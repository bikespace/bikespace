            <hr class="my-4">
            <p class="mb-4">Every cyclist has struggled to find space to park. There is simply not enough bike parking to meet demand. Bike racks are often full, requiring a cyclist to improvise using poor alternatives like sign posts or fences.  Too often racks are ancient wheel-benders, awkwardly located, or taken up by abandoned bikes.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">BikeSpace is a community-built web app originally started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190624165253/https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/bikespace-app/">with support from the City of Toronto</a> and Cycle Toronto. It lets people report the issues they find when trying to park their bikes in the city. This simple web app is:</p>
            <ul class="mb-4">
              <li>quick and easy to use,</li>
              <li>designed for mobile and desktop,</li>
              <li>building a public map of parking problems in Toronto,</li>
              <li>creating a data-driven picture to drive change.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">City planners, businesses and property managers all know there is a problem. They want to build simple and safe bike parking across the city but they need solid evidence of demand to invest smartly. Toronto needs a data-driven solution to bike parking—BikeSpace will produce that data and drive real change.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We invite you to <a href="https://app.bikespace.ca" data-umami-event="outbound-app-1">try the BikeSpace web app</a> and tell us what you think! If you have feedback about the app, please feel free to share it using the <a href="https://github.com/bikespace/bikespace/issues" data-umami-event="outbound-github-issues">issues tab of our GitHub page</a>.</p>

            <hr class="secondary my-4">
            <p class="mb-4">At BikeSpace, we see that the time for Toronto to actively build a bike-friendly city has arrived, and we believe that parking safely is just as essential for cyclists as moving around safely. More and more people are cycling as their primary form of transit, which means the need for safe, convenient, and accessible bicycle parking continues to grow.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The City of Toronto has been developing a Bicycle Parking Strategy since the launch of the 2016 10-Year Cycling Network Plan. Property owners are recognizing that building bike lockers gives them happier tenants. Businesses are realizing that new bike racks bring in new customers and gives their employees more choice in how to get to work. Overall, safe cycling infrastructure creates healthier communities, less traffic congestion, and less pollution.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The goal of this platform is to empower cyclists and to give their voices greater power by making it easy to share and explore bicycle parking needs. By focusing on bike parking, we concentrate our impact on a specific issue. Too often reporting tools try to be everything for everyone and end up improving nothing for no one. Even a tool for cyclists needs to be specific to be successful. There is a lot of work for us to do but the foundation of any bike-friendly city is safe, convenient, and accessible parking.</p>
