# About BikeSpace

BikeSpace is a community-built web app originally started [with support from the City of Toronto](https://web.archive.org/web/20190624165253/https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/bikespace-app/) and Cycle Toronto. It lets people report the issues they find when trying to park their bikes in the city.

## Eliminating the Bicycle Parking Gap

We believe that cycling — and its benefits for convenience, health, and the climate — should be accessible to everyone.

Unfortunately, a lack of secure, easy-to-access bicycle parking and the fear of bike theft are significant barriers for cyclists. Research has found that a lack of bicycle parking is a particularly significant barrier for women who want to cycle[^1].

E-bikes and cargo bikes are excellent alternatives to driving, but are most in need of secure bicycle parking due to their higher value as well as their space and charging needs.

By helping to improve bicycle parking across the city, we hope that even more people will have the option to use a bicycle to get around.

## Our Tools

The goal of BikeSpace is to empower cyclists by making it easy to find bicycle parking, identify areas where bicycle parking is missing, and collectively report issues with existing rings, racks, and stands.
