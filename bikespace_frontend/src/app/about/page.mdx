# About BikeSpace

BikeSpace is a community-built web app originally started [with support from the City of Toronto](https://web.archive.org/web/20190624165253/https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/bikespace-app/) and Cycle Toronto. 
It lets people report the issues they find when trying to park their bikes in the city. This simple web app is:
- quick and easy to use,
- designed for mobile and desktop,
- building a public map of parking problems in Toronto,
- creating a data-driven picture to drive change.

Every cyclist has struggled to find space to park. 
There is simply not enough bike parking to meet demand. 
Bike racks are often full, requiring a cyclist to improvise using poor alternatives like sign posts or fences. 
Too often racks are ancient wheel-benders, awkwardly located, or taken up by abandoned bikes.

City planners, businesses and property managers all know there is a problem.
They want to build simple and safe bike parking across the city but they need solid evidence of demand to invest smartly.
Toronto needs a data-driven solution to bike parkingâ€”BikeSpace will produce that data and drive real change.

We invite you to [try the BikeSpace web app](/submission) and tell us what you think! 
If you have feedback about the app, please feel free to share it using the [issues tab of our GitHub page](https://github.com/bikespace/bikespace/issues).
