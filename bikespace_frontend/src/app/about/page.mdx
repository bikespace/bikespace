# About BikeSpace

BikeSpace is a community-built web app originally started [with support from the City of Toronto](https://web.archive.org/web/20190624165253/https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/bikespace-app/) and Cycle Toronto. It lets people report the issues they find when trying to park their bikes in the city.


## Eliminating the Bicycle Parking Gap

We believe that cycling — and its benefits for convenience, health, and the climate — should be accessible to everyone. 

Unfortunately, a lack of secure, easy-to-access bicycle parking and the fear of bike theft are significant barriers for cyclists. Research has found that a lack of bicycle parking is a particularly significant barrier for women who want to cycle[^1].

E-bikes and cargo bikes are excellent alternatives to driving, but are most in need of secure bicycle parking due to their higher value as well as their space and charging needs.

By helping to improve bicycle parking across the city, we hope that even more people will have the option to use a bicycle to get around.


## Our Tools

The goal of BikeSpace is to empower cyclists by making it easy to find bicycle parking, identify areas where bicycle parking is missing, and collectively report issues with existing rings, racks, and stands.

# OLD: About BikeSpace Content

BikeSpace is a community-built web app originally started [with support from the City of Toronto](https://web.archive.org/web/20190624165253/https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/bikespace-app/) and Cycle Toronto. 
It lets people report the issues they find when trying to park their bikes in the city. This simple web app is:
- quick and easy to use,
- designed for mobile and desktop,
- building a public map of parking problems in Toronto,
- creating a data-driven picture to drive change.

Every cyclist has struggled to find space to park. 
There is simply not enough bike parking to meet demand. 
Bike racks are often full, requiring a cyclist to improvise using poor alternatives like sign posts or fences. 
Too often racks are ancient wheel-benders, awkwardly located, or taken up by abandoned bikes.

City planners, businesses and property managers all know there is a problem.
They want to build simple and safe bike parking across the city but they need solid evidence of demand to invest smartly.
Toronto needs a data-driven solution to bike parking—BikeSpace will produce that data and drive real change.

We invite you to [try the BikeSpace web app](/submission) and tell us what you think! 
If you have feedback about the app, please feel free to share it using the [issues tab of our GitHub page](https://github.com/bikespace/bikespace/issues).
