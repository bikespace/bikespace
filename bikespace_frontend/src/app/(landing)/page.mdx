## TODO Find Parking 

Parking map goes here (should be equivalent to 60-80vh on mobile?)

## Eliminating the Bicycle Parking Gap

We believe that cycling — and its benefits for convenience, health, and the climate — should be accessible to everyone. 

**Unfortunately, a lack of secure, easy-to-access bicycle parking and the fear of bike theft are significant barriers for cyclists.** Research has found that a lack of bicycle parking is a particularly significant barrier for women who want to cycle [^1].

Overcoming barriers to cycling: understanding frequency of cycling in a University setting and the factors preventing commuters from cycling on a regular basis. _Transportation_, 44, 871-884. https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526h740

E-bikes and cargo bikes are excellent alternatives to driving, but are most in need of secure bicycle parking due to their higher value as well as their space and charging needs.

## Our Tools

The goal of BikeSpace is to empower cyclists by making it easy to find bicycle parking, identify areas where bicycle parking is missing, and collectively report issues with existing rings, racks, and stands.

## Community-Built

BikeSpace is run by a team of [Civic Tech Toronto](https://civictech.ca/) volunteers who are passionate about making Toronto a great cycling city.

Our issue reporting app was launched in 2018 with [support from the City of Toronto](https://web.archive.org/web/20190624165253/https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/cycling-in-toronto/bikespace-app/) and Cycle Toronto, and has collected over 1,000 reports to-date.
