Please describe your feedback about app.bikespace.ca below. We welcome both positive feedback (e.g. I found x feature useful) and constructive feedback (e.g. y is broken, I wish the app did z).

Especially for constructive feedback, you can help us by letting us know:

- Your browser and platform (e.g. Safari, iPhone)
- If it's a bug, what steps led to the problem
- If it's something you wish the app was able to do, what goal would that feature help you accomplish? (e.g. "I think it would help advocates if you could report issues of x type", or "I wanted to be able to do step y easier on my phone")

Thank you for taking the time to help us make the app better!
