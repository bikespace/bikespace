        "comment":"I cannot but think that this proposed piece of legislation is anything more than an appeal to garner votes. Traffic engineers and urban planners agree that the root cause of traffic congestion is the presence of motor vehicles, and then the solution to congestion is to move motorists towards alternative forms of transportation such as cycling and transit. The Ministry clearly does not understand the concept of induced demand, in terms of which the introduction of additional vehicular travel lanes to reduce congestion has the opposite effect of inducing congestion. I am extremely disappointed that the Province would seek to override the expertise of local planning professionals and dictate to municipalities how best to solve their traffic issues. It is furthermore unimaginable that the Province would propose to remove active transportation infrastructure where it has been implemented at a time when Ontarians are without adequate medical care, are struggling to put food on the tables and pay their rents. The priorities of the Province are out of touch with reality.\n",

        "comment":"This is a ludicrous bill. Municipalities need to prioritize alternate modes of transportation to car traffic in order to reduce reliance on cars as the preferred method of transportation within their boundaries. This is clearly an overreach to take power away from the locally elected Toronto city council. The population of Ontario is growing faster than road infrastructure; there is not enough room on the roads for everyone who wants to drive - we need people to ride bicycles and transit instead. Every person on a bicycle or on a bus is one LESS car on the roads. Removing bike lanes will kill cyclists and have negligible impact on gridlock. Gridlock is caused by too many cars and having a subpar transit system that people don\u2019t have confidence in. How about the province focus on opening the incredulously overdue metrolinx Eglinton LRT and further investments in municipal transit instead. I am a driver, cyclist, transit user and parent who works and lives in Toronto. I do NOT support this bill.\n",

However, instead of planning to remove existing bike lanes there should be an equal emphasis on improving regional transit and this trying to reduce car traffic as much as possible. Our North American attitude that the car is the best way to get  around will never keep pace with our population and thus congestion will always be an issue. We need to look at world cities that have prioritized moving all people around from a big picture view versus the false narrative that we have both cars and people moving well in a city such as Toronto. Instead of diving voters let business thrive with reduced congestion and make so more people are moving around easier and not just focusing on car traffic\/infrastructure. We are already so behind on change but if we continued to believe car traffic is the only issue to focus on we will miss out what could make a Toronto a better functioning city.\n",

Bike lanes provide a safe method for people to travel freely across the city, without impeding on cars space within car-specific lanes.\nThe removal of bike lanes will lead to more congestion by proxy of having more people forced to use motor vehicles to get around, as well as push bikes into car traffic, slowing the pace of traffic, and ultimately causing more congestion for road users like myself.\nAs a car driver myself, I feel like I'd rather bikes be in a separate lane, where there is a lower risk of me coming in contact with them.\n",

The fact that I bike almost everywhere in Ottawa means that I am one less car contributing to traffic congestion and parking shortages \u2014 that\u2019s a good thing for people driving cars!\nBill 212 is NOT a serious approach to tackling traffic congestion \u2014 making it harder for cities to expand bike lanes will deter people who might be persuaded to ditch their cars in favour of sustainable alternatives like transit, biking or other micro-mobility devices. By contrast, more traffic lanes and more highways might slightly improve congestion in the short term but will inevitably encourage continued reliance on car travel and make the problem much worse in the medium to long term.\nBill 212 would increase the already unacceptable risks that face cyclists and people with disabilities who rely on safe separated bike lanes.\nFinally, I am very concerned that Bill 212 seems geared towards stoking a senseless culture war between drivers and cyclists. The tone is needlessly divisive and will increase tensions that are already running high on Ontario\u2019s streets. This is totally irresponsible and I hope that the Government of Ontario will reconsider adopt a more civil and inclusive tone and approach.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"The proposal in Schedule 4 that states: \"it is also amended to require Ministry approval before municipalities may construct bicycle lanes in certain circumstances, and to require municipalities to provide the Ministry with information, including information relating to bicycle lanes\" is an overreach of provincial government that will create unnecessary bureaucracy and clog up municipal development in red tape.\nThe provincial government should, instead, be acting to reduce restrictions for municipal developments approved by mayors and councilors, NOT increase them.\nThe focus on bicycle lanes in Bill 212 is also completely arbitrary, since the government has not been able to show that bicycle lanes do, in fact, increase gridlock when a motor vehicle lane is removed. There is not even any information provided in the Bill on requirements or methods for granting approval \"in certain circumstances\", or what kind of information is needed from municipalities for city planning. The arbitrary focus on bicycle lanes in the Bill is specifically significant since many municipalities across the world have shown that creating infrastructure that increases bicycle use actually does more for reducing gridlock than increasing lanes for motor vehicles.\nFurthermore, particularly in larger cities like Toronto, a significant (and significantly growing) number of citizens choose to use bicycles to commute to and from work, school, shopping centres, and places of leisure and socialization, simply because cycling is one of the most convenient and fastest modes of transportation. The proposal to hinder the development of bicycle lanes and favour lanes for motor vehicles will not only fail in reducing gridlock, but will make commuting more difficult for both cyclists and motor vehicle drivers. The bill does not give reasons why citizens who choose to commute via motor vehicles should be favoured over those who commute via bicycles.\n",

The number of cars will expand to consume additional capacity, negatively contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and, as such, reducing the life expectancy of all residents of Ontario.  The same principals dictate that a bike lane network, when properly separated from vehicular traffic, will induce more people to ride as an alternative to driving.  This will reduce the number of cars on the road \u2014 leading to less congestion and having a positive environmental impact.\nAnd even if this plan was going to be effective (which it will not be) no amount of congestion reduction is worth the cost of a single human life is lost in an accident that could have been avoidable had proper bike lanes been present.\nThe committee and the MPPs should take a moment to imagine their loved ones smushed and dying under an SUV before voting for a dangerous, environmentally destructive, non-solution to a much bigger congestion problem.\n",

The fact that the policy seems to ignore the well-known issue of induced demand\u2014where adding lanes only leads to more cars, more congestion, and the same problems this bill supposedly wants to solve\u2014makes you wonder if anyone actually read the research on this.\nIt\u2019s like they\u2019re stuck in some outdated mindset, refusing to learn from years of evidence that shows that car-first infrastructure doesn\u2019t fix the problem, it just makes it worse. Instead of investing in real solutions, like better public transit, encouraging cycling, and making our cities more walkable, they go for the quick and easy option of throwing taxpayer money at yet more roads.\nAnd the whole idea of \u201cbuilding faster\u201d probably just means less oversight, less environmental review, and cutting corners. We should be planning for cities that are sustainable and resilient, not dumping resources into projects that\u2019ll just make air quality worse, contribute to climate change, and keep us locked in a car-dependent loop.\nThis bill is nothing but a handout to the same old car-centric status quo.

        "comment":"I am writing in opposition to the proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act related to bike lane approvals.\nThe proposed amendments that would require municipalities to seek minister's approval for new bike lanes is redundant and unnecessary. The Environmental Assessment Act and Municipal Class Environmental Assessment process already establishes a framework for assessing potential impacts from infrastructure projects such as the redesign of roads. There is also already a process for \"bumping up\" Municipal Class EAs for provincial review if members of the public feel that a municipality has not followed the process correctly or has not appropriately considered impacts.\nThe effect of the proposed amendment will be to create a barrier to the implementation of bike lanes in dense urban areas where the public right of way is already primarily occupied by motor vehicle lanes. This places an unfair and unequal burden on dense municipalities with narrow rights of way compared to lower density municipalities with wider rights of way and is counter-productive considering the denser municipalities are in a better position to encourage cycling due to the shorter distances between destinations.\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act are also inconsistent with the recently enacted Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 and will frustrate the province's efforts to achieve the objectives of the Provincial Planning Statement.\nSection 2.2 of the Provincial Planning Statement states, \"1. Planning authorities shall provide for an appropriate range and mix of housing options and densities  to meet projected needs of current and future residents of the  regional market area  by:  c) promoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure  and public service facilities, and support the use of active\ntransportation\"\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act contradict this direction in the new PPS but adding an administrative layer to the installation of new bike lanes to serve new residential development that supports the use of active transportation. The proposed amendments will have the effect of discouraging municipalities from repurposing existing motor vehicle lanes, even in areas that have surplus capacity.\nSection 2.3.1 of the Provincial Planning Statement states, \"2. Land use patterns within settlement areas should be based on densities and a mix of land uses which:  c) support active transportation\"\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act would have the effect of discouraging active transportation by adding an administrative layer to the repurposing of motor vehicle lanes for bicycle lanes. The proposed amendment will frustrate the province's objective of ensuring settlement areas support active transportation, especially in established settlement areas where the public right of way is not wide enough to accommodate new bike leans without repurposing old motor vehicle lanes.\nSection 2.4.2 of the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 includes provisions for the intensification of development around Major Transit Station Areas. This intensification cannot proceed on the basis that primary mode of transportation outside of the transit system is by motor vehicle. Bicycles and public transit go hand in hand. Including bicycle lanes in close proximity to transit stations provides an important \"last mile\" connection between the transit station and people's homes, jobs or other destinations. Existing Major Transit Stations are often located in denser, urban areas where the majority of the public right of way is already occupied by motor vehicle lanes, without additional space available to accommodate bike lanes without repurposing the motor vehicle lanes.\nIn the absence of bicycle lanes, residents in intensified Major Transit Station Areas are more likely to drive, which will result in more traffic and gridlock. If they are provided with safe space to bike, this will reduce the traffic impacts of new development. Implementing barriers to the repurposing of motor vehicle lanes to bike lanes will frustrate the province's objective of achieving greater intensification in Major Transit Station Areas.\nSection 2.9 of the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 states, \"1. Planning authorities shall plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of a changing climate  through approaches  that:  d) promote green infrastructure, low impact development, and active transportation,\nprotect  the environment and improve air quality.\"\nBicycle lanes promote active transportation. Prioritizing the retention of motor vehicle lanes over their repurpose as bicycle lanes, and requiring an extra bureaucratic step of obtain minister's approval, directly contradicts the direction of the PPS, 2024 and will negatively affect the Province's objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nReducing reliance on motor vehicles supports the PPS objective of improving air quality by reducing vehicle emissions and micro-particles related to rubber tire wear and brake pad wear which make their way into air and water.\nSection 3.2 of the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 states, \"1. Transportation systems should be provided which are safe, energy efficient, facilitate the movement of people and goods, are appropriate to address  projected needs, and support the use of zero- and low- emission vehicles.\"\nBicycle lanes improve the safety of roads for all users. They reduce the frequency and severity of collisions involving motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.\nBicycle Lanes are energy efficient by encouraging human powered transportation options instead of fossil fuel and electrically powered vehicles that require significant resources to build, transport and operate.\nBicycle Lanes facilitate the movement of people and goods, often with greater efficiency than motor vehicle lanes because of bicycles smaller size and greater maneuverability. Delivery companies have begun shifting to cargo bikes for deliveries and food couriers on bicycles have proliferated greater in recent years.\nBicycle lanes are particularly appropriate to address the projected needs of large and growing municipalities like Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Ottawa, Vaughan and elsewhere.\nBicycles are zero-emission vehicles.\nAny legislation that would have the effect of slowing down the installation of bicycle lanes by requiring minister approval, especially if the criteria for the minister's approval is not clearly stated, would be contrary to the direction of the PPS, 2024.\nPrioritizing motor vehicle lanes over the installation of bicycle lanes by requiring minister's approval of any bike lanes that would repurpose vehicle lanes is contrary to the direction of the PPS, 2024.\nSection 3.2 also states, \"3. As part of a multimodal transportation system, connectivity within and among transportation systems  and modes should be  planned for,  maintained  and, where possible,  improved,  including  connections which cross jurisdictional  boundaries. \"\nBicycle lanes are an important part of a multi-modal transportation system. The proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act do not establish any standards, criteria, or methodology that the minister would use to evaluate proposed bicycle lanes. This makes planning for a multi-modal transportation system difficult or impossible because planning authority will not be able to anticipate how the minister will determine if their proposed bicycle lanes will be evaluated.\nThe Province of Ontario already has an established set of guidelines for the design of bicycle lanes in its Ontario Traffic Manual Book 18, and we already have an established process for evaluating the impacts of infrastructure projects through the Environmental Assessment Act.\nSection 3.9 of the Provincial Planning Statement states, \"1. Healthy, active, and inclusive communities should be promoted by: a) planning public streets, spaces and facilities to be safe, meet the needs of persons of all ages and abilities, including  pedestrians, foster social interaction and  facilitate\nactive transportation and community connectivity.\"\nBike lanes provide safe facilities for active transportation.\nOverall, the PPS does not state that active transportation should be subordinate to motor vehicle transportation. Read as a whole, the PPS provide clear direction that the Province of Ontario intends to prioritize active transportation, densities that will not function if the priority is motor vehicles, and a comprehensive response to climate change.\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act are not consistent with the Provincial Planning Statement and will in fact frustrate the implementation of the PPS. The proposed amendments are redundant and unnecessary considering existing requirements under the Environmental Assessment Act, and the proposed amendments do not provide any direction on how the minister intends to evaluate bike lane proposals or any methodology for determining the impacts of removing motor vehicle lanes.\nFor these reasons I am opposed to Bill 212 and the provisions related to bike lanes should be removed.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Members of the Legislative Assembly,\nI am writing to express my opposition to Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. This legislation not only removes decision-making authority from municipalities\u2014who are best positioned to understand the needs of their communities\u2014but also threatens vital infrastructure like bike lanes, which are crucial for public safety and reducing congestion.\nMunicipal governments know their residents\u2019 needs and should retain the authority to plan infrastructure accordingly. Instead of provincial interference, funding should be allocated to support public safety and transit infrastructure. Such investments enhance everyone\u2019s quality of life, allowing people to travel safely and efficiently without the constant stress of driving. Even drivers benefit from reduced traffic when strong public transit and cycling networks are in place.\nThe bike lanes specifically targeted by the premier are among the most heavily used in Toronto. Their removal would disproportionately harm the people of Toronto, who are already contending with extensive construction disruptions caused by the long-overdue expansion of public transit. Taking away these lanes during a time of upheaval risks alienating the very community that will be most affected. The bike lanes on Adelaide and Richmond, for example, enable an additional 400 people to commute during rush hour\u2014far more than the 80 or so people that a car lane could accommodate, given the bottlenecks at exit ramps. Beyond serving cyclists, these lanes also provide vital support for emergency services, allowing ambulances and other vehicles to bypass traffic during critical moments. Removing this infrastructure would not only hinder mobility but also jeopardize lives by delaying emergency response times. Fire engines may be unnecessarily deployed to incidents that could be managed by smaller, faster vehicles if these lanes remain available.\nIn addition, the legislation\u2019s focus on removing bike lanes and easing car travel risks increasing congestion through induced demand. Making driving more convenient often results in more people choosing to drive, which has historically erased any benefits from highway expansions in Ontario within 13 to 18 months. Simply put, removing bike lanes or expanding roads will not solve gridlock; it will exacerbate it.\nRather than doubling down on outdated solutions, Ontario should focus on well-designed transit projects. Such transit systems would also alleviate the need for expensive highway expansions by offering convenient and attractive alternatives to driving. High-speed rail, operating with local, express, and local-express modes on coordinated schedules, would allow people to commute comfortably, reducing the pressure on roadways.\nBill 212, in its current form, guarantees only more gridlock and diminished mobility. It risks creating urban enclaves where people are effectively trapped in their neighborhoods, with fewer options for safe and efficient travel. Toronto, like all cities, needs infrastructure that reflects the realities of modern urban life\u2014not provincial directives that dismantle critical bike lanes and push residents toward more car dependency.\nI urge the government to reconsider this legislation and engage meaningfully with municipalities and residents to develop solutions that enhance mobility for all. A forward-thinking approach, focusing on transit and public safety infrastructure, will foster a healthier, more livable Ontario for everyone.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\nSincerely,\na concerned practicing civil engineer\n",

        "comment":"This proposed bill is truthfully a farce in modern times. First, we know from years of scientific studies that a new highway will not improve traffic due in induced demand, which is NOT a \"red herring\". The fact that the government thinks that they can push this through despite all modern evidence suggesting that it is a bad idea would be laughable if it wasn't real.\nSecond, the proposed legislation regarding bike lanes is an egregious overstep by the provincial government. Not only that, the idea that bike lanes make car traffic worse is outstandingly simple-minded. One alternative to no bike lanes is bikes in car lanes, which everyone can agree makes car traffic worse. The other alternative is that those people who would be on bikes are now in cars, which means more cars on the road, which means more traffic. It seems that people have forgotten that cars are the problem; cars are traffic. But okay, if you're in favour of getting rid of bike lanes to give more space for cars, why not go one step further and get rid of sidewalks to give even more space. While it seems like a silly idea, it is the exact same as getting rid of bike lanes. If you got rid of sidewalks where would people walk? They would either walk in the road, which will definitely make traffic congestion worse, or they just wouldn't walk.\nThis bill is unbelievably shortsighted and should never pass. It is embarrassingly outdated in its reasoning with regards to traffic research, not to mention completely disregarding all the Ontario citizens who don't drive for one reason or another.\n",

These bike lanes were implemented by Toronto's democratically elected municipal government after careful studies and pilot projects.  They were also installed with city of Toronto tax dollars. Judging by other of Doug Ford's and his transportation minister's previous comments (see link below) one gets the reasonable impression that this legislation is being driven solely by the personal annoyances of Doug Ford and his cabinet experienced on their commute to Queen's Park in single occupant vehicles.  This is outrageous. If Premier Ford has an issue with the bike lanes, perhaps he should run for municipal office instead, or better yet, write and voice his concern to his city councilor like the rest of Toronto's residents.\nThis bill also strips environmental safeguards to clear the way for the construction of Highway 413. Is this ridiculous bike lane legislation being put forward merely as a distraction from the construction of this equally controversial and hastily planned highway? Bike lane legislation should be tabled in a separate bill if this government is, in fact, serious about pursuing it.\nLastly, where is the Minister of \"Red Tape Reduction\"?  The creation of such an absurd ministry is inherently ridiculous, but the hypocrisy of this government is nevertheless staggering in seeking to waste valuable provincial resources on what are squarely matters of municipal concern.\n",

        "comment":"I am a vulnerable road user and I deserve to get home safely. My life has value, I have value. As Doug Ford refuses to use facts to support his bills, I'm going to do you all a favour and give you the facts below.\nInduced demand is a concept in transportation planning and economics that refers to the phenomenon where increasing the supply of a good or service\u2014in this case, adding more car lanes\u2014leads to an increase in the demand for that good or service. In the context of transportation, specifically roadways, induced demand is when additional lanes are added to a road or highway, it initially reduces congestion and makes travel more convenient. However, this improvement in conditions often attracts more drivers, either those who previously avoided the route due to congestion or new drivers who change their travel patterns as a result of the improved conditions.\nOver time, the increased number of vehicles can lead to a return of congestion levels similar to or EVEN WORSE than before the additional lanes were added. This happens because the initial ease of travel encourages more people to use their cars, take longer trips, or travel during peak times, ultimately filling up the newly added capacity.\nKey points about induced demand in relation to adding more car lanes include:\n1. **Short-Term Relief**: Initially, adding more lanes can reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.\n2. **Increased Vehicle Usage**: The improved conditions can lead to more people choosing to drive, taking longer trips, or traveling during peak hours.\n3. **Return of Congestion**: Over time, the increase in vehicle usage can lead to congestion levels rising back to or exceeding the levels before the lanes were added.\n4. **Urban Sprawl**: Additional lanes can encourage urban sprawl by making it easier for people to live farther from their workplaces and other destinations, leading to more driving and further congestion.\n5. **Environmental Impact**: Increased vehicle usage can lead to higher emissions and greater environmental impact.\nThe concept of induced demand highlights the challenges in using road expansion as a long-term solution to traffic congestion and underscores the importance of considering alternative solutions such as public transportation improvements, BIKE LANES, demand management strategies, and smart growth policies.\nBike lanes offer numerous benefits across various aspects of society, including the environment, the economy, and public health. Here\u2019s how they contribute positively in each area:\n### Environmental Benefits\n1. **Reduced Emissions**: Bicycles produce zero emissions, unlike cars which contribute to greenhouse gases and air pollution. More people biking translates to fewer cars on the road and thus lower emissions.\n2. **Lower Carbon Footprint**: Cycling is a sustainable mode of transportation with a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to motor vehicles.\n3. **Reduced Noise Pollution**: Bicycles are much quieter than motor vehicles, contributing to less noise pollution in urban areas.\n4. **Less Traffic Congestion**: Bike lanes encourage more people to cycle, reducing the number of cars on the road and thereby reducing traffic congestion and idling emissions.\n### Economic Benefits\n1. **Reduced Transportation Costs**: Biking is a cost-effective mode of transportation. It eliminates fuel costs, parking fees, and many maintenance expenses associated with cars.\n2. **Boosts Local Businesses**: Cyclists are more likely to stop at local businesses along their route compared to drivers. This can increase spending at local shops, cafes, and restaurants.\n3. **Lower Infrastructure Costs**: Bike lanes are generally cheaper to construct and maintain than roadways for motor vehicles. This can lead to significant savings for municipalities.\n4. **Health Cost Savings**: Increased physical activity from biking can reduce healthcare costs associated with sedentary lifestyles and related diseases.\n### Health Benefits\n1. **Improved Physical Fitness**: Cycling is an excellent form of exercise that improves cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and overall physical fitness.\n2. **Reduced Risk of Chronic Diseases**: Regular physical activity, such as biking, can lower the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.\n3. **Mental Health Benefits**: Physical activity has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Cycling can also improve mood and mental well-being.\n4. **Safer Streets**: Dedicated bike lanes separate cyclists from motor traffic, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries. This makes cycling a safer option for more people.\n### Additional Benefits\n1. **Increased Mobility**: Bike lanes provide an additional mode of transportation, making cities more accessible to people who do not own cars, including low-income individuals, teenagers, and those who prefer not to drive.\n2. **Community Building**: Cycling infrastructure can encourage a sense of community by promoting social interactions among cyclists.\n3. **Efficient Use of Space**: Bikes take up much less space than cars, both on the road and when parked, leading to more efficient use of urban space.\nIn summary, bike lanes are a multifaceted solution that not only address environmental concerns but also enhance economic vitality and improve public health. They contribute to making cities more livable, sustainable, and equitable.\nIf we don\u2019t have safe bike lane infrastructure, more people will be forced to drive. If every person in Ontario over the age of 16 had their own personal vehicle and drove it instead of cycling, walking, or using public transit, several significant impacts would likely arise across various dimensions, including environmental, economic, social, and infrastructural aspects. Here are some potential outcomes:\n### Environmental Impacts\n1. **Increased Emissions**: A significant rise in the number of vehicles would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution.\n2. **Air Quality Deterioration**: More vehicles on the road would increase the levels of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), worsening air quality and potentially leading to health issues like respiratory problems and heart disease.\n3. **Noise Pollution**: An increase in vehicle traffic would result in higher levels of noise pollution, affecting the quality of life in urban and suburban areas.\n### Economic Impacts\n1. **Higher Transportation Costs**: Individuals would face increased costs associated with owning and maintaining a vehicle, including fuel, insurance, maintenance, and parking fees.\n2. **Infrastructure Strain**: The government would need to invest heavily in expanding and maintaining road infrastructure to accommodate the increased number of vehicles, potentially diverting funds from other critical areas such as education and healthcare.\n3. **Increased Health Costs**: With reduced physical activity due to less walking and cycling, there could be a rise in healthcare costs associated with treating chronic diseases related to sedentary lifestyles.\n### Social and Health Impacts\n1. **Reduced Physical Activity**: With fewer people walking or cycling, there would be a decline in physical activity levels, leading to higher rates of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and other health issues.\n2. **Mental Health Effects**: Increased traffic congestion and longer commuting times could lead to higher stress levels and negatively impact mental health.\n3. **Social Isolation**: Reliance on personal vehicles might reduce opportunities for social interactions that often occur on public transit or while walking and cycling.\n### Infrastructural and Urban Planning Impacts\n1. **Traffic Congestion**: Roads would become heavily congested, especially during peak hours, leading to longer commute times and increased frustration among drivers.\n2. **Parking Challenges**: Finding parking spaces would become more difficult and expensive, especially in urban areas. There would be a need for more parking infrastructure, which could take up valuable urban space.\n3. **Urban Sprawl**: Increased reliance on personal vehicles could encourage urban sprawl, as people might choose to live farther from their workplaces and other amenities. This could lead to the loss of green spaces and agricultural land, and increased costs for providing public services to sprawling areas.\n### Public Transit and Cycling Infrastructure\n1. **Decline in Public Transit Use**: Public transit systems might see a significant drop in ridership, leading to reduced revenue and potential cuts to services. This could disproportionately affect those who rely on public transit, including low-income individuals and those who cannot drive.\n2. **Underutilization of Cycling Infrastructure**: Investments in cycling infrastructure might become underutilized, leading to a potential reallocation of funds away from sustainable transportation options.\n### Overall Impact on Quality of Life\n1. **Decreased Quality of Life**: The combined effects of increased traffic congestion, pollution, and reduced physical activity could lead to a lower overall quality of life.\n2. **Environmental Degradation**: The natural environment could suffer due to increased pollution and urban sprawl, affecting biodiversity and ecosystems.\nIn summary, if every person in Ontario over the age of 16 had their own personal vehicle and drove it instead of using more sustainable transportation modes, it would likely lead to significant negative impacts on the environment, economy, public health, and overall quality of life. It underscores the importance of promoting and investing in sustainable transportation options like public transit, cycling, and walking.\nThe introduction of bike lanes in Toronto has had several positive impacts on local businesses, contributing to improved economic activity and community vitality. Here are some ways business has improved after bike lanes have been introduced in Toronto:\n### Increased Foot Traffic\n1. **More Visitors**: Bike lanes make it easier and safer for cyclists to access various parts of the city, leading to increased foot traffic in business areas. Cyclists are more likely to stop at local shops, cafes, and restaurants.\n2. **Improved Accessibility**: Bike lanes improve accessibility to businesses for people who do not drive, including younger and older adults, and those who prefer not to own a car.\n### Higher Spending\n1. **Frequent Stops**: Studies have shown that cyclists tend to make more frequent stops compared to drivers. This can lead to increased spending at local businesses as cyclists are more likely to shop at multiple locations during their trips.\n2. **Local Patronage**: Cyclists often prefer to shop locally, as biking is more convenient for shorter trips. This boosts revenue for neighborhood businesses.\n### Enhanced Community Appeal\n1. **Attractive Streetscapes**: Bike lanes contribute to a more attractive and vibrant streetscape, making areas more appealing to visitors and residents. This can enhance the overall shopping and dining experience.\n2. **Community Well-being**: The presence of bike lanes can promote a sense of community and well-being, encouraging people to spend more time in local areas and supporting local businesses.\n### Economic Revitalization\n1. **Business Growth**: In some areas, the introduction of bike lanes has been associated with an increase in new business openings and a reduction in business vacancies. This can contribute to the economic revitalization of neighborhoods.\n2. **Property Values**: Improved infrastructure, including bike lanes, can lead to increased property values, benefiting both commercial and residential property owners.\n### Case Studies and Examples\n1. **Bloor Street**: One notable example is the Bloor Street bike lane pilot project. A study by the City of Toronto found that the installation of bike lanes on Bloor Street resulted in a 4.45% increase in customer spending and a 49% increase in the number of customers who visited the area by bike. Businesses along Bloor Street reported seeing new customers who might not have visited the area without the bike lanes.\n2. **Danforth Avenue**: The installation of bike lanes on Danforth Avenue also showed positive impacts, with local businesses reporting increased foot traffic and customer spending. The bike lanes made the area more attractive to both residents and visitors.\n### Reduced Transportation Costs\n1. **Employee Benefits**: Businesses can benefit from bike lanes as they provide employees with a cost-effective and healthy commuting option. Reduced transportation costs can lead to higher disposable income, which can be spent at local businesses.\n2. **Delivery and Logistics**: Some businesses have adopted cargo bikes for local deliveries, which can be more efficient and cost-effective in urban areas with bike lanes.\n### Health and Environmental Benefits\n1. **Healthier Customers**: Healthier lifestyles promoted by biking can lead to healthier customers who are more likely to engage in community activities and support local businesses.\n2. **Environmental Appeal**: Businesses that support sustainable transportation options like biking can attract environmentally conscious customers who prefer to support green initiatives.\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the introduction of bike lanes in Toronto has had a positive impact on local businesses by increasing accessibility, foot traffic, and spending, while also enhancing the community appeal and contributing to economic revitalization. These benefits highlight the importance of continuing to invest in cycling infrastructure as a means of supporting local economies and creating vibrant, sustainable urban environments.\n",

This may have been acceptable policy 40 years ago, but the idea that major roadways should not accommodate all forms of transportation is antiquated thinking.\nStripping municipalities of the right to deliver what's best for city residents should not be in the interest of this government. Cycling infrastructure not only improves cyclist safety (for the most part, vehicle-users are still a threat), but improves pedestrian safety, limits damage to roadways from vehicles, and shows a commitment to accessibility by providing safe spaces for all road users. Cycling is a necessary form of transportation for youth and adults alike, as vehicle ownership and use is a privilege many cannot afford.\nThe negative framing of cycling as interrupting car road use is damaging to long-term place-making and city planning. Municipalities have continuously demonstrated a willingness to explore and implement ideas such as Vision Zero and walkable communities, however this cannot be accomplished without adequate cycling infrastructure. Municipal civil servants and councillors know their communities best and have a duty to provide for these communities. Bill 212 demonstrates a lack of critical thinking from the provincial government by taking more powers away from municipal government and wasting taxpayer dollars on the removal of bike lanes.\n",

        "comment":"Environmental Impact: Building highways, especially projects like Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass, poses significant risks to Ontario's natural environment. These projects threaten green spaces, farmlands, wetlands, and habitats that are essential for biodiversity and climate resilience. Highway 413, for example, could pave over 2,000 acres of farmland and cross 85 waterways, causing irreparable environmental damage. At a time when the government should be focused on reducing carbon emissions and protecting natural spaces, building more highways runs counter to these goals. Expedited construction could also lead to insufficient environmental assessments, which are critical for understanding the long-term impact of these projects.\nErosion of Municipal Authority: The BHFA would override most municipal by-laws that may prevent or restrict highway construction, undermining local governance. Municipalities have bylaws in place to reflect the unique needs of their communities, such as noise control, construction limits, and environmental protection. The proposed bill diminishes the authority of local governments, stripping away their ability to regulate key aspects of construction that directly affect their residents. Furthermore, local communities may find themselves powerless in opposing projects that are detrimental to their quality of life, especially in terms of noise, traffic disturbances, and environmental harm.\nLack of Public Consultation: By allowing the Minister of Transportation to expedite timelines, including for property expropriation, the legislation curtails meaningful public input and democratic processes. The public, particularly those whose properties are being expropriated or impacted, may not have adequate time or recourse to challenge decisions. Moving to an expedited appeals process or removing the ability for property owners to apply for later possession of their property under the Expropriations Act, undermines the rights of individuals and communities to defend their interests. This fast-tracking of projects prioritizes development over the fair treatment of citizens.\nQuestionable Effectiveness of Highway Expansion: The core assumption that building more highways will reduce gridlock is debatable. Expanding highway capacity often leads to induced demand\u2014a phenomenon where new roads initially reduce congestion but eventually lead to more traffic as they encourage more people to drive. In the long run, this means the government may spend billions on projects that do not achieve their intended goal. Instead, investments in public transit, carpooling, and active transportation infrastructure (cycling, walking) may offer more sustainable solutions to traffic congestion while also reducing carbon emissions and improving public health.\nFocus on Car-Centric Infrastructure: This bill reflects a continued focus on car-centric infrastructure, which conflicts with global trends toward more sustainable urban development. Many cities and regions are focusing on reducing car dependency by investing in public transit systems, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly urban spaces. Prioritizing highway projects reinforces the use of private vehicles, which increases greenhouse gas emissions and road congestion in the long term. Ontario should be looking toward modern, sustainable transportation solutions, not doubling down on outdated infrastructure paradigms.\nIn conclusion, while the proposed bill aims to address traffic congestion and improve infrastructure delivery, its environmental, social, and long-term economic implications raise significant concerns. It prioritizes rapid development over sustainable planning, weakens local governance, and may not provide the intended relief from gridlock. Ontario\u2019s infrastructure policy should focus on sustainable, inclusive, and forward-thinking approaches that align with environmental goals and community needs.\n",

Good luck :) My perspective is in regards to supporting the cycling infrastructure in Ontario. I hope that there is the ability for the ministry to not just put motor transportation ahead of cycling transportation. I understand that the Ministry's mandate is to focus on \"Moving people and goods safely, efficiently and sustainably across Ontario to improve quality of life and support a globally competitive economy.\" I believe the Ministry has been working on a multi-modal plan for years, hoping to allow for more cycling and multi-purpose infrastructure throughout the province. Cycling speaks to moving people sustainability and improving the quality of life. I understand that the Ministry has to balance the ability to move good and services in a fashion that meets its mandate and that can be a juggling act. Cycling has grown in interest and is a healthy way to commute, and enjoy recreationally. There are many cities throughout Ontario (e.g., Toronto and Sault Ste. Marie) that encourage cycling as a mode of transportation to help alleviate gridlock, but also to promote healthy\/active living. I understand the need to balance public transit and traditional road infrastructure needs with the needs of other modes of transportation, but try not to reduce biking - it has great externalities that might not be able to be quantified, but there is a positive impact to society overall. Think about how other cities that have a healthy cycling network (e.g., Chicago) - Chicago is a similar population size to Toronto, and has one of the best cycling infrastructure networks in the US. It's possible that Ontario (e.g., Toronto) can have a growing cycling network, that might compromise traffic lanes but doesn't have to compromise the overall health of a city which is willing to cycle and has the desire to cycle.\n",

The current highway construction process is sufficient. The possible time savings cannot justify overriding municipal by-laws, the expropriation act and the court appeal process. These are necessary parts of a functioning democracy and those processes require time. The Ministry may look at cities such as Detroit, Buffalo and Los Angeles and see that eventually the extra highway infrastructure bankrupts the cities nearby and does NOT solve congestion. Congestion could be solved by charging drivers for using the highway as demonstrated by highway 407. The government should considered removing the ban it imposed on such possibility.\nSchedule 3-the highway does not need these special concessions. It is in a not very populated area, outside of the GTA and not many will benefit from it. The minister should consider applying this framework to transit projects such as GO Expansion so that it is completed as soon as possible. That will provide an alternative to highways that will actually reduce traffic.\nSchedule 4-the ministry does not need to get involved with municipal bike lanes. The amounts involved are so small and the space on the roads so plentiful, compared to the Billions that will be spent on the three highways in Schedule 2, that it is incomprehensible why the ministry has an intersect on bicycle lanes. The ministry should aim for a balanced transportation system as opposed to becoming like Texas where 95+ % of the population drives cars. Wouldn\u2019t there be less traffic if only 50 % of people were car motorists and the rest used bicycles and\/or transit?\n",

Bike lanes keep us BOTH safe \u2014 I don't want to injure or kill a cyclist, and as a cyclist, I don't want to BE injured or killed. Weird, right? By removing bike lanes, you force cyclists back into sharing a lane with drivers, which will just slow drivers down and increase congestion, but I can tell you haven't thought about that because you haven't thought about anything to do with this plan other than, \"Hurr durr, let's stick it to those bike-riding lefties.\" Also, let's talk about the expense of ripping out perfectly good bike lanes that, in many cases, were only installed as recently as earlier this year. I'm not down to pay for that with my tax dollars as it's an incredible waste. You claim this plan is extremely popular, because you're not actually interested in looking at any data or opinions from cyclists. Lastly, for a party that is ostensibly 'pro-small government,' this is comically overreaching. Let the municipalities do what they want and, frankly, stay in your lane.\n",

        "comment":"Toronto is facing a critical turning point in shaping a sustainable and efficient city. Law 212 limits the expansion of bike lanes, despite the proven environmental, health, and economic benefits that accessible cycling infrastructure offers. We, the undersigned, urge Toronto's City Council \/ Ontario government to prioritize installing more bike lanes and not enact Bill 212 to create a greener, safer, and more connected city.\nContrasting the provincial government\u2019s policies, which promote car use, rapid greenbelt development, and increased alcohol accessibility, the city\u2019s potential for reducing congestion and emissions lies in fostering accessible and safe transit options like biking. While Premier Ford\u2019s government has prioritized policies that cater to short-term convenience, often at the expense of long-term environmental and public health, cities like Toronto must lead the way in sustainable solutions.\nOpening the greenbelt and undermining conservation efforts do not ease congestion but worsen air quality and contribute to urban sprawl. By making sustainable choices locally, we can counter these provincial decisions and set a forward-thinking example.\nBike lanes ease congestion by providing an alternative to cars and transit, reducing both traffic and wait times. According to the Toronto Centre for Active Transportation, 75% of Toronto residents support increased cycling infrastructure, reflecting a widespread desire for greener alternatives. By prioritizing bike lanes, we can create safer streets and offer residents healthier transportation choices that reduce our collective carbon footprint.\nWe ask government officials to not support Bill 212 and invest in a sustainable, people-focused city by expanding Toronto\u2019s bike lane network. Together, let\u2019s create a city where people of all ages can travel safely and efficiently without relying solely on cars.

Given the need to reduce GHG emissions and fossil fuel use policies that encourage travel by car (ie building more roads) are not what Ontario needs.  The funds to build this highway would be better spent building, encouraging and subsidizing public transit and bike lanes (or other small personal means of transportation).  Bike lanes have been shown to reduce congestion ... which is the stated goal.  So municipalities should be provided incentives to build bike lanes.  With e-bikes growing steadily in popularity these lanes become more and more important and more and more the way Ontarians get around.  With a clean low GHG grid this means that fewer GHGs will be emitted per capita.  So bike lanes and public transit are a win win.  They reduce congestion, get people to their destinations faster, ultimately cost less and are better for the environment.  The current policy direction of building more roads is not backed by evidence, will not reduce congestion and will create problems for many years to come.\n",

If it's an attempt to score political points with people like me who don't care about biking and generally drive everywhere, it's not going to work.\nLet's consider what we're talking about here: Eliminating bike lanes on major streets in Toronto doesn't mean bikes will take back streets exclusively, they'll just use the car traffic lanes because it'll still be faster for them. This slows down traffic and makes it more dangerous and difficult to drive in Toronto. I don't want to run over a cyclist and have my life turned upside down for a year while I'm dealing with the fallout from that. Removing bike lanes makes that a lot more likely.\nHighway 413 is a pointless boondoggle. It's just going to create more car-dependent housing which means more Ontarians will drive, and it doesn't even go anywhere useful! There are practically zero attractive destinations on the proposed route, so the extremely obvious result will be more traffic on the 401 and 400. Some people will feel like they're saving time once a week on the way to cottage country, but in reality it'll just shift the traffic north onto the 400 around Barrie. In fact it'll probably result in hours-long jams on highway 11 because of induced demand.\nStop pandering to the lowest common denominator. If you want to help drivers and decrease traffic, do what works: Get people off the road! Lots of Ontarians are struggling right now and if they had affordable housing they could live in, in an area with excellent public transit, they could save money and get out of the way of those of us who are more successful. It's not a liberal idea, it's a common sense idea. Developers can make more than enough money building dense transit-oriented communities, and as someone who lives in a rural area, that's what I want.

        "comment":"I am a family doctor living in Toronto. There are so many reasons why bill 212 is foolish and ill-advised:\n1. Decreased Physical Inactivity and Its Health Implications\nCycling provides accessible, low-impact exercise that many people incorporate into their daily routines. For some, biking to work or school is their primary way to stay active. Removing bike lanes makes it less safe and accessible, discouraging this habit. Without safe cycling routes, fewer people will choose to bike, leading to worse health outcomes across the population and higher healthcare costs. Further, active transportation, like biking, has been linked to improved mental health outcomes by reducing stress and anxiety. Families, children, and individuals with mental health challenges are particularly impacted by the removal of a peaceful biking alternative.\n2. Pollution from Increased Car Traffic:\nFewer bike lanes results in more car traffic (this is well studied and documented), leading to higher levels of air pollution. This could aggravate respiratory issues such as asthma, bronchitis, and allergies. Patients who are especially sensitive to air quality, including children and older adults, will face worsened symptoms.\n3. Exacerbation of Climate-Related Health Issues:\nMore car usage contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, worsening climate change. With extreme weather events on the rise, people are experiencing heat stress, and air pollution issues that aggravate health conditions, particularly in urban settings.\n4. Higher Risk of Traffic-Related Injuries:\nWith fewer designated bike lanes, cyclists are forced to share lanes with cars, increasing the risk of accidents and injuries. As a family doctor, I see the real effects of these injuries\u2014sometimes leading to lifelong complications or fatalities. Promoting safe, active transportation like biking reduces reliance on vehicles, which in turn lowers accident rates for motorist, cyclists, and pedestrians.\n5. Accessibility and Equity\nBiking is an accessible and low-cost form of transportation, crucial for low-income families who cannot afford a car. By making cycling less safe, the city will alienate these community members and increase reliance on public transit, which can add to their financial burdens.\n6. Well-Documented Link to Congestion:\nFinally - research consistently shows that removing alternatives to cars, such as bike lanes, increases road congestion. When people lose safe, viable options for active transportation, more individuals turn to cars, adding strain to already busy streets. This congestion leads to longer commutes, increased emissions, and more idling cars.\n",

A shared frustration about traffic might be the only thing that unites downtown Torontonians, 905ers, and everyone in between. But this legislation is incredibly foolish, and will only serve to make congestion worse by holding people back from shifting away from car-dependency.\nThis move concentrate power in the MTO so that Queen's Park can choke off new bike lanes, ostensibly as a tactic to tame congestion, offers no solutions to the problem at hand. Setting aside the many public health, affordability, economic, and climate benefits of active mobility infrastructure; and setting aside the gaslighting, power-grabbing, and politically divisive strategy behind the government's agenda and messaging on this issue; the ultimate impact of this policy is to make congestion worse.\nThat\u2019s because, time and time again, in cities all over the world, the only thing that has ever led to long-term improvements in urban car congestion is giving people viable alternatives to cars. That's not up for debate. That's just how traffic works. Again, I'm talking about car congestion. In order to get cars moving, we need to shift people to other, more efficient modes. Indeed, the simplification of our roads to prioritize one mode \u2014 the car \u2014 over all others is what got us into this mess in the first place. More of that same approach will only entrench the dynamics of the current crisis.\nWe could \u2014 and should \u2014 have a deep, academic, evidence-based discussion about things like induced demand and network effects \u2014 two concepts that are critical to understanding how our infrastructure can actually get people moving \u2014 but the simpler point is this: in a crisis, you don't take options off the table, and you don't limit your toolbox.\nAnd bike infrastructure is a really great tool! Depending on the study, a bike lane have been consistently shown to move anywhere from 4 to 12 times as many people per hour as a car lane, while taking up half as much of the road\u2019s cross-section. With such limited space to work with on any given downtown street, we simply can\u2019t afford not to take advantage of that level of performance. And because we\u2019re focusing on downtown areas, with speed limits in the 30-40 km\/h range, bikes tend to move just about as fast as cars \u2014 especially after accounting for time spent waiting at red lights, when everyone moves at the exact same speed. The existing bike lanes that this bill targets are the only reason I am able to move through downtown with any speed, and breaking away from car dependency is the only reason I am able to afford the life I live.\nAre bike lanes perfect? No. Are they effective in every context? Certainly not. The thorough debunking of the myth that bike lanes cause the kind of congestion we\u2019re seeing in downtown Toronto has revealed the exact opposite: in urban settings, bike lanes eat congestion for lunch. And yet, this bill offers no solutions to a process the government claims is 'broken'. It only promises to slow down the growth of our cycling network by forcing projects to clear one more hurdle: provincial approval.\nSo, what might we do instead to break this soul-crushing pattern of gridlock?\nHow about, instead of taking away a tool, we unlock a new tool? Or better yet, get more use out of a tool we already use? In a recent episode of The Agenda all about the crisis at hand, the panel expressed unanimous support for the expanded use of automated enforcement to improve traffic flow immediately by enforcing existing rules \u2014 because even with fines for infractions like \u2018blocking the box\u2019 rising to $450-500, the deterrent effect is practically zero if it's not enforced consistently. The consensus was that, if we could prevent a handful of bad drivers from spoiling the commute for everybody, we could do a lot of good in a short amount of time.\nAnybody who\u2019s ever sat stationary through a whole green light wishing swift retribution on the nimrod who was too anxious to follow the basic rules of the road can surely support sending that guy a ticket in the mail. So, why can't we make that happen? Because automated enforcement is heavily restricted by \u2014 guess who! \u2014 the Province. And the Province holds all the power to un-restrict it.\nIf this government were actually interested in improving the flow of traffic, they would be bringing solutions like expansion of automated enforcement to the table, instead of taking away good (if imperfect) solutions like bike lanes. Given their unapologetically pro-car (and, by extension, pro-congestion) track record, I'm not optimistic they will change their tack. But maybe, just maybe, some of those voters from the 905 stuck in gridlock, at intersections blocked by cross-traffic, on roads that don't even have bike lanes, might see through the rhetoric, see the lack of progress, and take their frustrations to the ballot box. One can only hope.\n",

This act is yet another instance of the provincial government trying to circumvent established procedures in the interests of private profit, with no thought to the knock-on consequences for Ontario in the future. Environmental assessment must be preserved, and property expropriation should follow the current standards. The infrastructure proposed is unnecessary, and stands to profit associates of the provincial government in ways that contravene the principles of anti-corruption. If the government wants to improve infrastructure, it should repair the infrastructure which is already in place. If it wants to reduce congestion, it should spend more money on public transportation infrastructure. Improving service on the GO train is one way in which car use could be minimized.

In fact, it always makes it worse in the long term. Ontario's proposed Bill 212 won't reduce gridlock, and won't save commuters time. I strongly oppose Bill 212. Hwy 413 will lead to more urban sprawl, people moving further from their jobs because of the perceived new travel savings in the short term, leading to more vehicles kilometres travelled and more congestion in the long term. It is the black hole of highway widening. And it comes at great cost to society.\nInduced demand is a non-intuitive concept, but an important one. Building more roads leads to more traffic. This doesn't mean we should never build roads, but we must take a more holistic approach and consider the entire transportation system. This includes encouraging active modes of transportation and public transit. There is no way to relieve congestion if the quantity of vehicles on the roads continues to increase. Car travel is extremely space inefficient. We need transportation options.\n",

Dedicated cycling infrastructure is crucial for protecting vulnerable road users.\n- Environmental Impact: Discouraging cycling by removing safe infrastructure goes against our climate goals. Bicycles are an eco-friendly mode of transportation that helps reduce carbon emissions and air pollution.\n- Public Health: Cycling promotes physical activity and improved public health. Removing bike lanes may discourage people from choosing this healthy transportation option.\n- Local Expertise: Municipalities have a better understanding of their specific local needs and challenges. Centralizing control may lead to one-size-fits-all solutions that don't address unique local circumstances.\n- Economic Benefits: Bike-friendly cities often see increased foot traffic to local businesses and improved property values. Removing cycling infrastructure could negatively impact local economies.\n- Traffic Congestion: Well-planned cycling networks can help alleviate traffic congestion by providing alternatives to car use, especially for short trips.\n- Community Engagement: Local cycling initiatives often involve significant community input and engagement. Centralizing control may reduce opportunities for citizen participation in urban planning.\nI urge you to reconsider this bill and instead focus on policies that support and expand safe cycling infrastructure. We should be empowering municipalities to create more bike-friendly cities, not hindering their efforts.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\n",

There is no evidence that building more highways reduces congestion.  Numerous studies have shown that any relief is temporary.   Usage will gradually increase to the new capacity.  A ten percent increase in highway capacity will lead to a ten percent increase in vehicles on the road.\nAs this is the ERO comment site, I would suggest that there are only environmental downsides - chewing through the Greenbelt and agricultural land,  both for the highway and the land used for urban\/suburban sprawl, as well as the increased number of cars on the road and their attendant emissions.\nSadly, there are no upsides.  And it goes way beyond environmental concerns.  This bill will not achieve its stated purpose.  In fact, in the long term it will likely make things worse.  The government cannot be unaware of the numerous studies that show real, effective ways of reducing  traffic congestion (See attachment) - none of which include building more roads.\nIn this light, a more appropriate name for the proposed bill might be \"Reducing Responsibility - paving the way for our friends the developers to get richer quicker\".\nSorry for the cynicism.

I would like to comment that eliminating bike infrastructure will not reduce your traffic in the city of Toronto. I come from a city that is equal in population to Toronto with more than 14 gardener\/DVP style expressways and many large boulevards that bifurcates the city of Houston. Houston has horrendous traffic that is getting worse, but the powers to be keeps pouring money to widen the roads and build more freeways. We know, with lots of research, that for each lane built in a city like Houston, we are saving 5 minutes to only need to do it again because of population growth. Toronto is incredible to be able to move the number of people it does with GO transit, TTC, BIKE LANES, pedestrian walking, etc AND not have the 14+ freeways that Houston has.\nI fear your half hazard approach to reducing infrastructure will only aggravate the problem while increasing the very real risk of pedestrian and bike fatalities due to not enough infrastructure for the most efficient mode of transportation. As a nurse, I have seen what lack of bike lanes can do to the physical body. I also see in real time that the bike lanes provide accessible transportation for people with varying physical mobilities. I strongly urge you to be a partner in keeping Toronto accessible and safe by expanding bike infrastructure and other public transit forms.\nSincerely,\nToronto RN\n",

To the contrary, it has been widely shown that increasing the number of lanes actually makes traffic and congestion worse: https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/amp\/1.7358319. Removing bike lanes will also force bikes to occupy the main driving lanes, which will further increase congestion.\nFurthermore, bike lanes are beneficial to the environment by promoting non-motor-vehicle transportation, and the lanes in Toronto have resulted in thousands of people every day using bikes instead of cars. It should be obvious that more trips by bike and fewer trips by car is beneficial for the environment. Cars also wear down roads hundreds of times faster than bikes because of how heavy they are. More wear means the roads need to be repaired more frequently, which is bad for the environment.\nFurther still, bike lanes are important for both cyclist and pedestrian safety. Anyone who thinks that saving people 2 minutes on their commute in exchange for the lives of Canadians should not have any political power.\nEven further still, this bill is a gross overstep of provincial power into municipal responsibilities. Ontario has many issues that need urgent funding such as housing and healthcare, and projects that need pressure to finish such as the Eglinton LRT. Spending money reviewing and ripping up bike lanes is completely fiscally irresponsible. The premier and Conservative party need to do their jobs, not roleplay as mayor of Toronto.\nStop pandering to people who cheer when cyclists are killed by cars. If this bill goes through, then I hope everyone involved understands that blood is on their hands the next time a cyclist or pedestrian is killed on Bloor\/Yonge\/University.

This bill oversteps municipal authority and undermines local decision-making on bike lane infrastructure. Local governments, not the provincial legislature, are best suited to determine the transportation needs of their residents. Bill 212 is a dangerous step backward. Municipalities like Toronto need the flexibility to design safe, inclusive streets, on the basis of expert opinion, staff reports, and resident input.

Both expediting Highway 413 and creating blockages to creating bike lanes suffer from the same issue around induced demand, a topic that has been modelled by traffic scientists and engineers for decades. Building out the highway and minimizing bike lanes only encourages greater car usage which, in turn increases gridlock. This is particularly given that of all of the transportation mechanisms available to us, cars have the highest cost in terms of space taken up per person. Investing in rapidly completing the provincial transit projects via Metrolinx would go a much longer way in helping to reduce gridlock. Also, by bypassing the environmental assessment required for Highway 413, we are risking a part of our land that we cannot get back. This is short-sighted and sets a dangerous precedent for other protected land, which all becomes more and more valuable to our ability to exist and stay healthy as climate change advances.

        "comment":"This proposal is extremely short sighted and deceitful, like many of other proposals by this administration. It is so problematic on so many levels, as I'm sure the provincial staff are aware:\n1. PROVINCIAL OVERREACH\n1a) In the example of Toronto, Premier Ford was quoted saying the major bike lanes, like the ones on Bloor, Yonge, and University, will be targeted for removal, based on no real criteria. Perhaps the criteria will be based on Mr.Ford's feelings? Since when does the premier get to decide what gets removed on city roads??\n1b) Do motorists need both major and minor roads? So do cyclists. The three he mentioned are major thoroughfares for cyclists, too. Putting bike lanes only on secondary streets doesn't solve gridlock.\n1c) Bike lanes are only installed after YEARS of study, planning, piloting, AND community input. The municipalities have already done this. It is a gross overreach of the province to suddenly butt in and announce they will rip out any that \"fails\" according to this non-existent criteria. The province should do their actual job, like completing higher order transit. Metrolinx, a PROVINCIAL entity, has been struggling to complete several LRT lines on time. I don't see the premier and the Transportation Minister Sarkaria doing much about that.\n2. WASTE OF TIME, MONEY AND RESOURCES - all the bike lanes are already put in. It took years of time from various departments at municipalities, consultants, and construction crews. The carbon footprint to rip out all the materials and re-install asphalt is a huge waste of resources and means more construction, which DOES contribute to gridlock. It also took A LOT of money to build the networks we currently have in Ontario, TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS. The province announced that it will pay for any bike lanes that it wants removed. BUT WHERE IS THAT MONEY COMING FROM? If you have all that money lying around, why hasn't it been used for public transit or hospitals?? Stop wasting our money.\n3. UNSCIENTIFIC - congestion is a big issue in many places around the world, and lots of studies have been done. No study has ever shown that putting more cars on the road reduces congestion, also none has ever demonstrated that bike lanes cause gridlock. In fact, it is the opposite: see article attached. It is also worth to point out that cars are not IN traffic, they ARE the traffic. We need to promote less cars on the road, not more, by promoting alternate modes of transit (i.e. LRT, subway, BIKE LANES, etc).\n4. BACKWARDS - this proposal is not only based on feelings and no real evidence, it is backwards. The world is facing a climate crisis. We, collectively as human species, need to be moving towards more sustainable modes of transit, not promoting carbon inducing single passenger vehicles.\n5. CYCLIST SAFETY - just like motorists, cyclists want to stay alive and unharmed! Removing bike lanes not only puts cyclists at danger, but motorist as well. With bike lanes, everybody knows where to be and there is less confusion and\/or mixing of the two road users. Perhaps this administration is forgetting that cyclists are also Ontarians, and their safety matters just much as motorists. And in case you didn't know, bike helmets don't save you from dying when you get crushed by a car.\n6. DECEITFUL - buried in this proposal is a clause that will allow bypassing of the environmental assessment required for the proposed Highway 413 (also, do we really need another highway?). It seems like this administration has complete disregard for safeguarding or protecting natural and environmental resources of Ontario, as was already demonstrated by the greenbelt scandal. Highway 413 will be an enormous piece of infrastructure if built, and it is paramount that we are fully understand the environmental impacts. We are facing a climate crisis and having to deal with extreme climates more and more. We need to more equipped with knowledge, not less. Such an infrastructure will last many decades, we owe the future generations of Ontario a better than this.\nThis proposal is an insult to the people of Ontario. There are so many other problems in our province, like the housing crisis or the buckling healthcare system. Yet here is the premier with a bogus proposal with a bogus name, wasting taxpayers' time and money that he claims he wants to save.\nAs a resident and cyclist of Toronto, I'd urge Mr.Ford and Mr.Sarkaria to try riding around those Toronto streets without bike lanes at peak rush hour and see if they can propose a bogus bill like this after that. Oh, wait, Mr.Ford already did: \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure three\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders,\" he said on TVO back in 2017. I guess he conveniently hasn't heard about the deaths of multiple cyclists in this year alone. Mr.Sarkaria lives in Brampton and commutes to Queen's Park by car. He is part of the gridlock problem, yet he has the audacity to question the validity of municipal bike lane studies that exclude bad weather months. Cyclists bike less in the winter partly because the lanes are never cleared of snow or ice, therefore unsafe. But how would he know that? He does not ride a bike in my city to know.\n",

We have been taught that driving is a privilege. This regulation proposal falls counter to that.\nHowever, this does make me wonder if there will be bicycle lanes parallel with the limited access expressway systems?\nHighway 413  - multiple sources show that this only benefits a few, and time savings are not yet significant.

Creating a safer means of travel for bikes will have the positive effect of increasing bicycle use. In Toronto, the Bloor West of Humber bike lane was rolled out with the concurrent expansion of Bikeshare stations, allowing me to ride out to the end of the line for coffee earlier this year.\nI also note that bike lanes tend to make it safer for pedestrians and drivers alike. One of the ways this happens is by providing dedicated left turns lanes. As a driver, this also makes the trip time more predictable - which to me, is the crucial part of dealing with the stress of traffic.\nSecond, on exempting highway 413 and the Brantford bypass from environmental assessment, this is clearly a violation of the spirit and intent of the environmental law. The current government has been in office long enough that the assessment could and should have been done. As above, it is clear that promoting more automobile and truck traffic will negatively impact our climate (and, therefore, environmental) goals. In addition, there are numerous likely adverse nature effects, which have taken on greater prominence since the COP 16 conference on nature held in Montreal. Building the highway will certainly make it harder to protect 30% of nature by 2030 (the 30 by 30 pledge).\n",

See key statistics provided by the Bloor Annex Business Improvement Area (BIA) below and at the following link:\nhttps:\/\/toronto.citynews.ca\/2024\/10\/24\/which-nasty-and-terrible-bike-la\u2026\nBloor Annex BIA bike lane stats:\nEVIDENCE-BASED HIGHLIGHTS: (Source \u2013 Bloor Annex BIA)\n\u2022 Monthly customer spending and number of customers in the Bloor Annex increased after bike lanes were installed\n\u2022 Retail vacancies in the Bloor Annex have not changed in eight years since bike lane installation\n\u2022 Road safety for all users has improved since the installation of bike lanes resulting in fewer fatalities and better road safety outcomes for all road users\n\u2022 No evidence of increased emergency response times due to bike lanes said chiefs of Toronto Paramedics and Toronto Fire to city\u2019s Infrastructure & Environment\n\u2022 Putting bike lanes on residential streets would have an extreme negative impact on street parking for residents\n\u2022 Bike lanes reduce congestion\nBY THE NUMBERS:\n\u2022 1 million: approximate number of cyclists who rode the Bloor Street bike lanes between Avenue Road and Shaw Street between February 2018 and February 2019\n\u2022 8,000: number of cyclists per day that Bloor Annex BIA believes currently use the Bloor bike lanes today\n\u2022 9 years: number of years that Bloor Annex bike lanes have been part of complete street renewal\nThis is an argument for practically every bike lane built in Toronto, not only just for Bloor Street (of which I use nearly every day as a cyclist). But let\u2019s talk about Bloor St. since Premier Ford has signalled his intent to rip up previously installed cycling infrastructure that has proven to be effective at reducing congestion, improving safety, and increasing revenues for small businesses (see above link for Premier Ford admitting his intention to remove specific bike lanes with absolutely no data to support it).\nBloor Street is the road I use more than any other to visit businesses and shop. I use it to go to the Royal Museum of Ontario with my wife and I use it as part of my  weekly journey to Kensington Market (from my home in the Dovercourt Village area)  for pub trivia with my wife and her family. Without the Bloor bike lane and others in the surrounding area (Shaw St., Grace St. Harbourd St., College St., Palmerston Blvd., etc.), I would be less inclined to travel at all for buying goods and services. Sure, I might take transit or walk, but if transit happens to be slow or down and the weather\u2019s bad and I don\u2019t want to walk, well, I\u2019m not going to make those trips. I should mention that I bike year round unlike what the Minister of Transportation may say and I do so in practically all weather so long as the City keeps the road reasonably clear of snow and ice on the few occasions when these are serious impediments. So yes, I am a cyclist who rides his bike even in the winter months and not much will stop me from doing so.\nLack of safe infrastructure would be the main reason for me to not ride my bike and, absent the bike lanes I would need to feel safe, I well tell you now that Toronto small businesses will not be getting nearly as much money from me should the bike lane provisions of this act become law. I would instead pay online retailers such as Amazon who can quickly get goods to my door without me having to risk my neck on a then unsafe bike ride to local stores. This is an economic argument against both ripping up existing cycling infrastructure and stymying planned infrastructure as this Act intends to do.\nOn the subject of safety, it is plain that this Act would do nothing to improve the safety of vulnerable road users if the only bike lanes that could be built are those that would not reduce vehicle traffic and it would absolutely endanger cyclists who have come to rely on the key bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge. I would encourage the Province to work with the City of Toronto whose Vision Zero Road Safety Plan (https:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/services-payments\/streets-parking-transportation\u2026) is gradually being implemented with the goal of \u201creducing traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries on Toronto\u2019s streets.\u201d Despite this plan, six cyclists have been killed so far in Toronto out of a total of 36 road users in 2024 (see Vision Zero Dashboard in the above link). I put it to the Provincial Government that the benefits to road safety alone justify the continued expansion of Toronto\u2019s cycling network, which is one aspect of the City\u2019s Vision Zero plan. We know that when protected cycling infrastructure is installed, not only does it incentivize more people to bike instead of driving their cars, it also calms traffic flows as well by forcing cars to slow down. Enforcement via police or speed cameras can only go so far as we have seen on Parkside Drive where there is no bike lane, which has witnessed 1,487 collisions between Aug. 2014 and Aug. 2024, seven of these \u201cresulted in five serious injuries and three deaths.\u201d https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/parkside-drive-bike-lanes-1.7353\u2026\nLastly, it must be said as the Bloor BIA has already stated, \u201cbike lanes reduce congestion.\u201d The Premier and his Minister of Transportation have yet to provide a shred of evidence that the presence of bike lanes contributes to congestion in Toronto. To date, all I have seen are anecdotes and uninformed opinions\/blatant falsehoods (e.g. Toronto winters are six months long and no one rides in winter). One thing I do agree with the Minister on is his statement in a recent opinion piece (https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/opinion\/contributors\/ontarios-transport-ministe\u2026) in the Toronto Star where he suggests that \u201cwhat we need is a common sense, evidence-based bike lane policy.\u201d The key word here being \u201cevidence-based.\u201d If the Minister can demonstrate with actual facts that bike lanes in Toronto add to congestion, then by all means proceed with this legislation. The fact that neither he nor the premier have done so indicates that there are no facts and there is no foundation to needlessly centralize a process that is best left with Ontario municipalities. Instead, perhaps the Minister can lead by example and take the GO Train to work. This would take one more vehicle off the road and perhaps inspire others to leave theirs behind as well.\nI want to finish by mentioning that my wife will be giving birth to our first child in January 2025. We are overjoyed and can\u2019t wait to introduce our son to walking and cycling in his community. We also do not own a car because it\u2019s frankly not necessary and too costly for us. We were able to make this decision because we have other options available to us instead of driving a car. There are many businesses within walking distance on Bloor St., for example, where I feel safe walking because cars can only go so fast with one lane of traffic going each way. Additionally, equipped with two paniers that attach to my rear bike rack, I am able to do practically all of my errands on two wheels. Yes, that includes grocery shopping. Doing so saves me buckets of money, it keeps me (relatively) in shape, and my carbon footprint is much lower than any of my car-owning neighbours. Those same neighbours don\u2019t have to compete for anywhere near as much road space with me as my bike is significantly smaller than any car and I never use street parking.\nI want to live in a city and a province where both levels of government actively work to reduce both congestion and fossil fuel emissions. It is abundantly clear that investing in public infrastructure so that more Ontarians walk, bike, and take public transit, will accomplish both of these goals. Tying the hands of municipal governments and effectively preventing any new cycling infrastructure from being built only exacerbates congestion and encourages more people to drive. Simply put, this Act will make traffic worse not better. I don\u2019t want Toronto and Ontario to go backwards on this very important policy area for many reasons, but, most of all, I implore the provincial government to eliminate this section of the bill because I am fearful for my son. One day he might be out on the streets of Toronto on his bike and I pray that he doesn\u2019t become yet another road casualty for no other reason than the Premier of Ontario thought he didn\u2019t deserve safe cycling infrastructure. He does and so does everyone else. I beg you to do the right thing and let Ontario cities build bike lanes free from provincial government interference.\n",

If some sort of priority process is deemed necessary, than there should be a clear process for determining that and not simply the minister making that decision.\nCorners not cut in the construction of highways in general and non of the measures being proposed seems warranted.\nLastly, bigger picture, if the goal is the reduce congestion the focus should be on actions that would have more on an effect. Building more highways is likely to only lead to a temporary improvement as the extra traffic encouraged will in the long run add to the levels of traffic being funnelled in the routes supposedly being relieved.

The bill's requirement for provincial approval of new bike lanes that replace traffic lanes is seen as an overreach of government authority and a lack of trust in local democracy. This approach contradicts extensive municipal planning processes that include research and community input.\nThe concept of Induced Demand suggests that adding more car lanes actually increases traffic, contrary to the bill's objectives. Critics argue that to truly reduce gridlock, the government should invest heavily in transit projects and comprehensive cycling networks. Bike lanes are highlighted as an efficient use of road space, with each cyclist representing one less car on the road. Additionally, areas with bike lanes have shown increased success for local businesses.\nThe bill's impact on cycling infrastructure is a major concern. Cycling is presented as a healthier transportation option that leads to better health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Bike lanes are also credited with improving overall street safety for all users and providing greater accessibility to those who can't afford cars. The removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto is criticized, given their high usage and the recent cyclist fatalities in the city.\nThe bill's proposal to exempt Highway 413 lands from environmental assessments is viewed as short-sighted and potentially disastrous for the environment. Critics argue that paving over environmentally sensitive land will permanently destroy natural habitats, carbon sinks, and flood control measures. The exemption is seen as a disregard for environmental concerns and contradictory to the goal of reducing gridlock. The summary concludes that Bill 212 will likely worsen gridlock, public safety, local economies, and health outcomes while causing irreparable environmental damage.\nThis is one of the most regressive bills I have seen in a very long time, and I will never vote for anyone who has supported this bill\n",

Not only does it ignore the empirical evidence of other countries around the world who have successfully integrated bike lanes without increased traffic congestion (see below links), but also is a bandaid fix to a larger issue. Instead of aiming to fast-track highway production by paving through Greenbelt areas, your government should be focusing on investing in safe, convenient, and environmentally conscious transportation infrastructure. Bill 212 is an overstep by the province into a jurisdiction that should be left up to municipalities. I hope you seriously consider the grave consequences that this Bill will have if put into action. We need to be thinking about the future, not just the here and now. And while this bill may seem to be the appropriate course of action for the present, that shortsightedness will be regretted years down the road as the climate crisis deepens.\nThank you for your time.\n",

        "comment":"This legislation is a travesty regarding understanding of the factors to reducing traffic congestion, will result in billion dollars of spending for the province and will have deadly consequences for little to no benefit to the public at large. There will be a slight decrease in traffic for a brief period of time \u2014 then induced demand will bring the roads to a standstill within no time at all. Studies show time and time again that adding lanes of traffic, over the long run, actually serves to make traffic worse while deprecating the quality of life for those who do not drive and makes our province even less navigable for those who do not drive. These billions in taxpayer dollars can far better be utilized by transit solutions that are actually planned for long-term sustainable growth and urban development that prioritizes mobility while deprioritizing personal motor vehicles.\nThe demonization and destruction of cycling infrastructure is the most tragic part of this plan. Drivers will see a meagre improvement to their travel time for a brief moment before returning to baseline. Meanwhile, us and our neighbours who do not drive, and choose to take an efficient, sustainable, and healthy way around our town will suffer for it and risk getting seriously injured or killed, all for what? A few minutes shaved off of drivers\u2019 morning commute? Your convenience as a driver does not outweigh cyclists right to safety. This thinking demonstrates a complete carelessness for the wellbeing of ALL Ontarians, increasing inequality between drivers and non-motorists.\nIf you really care about reducing congestion - create reasonable and effective alternatives to driving (transit, cycling infrastructure, better pedestrian access to amenities). Reduce the need to drive and make it easier to not need a car. The success of GO transit in getting suburban commuters to downtown should be a sign that we need more of this and less reliance on inefficient, costly, high-emissions travel modes. Plan smarter.\n",

        "comment":"To whom it may concern,\nI write to express my deep concern about the proposal to review and potentially remove bike lanes in Ontario and to urge you to abandon this short-sighted and highly damaging proposal.\nI am a driver, cyclist, and pedestrian in Toronto. I am also a professor and social scientist at the University of Toronto with a record of published research that bears directly on energy transition policies. So I have both personal experience and expertise on this topic.\nMost importantly, bike lanes are essential infrastructure to protect my and my family's safety as well as the health and safety of all Ontarians. I have bike-commuted to work for over 5 years. I have also used my bike, equipped with a kid's bike seat, to regularly transport my two children to daycare during that time. My children are now 8 and 5 years old and ride their own bicycles. According to Toronto Police Services data, 34 people have lost their lives to fatal car collisions so far in 2024. Six were cyclists. Eliminating protected bike lanes from widely used thoroughfares will put our safety at risk. Less appreciated, but equally devastating, are the health effects of continued investment in car infrastructure. A 2021 federal study found that 500 Ontarians and 170 Torontonians died prematurely as a direct consequence of traffic related air pollution in 2015. Given the rise in both vehicles and Toronto's population since 2015, we can reasonably expect these figures to be underestimates of the current counts. Reducing the number of cars on the road saves lives in multiple ways.\nI commute by bike daily. There are two things that I notice on my commutes. First, I notice the growing number of Torontonians using bike lanes for their daily travel. Due to growing demand, the building I work at downtown has added two additional bike racks last spring. They were at capacity again this summer. Bike Share Toronto statistics, the most reliable bike usage figures we have, back up my observation. The number of trips have grown from 665,000 in 2015 to 5.7 million trips in 2023--a near 10-fold increase in less than a decade! Bike lanes increasingly provide essential transportation infrastructure for Torontonians and this trend is expected to only accelerate.\nThe second thing I observe on my commute is a line of cars, many are SUVs and the vast majority with a single occupant--the driver. Passing one single-occupant car after another throws the absurdity of blaming bicycles for the traffic problem in sharp relief. Cars cause traffic, not bicycles. I sympathize with the residents who have no other option except to drive and must endure gridlock. So let's focus on actual solutions, encouraging and enabling commuters to make other choices. Bike lanes are one option that commuters are increasingly choosing. Let's focus the conversation on questions that actually matter. Why do many commuters who live near public transit lines still choose to drive (this includes many in my neighbourhood in Toronto, just 5 km from downtown and on a streetcar line)? Why does the Eglinton Crosstown LRT remain incomplete with apparently no accountability? Why are TTC fares some of the highest in the world?\nToronto is expected to grow by 1.1 million residents (35%) by 2051. If the Government wants to address transportation in a sustainable, forward-looking way, they should focus on answering and addressing questions like the ones I listed above, not on taking away choice from Ontarians.\nThank you for your attention.\nSincerely,\nFedor A. Dokshin\n",

The mere suggestion of legislation of this nature leads me to believe the Province lacks an understanding of how to move people from Point A to Point B safely, efficiently, and effectively.\nI take issue with this legislation for a number of reasons. After reading the legislation I\u2019m left with numerous questions that I think the Province should be prepared to answer.\nWhy is the Province looking to limit and restrict safe transportation options for all road users?\nWhy would the government want to have less options available for people to safely get around their communities? Would this not increase congestion and traffic?\nWhy is the Province looking to prioritise the time of motorists rather than create equitable solutions for all road users?\nBased on comments from the Minister of Transportation and the Premiere in the media, the time and safety of motorists seems to be of greater importance than that of other road users, cyclists and pedestrians included. Could you please articulate why this is the case?\nThis legislation demonstrates a lack of understanding behind the reasons for traffic and congestion\nResearch has demonstrated that bike lanes help reduce congestion because they create a modal shift away from driving, which allows existing vehicle traffic to move more efficiently. Please see link to research below. Could the Province please demonstrate how removing bike lanes would allow all roads users to get to their destinations safely and efficiently?\nHas the Province considered road safety, especially that of vulnerable road users?\nRoads in Ontario are dangerous; I read about people being seriously injured or killed by motorists weekly in this province. Bike lanes make using the roads safer for thousands of people daily in Toronto. Why is the government supporting policy that could so clearly impact the health and safety of individual road users, and by extension the broader community by increasing pollution and emissions in local communities? Can the Province explain the steps it has taken to mitigate the impact on vulnerable road users, namely children and the elderly who use bike lanes?\nHas the Province considered the equity and affordability impacts of this legislation?\nThe province is dealing with an affordability crisis. Not everyone can afford a car to get around. Bike lanes provide a safe way for non-motorists to navigate our communities. Has the Province considered the broad range of road users that use bike lanes, from students to delivery drivers?\nWhy is the Province creating legislation that increases red tape and costs?\nWhy is the Province proposing to rip-out millions of dollars in new infrastructure and cause further delays and congestion for all road users and in the process limit the safe options road users will have available to navigate their communities. The thought of ripping out millions of dollars of infrastructure when schools have leaking roofs, and our emergency rooms are at the breaking point is infuriating.\nHas the Province honestly considered where thousands of cyclists are going to go if the bike lanes are removed?\nWhat happens if those road users no longer feel safe cycling, what happens if they choose to use a car to drive (if they have one\/can afford one), where are they going to go? More cars on the road will lead to greater congestion, that\u2019s just a reality. How does the government propose to address that issue. Perhaps, bike tunnels?\nWhat happens to the cyclists who still choose to cycle on less safe streets? The have the right to take the lane to get to their destination, however, some cyclists, including those with children might not feel safe and may use the sidewalk, which is also not ideal.\nWhen legislation is this poorly thought out, I can only predict it will be poorly implemented.\nI would like the Provincial government to focus on its supposed priorities, namely rectifying the dismal state of our healthcare and education system, both of which are struggling significantly. Moreover, I\u2019d appreciate the Province focus on getting transit built, namely the Eglinton Crosstown which is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.\nOn a very personal note, I have three young children. I am honestly more afraid of them being killed by a motorist on road in Ontario than most other potential threats. The network of bikelanes where we live in Toronto is finally getting to a standard where I feel safer on the roads. We do not have a vehicle. We use bikes, specifically a cargo bike, the TTC and a car-share to get around. Removing bike lanes makes my family less safe. This legislation makes me less safe. I ask the Province to explain how legislation designed to make people less safe is good for anyone.\nI encourage the Province to review the work of the Centre for Active Transportation and collection of research on the positive economic impacts of bikes, the positive health and safety benefits of bikelanes, as well as research outlining how bike lanes do not increase congestion.\nInfrastructure can always be tweaked and improved, but ripping it out of the ground makes no sense. If you want me to believe this Government is actually serious, then come forward with serious policy and solutions for improving road safety and making sure all road users can get where they are going. Can the Province point to any jurisdiction where prioritising motor vehicle traffic has improved the transportation for all road users?\nI always appreciate it when members of the government work to really understand an issue. I would like to encourage the Minister to do as his boss did and actually get on a bicycle and try to navigate his local constituency or my neighbourhood. I would like to understand how he felt using roads with and without bicycling infrastructure.\nTo quote the Premiere, \"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\u201d and  \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was.\"\n",

Reducing bike lanes will only temporarily reduce car congestion. 100 years of cars has proven that more roads only creates more cars. We will never escape car congestion by creating more roads or lanes. It\u2019s time to re-think this issue.\n2.

I think it is unwise to remove them especially in a city like Toronto. In order to reduce gridlock, we should give people more options to commute other than driving. Also, not everyone can afford to rent or own a car. People who bike should not have to fear for their lives every time they need to get somewhere. Enough folks have lost their lives to easily preventable accidents.\nA lot of studies have already proven that increasing the number of lanes on streets doesn\u2019t actually improve congestion, as we will eventually return to the same levels of congestion as before.\nReducing gridlock should involve maintaining a diverse approach to travel, and will provide peace of mind for all in knowing that we can all be in our designated lanes to get to our destinations safely.\n",

Bicycle lanes in my community have improved accessibility and safety for myself and my family. Reducing cycle and pedestrian safety will not improve vehicular congestion, only fewer cars on the over-stuffed roads can do that. Cycle lanes, sidewalks and paths, and better transit infrastructure are essential to the healthy growth of our communities. I support a sensible, balanced approach for everyone - not just those who chose to drive over the other alternatives.

        "comment":"I am writing in opposition to this proposed anti-bike lane legislation.. This policy would not only compromise road safety for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers but would also infringe upon municipalities\u2019 authority to make decisions that directly impact their communities.\nThis legislation directly contradicts Ottawa\u2019s long-term vision to expand its cycling network, aiming to increase bike routes by 50% by 2046. Interference from provincial authorities disrupts these carefully planned, community-backed projects, which are crucial for Ottawa\u2019s sustainable future.\nLocal experts and planners have worked closely with residents to develop active transportation projects, and these should be supported, not undermined.\nThis legislation could also place an undue financial burden on taxpayers, leading to costly removal of existing bike lanes and adding unnecessary bureaucracy and delays to projects already approved. Residents want an efficient, connected transportation system with diverse options\u2014not a rollback that would limit safety and accessibility.\nOntarians are asking for practical solutions to ease traffic congestion and promote safety for all road users. Increased transportation options contribute to a more connected, eco-friendly future where not every trip requires a car.\nStudies, including a recent CBC report, have shown that widening roads and adding car lanes do little to reduce gridlock. On the contrary, cities that invest in bike lanes experience reduced congestion, cleaner air, and safer streets for everyone. Bike lanes are not just beneficial\u2014they are essential to public health, environmental progress, and local business.\nOttawa residents value our bike lanes and the benefits they bring. This misguided legislation does not reflect the needs or wishes of most Ontarians. I ask that you listen to your constituents and support local decision-making that prioritizes our communities\u2019 health and safety.\n",

        "comment":"As a frequent driver and biker in the City of Toronto, I think that some of the priorities of this Bill are misled and will not benefit drivers in Ontario. Municipalities should retain their ability to build bike lanes where they believe they are best-suited. The province, while it has jurisdiction over traffic and highways, should trust in the experts in each municipality to make informed and data-driven decisions on their own bike lanes. I frequently have to drive downtown to get to and from work, or to visit family in other municipalities, and having safe bike lanes has been a crucial part of reducing traffic and gridlock. When bikes are forced to share the lane with drivers, and especially when it is inconsistent due to construction, it greatly increases drivers' stress and risk of accidents. Bike lanes disappearing, reappearing, and merging with car lanes constantly doesn't help anyone's safety or efficiently on the road. Even if only 2% of the population uses bikes to commute to and from work, the impact that poor bike lane management and excessive construction has can be huge - from delaying so many drivers in their commute, to causing more emissions from all the stalled vehicles, and worstly it's far more dangerous for the lives and safety of Ontarian cyclists. While building the new highway is a great initiative and sure to help the province, this should not come at the cost of making things worse for bike lanes, local drivers, and the environment.\n",

When has it ever worked before? The way forward is to build good public transportation and more bike lanes. One bus can take the place of 50 cars! Bike lanes are being used as a scapegoat for the gridlock problems. Also, requiring municipalities to get permission from the province to add bike lanes will increase red-tape. The municipalities  know much better what works best for their communities. Removing bike lanes will result in more cyclist injuries and fatalities. Good, safe bike lanes encourage people to leave their cars at home and cycle instead. Cities around the world who do not suffer from gridlock are those which have excellent public transportation and a good bike lane system, not those who just add roads. As well, more cars mean higher CO2 emissions increasing our dire problems with climate change. We can do better than this!\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to you as a resident of Ontario, in the City of Ottawa and a professional transportation planner. I am dismayed as I read the news release from the Province of Ontario dated October 21, 2024 for the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. There is little to no information about the act and no resources citing research or informed policy information for many of the changes proposed in the act. The omnibus nature of this act is opaque and undemocratic. Why are all these disparate policies being compiled into a single act? That does not provide sufficient opportunity for discussion and each policy to be examined and judged on their own merit. Each of these new policies and actions need to be discussed on their own. With that said, I applaud your interest and attempt to speed up the process for government action. There are numerous crises in Ontario today being most keenly felt by those experiencing poverty, unstable housing and broader unaffordability, not to mention addictions and mental health, and they need our governments at all levels to take swift, bold actions to work towards sustainable decisions.\nThere are many issues I take with ranging proposals within the proposed legislation, but I want to focus my attention on this email regarding the proposed new approval process for the installation of new cycling infrastructure. With this issue I speak from a place of expertise and close experience, having worked in the profession for over 8 years, and having worked on transportation projects ranging from master plans, feasibility studies, and projects through the design process that have then been implemented. The idea that municipalities who need to receive approval from MTO before implementing a project is deeply concerning, as it is directly disentitling municipalities to their jurisdiction and creating new layers of red tape that will lead to slowing down an already lengthy, arduous process for a municipality to implement an infrastructure project. At what point in the process would a municipality need to get approval from the province? So often infrastructure projects that include bike lanes are part of initiatives stemming from the municipality's core policy and planning documents including their Official Plan, Transportation Master Plan, a Road Safety Plan, or Climate Action Plan. All these plans are developed through intensive, thoughtful processes that most often include public engagement, and build upon research and best practices. These documents are wide ranging, and broadly setting directions for a community, and responding to the needs of the community, helping it grow and prosper. These documents reflect the community and direct staff towards actions to respond to their needs towards realizing the community's vision and goals. Your proposed policy directly denies for these communities to direct themselves and respond to the desires of their residents and their needs. Would it be here that a municipality would need to seek prospective approval even though a lane removal is just a potential option that could be to help more affordably or rapidly enact infrastructure changes that stem from their policies? If not, then would it be at some point as the municipality takes a project through preliminary design, functional, or detailed design? What moment do they need to pause a project that they have likely engaged a consultant to complete, and put it on pause until it receives approval from MTO? This would add an additional step, and introduce friction into a business engagement and remove predictability, very likely leading towards increased costs for already cash-strapped municipalities due to requiring more project time and an unclear path forward for the consultant.\nI could also comment on the vagueness of the proposed legislation that projects will have to \"demonstrate that the proposed bike lane will not have a negative impact on vehicle traffic\". This is an incredibly single-minded proposal that maintains the status quo in which we are experiencing increasing congestion. It doesn't consider the potential multitudes of benefits of bike lanes which have been rigorously researched in Ontario, Canada, and internationally, and instead decides negative impacts for motor vehicle traffic are the only perspective that matters. This neglects the experience, safety, and needs of the senior getting exercise, the parent cycling with child, the student, the commuter, the person without a drivers license because they can't afford to own or maintain a car or physically not be able to drive. And what is a negative impact? How do we quantify it? Is it any increase in travel time along a corridor? What if there are benefits for people driving motor vehicles from the project like a decrease in the number and severity of collisions? Do those override the negative impacts? What if the project means that a parent driving doesn't need to pick up their young teen after school, because now they have a safe way to bike home, which would provide the parent with real time and money savings. Now that's a benefit!\nA single segment of bike lane in isolation may seem unnecessary, that it doesn't provide or get adequate use. I'd like to challenge that notion, and put it in a network perspective. When we travel by car through our cities we are able to travel on numerous routes of our choosing to access any destination, door to door. People who are cycling can use roads, but many - particularly arterial roads have high vehicle speeds and volumes that make cycling very uncomfortable and unsafe, so much so that while the majority of the population wants to cycle, they won't, because they don't feel comfortable and safe to do so. Bike lanes, especially ones with physical separation, create conditions on these arterial roads for people to feel comfortable using them. Very often everyday destinations such as schools, grocery stores and services are along these arterial roads, so people will only choose to access them if they feel comfortable cycling on that arterial road.Other times, that arterial road will be the only direct route through a community to connect between different neighbourhoods. We weigh directness, feasibility of cycling infrastructure, and latent demand when we develop proposed cycling networks for communities. The proposed legislation would set back hard work completed by the municipalities on developing networks. We know that if there's even one weak link in a network, like a stressful road, people will choose not to cycle for that trip.\nI hope that you have read and reflected on this email and consider how it aligns not only with provincial policy including past and current Provincial Planning Statements but also your own rhetoric about removing red tape, responding to the needs of Ontarians in this moment, and for a better, healthier, and more affordable future.\n",

You must consider that the sheer number of cars on the road is what is causing gridlock. How can we reduce the number of required cars for people to be able to get where they need to go? Provide other travel options that are not cars. Improve transit. Make it easy for people to bike, carpool, or take a train instead of driving.\nYou can improve the flow of traffic without reducing the number of bike lanes in Toronto and this proposal is very far off base from what the residents of the city want.\n",

        "comment":"Decisions about adding bike lanes in a community shouldn\u2019t be made at the provincial level; it\u2019s too broad a scope to understand the unique needs of each municipality. Bike lanes are a local issue, and it doesn\u2019t make sense for provincial authorities to be overruling or directing these kinds of projects. Bill 212 is a serious overreach.\nAs someone who works and lives in the city core while also bikes year-round, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how valuable bike lanes are. There\u2019s so much evidence showing they improve the health, safety, and well-being of communities. Bike lanes encourage people to stay active, reduce dependence on cars, and help make neighborhoods cleaner and more pedestrian-friendly. Removing them would just push more people into cars, adding to road congestion and forcing cyclists to use driving lanes, which slows traffic even more. This year alone, six cyclists have already died on Toronto streets. Cutting back on bike lanes would be a huge step backward\u2014we actually need more bike lanes, not fewer.\nHaving strong cycling infrastructure, along with other alternative transportation options, makes our cities fairer and safer for everyone. I really hope the Ministry will look at the overwhelming data backing these benefits and make a decision based on evidence.\nAnother part of Bill 212 is that it would allow projects like Highway 413 to skip the Environmental Assessment Act, which sets standards to protect our environment. Skipping these assessments just to speed up projects is reckless and short-sighted. We need these measures to hold everyone accountable and make sure developments are sustainable. I urge the Ministry to stick to its commitment to a healthy, sustainable future for all of us.\n",

As an avid cyclist, taxpayer, and concerned citizen, I want to emphasize that bikes are not the cause of traffic congestion; rather, they offer a sustainable solution to it.\nRemoving bike lanes will not solve our traffic issues\u2014instead, it will likely worsen them. When cyclists are forced onto the road without dedicated lanes, it creates a more dangerous environment for everyone, ultimately leading to more frustration and congestion. Studies have shown that cities with well-planned cycling infrastructure experience less traffic, as more people opt to ride rather than drive. Instead of viewing cycling as a contributor to traffic, we should recognize it as a vital component of a holistic transportation strategy that promotes public health, reduces pollution, and enhances our city\u2019s livability.\nMoreover, dismantling existing bike lanes would be a significant waste of public resources. The investment made in creating and maintaining these lanes is designed to promote safer cycling and to encourage a shift toward greener modes of transportation. Rather than dismantling what we have, we should be enhancing and expanding our cycling infrastructure, which has proven benefits for public health, the environment, and the economy.\nIn a city facing urgent challenges related to traffic, pollution, and public health, we cannot afford to take steps backward. Let\u2019s focus on developing solutions that benefit everyone, not just drivers, and support a more sustainable future.\nI urge you all to reconsider this bill and advocate for policies that prioritize safe cycling as an integral part of our transportation network.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n",

The government claims that bike lanes the cause of gridlock, and removing them will 'get driver where they need to go faster'. However, this opinion is misinformed for multiple reasons:\n1. New bike lanes have not been shown to cause longer travel times. There are many other factors increasing travel times, including: more cars on the road post-pandemic, increased construction projects. Bike lanes actually can help reduce travel times by taking cars off the road. If there is better cycling infrastructure, commuters are more likely to take their bike to work, instead of their car. This removes a car from the traffic, which will reduce congestion.\n2. New bike lanes have not been shown to increase emergency response times. Emergency services of Toronto have not reported increased response times for calls.\n3. Adding more lanes of traffic will just encourage more people to drive, and will increase congestion.\nBike lanes have other benefits as well, regardless of traffic and congestion:\n- safety for cyclists and drivers. With separated bike lanes, collisions between cyclists and cars decrease. Cyclists have been seriously injured and have died previously, due to collisions with cars. Everyone should have a right to get to work, and move around the city safely. Many use a bike because they cannot afford a car and it's associated costs (parking, gas etc.). By removing bike lanes, it is showing the province that the government cares more about drivers than they do cyclists. Cyclist fatalities and serious injuries will increase with the removal of bike lanes.\n- reduced environmental impact. With better cycling infrastructure, more people are likely to ride their bike, instead of taking a car. This lowers emissions, which is beneficial for the environment.\n- health - cycling is better for the health of Ontarians. The government should be encouraging more people to cycle, which could have downstream affects on health and health care costs.\nRipping up already existing bike lanes has the following negative impacts:\n- Cost: there has already been a cost to install these bike lanes - the cost to remove them will be even higher. We are already in a deficit.\n- Construction congestion: while these bike lanes are being removed, there will be extra lanes of traffic closed for construction. This will actually increase congestion.\nTelling cyclists to use side streets on their commute is not a practical solution. Many of the sidestreets end after a few blocks, and cyclists are forced to zig zag through the neighbourhoods. This increases their travel time. Why is it more important for a driver to decrease their travel time, while a cyclist is forced to increase theirs? This proposal is not equitable and is putting driver's priority above the rest of the population.\nThe use of bikes has increased significantly over the last 5 years, which is when the majority of these bike lanes have been installed. Why do we want to move backwards?\n",

Major Ontario cities, especially Toronto, face severe gridlock due to decades of inadequate investment in modern, safe, and effective transit options by several provincial and federal governments. Urban road networks cannot sustainably accommodate more cars without sacrificing livability, sustainability, travel times, and safety.\nPromoting cycling and other alternative transportation methods is essential to reducing gridlock, increasing livability, and dealing with emissions caused by car traffic. The City of Toronto, funded by its own budget, is responsible for its transportation infrastructure, and the provincial government neither funds these roads nor should it have authority over local bike lane decisions.\nThis proposal is not a genuine attempt to address gridlock but a politically motivated move based on misguided assumptions. It undermines public safety, urban sustainability, and quality of life. The regulation should be dismissed to protect the interests of Toronto and its residents.\n",

Like that of the \"Ontario Line\" being built for transit expansion, there seems to be a trend of approving, removing, and revisiting projects that were originally in place. Again, only wasting all of the time and effort spent originally to just do something that was meant to be there in the first place.\nWhen it comes to relieving the congestion of traffic in the city, the removal of bike lanes would have a much smaller impact than to say, improving the quality and reach of public transit. As a resident of Scarborough, I eagerly await the completion of the Line 2 expansion, as I can already anticipate how much an improvement it will make for traversing larger sections of the city (like having to commute downtown to and from work everyday as I do now). Perhaps a better question to ask yourselves before making decisions on these bike lanes would be to determine who exactly is constantly driving into the city and causing this congestion in the first place.\nWith a currently extremely limited transit system, it's obvious that those living in the surrounding areas of the Toronto core would opt to drive in and out of the city, but the removal of these lanes really does little good. More open lanes more often than not invite more traffic, which doesn't relieve anyone of anything. Your 30 min drive is still a 30 min drive, except a large population of the city that rely on bicycles as their means of transportation are more susceptible to risk of fatal injury.\n",

I did not vote for this party to have my city subjected to more red tape to complete basic projects.\nPreventing the construction of new bicycle lanes, and requiring the removal of old ones, is directly contrary to the province's stayed goal of improving traffic flow. Without a dedicated bicycle lane, bicycles will be mixed in with the flow of motor traffic. In addition to the intrinsically slower speeds of bicycles, motor vehicles further reduce their speed due to the high consequence of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles.\nAs a regular driver, I expect this bill will cause worse congestion.

As an avid cyclist, I use my bike regularly to travel through the city of Toronto to get to work and run errands. I have alternatives to this with easy access to the TTC by living on a street car line and a car for doing distant trips that are inconvenient through other means. Cycling is the superior method of travelling the city by providing able bodied people a healthy and independent method of transportation. Additionally, through cycling, I am relieving public transit and city roads of congestion. There is evidence that bike lanes have a positive effect to reducing congestion through major cities, through many reputed sources online and public authorities that have been referred to and posted since this policy entered the public eye. This is in addition to providing safer roads for all users and alleviating the environmental impact of cars and maintenance costs on roads throughout the city.\nHave we considered other alternatives to reduce congestion in the city? To build a strong and transparent policy that benefits all people in Ontario, we should cost out the each alternative as well and evaluate the financial, human, and environmental cost for improving congestion problems.\nHere are some alternatives that must be considered before bike lanes are removed:\n- removing street parking on major roads\n- congestion tax for cars\/trucks in the city\n- increasing fines and enforcement for illegal parking and dangerous driving in the city that adds to congestion\n- improving public transit\n- adding a levy to parking in the city to fund public transit or a \u201ccongestion reduction\u201d fund\n- increasing access to public transit by adding parking spaces to major terminal stations on the TTC and GO networks\n- incentivizing work from home that alleviates congestion during rush hour in the city\nThank you for your consideration\n- concerned cyclist\n",

I enjoy being able to choose the most convenient method of travel, whether that's driving, walking, biking, or taking the TTC, depending on the trip, and I don't want any of those choices to put me at risk of serious injury or death.

        "comment":"The purpose of our roads and our transportation network, is to move people. Some people drive, some cycle and some walk. Increasingly cycling is a growing mode of transport, especially on Bloor street. There are estimates that 40% of through traffic on Bloor is now cycle traffic.\nIf you just look, it doesn't seem so because cycling is so much more efficient than driving, that it appears that there are very little cyclists. That's because cars take up so much more space.\nIf the province forces the city to remove the Bloor bike lanes, it will not improve traffic. It will make it worse. Maybe not all of cycling traffic that goes through bloor will continue cycling there, but many will. The result will be mixed traffic where drivers will have to contend with cyclists in a more direct way. This will be even worse during non-rush our time when the cur lanes will become parking. On top of this not solving congestion, it will also make our roads far less safe. The city saw a 60% reduction in vehicle\/cycling\/pedestrian altercations after the installation of the bloor bike lanes. The province is literally proposing more injury and death to falsely claim traffic congestion will improve.\nThe worst part is that this is all a distraction. It's a distraction from the province bypassing environmental protections to build a highway nobody wants except for the developer donors to the conservative party. Ripping up prime farmland to increase urban sprawl, pollution and degradation of our green spaces. Ultimately increasing traffic as the people living in these communities have to drive, putting further pressure on our other highways instead of reducing them.\nOverall this bill will do the exact opposite of what it claims. It will put more drivers on our roads, remove safety and increase gridlock and overall traffic. Not reduce it.\n",

I believe that decisions regarding local transportation management should be left to muncipalities, and that the province is significantly overstepping its bounds by trying to insert itself on these matters.\nI also fundamentally disagree with the reasoning behind this act. It is well known in the transportation planning industry that increasing road capacity is not a long-term solution for reducing congestion due to induced demand. Additionally, driving is a highly space-inefficient method of travel, particularly since drivers often travel as single occupants and do not have any passengers. Therefore, even if current road capacity were preserved, population growth would still result in increased congestion if people continue to choose driving as their primary - or only - mode of travel. Reducing or eliminating bike infrastructure will NOT reduce gridlock or save Ontarians' time - rather, providing more efficient alternatives to travel is the only long-term solution. Bicycle infrastructure is essential to making sure people have adequate alternatives.\nIf the claim is that bicycle infrastructure should not be built because it will be underused, this claim ignores the fact that bicycle infrastructure, like any transportation infrastructure, is less effective if provided discontinuously rather than as a continuous connected network. This can only be achieved by gradually expanding infrastructure over time, not by adding roadblocks to its construction. This also means that the future potential usage of cycling infrastructure cannot be accurately assessed based on existing cycling demand; exising cycling demand will necessarily be underrepresentative of potential future demand because people will be less inclined to cycle where they feel unsafe or where there is no dedicated infrastructure for them to use. This also means that the suggestion to only build cycling infrastructure on side streets is inadequate because this is unlikely to provide a sufficiently connected network to serve all the destinations people may want to cycle too, which would again result in low usage.\nFinally, providing dedicated transportation infrastructure for non-auto modes is absolutely essential for safety. Cyclists and pedestrians are at high risk of injury or death in vehicle collisions; failing to provide dedicated infrastructure increases the risk that they will suffer such collisions. Failing to provide adequate infrastructure is therefore a direct threat to people's safety. By trying to stifle the development of protected cycling infrastructure, this provincial government is stating that they do not care about the lives of anyone outside of a car, and do not respect anyone's choice to travel by any mode other than driving.\nAs a someone who lives and works in downtown Toronto and has made significant use of the available cycling infrastructure, such as the bike lanes on Yonge, University, St. George, Bloor, and Sherbourne, I strongly hope that the province will amend this act and continue to allow muncipalities to make their own decisions regarding how to build a transportation network that is built for long-term sustainability, that provides users with safe and convenient choices for getting around, and that prioritizes users' health, safety, and lives.\n",

Remove them, and more Ontarians die.\nRemoving bike lanes won't make commutes any faster - the outside lane on pretty much every street in Toronto is used for parking. People can't drive through parked cars. Want to create an additional driving lane? Ban on-street parking on major streets.\nIf y'all were actually serious about reducing gridlock, you'd be expanding cycling infrastructure, not removing it. More people choosing bikes to get around means fewer cars on the roads. More people choose to ride a bike when there is the infrastructure to safely ride them.\nAs for Ford's whole, \"bike lanes should be on side streets\" shtick, side streets have only one lane in each direction. There's no space to add bike lanes to them. (And no, sharrows aren't the same as bike lanes.) All of the bike racks are on major streets, not side streets.\nI thought Conservatives were supposed to be the party of fiscal responsibility. But here you are, planning to waste taxpayer money to remove things that are benefitting Torontonians. Whose budget will the removal come out of - Toronto's, or Ontario's? Are you planning to give Toronto back the money that it paid to install them? Will the province be paying to build new ones on side streets? Businesses saw an increase in customers after bike lanes were installed. Is Ontario planning to reimburse businesses for the sales that will be lost by removing them?\nThe fact that three bike lanes have been slated for removal before there are any criteria for deciding whether or not a bike lane should be removed makes it pretty obvious that this is just another one of Ford's attempts to punish Toronto for rejecting him. Safety for cyclists needs to come before stroking Ford's ego. Leave the bike lanes alone, and stop trying to micromanage municipalities.\n",

Reduce the number of people in cars. That's it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by wasting billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be driving THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they don't have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs.

As an Ontarian, I am dismayed at the poor governance exhibited here.\nFirst, this bill is a mess in contents and scope. Is this bill about streamlining highway construction? Or increasing bureaucracy for city planning? There\u2019s a lack of cohesion and strategy here that reveals weak policy. There\u2019s plans to overstep municipal street planning. There\u2019s a proposed elimination of checks and balances in the development of Highway 413. There\u2019s intented forced removal of already constructed urban projects in the city of Toronto. There are major negative implications here on citizen safety and civic trust in our provincial transportation planning.\nSecond, I\u2019ll speak to the issue of cycling infrastructure. There is a level of unwarranted focus on cyclists in this bill that feels targeted with how small the scale of cycling lanes is in this province. The strategic removal of heavily used lanes on main streets in Toronto can only be viewed as politically motivated by MPPs who commute to Queen\u2019s Park by car. This would be a gross misuse of legislative processes for personal convenience.\nIn the debates, the members in favour of the bill bring forward only the perceived inconveniences experienced by a handful of their constituents as evidence for forced cycling infrastructure removal. This isn\u2019t where MPPs should be focusing their attention, on the whims of a disgruntled few with time to make calls and send emails. They should focus on the safety and mobility freedoms of ALL their constituents, including youth who cycle to school, couriers who deliver by bike, and others who rely on bike lanes every day for safe commutes and recreation.\nThose against permanent separated cycling infrastructure seem to view cyclists as some intangible \u201cother\u201d distinct from the rest of their community. No one advocates for the narrowing or removal of sidewalks in favour of additional lanes of car traffic. No one shrugs and says \u201cyou walk on the streets at your own risk\u201d to pedestrians who have concerns where sidewalks are missing or unsafe. We see news every week about cyclists who are injured and killed in mixed traffic and unsafe intersections in this province, and still this lack of care persists. Why the neglect for the public safety of cyclists? To anti-bike lane advocates: cyclists are not phantoms that materialize out of nowhere to inconvenience you. These are your neighbours, your friends, your colleagues, and your children going about their daily lives that you hold so much frustration and anger for. To MPPs in favour of Bill 212: these are your constituents you disregard, whose public safety you are accountable for.\nAssuming the intentions of the bill in good faith - what would it take to improve traffic in Ontario\u2019s cities? Traffic IS CARS. There is no other way to spin this. A focus on adding car lanes and highways can only increase the volume of traffic concentrated in cities, and increasing cyclists and transit users can only decrease the amount of cars on the road. The members in opposition to the bill bring up a wealth of other opportunities for transportation improvement across the province in the debates. Let\u2019s redirect traffic to the existing underused Highway 407. Incentivize employers to bring back pandemic-era work from home policies. Get people out of single occupancy cars and onto transit. Use those overextended provincial powers to finish the ongoing Metrolinx projects and increase capacity and frequency for regional commuter transit options.\nThere are better options than Bill 212, which presents no solutions for Ontario, only a politically-motivated onslaught against cyclists as a distraction for the government\u2019s shady intentions for highway development and mismanagement of provincial transit projects. Where\u2019s the forward-thinking? The evidence-based policy making? We expect better from our Minister of Transportation, our MPPs and our Premier.\n",

Removing or restricting bike lanes leads to more bikes sharing the road with cars, which is more dangerous and slows the flow of traffic.\n2. Commuting by bike instead of car means one less car on the road, which improves traffic for those who choose to or need to drive.\n3. Bike lanes, especially with physical barriers, are very safe. There have already been 6 bicyclist deaths this year, which is 6 too many.\n4. Provincial approval for municipally led bike-lane projects add unnecessary red tape, which is antithetical to the provincial government\u2019s agenda. Has Mike Harris Jr., Minister of Red-Tape Reduction, weighed in on this plan?\n5. Ripping up established bike lanes is a waste of money. Time and again studies have shown adding car lanes is not a universal fix for congestion.\n6. The existence of bike lanes is not a war on cars. I agree that we need a balanced approach that considers cars, bikes and pedestrians. There will always be people who rely on driving as a primary means of getting around urban spaces. However, I fail to see how such a restrictive plan, one that would pause or even undo Ottawa\u2019s progress in building safe and reliable biking infrastructure, is fair to cyclists. All of the arguments against bike lanes are based on shoddy anecdotal evidence without consideration for data on how they benefit motorists and cyclists alike.\n",

        "comment":"I strongly oppose this bill for the following reasons:\n1. Cost of implementation and burden on the government. This bill would increase bureaucracy and red tape by requiring public servants to administer, thus increasing costs to taxpayers. In addition, removing existing bike lanes would be a further cost to taxpayers at a time when we should be focusing precious tax dollars on things like health care (which is sorely underfunded in this province) and infrastructure that would actually reduce traffic, like transit projects.\n2. Safety. Removing existing separated bike lanes would increase the number of cyclist deaths. They have been proven to reduce fatalities so this is only going to cause more unnecessary deaths. At least 5 cyclists in Toronto have died this year, a number that has increased from last year and will only continue increasing if we move forward with this bill.\n3. Essential infrastructure. As a cyclist, I use bike lanes every day in the same way that, as a driver, I use roads and as a pedestrian, I use sidewalks. No one would ever suggest removing roads or sidewalks as these are considered essential for mobility, so why are we considering removing bike lanes? What makes them less essential?\n4. Predictability. Dedicated bike lanes provide predictability and structure for all road users. It does not make sense having slow moving vehicles like bikes sharing road space with cars that move much faster. As a driver, it makes things simpler knowing that I won\u2019t need to interact with a cyclist on a busy street.\n5. Not a provincial responsibility. Local governments know their communities best and should be empowered to make decisions that best fit their communities in consultation with their residents.\n",

        "comment":"The Fallacy of Removing Bike Lanes to Reduce Traffic\nIn urban planning debates, the issue of bike lanes often stirs passionate opinions, particularly when it comes to their perceived impact on traffic congestion. Some argue that removing bike lanes can alleviate traffic by freeing up road space for cars. However, this notion overlooks several key factors that demonstrate why eliminating bike lanes is unlikely to reduce traffic and may even exacerbate the problem.\nEncouraging Alternative Transportation\nFirst and foremost, bike lanes play a crucial role in promoting alternative modes of transportation. When cities invest in dedicated bike infrastructure, they encourage more people to consider cycling as a viable option for commuting. Research shows that when safe bike lanes are available, cycling rates increase, which can lead to fewer cars on the road. Removing these lanes would likely discourage cycling, resulting in more cars returning to the streets, thereby increasing overall traffic congestion.\nSafety and Traffic Flow\nMoreover, bike lanes contribute to safer roadways for all users. Studies have demonstrated that well-designed bike lanes reduce the likelihood of accidents involving cyclists and motorists. Safer roads encourage more people to ride bikes, which can reduce the number of cars on the road. Conversely, the removal of bike lanes can lead to an increase in accidents and conflicts between vehicles and cyclists, creating a less efficient traffic flow. A chaotic traffic environment tends to slow down overall vehicle movement, counteracting any perceived benefits of increased road space.\nThe Reality of Urban Traffic Patterns\nAdditionally, urban traffic patterns are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the availability of bike lanes. These factors include public transportation options, population density, and the availability of parking. Simply removing bike lanes does not address the root causes of congestion, such as the growing number of vehicles on the road due to population growth and urban sprawl. In many cases, reducing the number of bike lanes can lead to a perception that cycling is less safe and feasible, which may push commuters back into their cars, further exacerbating traffic issues.\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations\nFrom an environmental perspective, removing bike lanes is counterproductive. Increased reliance on automobiles leads to higher emissions and contributes to air pollution, negatively impacting public health. Cities that prioritize cycling as a legitimate form of transportation can reduce their carbon footprint, improve air quality, and promote healthier lifestyles. This aligns with broader goals of sustainability and livability in urban areas.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the idea that ripping out bike lanes will reduce traffic is a misconception rooted in a simplistic understanding of urban mobility. Rather than alleviating congestion, the removal of bike lanes can discourage cycling, create unsafe road conditions, and fail to address the underlying factors contributing to traffic issues. For cities aiming to manage traffic effectively, investing in comprehensive transportation solutions that include bike lanes is essential. By fostering a multi-modal approach to transportation, cities can create more efficient, safer, and environmentally friendly urban environments.\n",

        "comment":"As a car commuter, I am deeply opposed to this proposed bill. This bill would make commuting worse given that it would remove viable alternatives for people to use instead of driving, which will induce more demand for car travel and lead to higher congestion and travel time, the opposite of what this bill intends to achieve.\nBy limiting or outright removing the limited bike infrastructure that exists today, this bill has the potential to undo much of the progress that Ontario has done to increase mobility and sustainable transport from the last several years.\nI advocate that more bike lanes should be built, not removing them. Cyclists should be able to safely travel to their destinations away from car travel while remaining on main roads. Especially as a driver, I prefer for cyclist to be removed from traffic given that accidents involving cars and cyclist can often lead to unnecessary fatalities.\nGiving people access to safe bike lanes to use is not only beneficial environmentally but also helps families save money as a cheaper means of transportation and provides greater mobility to people with disabilities. This government should seek to give more options to people commuting to work, school and shopping, not lock them into only a single viable means of transportation.\nWhile some people may argue that the bike lanes are underused, I believe that that is mainly due to the fact that our bike networks are in their infancy and ridership will continue to grow as complete, car separated bike networks begin to be accessible to a larger population as opposed to the patchwork of unconnected and unprotected painted bike lanes we have currently.\nI would invite members of the legislated assembly to try biking on any major road to understand why so few people choose to cycle there due to safety concerns.\nIn summary, I am opposed to this proposed bill as this would increase red tape for municipalities, decrease the safety of cyclists on our roads, increase congestion and travel times for the majority of Ontario and be a step back for the progress we need to make towards reducing our environmental impact.\n",

Without a car, we depend on bike lanes as an efficient and safe way to reach our essential roles at work.\nRemoving key bike lanes on main routes like Bloor, Yonge, and University will push cyclists into shared lanes with cars, which could inadvertently create more congestion and risk for everyone on the road. Imagine the frustration of driving behind a cyclist on a backed up University Ave, forced to slow down or navigate around them\u2014this situation increases delays and the risk of accidents. Mixing bike and car traffic, rather than separating them, could ultimately work against efforts to reduce congestion by removing a proven, efficient alternative for thousands of city commuters.\nEnsuring that bike lanes are available for those who depend on them allows roads to operate more smoothly, with safer, separated routes that keep everyone moving.

        "comment":"I strongly oppose this bill. This bill does not even distinguish between main roads and side streets and doesn\u2019t take cyclists into consideration. Why would we reverse the progress we made and waste tax payer dollars ripping out bike lanes that we just spent money on to build how is this an effective use of our time and resources? Why does this bill only focus on saving a couple minutes of commute time for drivers but not for cyclists? Cyclists pay taxes just like motorists do should they not have bike infrastructure like cars do? Does the safety and convenience of cyclists and\/or students and kids who would like to be able to safely bike to school or work not matter? I think that it is unfair that this governments sole focus is on drivers over everybody else especially at a time when things are so expensive and not everyone can afford to drive everywhere. I would also argue that reversing progress made on our bike lanes network only hurts congestion. More bike lanes and transportation options means more people cycling and taking public transit means less people in cars and on the road. The city of Toronto\u2019s population is expected to grow dramatically in the coming years and those people will need bike infrastructure in order to get from a to b because we can\u2019t have a growing population of only drivers it\u2019s unsustainable. Our roads can only move so many people and the more people who choose to drive because they can\u2019t feasibly bike to where they need to go the more traffic we will have. We need to show people there are other options and encourage them to use them, this is done successfully all over Europe where plenty of people bike daily year-round sun or snow. There is a reason why so many European cities are where people want to live and travel to and if they can do it we can do it. To summarize this long rant, this city needs to be more livable, and bike lanes help to make that happen. Cycling is cheaper, better for the environment, quieter, and make people safer, happier, and healthier leave our bike lanes alone if anything we should be expanding them across the city in areas where people don\u2019t have access to them.\n",

        "comment":"I am deeply concerned about the proposed bill. As a non-cyclist, I find the current infrastructure unsafe, particularly due to the absence of a continuous bike network that is fully separated from vehicle lanes. For many years, I relied on the TTC for my daily commute, but I recently transitioned to driving because the streetcar service became increasingly unreliable, often taking 1 to 1.5 hours to travel from The Beaches to work on the west side of downtown.\nWhile I support the creation of more bike lanes, I strongly oppose the idea of sharing the road with bicycles. This setup jeopardizes the safety of both cyclists and drivers. I believe it\u2019s crucial to have designated lanes for vehicles and a separate lane for bikes. This would create a safer environment for everyone involved, rather than forcing us to navigate in a shared lane, which is inherently risky.\nI do not consider bicycles as the primary source of traffic congestion in this city. Instead, I attribute much of the congestion to poor scheduling and management of construction projects, along with insufficient funding for reliable public transportation. Taking weeks to months to install infrastructure on our roads to then dismantle the same infrastructure that aids in reducing traffic delays only exacerbates these problems, leading to greater frustration and complications for all road users.\nI maintain a neutral political stance and have voted for all three major political parties throughout my life. However, I want to be clear: if this bill is passed, I will not support the Conservative Party in future elections. This issue affects us all, and we deserve a transportation solution that prioritizes safety and efficiency.\n",

An example: the Annex BIA wants them to stay. Some of these bike lanes are good for business. Do you hear that, Mr. Ford? Good for Business.

        "comment":"There is so much I feel is a step backwards with how the government is approaching this bill so I am going to have to approach it in bullet points working my way through the proposal.\nNew highways aren't the answer to getting people and goods out of gridlock. Especially when there is an almost entirely empty highway sitting there that could be better utilized today.\nAccidents won't be relieved with more highways. They actually just add to more places accidents could happen, and more, faster traffic to cause more accidents.\nBroadband projects is a plus, we do need more reliable internet. Accessing more communities with reliable internet can also open up more work from home options, which will help reduce congestion.\nHighway 413 is not needed as the 407 is already available. It will only open up more valuable green land to be paved over.\nExpediting these projects is wrong, especially when it goes against legislature that has been previously enacted for a reason. Safety is one factor here that is going to be overlooked. The environment is another and arguably one of the most important. Once these environmental lands are gone, we can not go back and return them to how they were if we realize we were wrong. Proper consultation needs to be done and accepted if it says these projects should not go forward or should be modified. If the government just bulldozes ahead with these pet projects without a care for the environment they are sending a message that they don't care about the future of Ontarians. The fact that the proposed bill only really mentions environmental protection at the end comes across like a footnote. The fact it mainly seems to mention environmental impacts in regards to disturbances to local residents with noise is especially concerning.\nThe rights of the people of Ontario must also be retained. There is a reason the laws allow for appeals to judges regarding expropriation of land. Those laws must remain intact. The highways will not be built over night. Landowners must be allowed the time to have their voices heard if their land is going to be taken.\nThe federal government has just announced plans for a highspeed train to run essentially through most of this gridlock. The provincial government can do so much more to ease gridlock, while paving over far less land by expanding upon this. Put in more train lines, expand the usage of public transit, encourage more work from home options. These are all better ways to reduce gridlock while also preserving our future.\n",

It's unfair to me and my fellow cyclists that we must wonder whether or not I will return safely to my family. If you want to fix congestion, fix the way that we conduct construction and the people who actually congest the roads. And the CafeTO program that still takes up an entire chunk of all the real estate on a lot of streets. Pape and Danforth, for example, has construction dump trucks parked on every street. Not just danforth, but residential side streets as well and the CafeTO program takes up the entire area where people used to park. If you think congestion is bad now, wait until all of the buildings start going up at the same time, which is what we're looking at doing due to the lack of housing that we have in the city when it's worse then and there's no bike lanes What will you blame? I hope and pray that 1 day there are politicians who actually stand up for the people instead of selling Green Belt land to their friends and looking after their own best interest, instead of the people who hired them to look after their best interest.\n",

As an Ontario resident, I worry that this bill blatantly counteracts the goal of making Ontario cities safer, more vibrant and more liveable for residents. The evidence is clear, removing cycling infrastructure will not only increase car traffic but render our roads much less safe for bike commuters, families, and cyclists alike.\nOn a personal note, a family member of mine was recently hit by a car in tragic accident in Ontario. The incident took place at very unsafe juncture in the road and could have been avoided if safer cycling infrastructure was in place. My family member, at a young age, has been undergoing intensive hospital care. She now faces the prospect of serious health impairments for the rest of her life, or devastatingly, her life might end in the prime of her youth. We need safe cycling options in our province. Removing cycling infrastructure will not remove cyclist from our roads, instead it will lead to more tragic deaths and injuries. Ontario cyclists are taxpayers, we are voters, and we deserve access to safe cycling infrastructure.\nThank you for your consideration regarding this important issue.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed removal of bike infrastructure along University, Bloor, and Yonge in Toronto seems to be an illogical one. University in particular is still able to have 2-3 lanes of car traffic despite the bike lanes that Ford deems as intrusive to cars. I struggle to understand the desire to remove a secondary transportation option along a major street, especially when the infrastructure for it is improving and cars still have room to operate along it. The city should seek to promote options for transportation, not funnel everyone into cars.\nAdditionally Ford's proposal suggests that because there are a lower number of cyclists than drivers, we should remove cycling infrastructure and seek to halt further development. I find this reasoning to be circular. It doesn't necessarily follow that because we have low ridership comparative to cars there is no demand for better cycling infrastructure. In fact I believe that the opposite is true. The reason cycling ridership is lower than cars is because car infrastructure vastly outnumbers bike infrastructure. The city has been designed specifically to funnel as many cars as possible through it. The bike infrastructure we do have is unreliable and sparse, often ending abruptly and shooting cyclists out onto a busy street full of cars with no protective barrier to separate them. This leads to a feeling of uncertainty when cycling in the city. I would be much more inclined to ride a bike downtown if I knew that the routes I was taking were grade separated from car traffic, and would get me to my destination without hurling me into multiple lanes of car traffic. No one wants to cycle along the shoulder of a busy street. Take the new development in the port lands for example. I usually use the subway or walk downtown, but the cycling infrastructure near the port lands engenders a feeling of safety and ease of navigation that has led to me cycling through the area on a number of occasions. If more places in the city were properly outfitted with safe cycling infrastructure I believe the ridership would increase dramatically. Low ridership does not equal low demand, it is indicative of the inadequacies present in the current infrastructure.\n",

        "comment":"I was born and raised in rural Ontario, where cars are a necessity of life because of long distances and a lack of alternatives. I've since lived in Switzerland, where you can travel the entire country (even to far-flung mountain villages) by transit and bike. I've traveled throughout Europe and Asia, where people have incredible choices and flexibility in how they move around. I now live and work in Toronto - the best place in the province for mobility choice and affordability. I have thus seen how poor policy has made cars the only option, while good policy has improved the quality of life of me and my community.\nThis bill will be disastrous to consumer choice, climate goals, safety, efficiency, and the province's reputation. I and most of my community in Toronto do not own cars, nor should we need to. They are expensive too own, maintain, fuel, and find parking for. The city is growing rapidly, and there simply is not enough room for everyone to drive. We use transit often, but it can only accomplish so much - the TTC goes down because of a lack of funding, routes are not comprehensive, and it can be slow for a variety of reasons. Cycling is consistently the fastest, healthiest, and cheapest way to get around the city. Just look at BikeShare Toronto's incredible growth. People enjoy and want to cycle, full stop. And we need to be safe. In this bill, the province will be publicly saying that the lives of cyclists matter less, that we are disposable. I am a Registered Nurse working in health policy and administration. The health harms to encouraging driving (stress, sitting, pollution) and increasing risks to cyclists (concussions, fractures) will be felt in our health system. Communities that cycle are simply safer and healthier. The arguments citing bike lanes worsening driving times, harming local business, and being underutilized are not grounded in evidence. I and many of my loved ones cycle for the vast majority of our trips - for work, errands, leisure. The adage goes, 'if you build it, they will come', i.e., induced demand. Cycling is growing rapidly in Toronto. Removing established bike lanes and limiting future development will not get rid of existing cyclists. We will now be weaving in and out of traffic, getting into altercations, slowing down actual driving lanes. An actual solution to improving driving times? Properly funding transit and removing on-street parking. Why is a bike lane that moves thousands of people a day worth less than an entire lane blocked my parked cars?\nFor our collective benefit, please rip up this bill and partner with us on actual solutions. Implementing this bill would make Ontario a laughing stock in the developed world, a place people don't want to visit or enjoy. We can do so much better than this silly culture war. Choose choice, safety, and efficiency. Please, for the sake of me and my loved ones.\n",

        "comment":"I am an avid cyclist who owns properties both in and outside of the city. My recommendation is based on both driving and cycling throughout Toronto.\nWhile I see the need for cycling infrastructure I do believe it can be approached differently to better accommodate both drivers and cyclists by implementing the following.\n-reduce sidewalk width and minimize lane width in order to allow a 3ft space with a simple painted line to act as designated bike lane while not compromising the flow of traffic\n-reduce implementation cost by not installing cycling specific traffic lights as these also make it more confusing for drivers, slowing down traffic and potentially contributing to more accidents\nThe addition of cycling infrastructure to a densely populated city is critical to provide options for people to commute to school and work as well as day to day interactions with businesses. (Groceries, health appointments, etc.)\nIt is possible to have cycling and vehicle infrastructure coexist. We as Torontonians need to agree on solutions that fit our city\u2019s unique needs. We may not be able to mirror other existing infrastructures in other countries but I believe a functional bike lane can be achieved with a minimum requirement of 3ft with a painted line.\n",

        "comment":"Hello,\nI am a biker, walker, driver, and public transportation user in the GTA.\nThe provincial government should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to provide meaningful transportation options. Removing bike lanes that are safe, and (in some cases) newly constructed, along some of these arterial roads is a monumental waste of money, time, and human power.\nI use bike lanes, sidewalks, streets, and public transportation options every single day, and consider them absolutely essential transportation options. Most of the time, if it is a viable option for me, I walk, bike, or take public transport in the city; these are faster, healthier, cheaper, and make it much easier to get around. Because of meaningful infrastructure, these are options for me; the removal of bike lanes will make these decisions much harder, more complicated, more expensive, and less efficient.\nWe need to think about safety and providing options for all users of the road; being a biker on city streets, I fear for my safety especially when I am riding without bike infrastructure.\nWhen I drive or walk, I would much rather that cyclists have their own bike lane. At present, when traveling around Toronto, I often see cyclists (especially delivery drivers) who choose to ride on the sidewalks rather than risk their own safety on the road with no designated lanes. This is a rational choice for them, and I would probably do the same if I were in their position. Additionally, many cyclists do not know how to \"take the lane\" and end up squeezing to the far right on unprotected streets, risking their own safety. Maintaining meaningful bike infrastructure along key arterial routes solves this problem at many levels. For an analysis of the factors that influence route calculations made by real bikers in the city of Toronto, see Li (2017): \"Cycling in Toronto: Route Choice Behavior and Implications to Infrastructure Planning.\"\nBike lanes support transit options by providing meaningful links to and between stations. This will further help reduce car traffic and gridlock. Taking these out will result in more of the same -- many people who have been in Toronto for years have noted that bumper to bumper traffic has always been a problem in the city, even before bike lanes. By keeping the bike lanes, I, and thousands of other Torontonians, will choose to bike over to drive. Study after study demonstrate that bike lanes not only functionally reduce traffic, but are also good for business. It is a simple calculation: fewer cars on the road, less congestion; the easier it is to pop into a store or restaurant because of being on foot or bike, the better it is for local businesses.\nI support safe infrastructure around the city, and safe bike infrastructure is part of this. These proposals will make it worse for everyone, and less safe for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers.\nFor these reasons, and many others, is my sincere hope that Bill 212 is not successful.\nThank you.\n",

It introduces more red-tape and more government and strips powers away from our cities, who are best placed to make decisions about their own streets. Evidently, the party of small government is not very much for small governments when it suits some agenda of theirs.\nTo decrease traffic at a point of saturation we need to offer alternatives to cars, and making biking less accessible will increase the amount of cars. I have not seen any evidence that the bike lanes cause traffic or where their removal has decreased traffic. In fact, roads will become even more multi-use as well and bikes will directly slow down cars instead of having their own dedicated paths.\nGrade separated bike paths also improves safety. No one is saying that biking is safe, but this law will make it even less safe to bike in our streets. Why do cyclists safety not matter to the government?\nThis law is setting Ontario back decades. We need to foster a variety of safe commuting and transit options and not take them away due to the vanity of our politicians. Ontario is failing its citizens with this law.\n",

The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governance trying increase transportation options. I use bike lanes every day as my primary means of transportaion and are essential to my daily life. I have watched the bike lanes on bloor be build up and improved over the last 6 years of my living on the Danforth and have felt the improvement in my quality of life. The city has invested millions of dollars to improve Toronto's transportation network and this bill would have it torn up, spending even more tax payer dollars to undo the progress we've made. We need to think about guaranteeing safety for vulnerable road users instead of just maximizing the number of cars you can fit on a road. Removing bike lanes to add more space for cars will not reduce congestion as seen in this research paper by Rand Europe which I have attatched below.\nIf you build bike lanes, more people will bike. If you build car lanes, more people will drive and congestion will remain the same. Toronto is a big city and is growing bigger. Cars are simply not an effective or efficient way to move around such large numbers of people in an city of this size. We need to invest more money in public transportation and bicycle lanes, not rip them up.

I have used and had to rely on many forms of transportation to make my way around the city; including, by car, car-share, bus, LRT, bike, and on foot \u2013 or some sort of combination of them.\nI think often about making transportation better, not only for myself, but for everyone in the city. This requires that we prioritize safety, accessibility, efficiency\/timeliness of travel, and the environment. There is also a need to recognize the limitations \u2013 primarily being that an infinite number of roads and\/or addition of lanes on any highway, simply does not exist.\nI have read about this subject quite a lot, and have talked about it with friends\/family\/community\/etc. The thing that comes up the most is an emphasis on multi-modal transportation, and maximizing the use of each of these modes. This means investing in walking and biking infrastructure (i.e. bike lanes, shared use paths, bike parking, etc), that allows people traveling in this way to get where they need to go safely and efficiently. It also means leveraging\/investing in public transit, like buses\/subways\/light rail\/para-transpo\/etc., to move large numbers of people across the city. Driving by car should become something used for absolutely necessary trips only (i.e. deliveries to businesses), or used in the absence of other options (i.e. rural-to-rural).\nIt really saddens me to see the province talk about the removal and disinvestment of bike lanes and other forms of active transportation. Not only will this not address concerns of timeliness and safety of commutes, but it will worsen them. Because, there will be the people who will still bike with or without any sort of bike lanes, either because they can't afford alternatives or they simply enjoy to bike \u2013 either way, they will experience higher risk to their safety as a result of a change of this nature. And the people who currently bike, but decide to change their mode of transportation (likely to driving), means there's increased volume and pressure on an already inefficient system. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not reduce bike lanes, or destroy existing ones \u2013 it will be costly to the province, cost people their safety, and provide no relief to car drivers.\nI would also really like to see greater investment and respect be paid to the importance of public transportation. I think it is easy (or convenient) to view it as simply an \"option\" for people to commute to work this way \u2013 but public transit is so much more than this. It is an essential mode of transportation, that provides anyone access to the city for various kinds of trips. For example, anyone who's unable to drive themselves (i.e. youth, elderly, disabled, etc) can independently get around this way. Or for folks who are technically able to drive, but do not have access to a car (i.e. for financial reasons, or maybe they don't have access to parking etc.), they rely on public transit for all trips. And anyone who's had to take public transit in Ontario is familiar with the frustrations and the struggle of it lacking prioritization and funding from the province. Please invest in public transportation. Please view it as a serious and viable solution for cities across the province. Please do not limit the access of citizens to their city!\nI am very confused and exhausted that solutions for road congestion and traffic (etc.) is always more roads\/road-widening. I have found that it never goes further than this. Why not have more paid parking (see book \"High Cost of Free Parking\") to disincentivize driving, or get people to consider carpooling? Why not build nicer and more convenient carpooling\/park and ride infrastructure to increase the efficiency of one car driving on the road (have multiple people in the car vs just one). Why not encourage people and businesses to allow people to work from home, and decrease reliance on long commutes into the city for work \u2013 while increasing their investment and participation in their community. If you're going to make us prove to the province why active transportation or public transit are worthy and worthwhile modes again and again, why is it that driving is just accepted as is?\nI need a result from this that is not an approach of just \"build more roads\". Where, once implemented, the province can show that they've tried, but in reality, we just keep doing the same thing repeatedly...hoping for a different result. Where is the gusto for experimentation? I often wonder, what is the end goal of more and more and more roads \u2013 where does it end, and where are people left? Are we just going to start building multi-level roads \u2013 is Google maps going to say \"the fastest route is  the 5th floor of the 401\"? This is a bit extreme, but maybe it's not.\n(tone: sincere)\nLastly, a note for the dearest Ontario public servant(s) reviewing these consultation comments: thank you for your work and dedication to this review. I hope the voices of Ontarians will be heard, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide input.\n",

The removal of safe cycling infrastructure will do a disservice to each community impacted - moreso that of downtown Toronto where safe cycle networks are an asset, relied on and appreciated by all including motorists, cyclist and pedestrians. I am all three of these, and can speak on behalf of each of these demographics, as can countless others. First - as a motorist, cycle networks that are clearly demarcated (and those that are fully separated) make me a more comfortable driver as cyclists are provided a degree of separation and are therefore more predictable and visible to motorists. We can co-exist safely on the roadway with safe cycling infrastructure which is the ultimate goal. Also, in all of my decades as a driver I have never ONCE looked to bike lanes as the reason for congestion and placed my blame on them. The removal of bike lanes will not magically ease traffic congestion. You need to find another scapegoat because bike lanes are not the cause. If anything, the removal of on street parking on busy roadways would be a more appropriate place to start.\nSecond - as a cyclist, I am appreciative of the safe cycling networks that exist. I feel safer in protected bike lanes and can get to my destination faster. The benefits of cycling are boundless, and my commute by bike has relieved so much stress and saved me so much time as compared to driving or taking transit. I feel that I am doing better for myself and for the environment, and I wish that these benefits were more highly discussed to encourage more cycling. This mode of transportation only has net benefits and I don't think that demonizing bike lanes is effective. The removal of cycling infrastructure is only doing a disservice and I think will be a grave mistake. As more people explore cycling as a legitimate mode of transportation, we ease the woes of car congestion as that is one more vehicle off the road. Is this not one of the very things you are hoping to achieve? Encouraging safe cycling and expanding safe networks will only pay dividends to easing traffic congestion.\nAs a pedestrian, we have dedicated sidewalks for foot traffic. How are sidewalks any different than bike lanes? Each method of transport should and deserves to have a dedicated space to move about safely. Full stop. Cars have roads, bikes have cycle networks, and pedestrians have sidewalks.\nThe provincial overreach into municipal matters will not benefit the province of Ontario whatsoever.

        "comment":"I would like to voice, in the strongest possible terms, my opposition to this bill.\nFirstly, this bill adds unnecessary bureaucracy and \u201cred tape\u201d to a job that is, ultimately, up to municipalities. Cities know their transportation networks and needs best; not the province. Adding a higher-tier of decision making to this process undermines my faith in a government that\u2019s stated values are austerity and \u201csmall government.\u201d\nSecondly, bike lanes are essential transportation infrastructure like sidewalks and roads. They guarantee a basic standard of traffic flow, safety, and navigation for road users outside of a car. This point is twofold: when I drive, especially on main roads, I would much rather cyclists be out of my way in their own bike lanes wherein I do not have to worry about passing or yielding to them. Getting rid of lanes on streets like Yonge, University, and Bloor will not stop cyclists from biking on them; it will only make their cycle commute (and just as well a drivers\u2019 commute) more treacherous.\nThirdly, bike lanes on main roads support the massive transit investments that our province has been making recently. From the TTC, GO Transit, the ION LRT and the O-Train, rail expansions are already underway. Cycling infrastructure on main roads makes stations more accessible, boosting farebox revenues and increasing ridership; supporting and making back the province\u2019s worthy investments into these systems.\nFinally, myself and a growing number of people across this province cycle on a daily basis. Historically and statistically, bike lanes on main roads which take away a lane of vehicle traffic do not increase car congestion but in fact help to alleviate it. Detouring cyclists down winding side roads, put simply, is not enough to promote cycling as a viable commute option. Having the bike lanes on main roads cuts cycle commutes and puts the lanes where people want and need to go; therefore making cycling a compelling option. More cyclists means less drivers; less drivers means easing car congestion. The opposite is also true: if another vehicle lane of traffic is introduced, it ultimately creates more space for cars which will inevitably be filled due to inducing traffic demand (Rand Europe, CIVITAS, Le Parisien). The Premier and Transportation Minister\u2019s comments that this plan will reduce gridlock, which were made without credible sources, feel anecdotal at best and like misinformation at worst.\nIn conclusion, I strongly oppose this bill due to its adding of increased bureaucracy to municipal processes, its taking away of an essential road safety measure, its counter-productive nature with regard to current provincial transit investments, and finally, because it, in fact, does not \"reduce gridlock\" and \"save time;\" it very much serves to do the opposite.\n",

The bicycle network in Toronto is only beginning to develop downtown and this attack on vital infrastructure is dangerous, irresponsible and pointless other than to conjure up sentiment from suburban voters in the lead up to election season.\nMy life will be at risk each time I bicycle downtown to my workplace as an essential worker. This legislation will encourage road users to drop their bicycles and further clog up Toronto roads with cars. Peer reviewed literature indisputably indicates that protected bike lanes make roads safer for drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and have negligible influence on commute times.\nI gravely caution the MPs reviewing this bill to consider the potential erosion of Toronto\u2019s urban fabric with passing this bill. It is a promise to make cycling again mortally dangerous for road users by removing critical safety infrastructure to encourage faster driving, pollution, and a sedentary lifestyle for Toronto\u2019s population. Stop the overreach and stay in your lane. Every other metropolis is embracing cycling as part of their urbanist development. Toronto will be considered a backwards destination\u2026 a city for cars, not for people. Simply say no to road deaths.\n",

        "comment":"I strongly oppose Bill 212. It represents a massive overreach of the provincial government's power. The province should not be stepping in and blocking construction of or removing bike lanes in cities, as they are valuable transportation infrastructure. Bicycle lanes save lives, help businesses, and provide residents with reliable transportation options. This bill would be a massive step backwards for making transportation efficient and reliable, because more bicycle infrastructure ultimately means more people will opt to bike rather than drive, in turn reducing congestion on roads. It simply doesn't make sense for the provincial government to be wasting time and taxpayer money meddling in municipal infrastructure projects like bike lanes, which have been shown around the world to be a net-benefit for transportation in countless cities. Let local voters decide how their cities should be built. The province does not adequately represent local municipal voters and does not understand our local needs. We need safe and expansive bicycle infrastructure.\nIn addition, rather than attempting to spend billions of dollars on car infrastructure by continually expanding highways (despite the fact that these projects always end up inducing more driver demand and thus likely making car traffic worse in the long run), we would be much better served by investing in public transit infrastructure, which \"pays dividends\" in the long run by reducing the amount of people who need to drive a car every day, freeing up our existing roads, while making transportation more accessible to those for whom driving is not a viable option. This demographic includes children, seniors, people who cannot afford to own a car, people living with disabilities, and more. In short; Bill 212 works against the best interests of Ontarians.\n",

Ontario has witnessed an alarming rise in cyclist deaths, highlighting the critical need for protected bike lanes that safeguard both cyclists and pedestrians. Instead, this bill would enable the removal of key cycling infrastructure on major urban arteries like Bloor, Yonge, and University Avenue in Toronto, pushing cyclists back into traffic, increasing congestion, and jeopardizing their safety.\nPremier Doug Ford has previously acknowledged the importance of bike lanes for reducing congestion and supporting healthy, sustainable commuting. Bill 212, however, contradicts this vision by prioritizing vehicle traffic at the expense of cyclist safety and equitable access to public spaces. Rather than removing bike lanes, Ontario should focus on expanding them to create safer, multimodal cities that reflect the diverse needs of all residents. Blocking this bill will help protect vulnerable road users and uphold our commitment to safer, more inclusive streets.\n",

This shows a clear lack of understanding of how traffic works and is out of touch with what the province I have lived in for my whole life needs. Ontario does NOT need more highways, lanes and cars. If you add more lanes or roads, you increase traffic, it's known as induced demand, it's common sense everywhere in the world except for North America. What makes you think that if you remove alternatives to driving, like Bike lanes and transit, that you'll reduce car traffic? If you give people alternatives to driving, they will drive less and you will have less cars on the road, speeding up traffic for those who need to be on the road like emergency services, delivery drivers (But even they can use E-bikes for within-neighborhood deliveries) and those who need the roads for work like tradesmen. Every time I look at the Ford Government wanting to spend an extra billion here and there for a wider 401 or a new 413, it just makes me think of what that money could have gone to, like healthcare funding, better GO Transit service, new transit programs across the province, new Ontario Northland train services or subsidized VIA Rail services to Sault Ste Marie who desperately needs rail connections to the rest of the province. The international community is admiring Toronto's efforts to increase it's transit network and it's cycling network, and it pisses me off to no end that you would want to stop that, cause guess what, the international community looks at you as a pillar of car-centric, car-dependent policies that have been plaguing North American since WWII. You wanting to rip out bike lanes and force those cycling onto \"Side streets\" shows that you have literally never cycled in Toronto or any city before and are therefore unfit to ever speak on bike lanes again, also, leave it up to the cities those streets and lanes belong to. Conservatives are supposed to be about smaller government, well here you are, trying to control what cities can and can't do with their own streets. I will NEVER vote for you and I want you out of office because you are running my province into the ground with your childish and ill-advised transportation ideals, Mr. Ford\n",

Government will need to shut down the roads AGAIN to remove the infrastructure to replace it back to being only for cars - costing taxpayer time and money\n3.

I rely on bike lanes on major streets like Bloor and University to commute to work. The prospect of losing these bike lanes is deeply concerning for me and many others who depend on them for safe and efficient transportation.\nBike lanes play a critical role in this effort by providing safe and equitable transportation options for all residents, including those who cannot afford cars or prefer cycling for health and environmental reasons. Removing these lanes, especially on essential routes, would limit mobility options and undermine the progress we\u2019ve made toward creating a more sustainable and bike-friendly city.\nBike lanes are essential infrastructure that supports active transportation as well as contributes to reducing congestion and emissions. By prioritizing cycling, we can improve public health, enhance air quality, and create vibrant streets that encourage community interaction. Bill 212\u2019s focus on preserving car lanes at the expense of bike lanes overlooks these significant benefits and threatens to reverse the strides we\u2019ve made in promoting cycling as a viable transportation option.\nFurthermore, the top-down approach requiring provincial approval for local transportation decisions undermines municipalities' ability to address the unique needs of their communities. Local governments are best positioned to assess and adapt their infrastructure to meet the demands of residents, ensuring a balance between various transportation modes.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider the provisions of Bill 212 that could lead to the removal of bike lanes. Protecting our bike lanes is essential not only for my daily commute but also for the health, sustainability, and inclusivity of our city as a whole.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.

Since the year 2000 I have seen that traffic was becoming a growing issue and that we are the fastest growing major region in North America.  As a result I have studied traffic solutions from around the world.  Premier Ford's plan to rip out bike lanes is misguided.\nCreating alternatives for residents to move around the region using modes other than cars is especially important in the central city.  We are currently experiencing grid lock during rush our and even on weekends.  Ontario is investing in public transportation more than any other region with exceptional projects such as GO expansion and Ontario Line.  Creating a network for bikers is an important piece of providing transit riders with last mile transportation options that don't rely on cars within the central city.  Bike tracks on main corridors such as Bloor, Yonge, Eglinton (once complete) and University are the backbone of the bike network, which compliments existing high order transit such as Line 2 and Line 1 of the TTC's subway network.\nI can understand the traffic concerns of those in the inner suburbs, when a lane of bike lanes is under used and their traffic times have increased, such as those in Etobicoke along Bloor west.  However, from High Park through to Greektown (if not further east), this bike track has growing ridership and more importantly takes cars off the road.\nThe removal of bike tracks does not plan for a future that involves more people in the region than there already are.  Any city the size of ours has substantially more public transit and in many cases a complete and separate from traffic bike network.  The numbers in Toronto of cyclists are growing, especially along the corridor's that have bike tracks.  Many of the neighbourhoods around Bloor have 10% of residents biking as their primary commuting mode.  This number is increasing.\nHow are you going to improve gridlock if you do not provide alternatives.  A real alternative is a complete network of separated bike lanes, of which Yonge and Bloor form a back bone.  Furthermore, this keeps bikers safe without forcing them into sharing the road with traffic.\nPlease don't spend millions to make the city worse, from a Toronto resident who drives to work every day.\n",

The Bloor and University bike lanes are a critical piece of infrastructure for us to move around the city safely. Already 6 bicyclists were killed on the roads in 2024 thus far. Bike lanes significantly improve our safety. Moreover, by riding our bikes we are lessening the load on the roads, lessening the danger that cars pose to pedestrians, lessening the climate change impact of transportation and, by staying physically active, lessening the burden on our publicly funded health care system. Building bike lanes costs a fraction of other modes of transportation such as roads, railways, subways and so forth. In my experience as a driver and the CEO of a company that owns a fleet of 20 delivery vans, bike lanes usually have a negligible impact on journey time in the short run and are beneficial in the long run. Quite simply -- to move more people, more quickly in Toronto, we need to move them out of vehicles and onto bike lanes, sidewalks, subways, streetcars, buses and trains. To achieve higher rates of bicycle usage, we need a sustained commitment to (a) expanding the network and (b) ensuring proper maintenance and enforcement.

        "comment":"As a cyclist from Ottawa who relies on my bicycle as my primary means of transportation, I strongly oppose Ontario Bill 212. This bill, which proposes to use constitutional laws to override municipal law, addresses an issue that is fundamentally not a provincial matter. Removing bike lanes will not reduce congestion; in fact, it will likely exacerbate it by forcing more people into cars.\nToronto's historical data clearly illustrates this issue. In 2011, when bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street, the city's own data showed that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the goal of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes endangers cyclists and discourages sustainable transportation options, leading to greater car dependence and worsening gridlock.\nThis proposal jeopardizes cyclist safety and sets the province back decades in our progress towards creating liveable and sustainable cities. We need to prioritize safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation options, not eliminate them. Let's work towards a future where all road users can coexist safely and efficiently.\n",

        "comment":"Ripping up the existing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, University would be absolutely criminal. As a former student at Ryerson (TMU), I used the Bloor bike lanes daily. Those lanes are incredibly well used, even seeing a considerable amount of congestion during peak times. These routes represent an immense investment in green infrastructure, which actually does reduce gridlock and save people time. Without the bike lanes, those bikers will either hop in a car (Increasing gridlock), take the already congested subway line, or continue to bike as usual, without a bike lane, which puts them at risk and created havoc for drivers. A cyclist was killed at Bloor and Avenue earlier this year, due to a dumpster being illegally put in the bike lane. If Doug Ford's response to that senseless manslaughter is to remove the bike lane, he's out to lunch and completely unfit to serve.\nThe provincial conservative party has no business weaseling into municipal affairs such as this one. If the City of Toronto didn't want bike lanes, they would've elected a mayor who reflected those values, however the opposite happened. If Doug Ford cares so much about these issues he should just run for Mayor - oh wait, that already happened...\nMost importantly, the way Doug and Prabmeet vilify cycling is shameful. I don't understand when or why cycling became a left-wing virtue. Shouldn't people of all political backgrounds want their kids to have safe routes to bike to school, friends house, soccer practice etc., and safe and reliable mobility options for folks who don't want or need to own a car? Cycling promotes positive physical and mental health, is environmentally friendly, economically friendly, safe, and makes sense spatially in big cities. If the conservative party is against all those things, they should probably take a long look in the mirror.\n",

        "comment":"Space in a downtown urban environment is precious. The people of Toronto enjoy a wealth of spatial variety, from its rich green spaces and parks, to its economically active corridors and thriving intersection of culture and business in the downtown and surrounding areas. Changes in any shape and format must consider costs compared to the benefits they propose.\nThe city has grown considerably in a few short years, and is projected (and planned) to do so for more years to come. Moving people around to where they need to be\u2014for work, for study, for recreation and socializing\u2014is critical for such growth to be prosperous. These methods of mobility in a city such as Toronto must consider a variety of distances and route offerings.\nFor something like mass transit, we have the subway system, surface transport such as bus and streetcar networks, and (soon) the LRTs. Form follows function here, and so large amounts of people are moved in a general fashion, with the last mile predominantly coming from BRT, walking, and bicycling.\nHowever, the adoption and expansion of the bike lane network specifically in Toronto on key corridors has allowed for an incredible amount of accessibility along them. Paired with lanes for traffic and transit (both surface and underground), these corridors offer commuters options. If we are to assume the GTA region grows as it has been for the foreseeable future, then we must consider the balance of space to accommodate many options for moving people around on a mass scale.\nThe amount of space a single bike occupies compared to a single car is significant, and allows for considerable savings in the form of monetary cost (maintenance, fuel, infrastructure), air quality, and noise, at a small cost of perhaps comfort on a few particularly cold days of the year. Cars often predicate a lane not only for movement, but parking as well, requiring additional space on-street as it currently stands. Under the concept of induced demand, an additional lane for cars nudges commuters to consider driving more than they do, just as a bike lane encourages riders to cycle. The primary difference is that the stickiness for riders is greater, meaning that removing a bike lane does not remove the riders using it to the same extent that reducing a lane for car traffic discourages car use (again going back to the space issue). This incurs costs particularly in the realm of safety. By removing a physical design barrier between motor vehicles and bikes, the likelihood of collisions goes up, meaning people come to harm more frequently. This is antithetical to former mayor Tory's-led Vision Zero.\nI strongly urge you to rescind this part of Bill 212, for the betterment of Ontarians in consideration of our future growth. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n",

Seems like an attempt to cook the books with faulty data to support faulty legislation.\n\"We know that these bike lanes, where only 1.2 per cent of people use to commute to get to work, are taking away almost 50 per cent of the infrastructure on those streets from vehicles,\" Transportation Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria said. False data, taken completelty out of time and out of context.\nOntario cities and towns in general, and Toronto in particular, need MORE cycling infrastructure, not less. Cycling traffic on major shopping streets is a positive, not a negative. Cyclists are more likely to visit business on streets like Bloor and most Toronto BIA support increasing cycling infrastructure.\nRemoving existing cycling infrastructure from Toronto roads is a costly, regressive step. Akin to the first term of the Ford government when he cancelled partially completed clean energy projects, costing taxpayers billions of dollars to undo useful energy projects.\nThe government should be prioritizing the Eglinton Crosstown project, and other mass transit projects. Instead they seem intent on building massive parking lots near Lake Ontario, massive highways through our farmlands and Greenbelt, and destroying existing hard-won cycling infrastructure in Toronto.\nMr. Ford is not the Mayor of Toronto, but he wishes he was and acts like he is.

Full stop.  And everyone knows it.\nThis bill is not about reducing congestion, it is about scoring political points to bolster an election.\nIf this bill moves forward, we will be wasting taxpayer money removing cycling infrastructure, instead of investing it in things that will actually help with congestion; providing transportation alternatives like walking, cycling, and public transit.\nThe argument that only 1.2% of Torontonians ride bicycles is provably false.  Within Toronto proper, surveys show numbers as high as 44%.  1.2% is a number from over 10 years ago that included people from Burlington to Ajax, from the lakeshore to Lake Simcoe.  Through that incredibly wide expanse, there is nearly no bicycle infrastructure even if people wanted to survive a ride to work or to the Go train or to the local grocery store.\nIt is a cyclic issue; people don't feel safe riding a bicycle to do day-to-day things like commuting, errands, or going to see friends, because there is no cycling infrastructure.  And politicians score points saying no-one is riding so it is a waste of money to invest in cycling infrastructure.  But if you actually look at the numbers, you see that when you do invest in infrastructure, deaths go down and ridership goes up.\nOf course, this is the \"Environmental Registry of Ontario\", and none of this has touched on the actual environment.  Cars are bad for the environment, full stop.  And not just from their tailpipes; the amount of green space that gets destroyed to support a car culture is ghastly.\nThere is no positive outcome from ripping out existing bike lanes and proactively blocking the creation of new cycling infrastructure, period.  We need to invest in the people, not the profits of foreign car companies by paving over every blade of grass to ensure they're they only hope for Ontarioans to get around.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limit the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario. This decision is not just short-sighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nFirstly, and from a legislative perspective, requiring provincial approval for bike lanes is an overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Drawing on local expertise and community feedback, municipalities create transportation plans that effectively balance traffic management with key priorities such as active transportation, multimodal transit options, and environmental protection. It remains unclear how the Ministry of Transportation can make more informed decisions about local transportation issues than the municipalities themselves. Instead of micromanaging bicycle lane implementation, the Ministry could better support the development of new housing by streamlining its own approval processes.\nAs for the impact of bike lanes, evidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes significantly reduce gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those relying on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without vehicle access. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto, but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the environment. The province must respect local decision-making when considering transportation planning.\n",

        "comment":"Provincial legislation (Bill 212) aimed at keeping towns and cities from building bike lanes and even forcing some to remove them is bad news for everyone in Ontario, wherever they live. For people who live in the towns and cities directly affected, it will result in more dangerous streets and more congestion. For those who don\u2019t, it introduces a dangerous and false polarization, pitting drivers against cyclists and encouraging dangerous driving.\n  The proposed legislation is not just an urban problem. Rural municipalities and small towns across Ontario have been creating cycling infrastructure because they know cycling reduces traffic, promotes health, reduces environmental damage and promotes tourism. For instance, the County of Renfrew has embraced this thinking with its Active Transportation Policy, and a network of roads with hardened shoulders is quickly developing as a result. Municipalities around the County are doing the same with their roads. The Province putting the brakes on bike lanes sends a negative message about these developments.\n  Cycling brings together citizens of all political persuasions, as shown by the huge turnout for group cycling events in Westmeath, Killaloe, Eganville, Braeside and Petawawa. Local businesses are going bike-friendly to attract the growing number of cycle tourists.\n  Creating a polarized us-versus-them, drivers-versus-cyclists atmosphere is bound to encourage negative attitudes and dangerous driving. Parents sending their kids off to school, commuters getting to work, folks out shopping, seniors touring and exploring new places \u2013 all these people have reason to feel threatened by this proposed legislation.\n  The proposal has also pitted the provincial government against municipal ones. Having the Province tell towns and cities what they should do is so deeply offensive and makes so little sense that the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) \u2013 a non-partisan association of municipal officials \u2013 has condemned Bill 212, on which it was not consulted at all before it was introduced.  \u201cBicycle lanes are an essential element of urban transportation planning and road safety,\u201d it wrote in a news release.\u201d Requiring provincial approval would be a significant overreach into municipal jurisdiction.\n  \u201cBased on local knowledge and community input, municipalities develop transportation plans that balance traffic flow with planning priorities like active transportation, multi-modal transportation and environmental and health protection.\u201d Local leaders and staff are much better equipped to know local needs than provincial politicians.\n  Premier Ford argues that bike lanes cause traffic congestion. Research says they don\u2019t. The City of Toronto has done extensive research, as reported in City Hall Watcher, finding that while bike usage has jumped by as much as 1,000 percent on some streets as a result of bike lanes, travel time for cars has actually dropped on some routes (Adelaide St., University Ave.) and increased only marginally in  others (Bloor and Richmond Streets).  CBC News reports that from New York to Montreal to Copenhagen to Paris, installation of bike lanes has led to rapid growth in cycling and less traffic congestion, as people find cycling an attractive, affordable and safe alternative to driving.\n  In England, one of the most comprehensive studies on the subject has shown that building roads, on the other hand, actually encourages congestion because it encourages more people to drive. As urban planning expert Lewis Mumford wrote in 1955, \u201cAdding car lanes to deal with traffic congestion is like loosening your belt to cure obesity.\u201d More and better public transportation and more people on bikes are more effective deterrents to congestion.\n  The growing popularity of e-bikes is bringing a multitude of new commuters to the existing bike lanes as they use them for everyday transportation. This trend is growing quickly and if encouraged by providing enhanced safety for those commuters, will lead to fewer cars on the crowded urban streets as people opt for the faster commute and fewer parking problems offered by e-bikes.\nFurther, segregated bike lanes, in numerous studies in Toronto, NY and others, increase business for retailers.  Patrons arriving by bicycle or foot visit most often and spend the most money per moth.\nThis bill is a step backward and should be withdrawn in favour of action that truly enhances safety and gets people moving.\n",

My family are Toronto residents, many of us are families who own just a single car or have no car at all. Often these constraints are due to financial requirements - cars are expensive.

Investing heavily in highway expansion projects like Highway 413, the Bradford Bypass, and the Garden City Skyway perpetuates our reliance on automobiles and ignores the proven benefits of enhancing public transit systems.\nThe proposal to override most municipal by-laws that might prevent or restrict the delivery of goods or services to priority highway projects is particularly concerning. This move undermines local governance and disregards community-specific needs and environmental considerations. Moreover, granting the Minister of Transportation new powers to accelerate utility relocations and property access infringes on the rights of property owners and sets a troubling precedent.\nThe emphasis on speeding up broadband projects is commendable; however, it should not come at the expense of sustainable urban planning. Building more highways will only lead to increased traffic congestion in the long term, as induced demand encourages more people to drive. This contradicts the goal of reducing gridlock and improving the quality of life for Ontarians.\nFurthermore, the proposed legislation includes creating offence and penalty provisions for individuals and corporations that obstruct MTO officials. This heavy-handed approach discourages public participation and undermines democratic processes that allow citizens to voice their concerns about significant infrastructure projects affecting their communities.\nOne of the most alarming aspects of Bill 212 is the potential impact on cycling infrastructure.

Eliminating them will discourage cycling, which will then force bikers to use car more and increase traffic, and make our roads more dangerous for everyone.\nWhile the government claims to be committed to balancing environmental protection with infrastructure development, the proposed measures fall short of this commitment. The bill suggests that construction activities will be undertaken to minimize noise levels and reduce community impacts, yet overriding local by-laws and fast-tracking projects without thorough environmental assessments contradicts this assurance.\nIn conclusion, Bill 212 focuses excessively on expanding highway infrastructure at the expense of sustainable transportation alternatives like public transit and cycling. This approach is outdated and does not align with global best practices for building resilient, livable cities. I urge the government to reconsider this bill and instead invest in enhancing public transit systems, expanding cycling infrastructure, and fostering communities that are less dependent on cars.\n",

        "comment":"As a life-long Toronto resident who is approaching 70 years old, as a frequent driver in a\n3-car household, and as an avid cyclist, I would like to register my strong opposition to the\nproposed destruction of cycling infrastructure within the city of Toronto.\nAs a taxpayer, to waste my provincial tax dollars for such a retrogressive move as paying\nfor the removal of existing infrastructure, as well as waste my City of Toronto tax dollars\nby reversing years of city infrastructure development is highly misguided.\nPaying for the elimination of the cycling infrastructure is a waste of provincial tax\nrevenue, but failure to pay the City of Toronto for the present value of those improvements\nwhich will be destroyed is an economic burden on all taxpayers in Toronto.\nHaving grown up in Rexdale, and cycled, while risking my life, on Kipling Avenue, on\nMartin Grove Road, on Rexdale Boulevard and occasionally on Islington Avenue to\ncommute to work at summer jobs in my late teens and early twenties, I can attest to the\nincompatibility of cycling and car tra\ufb03c on multi-lane arterial roads.\nMore recently, cycling along Bloor from Parkdale, where I now live, to close to Islington,\nwhere my dentist is located, was highly dangerous until the introduction of the dedicated\nbike lanes.\nLast Wednesday I cycled on Bloor in the bike lanes to and from Parkdale to Broadview.\nThe safety of that route is greatly enhanced by the bike lanes. During my cycling both late\nmorning heading east and in rush hour returning to Parkdale that day, the primary\nimpediments to automobile tra\ufb03c flow appeared to stem from road repair work, and\nconstruction on new buildings. Illegal turns by vehicles, and illegal stopping and blocking\nthe road by ride-share vehicles seemed to also contribute to congestion. Not so prevalent\non that route was the frequent blocking of intersections by cars causing gridlock during\nrush hour which I regularly encounter on my normal route to work.\nThe presence of frequent signalled intersections, which is a feature of any built-up urban\narea with or without bike lanes, makes speedy vehicular travel unlikely even without bike\nlane infrastructure, nor is high speed vehicular travel safe in an urban context on vitally\nactive streets used by pedestrians and shoppers, and which feature car parking on the\nsides of the road.\nFor decades I have cycled from Parkdale to and from work in downtown Toronto. Over\nthose years, I have seen enhanced infrastructure greatly increase the number of bike\nriders regularly using bikes as an alternative to car travel. More recently, the growth of e-\nbikes used for commerce by couriers and food delivery has exploded, further reducing\nvehicular travel, and contributing to the lessening of road congestion. Furthermore,\ngrowth in use of bike-share riders has been spectacular.\nThis past spring my wife and I visited Montreal by train, and were blown away by the\nvastly superior cycling infrastructure that city possesses. We took advantage of the BIXI\nbike-share system to use both conventional and e-bikes for our travels around the city,\nfeeling completely safe due to the separated bike lanes that city provides to allow year-\nround cycling in a city with much more challenging winter weather than Toronto has.\nThere are a wide variety of measures that can be implemented to reduce vehicular\ncongestion in the city, which are well documented by case studies and figures to\nsubstantiate their impact around the world.\n\u2022 One of those measures includes making transit free, which would instantly reduce\nvehicular travel volumes, particularly by commuters whose free use of roads and\nsupporting infrastructure which is paid for both by car drivers and those who do not\ndrive cars.\n\u2022 Introducing fee-for-use on major roads, such as was used on Highway 407, would\nalso help level the imbalance of subsidy of car use over other modes of travel.\n\u2022 Congestion pricing on travel within the downtown core during certain hours has\nbeen highly e\ufb00ective in reducing congestion in places like London, England.\n\u2022 Increased levies on parking lots also act as an incentive to reduce vehicular tra\ufb03c,\nbut unless accompanied by transit fee reductions, unfairly penalizes those with\neconomic challenges.\n\u2022 Closing of parts of the downtown core to vehicular tra\ufb03c is a mainstay in many\nmajor cities to manage and reduce tra\ufb03c volume. Partial road closings such as has\nbeen successfully on King Street, limiting tra\ufb03c to transit only, are also a tool.\n\u2022 Targeting gridlock by use of cameras to ticket those who block intersections on red\nlights would significantly improve tra\ufb03c flow at a modest cost.\n\u2022 Provision of additional separated bike lanes would further reduce vehicle use and\nreduce congestion, as part of a well-considered policy of allowing for a wide variety\nof travel alternatives, including transit improvements. The Metrolinx\/Intrastructure\nOntario boondoggle in implementing transit improvements continues to negatively\nimpact vehicular, transit and cycling travel in the city.\nThe current Bill 212 is interventionist and seems antithetical to the deregulatory mode the\npresent provincial government would normally take.\nIt adds red tape & bureaucracy to the provision of transportation options while reducing\nsafety for cyclists and car drivers, who will now need to deal with road lanes shared with\ncyclists, adding to congestion.\nI urge the government to implement enabling legislation to allow many of the alternate\nmeasures mentioned above rather than foolishly waste taxpayers\u2019 resources on the\nwrong-headed direction demonstrated in Bill 212.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limit the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario. This decision is not just short-sighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nFirstly, and from a legislative perspective, requiring provincial approval for bike lanes is an overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Drawing on local expertise and community feedback, municipalities create transportation plans that effectively balance traffic management with key priorities such as active transportation, multimodal transit options, and environmental protection. It remains unclear how the Ministry of Transportation can make more informed decisions about local transportation issues than the municipalities themselves. Instead of micromanaging bicycle lane implementation, the Ministry could better support the development of new housing by streamlining its own approval processes.\nAs for the impact of bike lanes, evidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes significantly reduce gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those relying on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without vehicle access. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto, but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the environment. The province must respect local decision-making when considering transportation planning.\n",

It is the poorly planned construction \/ hoarding and selfish moves of drivers blocking intersections, parking and stopping in bike lanes which is causing delays and gridlock, not bike lanes.

University Ave has the width to accommodate the bike lanes and still maintain at least 2-3 active lanes of traffic.

The bike lanes are good for business. This has been shown by numerous studies across north america. The bloor business association publicly stated revenue has improved with the bike lanes. Bikers and pedestrians shop at the businesses, while the motor vehicle traffic drives past them.\n3. It improves the community and atmosphere of the neighborhood. This not only leads to improved business but home values as well.\n4. Removing bike lanes will make traffic congestion worse, not better. Even a small percentage of those bikers being moved to cars will immediately overwhelm any gains from the additional lane. Bikers will still exist, and traffic will have to move at the pace of a bike.\n5. It misses completely other sources of congestion. By far the worst sources of congestion are left hand turns across traffic, right hand turns when pedestrians are crossing, illegal street parking (especially during rush hour), lack of signal priority for TTC, and motor vehicle volume. Addressing any of those would have a far greater impact.\n6. There is a lot of high rise development in the core. These people have to get around some how. The volume is absolutely impossible to expect cars for all of them.\n7. Parking for all those residences is extraordinarily expensive to build because it is all below grade.\n8. Removing the bike lanes will kill people.\n",

Bike injuries can have a significant impact on someone's life and can also be very expensive for our health care.\nWith the densification of Toronto, we need to make our public transit better and we need bike infrastructure.

        "comment":"This bill is made in flagrant disregard for the wellbeing of Ontarians and the wishes of those who live here. The bill proposes loosening environmental standards for highway 413 construction to allow for faster construction of a highway we don't need. Construction of this highway will cause immense environmental damage to our precious green belt and lead to more development in the area. We already have a second highway to help reduce 401 traffic and building another one to connect to the 400 will only lead to more congestion in the long term. Another issue is municipal bike lanes. I have no idea why roadway decisions are any business of the provincial government. Adding more lanes does not make traffic better, it never has and never will. All it does is provide more incentive to drive. It is a DRAMATIC OVERSTEP of provincial power to tell cities what is good for their roads. The cities build and maintain them and the provincial government should have no say in what happens with them. What makes this worse are ideas of removing existing bike lanes. This will not reduce congestion. This will not make a certain unnamed Premiere of Ontario's commute to Queens Park shorter. It will only make roadways more dangerous for cyclists and waste taxpayer money on removing infrastructure that was just put in. These bike lanes are getting plenty of use every day, businesses in the annex BIA want the lanes to stay because it brings in more customers, they even warn that removal of the lanes could be disasterous. The majority of people who live or work anywhere near the bike lanes want them to stay. Please take into consideration the pleas of everyone who knows the damage our cities sprawl has caused damage to our lives and livelihoods. Ignoring the importance of our greenbelt for the sake of saving time and building more car infrastructure and destroying existing infrastructure that carries thousands of people everyday will do nothing but cause more damage to Toronto and the greater GTA.\n",

        "comment":"Subject: Strong Opposition to Bill 212 and Proposed Removal of Bike Lanes\nDear Members of the Ontario Legislature,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, particularly the provisions that would allow for the removal of existing bike lanes, including the newly built lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University streets. As a daily bike lane user, I have witnessed the positive impact these lanes have on our community, providing safer spaces for cyclists and promoting a more livable city.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University streets are essential not only for ensuring the safety of cyclists but also for improving the overall traffic environment. By incorporating greenery and making the roads feel narrower, these lanes effectively slow down car traffic, encouraging drivers to be more cautious. This design approach enhances the safety of all road users and contributes to a more sustainable urban ecosystem.\nIt is particularly disheartening to see how the mentality of our leadership can undermine progress. In \"Fordnation,\" Doug Ford openly expresses his disdain for bike lanes, revealing a narrow perspective that prioritizes his personal commute over the broader needs of our community. His reasoning\u2014that he dislikes seeing bikes pass him while he sits in traffic\u2014reflects a selfish and simple-minded approach that is not conducive to effective policy-making. It is troubling that such views are allowed to shape transportation policy in Ontario, leading to decisions that ignore the growing demand for cycling infrastructure and the benefits it brings.\nIt is vital to recognize that the removal of these bike lanes would undermine the progress we have made toward creating a safer and more accessible city. Instead of reducing our cycling infrastructure, we should be focusing on expanding and improving it to encourage more residents to choose cycling as a viable and healthy transportation option.\nFurthermore, transportation policies should be grounded in sound evidence and scientific principles, ensuring that decisions reflect the needs and safety of our communities. I urge the government to reconsider the implications of this bill and prioritize the protection and expansion of our cycling infrastructure.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\nSincerely,\na Phd from University of Toronto.\n",

We will be no better than countries that exploit their resources that we judge on the world stage.\nThe way I see the proposal is 1 of 2 options.\nOption 1 -\tWe build the highway, in 10 years we will be just as congested as before, we will need to build a new highway and expand the 413 on even more critical habitat to stop even more congestion.

The proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic; studies and historical data have shown the opposite. This measure will likely lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately costing the city more in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto highlights this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and deter sustainable transportation options, leading to higher reliance on cars and exacerbating gridlock.\nInstead of pursuing policies that endanger lives and diminish the quality of urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as enhancing healthcare and education. This approach would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to placate drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n",

However, since the capacity of a single bike lane outcompetes that of a single car lane, the bike lanes have the potential to relieve congestion by effectively reducing the number of cars.\nToronto is seeing a small cycling population due to a very limited cycling infrastructure. Measuring the effectiveness of bicycle lanes when the city has a few disconnected bicycle lanes is a totally unreasonable approach. For cycling to be an attractive alternative to driving, a continuous addition of safer bicycle lanes and a cohesive cycling network is required.\nThe effectiveness of bicycle lanes in easing traffic congestion can be seen in New York City. The city has been implementing bicycle lanes for nearly two decades. According to their report, the addition of the bicycle lanes reduced the vehicle travel time, desmonstrating the positive effects of the bicycle lanes on the traffic management. In addition, the bicycle lanes resulted in a decreased numer of pedestrian\/cyclist crashes with injury.\nHence, a wider implementation of the bicycle lanes throughout our cities will ease the traffic congestion and increase pedestrian and cyclist safety.\n",

        "comment":"This bill appears to be government meddling in what should be a municipal matter. Not only that, it goes against the current predominant research on urban planning and city infrastructure, which indicates that investing in public transit and non-car transportation infrastructure is a more effective and cost effective means of city growth. Why does this government ignore this information and insist on micromanaging municipal decisions?  The creation of yet more red tape for building infrastructure is at odds with the supposed restrained hand ideology of a conservative government.\nRemoving bike lanes only reduces the options a person has for transportation. It is unsafe for drivers and cyclists to be forced into sharing the same space, and the presence of cyclists on a street can add to the already clogged nature of traffic. As both a driver and a cyclist I would like to see more infrastructure that enables people more options and safety in terms of the transportation they can use, but this bill aims to enable the opposite.\nThis kind of legislation seems personal to the premier and that is unbecoming of the entire party. The infrastructure is already there, what a waste of time and resources to now remove it. Bill 212 appears to be nothing more than more than another symptom of Doug Ford's hyper fixation on Toronto, something that seems to come before the rest of the province which is currently watching the healthcare system buckle. The priorities of this administration are shamefully abysmal.\n",

Bill 212 says goodbye to the Butternut tree, western chorus frog, resided dace, rapids club tail,  bobolink, chimney swift, barn swallow, wood thrush, eastern meadowlark, olive-sided flycatcher.It is not logical to \"expedite\" building bridges and pavement for projects that will take years to complete and will minimally relieve current gridlock in the GTA. Bill 212 seems to be a knee-jerk reaction by  the  Government of Ontario leaders  being overwhelmed by current traffic management  in the GTA- density being complicated by  many major construction projects in downtown Toronto.These projects will be completed. It has been suggested that paying truck tolls now for travel on the 407 highway will relieve current congestion. This proposed bill only inflates property values for select developers, not building more affordable housing communities.\nBill 212 also removes  legal  rights of landowners facing expropriation for government priorized projects.It removes rights of citizens objecting to these  questionable expedited projects and effectively squashes the protective mandates  of the Conservation agencies like the TRCA whose lands will be compromised by the projects.\nUnfortunately, the taxpayers will pay the costs  and the environment will pay the cost with less ability to store carbon and mitigate flooding as we face increasing hazards from climate change.

Bike lanes are simply efficient in moving people because bikes take up so much less space.\nThose drafting this act will find themselves in even worse traffic, surrounded by even more cars the city can't accommodate.\nAdd to that the increased frequency of disruptions caused by emergency response situations where cyclists, robbed of a safe commute, are injured or killed by being struck by vehicles.\nMoreover, this act will harm local businesses. Each business association that has commented on the proposed removal of bike lanes has expressed dismay, as evidence shows cyclists are more likely to drop in and spend more.\nRaising an additional concern; both the City of Toronto and the Government of Ontario have quantifiable evidence of a reduction in cyclists being struck by vehicles following the installation of bike lanes. Typically, government policy is exempt from legal liability. However, this act is so offside evidence that Ontario is very exposed to a class action lawsuit for willful negligence.\nFor the sake of business, moving people efficiently, and safety, I implore the government to retract this deeply flawed act.\n",

Consider this analysis and the objections pasted below from experts, BIAs, and advocacy groups:\nIt won't reduce gridlock or save time. Motor vehicles and infrastructure that prioritizes them cause congestion, not bikes. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary, the evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion, whereas people switching from bikes to cars does. Combined with proposals to build the new 413 highway and create a traffic tunnel under the 401, these plans further lock us into the car-centric planning decisions that lead to congestion in the first place (read: induced demand).\nAt present, municipalities have the authority to design and install bicycle lanes on roads under their jurisdiction based on their own priorities and transportation context. This bill is provincial overreach into municipal decision-making.\nRemoving bike lanes can be considerably more costly than installation. Municipalities have not budgeted for this, and even if the province picks up the tab, ripping out functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible.\nA singular focus on \u201cmaking life easier for drivers\u201d will only make life harder for all road users. Yes, some people prefer or need to drive, but many people don't, and in any community at least 30% of people can't drive due to age, ability, or access, and they need real options too.\nThis move is out of line with other provincial priorities, such as growth targets, efforts to boost transit, and the current e-scooter micromobility pilot program.\nWhy we need more (not fewer) bike lanes:\nA few key reasons why municipalities across Ontario have committed to building bike lanes, which are likely familiar to you:\nBike lanes are an incredibly efficient way of moving people and are able to move many more people per hour than a lane focused primary on moving motor vehicles.\nBike lanes help to provide transportation choice, which helps to reduce the overall number of motor vehicles on the road. Just as highways result in more car trips, bike lanes increase cycling trips.\nBike lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles.\nReallocating road space to transit and active transportation reduced traffic volumes and GHG emissions without substantially changing traffic speeds.\nCycling is an effective way to incorporate physical activity into daily life, reducing the risk of chronic disease, reducing stress, and improving mental health.\nThere is a wealth of evidence in support of building bike lanes.\nStatements from expert groups, associations of businesses, and community groups:\nBloor-Annex BIA: https:\/\/x.com\/dmrider\/status\/1849123389937508607\n\u201cPremier Ford has asked for the installation of bike lanes to be evidence-driven.

This is an absolute shame and speaks volumes of the PCs priorities.\n-27 year old Toronto resident.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 212: Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\nThe purpose of this legislation is to reduce gridlock and save time for drivers in Ontario.\nThese comments focus on Part XII, which requires Government of Ontario approval\/review of:\n\u2022\tmunicipalities\u2019 plans for bicycle lanes that reduce lanes for cars, and\n\u2022\tbicycle lanes that have been built in the past five years (with the potential for removal of lanes that are in place.)\nThese measures will not significantly reduce gridlock.\nThere is no evidence that bike traffic and bike lanes contribute to gridlock.\nThe problem with gridlock is too many cars.\nIncreasing space on roads leads to increases in car use, more congestion, and eventually more gridlock.\nReducing infrastructure for cyclists may contribute to congestion and gridlock if they opt for motorized transport instead.\nThe legislation makes no provision for improvements to public transport which could at least absorb the trips of some of the cyclists who will ride less because they have lost bike lanes.\nThey will also degrade the benefits of cycling to Ontario.\nTransportation\nEliminating or slowing the growth of bike lanes will drive cyclists back to motorized transportation--which will increase congestion.\nThe transportation system will be less efficient, incenting use of expensive (car\/transit) modes over the less expensive one (cycling).\nHealth\nFewer bike lanes will reduce safety for cyclists, leading to more injuries and possibly, fatalities.\nReductions in cycling infrastructure will lead to less riding, exercise and fitness, which will reduce population health.\nEnvironment\nCycling is the one of the most efficient modes of transportation in terms of space, energy and pollution.\nMore trips by car and public transit will only lead to more pressure on available space on roads, as well as increased energy use and GHG emissions.\nCars require much more land than bicycles: both while travelling and not in use (parking\u2014which is often under priced).  They require more public space per passenger mile--so are a less efficient use of that space.\nMunicipal Finances\nRoads and car infrastructure are expensive.  Municipalities across Ontario are struggling to build and even maintain the road networks needed to support \u201ccars first\u201d transportation.\nIn municipalities such as Ottawa, (which has a \u201crevenue shortfall\u201d) the huge investments in road building and maintenance are crowding out expenditure on other important public goods and services.\nMunicipalities, whose revenues are constrained by their narrow tax bases, tax increase commitments and dependence on other levels of government for funding, will not be able to support ever-growing road networks.\nCycling lanes are a fiscally responsible means to increase transportation capacity in Ontario, at a lower cost than roads dedicated primarily to cars.\nRecommendation:\nRemove section XII from the proposed legislation.\n",

        "comment":"I own a greeting card and gift store called TOWN. We are located on Bloor Street West, near the corner of Brock Avenue. The proposal in Bill 212, The Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, to remove bikes lanes on major thoroughfares, especially Bloor Street, is very concerning to me. Minister Sarkaria\u2019s statements that bike lanes are bad for small businesses are especially disheartening. The Bloor bike lane has been great for my business. Please leave it where it is.\nAt least a third of my customers use the Bloor bike lane, probably more. Many of these customers use the bike lane year-round. In fact, the bike lane attracts people to my business. Since the Bloor bike lane was installed, more people spontaneously visit the store during their daily commute. Customers have mentioned that they noticed the store from the bike lane, and it was easy for them to pull over and run in and grab a card or whatever else they need. If bike traffic is diverted away from Bloor Street, my business will suffer.\nWe now have a Bike Share depot directly in front of the store, which I am thrilled about. It allows a whole other section of the population to see and become aware of our store. This includes many tourists who use Bike Share to get around the city. The Bloor bike lane makes it easier, not harder, for more people to come to my store in more different ways.\nThe Bloor bike lanes sometimes cause small inconveniences, but they are worth it. Deliveries to the store can be more difficult, and couriers might have to walk an extra block or two, but they figure it out. Some customers complain about a lack of parking, but this has always been true. I had two retail stores on Danforth Avenue, between Broadview Avenue and Chester Avenue, from 1987 to 2006, before the bike lanes were installed, and parking was an issue then too. More lanes of traffic will bring more cars, and parking will only get worse. The only way to free up parking is to enable fewer people to drive.\nAs a lifelong resident of downtown Toronto, I believe in livable cities that don\u2019t rely solely on cars to move from one place to the other. It is so much easier and safer to drive when bikes (and now e-bikes and scooters) have their own lane. The feedback I have received when TOWN has publicly supported bike lanes in the past has been nothing but positive. It actually brought people into the store once they heard of our support. Real support for small businesses like mine means supporting the Bloor bike lane.\n",

Maybe some municipalities took bike lanes too far but this not the case in downtown Toronto.\nIt is totally against best transportation practices to think that adding an additional vehicular lane of traffic will drastically improve congestion on urban roads.\nIn most cases one additional vehicle lane could be added and that will not improve vehicular traffic and will induce more vehicular demand and increase congestion. It will also create less safe conditions where high volumes of cyclists mix with vehicular traffic.\nRemoving bike lanes on urban streets that are suited for them (like Bloor) would undo years of progress.\nThe costs:\n- undoing years of planning and construction time\/$\n- new construction for the removal bike lanes and addition of vehicle lanes that will rip up major downtown roads for years\n- lost productivity because this will increase congestion on urban roads\n- the cost of injury (or worse) to cyclists because removing bike lanes is much less safe.\nBike lanes on urban roads can be hugely beneficial because there is never enough capacity to expand vehicular traffic lanes to solve traffic congestion.\nDedicating portions of the road for cyclists\/pedestrians\/transit provides more benefit because this moves more people in less physical space.\nCost-benefit analysis: what is the cost of adding another vehicular traffic lane and what is the benefit? The short answer: the cost is high and the benefit is low, the benefit pails in comparison to adding bike lanes or pedestrian or transit facilities.\nThe province fails to see this as a complex issue and instead treats it as black-and-white, illustrated by their all or nothing approached to bike lanes. This is a shame.\nStrongly oppose.\n",

        "comment":"This legislation fails to address the key issue behind congestion being the overwhelming reliance on automobiles for travel. Modal shift via public transit, cycling, and other modes of active transportation are effective and proven modes of addressing congestion but Ontario lacks appropriate support and investment in these initiatives to actively support and encourage this necessary modal shift (along with unequal access to such services and opportunities). Public transit needs guaranteed supportive funding to ensure appropriate service levels and quality for users as seen by the TTC and other such agencies. Removing bike lanes will actually make congestion worse in areas with high cycling traffic as now both modes will have to actively share the same space and will increase the potential for conflicts and accidents. Building a new highway tunnel under the 401 along with Highway 413 will only endure further autocentric development and travel in the GTHA and undermine the necessary modal shifts (even car centric Los Angeles has been actively working to invest in transit which should be a sign that multi-modal transportation is important to addressing congestion). Fast-tracking such projects also means more room for environmental degradation not just from construction but from overall infrastructure implementation as well. Other more effective and less costly alternatives to the 413 were already provided in 2018 when the project was originally cancelled yet these are being ignored for what was designed to be an element of the Greenbelt land grab scandal.\n",

        "comment":"I am providing a comment to say it is worrying that Bill 212 seems to be punitive towards bike lanes, without addressing issues of bike safety. Bike lanes are not Provincial jurisdiction. I respectfully suggest the Province should work to incentivize good planning, not simply provide municipal restrictions imposed by Bill 212's Section 195.2.\n195.2(4-7) exempts certain roads from having bike lanes. This by itself is not a faulty notion. The fault lies in that it mainly allows the Province to determine when bike lanes may be built. Make a provision that forces cities to instead analyze the statistical usage of bike lanes. If it is inadequate, then allow the city's citizens to democratically decide.\nSecondly, preventing major roads from having bike lanes will mean the most busiest streets in Ontario- such as downtown Toronto- will become more dangerous. This surely will apply to other municipalities, such as Waterloo or Hamilton, too. Bikes will have no choice but to either risk being hit in traffic, or intermingling with pedestrian traffic which further endangers pedestrians around them. 195.2(7) seems poised to prevent major roads from having bike lanes. I respectfully encourage the Province to rethink this process as it endangers not just cyclists, but the millions of pedestrians in Ontario city centers.\nIn city centres like Toronto, cars are not the best mode of travel. It is faulty to pretend that city centres should encourage car traffic everywhere. Bikes, walking, and transit should be prioritized, to allow a multi-modal split which reduces demands on overburdened downtown roads. The busiest places in downtown are sidewalks, bikes weaving within them only make them more dangerous.\nThank you in advance for your time.\n",

North America is knows for it's inhumane and hostile car infrastructure that leads to obesity rate, and death. The Ontario Government shouldn't be placing red tape to municipalities who want to increase OTHER OPTIONS than driving.\nWHEN YOU PROVIDE OPTIONS TO PEOPLE OTHER THAN DRIVING, THEY WILL USE IT MORE. Statistics over the past several years have shown steadily increasing use of cycling and pedestrian infrastructure in areas where there is the option. Quite frankly, North America is ridiculed for it's lack of pedestrian infrastructure and hostile road design. People are dying. Not just cyclists and pedestrians, but people in cars too. Sometimes it can take several years for use to go up, but it increases every year.\nADDING ONE MORE LANE DOES NOT SOLVE CONGESTION. Providing different options other than driving does decrease congestion. In fact, adding one more car lane induces demand for unaffordable cars. Having the option not to drive, saves Canadians money. My husband and I have one car, and we we only ever have one car, or no car. I use public transportation, and bikes lanes and sidewalks everyday. I regularly feel in danger on my bike in traffic with no cycling infrastructure and also on certain sidewalks. We save money by only having one car.  Having the option not to drive, saves Canadians money. Doug Ford is price gouging the Province of Ontario to make more money on cars. He is out of touch with a large portion of the people of Ontario.\nWhen I do drive, (which is what I do professionally, operating a bus, 8 hours a day, everyday), I would much rather cyclists be completely separated from car traffic, so that the risk of hurting or killing the human being on a bike is greatly diminished. It is safer for everyone on the road. Cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers.\nBike infrastructure supports public transit investments, as bike lanes are usually connected to the transit stations. We want people to use public transit as it has proven to reduce congestion and the province has put so much money into transit investments. Not everyone can drive.\nWhen you build it they will come.\n",

If anything the proposal appears to be a misuse of law to avoid said other approaches.\n2.  municipalities are extremely important for understanding and serving local populations and constituencies. It appears that a key purpose of the proposal is to undermine municipal authority and autonomy of decision-making.  The key question on this point has to be \u201cwhy?\u201d; surely the province doesn\u2019t want to have the responsibility for fulfilling the role of municipalities themselves.  However, using legislation to automatically over-ride municipal input\/concerns etc. also means undermining the voices of all Ontario residents.

And the \u2018other approaches\u2019 listed in point 1. could be exercised to great effect.  The proposal appears to suggest that \u2018priority projects\u2019 would be exempt from environmental assessment and protection, or subject only to minimal requirements. This is not acceptable.\nIt is not acceptable, under any circumstances, to sacrifice public interest and the long term sustainability of provincial farmland, food security, water tables and water quality, air quality and natural habitats, migration routes etc. for something that *may* only serve a small fraction of the population.  And, this is assuming that there is a case for new highway development.\n4. It is unclear why the \u201cpriority projects\u201d have been selected at all, never mind made priority.  There are many options for transportation. Highways are one.  What about all the others?\nIf there was an argument for having new legislation, it might be to support a comprehensive, integrated, multi-use provincial transportation plan, developed in collaboration with municipalities and the Federal government.\n",

        "comment":"I find this legislation unacceptable on many levels.\nFirst of all, bike lanes are a statistically proven way to reduce congestion in an urban environment. Bicycles take up far less space than single occupant motor-vehicle transport. Bike lanes also allow more efficient use of much more expensive public transportation like trains and buses.\nSecondly, municipalities already engage in a lengthy design and regulation process for implementing bike lanes. These are not processes that are done without thought. Adding provincial level micro-managing of infrastructure at the municipal level adds needless government spending.\nIf the provincial government focused on increasing population density in urban cities, by working toward legislation that allowed developers and families to more easily create multi-unit dwellings, we would be less reliant on expensive modes of transport like highways, and motor-vehicles. In dense urban environments where people live close to where they work, bike lanes are far more practical. People should not default to driving incredibly short distances to work; however, this is often done out of a lack of safe infrastructure available.\nFinally, Highway 413 legislature should not be hidden behind a \"click-bait esque\" hate towards bicycle infrastructure. Removing environmental protections, and streamlining construction of incredibly environmentally damaging motor-vehicle infrastructure, should not be in the same bill as hindering an environmentally beneficial infrastructure (like bike lanes).\nNeedless to say, if this continues, I will not be supporting the Ford government in the coming election.\n",

        "comment":"Please do not remove the University, Bloor, and Yonge bike lanes that downtown Toronto has invested so much and worked so hard to install recently. I use those bike lanes daily and we should support cycling infrastructure especially in the downtown areas. In the downtown core, bike lanes work to reduce traffic, since cycles are a substitute for cars. There is a big difference between the downtown core and the rest of Toronto.\nIn the downtown core, cycling is the preferred means of transport as it is a high density area. It encourages physical activity, is way faster for getting around, is generally more pleasurable and drastically reduces traffic and makes the entire city core more pedestrian friendly, all the while reducing greenhouse emissions and noise pollution. It is such an obvious decision to support cycling infrastructure in the downtown core since most trips are of such short distances.\nThe statistic that \"only 1.2% of Torontonians commute by bike\" has been completely debunked and is misleading. Please refer to this video https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ScwcEVzmCU4&t. That statistic comes from a survey done more than a decade ago when we did not have good biking infrastructure and includes people living in the suburbs, away from the downtown core - where obviously cycling is a lot less popular. As I said, there is a big difference between the downtown core and the rest of Toronto.\nInstead, when concentrating on the downtown core, a more accurate figure would be one-third of people in the downtown core use bikes regularly, whether for pleasure, or for commuting, and this figure keeps growing every year. With the Toronto bike share program growing exponentially in popularity, having good bike lanes is an obvious complement for the city. The people in the downtown core have shown immense interest in using cycles for transportation along with public transit and we should do our best to support that and remove car dependency.\nIf we continue to support biking in the city center, more and more people will switch to using cycles as their regular means of transport. Build it and they will come. This is already a growing trend, and if we continue to support it, we can likely reach more than 50% of people cycling in the near future. We should strive for that and reduce our reliance on cars -- especially in the downtown core.\n",

        "comment":"This bill is a fiscal, environmental, and health disaster for the province. Cars are the least efficient mode of transportation available - for over 90% of their lifetime a personal vehicle does nothing but take up space, space that could be used for more housing or more businesses that the province desperately needs. For the 4-8% of the time a personal vehicle is actually in motion if they are within a city they are barely faster than a bicycle but take up 4x more space on the roads than a bicycle this slowness isn't due to congestion but because of stop signs, traffic lights, and intersections that are necessary inside any densely inhabited area. For example, traveling from the ROM to the Waterfront in Toronto takes 15 minutes by car vs 20 minutes by bicycle, or traveling from Leslieville to Kensington Market takes 20 minutes by car vs 25 minute by bicycle. This inefficiency causes millions of dollars of financial waste by both city authorities and the provincial government, as valuable land is taken up by parking lots that pay next to nothing in terms of property taxes compared to what could be built there, and maintaining road infrastructure costs billions of dollars a year. Note that a personal vehicle not only requires 4x bigger roads than a bicycle it also does 1000x more damage to that road each time it drives over it than a bicycle. Even just the 2% of trips where bicycles replace personal vehicles in Toronto represent millions of dollars in savings to the city and province. SAVE OUR PROVINCE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL!\nCars are also a health disaster for the province, they are already the greatest source of death, disability, or serious injury for working-age people in this province. But beyond the two biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the province are old age and physical inactivity. Physical inactivity is a risk factor for high blood pressure, heart attacks, stroke, kidney disease, type-2 diabetes, and cancer among others. No amount of PR campaigns have managed to make any significant dent in the rising rates of physical inactivity or these various diseases, because joining a gym costs people time and money that they do not have. But as I pointed out above using active transport like cycling or scootering instead of driving costs only a few minutes and it actually saves individual people money so people are much much more likely to do it than go out and get a gym membership and get healthy that way. And this is without even considering the healthcare costs associated with air pollution caused by particulates generated by car tires and car brakes, or from the tail pipe of gas-powered vehicles which similarly cost the province billions of dollars every year. STOP WASTING MY TAX DOLLARS ON PREVENTABLE HEALTHCARE COSTS!\nEnvironmentally 28% of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada are released by transportation, the vast majority of which are from personal vehicles. Personal vehicle emissions also contribute to acid rain, the asthma epidemic, metal particulates from the wear on mechanical components of vehicles contribute to heavy metal pollution (which the province\/city then has to pay to remove from drinking water), and various lubricants and coolants contribute to chemical pollution. Beyond that the heat generated by pavement and internal combustion engines causes the city of Toronto to be 1-2 degrees hotter than the rest of the province which contributes to the strain on the province's electrical grid which already is having economic impacts with utilities asking large companies and institutions to reduce their energy use at least 3 times last summer. But beyond that personal vehicles are also the largest source of noise pollution in urban and suburban areas. Noise pollution contributes to mental health issues, sleep deprivation, stress, and cardiovascular disease all of which are already costing the healthcare system of Ontario billions in treatment and costing the economy billions in lost productivity.\nLastly, personal vehicles are also a huge financial burden to everyday Ontarians. The cost of buying a new car is skyrocketing, and ownership of a car costs an individual typically $2,000 per year in depreciation (closer to $5,000\/year if a new car not including interest), plus $2000-$3000 per year in maintenance and fuel costs. The necessity of driveways, garages, and off-street parking adds ~$300 dollars\/month to the average rent of a one-bedroom apartment and adds $20,000 of dollars to the cost of a house. When added up across all the residents of the province this represents ~$25 billion dollars disappearing from the Ontario economy every year due to asset depreciation from the ownership of personal vehicles without considering all the other costs I listed above.\nPLEASE END THE DRAIN ON THE ECONOMY, PROVINCIAL AND MUNICIPAL FINANCES, AND THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ONTARIANS AND VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL!\n",

I ride along the Bloor street bike lane between Bathurst and University multiple times a week as I drop my kids off at school. After safely dropping my kids off, I ride south on University either stopping at the University of Toronto for classes or passing by Queens Park as I continue to Adelaide St where my office is located.

The bike lanes provide peace of mind that my kids and I can navigate the city safely and effectively.\nThis summer, the upgrade of the University bike lanes made my commute from Bloor to Adelaide smoother and safer. In contrast to traveling the same distance along Bay where there is no dedicated bike lane, on University there is now no need to dodge delivery trucks, weave around parked cars, or deal with dangerously large potholes. The bike lanes provide me with the comfort that I will be able to commute to work and make it safely home to my kids in the evening. Removing the bike lanes around Queens Park will make it significantly more dangerous for myself and the many other bike commuters who rely on this corridor. Removal of these bike lanes will inevitably result in cyclist injury and fatality.\nI do not have the luxury of using a car to transport my kids to school or myself to work on a daily basis.

        "comment":"I have significant concerns regarding Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024). The proposal to remove bike lanes as a strategy to reduce traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and lacks empirical support. Evidence consistently shows that removing bike lanes does not alleviate traffic congestion; in fact, it often exacerbates it.\nFor instance, when bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data revealed that travel times increased and traffic flow worsened. This measure not only failed to reduce congestion but also compromised safety, leading to more accidents and fatalities. These incidents result in higher costs for healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses, ultimately burdening taxpayers.\nInvesting in bike lanes and other sustainable transportation options is a more effective approach. It promotes safety, reduces reliance on cars, and supports a healthier, more active population. This, in turn, can lead to long-term savings in healthcare and infrastructure maintenance.\nInstead of dismantling bike lanes, the province should focus on initiatives that directly benefit residents, such as improving healthcare and education. These investments will serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than short-sighted measures aimed at placating a specific group of commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 represents a step backward for Toronto and the province. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that enhance safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n",

        "comment":"This is a bad law and regulation, for several reasons, and I oppose it. Bundling removing and banning bike lanes with exempting a freeway from environmental assessment is a blatant attempt at politicking and creating a wedge issue to shift the conversation and hide the real goal of the law. Discouraging bike lanes disregards existing data and disregards best practices in urban design from around the world, and it considers the time, wellbeing, safety, and health of anyone not in an automobile to be worth nothing.\nHere's only a few of the considerations from provincial point of view:\nOn a practical level:\n- This adds provincial red tape to matters that the province has delegated to municipalities.\n- This mixes governmental responsibilities. If the Ministry of Transportation wants a say in how streets operate, an obvious answer would be to assume the streets as provincial property and responsibility. Yet, this act does not provide for the Ministry to pay for increased road maintenance that will be required due to increased automobile volumes.\n- This sets up a game of cat and mouse with municipal governments. We've seen that municipal governments are very good at putting up creative barriers to provincial policies, for example on the housing file. Municipalities will be able to take other actions, not proscribed here, to reduce vehicle throughput. Now instead of converting car lanes to bike lanes, they'll convert car lanes to parking lanes, or set a really low speed limit, or put a stop sign or traffic light on every block, or set up modal filters to remove through traffic from streets. Is the Ministry of Transportation prepared to check every change to every street in Ontario?\n- This might have an unintended consequence of municipalities avoiding widening any streets or roads, fearing they won't be able to adjust them ever again.\nOn an ideological level:\n- What is the purpose of the Environmental Assessment Act if we exempt projects from assessment? Is it only for projects the government doesn't like?\n- Some of the worst congested highways in Ontario are provincial highways like the QEW and the 401. Congestion on the 401 is legendary. The QEW is newly clogged through Hamilton and Burlington due to failures of provincial transportation policy and planning. Having failed to keep provincial highways free of congestion, the province now wants to use our main streets as highways.\n- Outside of 400-series highways, some of the worst congestion in the GTA is on streets that have no bike lanes and no road safety changes. These are areas such as around Square One in Mississauga or around Yorkdale in Toronto. Why are these not a focus for the province, rather than three specific streets in central Toronto?\n- It is unclear why the Ministry of Transportation is taking on more responsibilities considering their failures on the freeway file, and their current problems delivering projects like the Crosstown LRT (now at least half a decade late with no opening date set). Why does it need more responsibilities?\n- Why is this a priority for the government during the week that province announced that it is not meeting its own housing starts goal? Which do we need more, homes or cars?\n- If the province wants to see municipal data before making a decision, how come a decision has been made already for Bloor, Yonge, and University? Which data has the province seen there to make this decision?\n50 years ago, the Progressive Conservative Premier Bill Davis stated about a proposed expressway: \"If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good place to stop.\"\nIs Ontario interested in building transportation to serve people, or to serve the automobile?\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to share my concerns regarding potential provincial interference in municipal decisions about bike lane placement. As a young professional and parent, I rely on bike infrastructure daily to get around my city with my children and on my own. These lanes are essential for ensuring our safety, promoting health, and offering a cost-effective and efficient transportation option.\nBike lanes are not only crucial for cyclists but also for drivers. When I am driving, I would much rather have cyclists in a separated bike lane than sharing the roadway. This creates safer conditions for everyone and helps reduce conflicts between different modes of transportation.\nAdditionally, as a cyclist, I often need to use major routes to reach my destinations. Secondary streets alone are not always a practical option. Relying solely on secondary streets for bike lanes creates unnecessarily long and inefficient routes, and results in gaps in bike infrastructure. This forces cyclists to ride on roadways without bike lanes, which increases safety risks and discourages cycling as a viable transportation choice.\nMunicipalities are best positioned to plan bike lane networks that integrate seamlessly with their cities\u2019 needs. Adding red tape to these decisions undermines the development of safe, continuous, and accessible bike infrastructure. Without these essential networks, residents like me may be forced to reconsider living in communities that do not prioritize diverse transportation options.\nI urge the Ontario government to respect municipal autonomy in this matter and support the development of transportation systems that benefit everyone, including drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.\nThank you for your attention to this important issue.\n",

This bill kills:\nTraffic congestion in Toronto is a very frustrating issue that needs urgent attention. However, in a climate where cyclist deaths are up 500% from last year (see link 1), a conversation about removing vital infrastructure safeguards in favour of shaving a few minutes off of motorists' commute is absolutely absurd.\nWe all deserve to move around this city without fearing for our lives and there are ways we can reduce traffic without forcing already vulnerable commuters into dangerous and life-threatening\/altering situations. Moreover, there is an abundance of literature and data indicating that people drive faster resulting in more fatal accidents where there are more and wider streets and lanes, and without bike lanes (see link 2).\nPlease shut down this bill and protect the lives of Canadians.\n2. This bill is ineffective:\nToronto has reached a point of critical mass with vehicles. If the solution to traffic congestion is building more lanes and highways, we simply have no more space.\nAfter we've removed the bikes lanes will we also take out street cars and busses so that drivers have more space? We all understand how ludacris that sounds; how ignorant can Mr.Doug Ford be to not understand the same is true for bikes. Investments in infrastructure that promote modes of transit besides driving reduces congestion.\nThe October 31st update states that the bill would require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes. These are critical connections to a broader cycling network. Cyclists need to get to the same destinations as drivers so these people may then choose to drive, making traffic worse. The space of 1 vehicle can trasnport 4-6 cyclists.\nInduced demand: if you build it they will come. If we build more lanes for traffic, more people will choose to drive and if we build a robust network of protected bike lanes, more people will cycle. There are numerous studies from all over the world that clearly indicate this, but we do not even need to search that far. In 2011, a bike lane was removed on Jarvis Street to allow more space for cars and congestion got worse in the years that followed, (see link 3).\nThis bill will actually have the opposite affect of it's intended purpose - please shut it down.\n3. This bill is unfair government overeach:\nAlthough I appreciate the sentiment of a push to unilaterally address gridlock as a whole in this province, I believe this to be unfair to the unique needs of municipalities. The transit issues of Hamilton are different than Toronto, and Toronto different than Barrie. Municipalities should not be be restricted, but empowered to make transit choices that best fit their communities.\nI am proud of the equitable, inclusive, data-driven and community oriented approach Toronto has taken for its decisions of the cycling network, (see link 4). This is a comprehensive plan that is based in science and commentary from residents. Mr. Doug Ford's comments about how bike lanes should be on side streets shows how little he understands this plan. There is no efficient side street route that will move cyclists East to West - Urban planners have already determined that Bloor St is the most efficient route and the community has been advocating for this for decades, (see link 5).\nLet Toronto make the transit choices that are best for Torontonians.\n4. This bill is needlessly divisive:\nThere is absolutely no need of rhetoric coming from our politicians that pits drivers against cyclists. It is very common in Toronto that people who drive also bike, walk or take public transit depending on where they're going or what they're doing, and infact, this is exactly the kind of transit behaviour our municipalities need and our leaders should be encouraging. Mr. Doug Ford speaks about this issue with language such as \"a war on cars\" as if our government has some sort of allegiance to vehicles. Perhaps he does personally, but the job of government is to efficiently move and protect people, regardless of how they choose to travel. I am very disheartended to see leadership that not only promotes one mode of transport above others, but encourages divisive social behaviour, making one group out to be the problem that is making others lives worse.\nCanadians deserve better.\n",

        "comment":"This bill is antithetical to so many of its supposed goals that it boggles the mind that it could possibly be considered even remotely reasonable.\nFor every single one of those bikers you take out of the bike lane (a number that, mind you, is immensely understated by the proponents of this bill), another massive car is added to the road; a car that is much more ingestion-inducing than a bike lane is.\nFor every car lane that you add to a road, as it is eminently well understood by civil engineers the world round, you do not get a linear amount of increased car throughput. Induced demand from increasing road area means that ingestion will rise to its limit no matter what, making such a small impact on traffic that it is barely distinguishable from the throughput before expansion.\nThese car lanes are actively harmful to the small businesses that improve Toronto's culture and economy. Cars are expressly NOT vehicles of urban exploration. Bikes are, public transit is, and foot traffic is. A car user will not pull over to investigate a thrift shop or a florist or a new restaurant on a whim. Cars are also an incredibly expensive mode of transportation, leaving less spending money for people who are already stretched so thin. Overall, cars are toxic to small businesses.\nCars are also toxic in a very literal sense. Air pollution is, by-and-large, the single most damaging forms of pollution from a health perspective. An estimated 15,000 Canadians die every year from the effects of air pollution and expanding car infrastructure also expands that number.\nAnother dubious increasing statistic from putting more cars on the road is car deaths. Car deaths are one of the most dangerous forms of transportation accessible in cities. Unfortunately, the danger is mostly to pedestrian and, indeed, cyclists. That danger is minimized significantly with bike lanes, separating the two forms of transportation and providing a buffer zone to pedestrians. In 2022, nearly 20% of the 1931 vehicle fatalities in Canada were pedestrians and cyclists; a sobering number considering the share of commuting that this bill purports them to have.\nLastly, for many, we will not go away if you tear out these bike lanes. For many of us we have no alternative. You are putting bikes back in car lanes. You are putting bikers into early graves. You are putting pollution in the air. You are putting businesses into bankruptcy. Speaking frankly, I fail to see even a single solitary redeeming quality in the entirety of this bill.\n",

        "comment":"The stated objective of this Act is to reduce \"gridlock,\" yet it proposes measures likely to harm public health and safety, limit mobility and access to Ontario communities, damage environmental protections, and exacerbate the climate crisis.\nAlthough the Municipal Act grants municipalities authority over local affairs, this Act requires provincial approval for new bike lanes if they replace a traffic lane. This requirement represents an overreach by the provincial government, undermining local autonomy. It implies a lack of trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs and disregard for local democracy. Bike lanes are built only after an extensive planning process, including research and community engagement, so this intervention appears unnecessary and intrusive.\nAdditionally, adding car lanes has been proven ineffective for reducing traffic congestion. The principle of Induced Demand demonstrates that increasing road capacity only attracts more cars, worsening traffic over time. If the government were truly focused on easing gridlock, it would prioritize substantial investments in public transit infrastructure and develop extensive cycling networks. Cycling reduces road congestion, as each bike replaces a car, making more room for necessary vehicle use.\nPremier Ford\u2019s pledge to remove three bike lanes in Toronto disregards the thousands of people using these lanes daily, effectively taking thousands of cars off the road. Studies, such as the Bloor Bike Lane reports by Toronto city staff, show that bike lanes support local businesses, which are likely to suffer from their removal. Numerous Toronto Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) have already voiced their support for bike lanes, recognizing their value for local commerce.\nCycling is also a healthier choice, promoting better health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. The presence of bike lanes makes streets safer for all users\u2014cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians alike. This year alone, six cyclists have died on Toronto streets, a tragic reminder of the need for safer cycling infrastructure.\nFurthermore, bike lanes expand mobility options for those who cannot afford car ownership, enabling more residents to travel for work, leisure, and commerce, supporting a more inclusive local economy. A car-centric approach, on the other hand, marginalizes people without access to a private vehicle.\nRegarding the exemption of Highway 413 lands from environmental assessments, this policy is shortsighted and environmentally damaging. The proposed highway route passes through sensitive land that serves as a carbon sink, habitat for native species, and natural floodplain. Paving over this area would permanently degrade its environmental value. Additionally, without proper environmental assessments, this project poses risks of increased traffic and greenhouse gas emissions. As with the gridlock issue, meaningful solutions lie in robust public transit infrastructure and support for alternative mobility options, like bike lanes.\nOne must question whether credentialed experts, such as planners, environmentalists, or engineers, were consulted during the drafting of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 takes a misguided approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock, likely achieving the opposite result. It risks worsening congestion, endangering public safety, harming local economies, causing irreversible environmental damage, and negatively impacting public health. This bill should not proceed.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to voice my dismay over significant portions of Bill 212. The overall content of the bill is founded on hypotheses that are erroneous in fact (as readily shown by the significant majority of current urban congestion research) and the measures specified cannot be expected to efficiently address the issue that they purport to address. Worse, the specified measures can be reasonably expected to adversely affect the environment, and make the problem worse over the long term. In particular, the actions specifically added in the October 31 addendum to the Act - namely the removal of existing bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge in Toronto - are highly likely to induce demand for automobile traffic that will exacerbate the problem over the medium and long term future.\nThe preamble to the bill states that:\n\"The Government of Ontario:\nRecognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\"\nThis statement identifies that the challenge the government intends to address is gridlock, and that the objective is to save drivers and businesses time and money. While gridlock is a problem that is definitely worth solving, the implicit assumption that building priority highways is an effective solution is demonstrably false, except in the shortest of future terms. Additionally, the focus on drivers and businesses belies an unbalanced view of the problem at hand, neglecting all other stakeholders and magnifying the likelihood of a flawed proposal. This becomes evident when the proposed measures are viewed against both their likely efficacy in solving the problem at hand, and the undesirable effects they are likely to cause.\nIt is well understood in the current research that additional traffic lanes for cars create short-term relief followed by induced demand that magnifies the problem in the medium and long term. Conversely, a 2021 comprehensive study of congestion in 100 American cities by Mokhlesur Rahman and Jean-Claude Thill which also amalgamated and summarized the results of 30 other studies found:\n\"Of all the considerations tested...non-car mode share behaviors have the greatest\nimpacts on reducing all three aspects of congestion, travel time, congested lane miles, and the\nduration of peak periods. Non-car mode share reduces congestion significantly by reducing car\nuse and increasing public transport and walking. While a number of authors (e.g., Bhattacharjee\nand Goetz, 2012; Anderson, 2014; Beaudoin et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2015) have\nunderscored the relief that public transportation brings on congestion, the magnitude of the\neffect uncovered here is quite striking. It literally dwarfs the overall effect of highway\ninfrastructure development on congestion (0.390 versus 0.086, Table 10). While more highway\nand freeways reduce congestion by providing alternative routes to people (direct effect of -\n0.92), they also invite more cars on the streets due to induced demand for travel (indirect effect\nof 0.833), hence the melting of the positively contributive effect of highway infrastructure\ndown to -0.086.\"\nIf the Government of the Province of Ontario wishes to reduce congestion in Toronto, they would do well to heed the results of this massive study. These results clearly state that not only do \"non-car mode share behaviours\" (i.e., active and public transportation) \"have the greatest impact on reducing all three aspects of congestion\"  but also that \"more highway and freeways...invite more cars on the streets due to induced demand...melting...the positively contributive effect...to [a negative number].\"\nBy proposing this bill, the Government is choosing to act counter to the interests of the majority of the people they serve, and leading in a direction that irresponsibly supports populist and vitriolic anti-cycling sentiment. The Bloor, University, and Yonge cycling lanes are routes that form the core of what has begun to be an interconnected network of cycling infrastructure. Research also shows clearly that cycling infrastructure is only effective once an interconnected network is formed. Removing these lanes in particular will not only cripple the type of activity that has a chance of dealing effectively with the congestion problem, but it will also magnify the problem in the long run by inducing increased demand for vehicular traffic in downtown Toronto.\nIt is worth noting, however, that this Act is not problematic only in Toronto. I have had the opportunity to both cycle and drive in a number of southern Ontario cities as well as in cities in other countries around the world. I cycle daily. I also drive very regularly. It's clear to me that improved cycling infrastructure (and especially physically segregated infrastructure) has the potential to create the kind of environment that is conducive not only to desirable cycling conditions, but desirable driving conditions as well. I would much rather drive down a Yonge Street with less cars and a 30 or 40 km\/h speed limit, and countless bicycles utilizing the bike lanes. This approach would not only move a great deal more people a great deal more quickly than simply adding another vehicle lane and removing the bike lanes, but it would also be substantially more pleasant for everyone. And, as we have already found out, adding the cycle lanes have improved revenues for businesses on Yonge. The choice to remove these lanes is frankly baffling in light of the stated goals.\nFinally, with respect to this Act, the requirement for municipalities to receive provincial ministry approval prior to the creation of cycling infrastructure is blatant overreach in almost any circumstance. And the pretense that this has to do with improving gridlock, already shown above as false, is also blatant overreach on the part of the provincial government and indicative of the worst form of authoritarian and baseless ideological political maneuvering. This kind of legislation exacerbates not only the very problems it purports to solve, but also the divisive politics that mire our society in ill feeling and blinkered ignorance.\nThe final comment that I would like to make is with respect to the Highway 413 act, Section 2 of which \"provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects.\"\nOnce again, this is an example of poor reasoning in the face of mountainous quantities of thorough research. As a result, the optics of the situation appear as willful opposition to meaningful, valuable protections against the results of that very type of activity. First, the very belief that this highway is essential is still questionable in the face of the same evidence I have provided above (and will attach to this commentary). And second, the point of the Environmental Assessment Act is to ensure that environmentally impactful projects (like highways, and particularly large 400-series highways) are undertaken only with an amount of environmental impact mitigation that is sufficient to address the challenges they create. Nothing should be exempt from the Environmental Assessment Act. The environmental assessment of the project is next to meaningless if the project is a priori exempt.\nTo sum up, the challenge we face is real. Congestion is undesirable. However, the hypothesis that we have more cars moving faster is a desirable alternate reality is flawed. It's not the cars that need to move faster or with less congestion. It's the *people* that need to move with less friction. There are many ways to address that problem, but more lanes for cars is demonstrably ineffective, as shown in cities all around the world and studied by many reliable scholars. There are effective techniques, and they generally include public transportation, active transportation, walkable infrastructure, and tele-work (i.e., reducing the frequency of intra-city travel), among others. From a taxpayer perspective, all of these are more cost-effective than highways, and everything is more cost-effective than dismantling steps taken by cities to move in the direction of effective congestion mitigation (i.e., first-class cycling infrastructure).\n",

        "comment":"As a resident of Toronto\u2019s west end and a commuter of all forms (biking, public transit, and driving), I am adamantly against the removal of biking infrastructure and the unnecessary interference by the provincial government in the ability of cities to construct new lanes. It is a completely irresponsible use of taxpayer money to remove well-used infrastructure like this, and the pitting of cars vs. bikes to create a culture war is an extremely reckless and bad-faith initiative from the provincial government.\nTraffic is caused by many factors - construction, population growth, and poor driving skills (paired with a lack of enforcement) to name a few. So this is not a matter of cars vs. bikes, and to frame bike lanes as the primary culprit of traffic congestion is ridiculous. Instead, this is a matter of all transportation options vs. gridlock. The way to reduce gridlock in the city is NOT by reducing existing transit infrastructure (bike lanes), but by:\n(i) Investing in all forms of transportation (particularly systems like the subway and GO trains, which are a far more efficient way of moving people to, from, and around the city than cars, especially during rush hour commute traffic),\n(ii) Addressing the delays that have become more of a norm than an exception in construction projects, and\n(iii) Confronting the seriously deteriorating driving culture in the GTA. Whether due to poor skills or lack of consideration for others, the aggression, obliviousness, and arrogance on GTA roads is bad for gridlock, and, more importantly, for safety. Drivers need to be properly trained and rules need to be properly enforced.\nResearch suggesting that replacing bike lanes with an additional lane of traffic reduces congestion is very inconsistent. In fact, research into the phenomenon of induced demand - whereby an increase in supply results in a decline in cost (i.e. traffic delays in this case) and thus an increase in consumption (driving) resulting in just as much traffic as before - is much more extensive and well-founded. Simply, cars are an incredibly inefficient use of space on our roads, and adding more lanes will only exacerbate that inefficiency. Instead, the focus of transportation infrastructure and investment should be on making alternative commuting options more appealing to get people off the roads, thereby freeing up space for vehicles that actually need to be there, such as buses, those with mobility issues, or shipping vehicles (because the reality is that many people who choose to drive do not need to drive and this culture of car-supremacy shows clear favouritism for constituents who do not rely biking or public transit to get around).\nLastly - and most importantly - removing bike lanes will put cyclists in danger, and the adamance over their removal shows blatant disregard for public safety. While putting new lanes on side streets may be practical in some cases, it is often not feasible in Toronto due to the broken grid system and would often make bike travel tedious and less efficient.\nThis Bill represents a complete overreach by the province into municipal affairs, and a distraction from the fact that the province has completely failed to deliver the public transit projects in Toronto that it actually does have the mandate to oversee (see Metrolinx), resulting in years of delays and ballooning costs (and likely contributing to the gridlock that the province claims to be trying to address).\n",

The proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic; studies and historical data have shown the opposite. This measure will likely lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately costing the city more in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto highlights this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and deter sustainable transportation options, leading to higher reliance on cars and exacerbating gridlock.\nInstead of pursuing policies that endanger lives and diminish the quality of urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as enhancing healthcare and education. This approach would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to placate drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n",

        "comment":"Supporting bike lanes is about investing in a stronger economy with a healthier, faster and more efficient community. Removing bike lanes would waste more time and tax dollars, and create more gridlock.\nIt's understandable that the installation of new bike lanes has caused frustration for some, especially in a city where car culture has been ingrained for decades. Adjusting to changes in road design can be challenging, particularly when it impacts familiar commuting routes and routines. However, it\u2019s worth considering that spending additional public funds to remove these bike lanes and revert back to car lanes would take time and money and would not be the most efficient solution. Removing them could negate potential long-term benefits of a more balanced transportation network, and the costs of doing so would add up without giving the current investment a fair chance to demonstrate its value. Instead, allowing time for adaptation and assessing the impact of the bike lanes more comprehensively might yield a more informed and financially prudent outcome.\nResearch supports that the benefits of dedicated bike lanes\u2014such as safety, reduced congestion, economic growth, health improvements, and environmental gains\u2014often require a sustained period to fully materialize. Giving the bike lanes a fair, extended trial allows the city to see these potential positive outcomes.\nSome key reasons to for keeping the bike lanes include:\n1. Behavioral Change Takes Time: When a city deeply embedded in car culture introduces bike lanes, residents may initially be resistant to change. Studies show that people gradually adapt to new infrastructure like bike lanes, with cycling adoption rates steadily increasing over time as people become more familiar and comfortable with the option. A longer trial period allows time for behavioral shifts and for residents to explore cycling as a viable alternative.\n2. Reduction in Traffic Congestion: Research indicates that, in the long run, bike lanes can reduce car congestion by shifting some commuters to cycling, especially for short trips. Cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have shown that dedicating space to bikes can eventually lead to fewer cars on the road, easing overall traffic. However, these benefits are often gradual, requiring time for commuter habits to shift.\n3. Economic Benefits to Local Businesses: Studies have found that bike lanes can positively impact local economies, as cyclists tend to shop locally and spend more over time compared to drivers. In New York City, for example, retail sales along a street with a new bike lane increased by up to 49%, compared to 3% in areas without them. Giving bike lanes a longer trial period offers an opportunity to track economic impact and support local businesses.\n4. Safety Improvements Over Time: The presence of dedicated bike lanes has been shown to improve safety for both cyclists and drivers by reducing the likelihood of accidents. According to a study by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), crash rates for all road users dropped in cities with bike lanes. However, initial periods may see adjustment challenges as road users become accustomed to new layouts. Keeping the lanes allows enough time for all users to adapt, making the roads safer in the long run.\n5.Environmental and Health Benefits: Long-term reductions in car use due to increased cycling can lead to lower emissions and improved air quality. As more people transition to biking, cities often observe lower carbon emissions and better air quality, which benefits public health. For example, Portland\u2019s long-term investment in bike infrastructure has significantly reduced CO2 emissions. These effects are cumulative, with greater benefits over time.\n6. Reduced Stress Takes Time: Research published in the Journal of Transport and Health found that both drivers and cyclists experience reduced stress over time as they become familiar with bike lanes. Initial anxieties around potential conflicts with cyclists tend to decrease as drivers learn how to navigate around these lanes confidently.\n7. Cost Savings in Infrastructure Maintenance: In the long term, bike lanes cost less to maintain than car lanes, since bicycles cause far less wear and tear on infrastructure. Some cities have found significant budget savings by prioritizing bike lanes. Allowing more time to measure the financial impact of these lanes could reveal cost savings that benefit the city\u2019s budget.\n8. Long-Term Public Health Savings: Increased cycling leads to health benefits, such as reductions in cardiovascular disease, obesity, and respiratory issues. Cities with more established cycling infrastructure tend to see a healthier population, which can reduce public healthcare costs over time. Giving the bike lanes more time allows the city to potentially see these health benefits, which require years of behavior change and consistent cycling habits.\nOverall, supporting bike lanes is about investing in a stronger economy with a healthier, faster and more efficient community.\n",

Contrary to popular belief, bike lanes do not cause traffic congestion, car usage and construction to keep car usage alive does. (just look at the data, no, before you say anything, just look, please look, I am begging you.). By encouraging cycling as a mode of transport, bike lanes help reduce car dependency and alleviate traffic congestion, freeing up road space for those who actually need to drive, such as people with disabilities, those transporting goods, and emergency services.\nThe economic benefits of bike lanes are substantial. Cycling infrastructure is relatively inexpensive to build and maintain compared to the high costs associated with road expansion and car-related infrastructure, saving municipalities significant amounts in construction and upkeep. Additionally, a healthier population results from more active commuting, reducing long-term healthcare costs. Unlike cars, which often require imported parts, a larger proportion of bike parts are domestically produced, supporting Canadian businesses and reducing Canada\u2019s reliance on imports, thereby strengthening our  economy.\nFurthermore, bike lanes increase urban density efficiency. Since bikes require less space, bike parking can be easily integrated into busy downtown areas, freeing up valuable land for new developments like housing or business spaces.\nFrom a safety perspective, bike lanes protect cyclists, including children, from the dangers posed by sharing roads with cars, making cycling a safer, more viable commuting option.\nBike lanes are designed to incentivize cycling over driving, as the former contributes to positive externalities, reduced pollution, lower congestion, and better public health, while the latter poses costs to society in the form of accidents, emissions, and heavy infrastructure demands. Eliminating this mode of transportation limits the city\u2019s options and intensifies the pressures of a growing population and the demands of urban expansion.\n",

These have added delays and extreme stress to my work commute, including much frustration as I look upon empty and underutilized bike lanes that were once motor vehicle lanes while I inch my way to work in standstill traffic. Travelling from Bloor to Symington post-Covid has been a daily struggle; what should be a couple minute drive has turned into a 10 minute crawl (and this is after an already arduous journey on the Gardiner). Additionally, I worry about the negative effects on the environment due to the additional congestion\/vehicle idling.\nTo hear there are intentions to forge ahead with bike lanes on Parkside Drive is appalling - the morning and evening commutes along this major route to and from Lakeshore are already congested; the justifications I've heard for this vaguely refer to increasing the safety of pedestrians, but lacks transparent, concrete data to support this. The current mayor of Toronto has made me feel vilified as a motor vehicle driver by pushing this agenda, but I am a safe driver whose only desire is to commute to work without battling additional, unnecessary congestion. Arbitrarily removing driving lanes in favour of cycling lanes is a rash and oversimplified solution to a complex problem.\nThis is a prime example of why the Ontario government needs to assume decision-making powers on the installation of bike lanes. The new bill, as I understand it, will require data collection and analysis to approve and plan the installation and removal of bike lanes. This is the correct approach so that: careful examination, impact analysis, and proper planning are performed; and any bias is eliminated so all taxpaying citizens of Ontario are considered, not simply the subset that will help a mayor get re-elected.\nI am not anti-cycling or anti-bike lanes by any means, I just wish to see the installation of bike lanes done strategically going forward and that's what I am optimistic this bill will achieve.\n",

        "comment":"Bike Lanes and Highway 413\nThe issues in this bill are two fold: (1) the reduction and limitation of bike lanes in favor of additional vehicle infrastructure and (2) expediting the construction of highway 413.\nThese two action, in tandem, will increase congestion from both ends by (1) limiting the desirability of non-vehicular modes of travel (e.g. bikes) and (2) promoting vehicular modes of travel through the construction of high capacity highways. This will not reduce congestion and in fact, it will make it worse due to the simple fact that there will be more cars on the road.\nAdditionally, both of these actions promote the emissions of green house gases and reduce alternative mobility options.\nFinally, removing bike lanes that already exist is a waste of taxpayer dollars and materials from an environmental perspective. In an economy where the costs of labor and materials have been inflated and the Province has an enormous amount of debt, spending money on destroying brand new, well-designed infrastructure is against responsible fiscal spending.\nThank you for your time.\n",

        "comment":"Here are 10 points on why government overreach in legislating bike lane placement may have negative impacts across various demographics and could detract from public health and mobility goals:\nImpacts on Mobility for Low-Income Communities\nBy limiting bike lanes, governments disproportionately affect low-income communities who rely on affordable transportation options. Bike lanes offer a cost-effective way to commute, and limiting these lanes increases dependency on cars, adding to transportation costs and pollution exposure for those already financially constrained (Pucher & Buehler, 2012).\nAccessibility Barriers for People with Disabilities\nBike lanes can serve as safe passageways for adaptive cycling, a mode of transport for people with physical disabilities. Reducing bike lanes removes opportunities for disabled individuals to move safely through cities on adapted bicycles, trikes, or hand cycles, limiting their independence and mobility (UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities).\nIncreased Health Risks\nStudies show that active transportation, including biking, is linked to lower cancer and cardiovascular disease rates. People who actively commute experience reduced sedentary time, which lowers cancer risk factors like obesity and inflammation. Limiting bike lanes could increase reliance on cars, exacerbating sedentary lifestyles and worsening public health (Celis-Morales et al., 2017).\nEnvironmental Impacts and Climate Goals\nBike lanes reduce vehicular traffic and emissions, helping cities achieve climate goals. By making active transportation less feasible, governments miss out on significant environmental benefits like reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, critical in combating climate change and its health impacts (IPCC, 2021).\nBarriers to Youth and Future Generations\nYounger generations favor environmentally friendly and active commuting methods, like biking, for their lower carbon footprint. Removing or limiting bike lanes reduces safe spaces for these younger people, pushing them to use cars, which goes against their preference for sustainable transportation options (McDonald et al., 2011).\nIncreased Congestion and Stress\nWithout adequate bike lanes, cyclists may need to share lanes with cars, increasing the risk of accidents and road congestion. This can lead to higher levels of commuter stress, road rage, and accident rates, impacting overall city life and public safety (Jacobsen, 2003).\nSocial Inequity and Inaccessibility\nBike lanes democratize access to transportation. Legislating them away could deepen inequality by giving car users priority over cyclists, who are often from diverse economic backgrounds. This hinders equitable access to safe transport options, going against principles of inclusivity (Litman, 2021).\nNegative Effects on Mental Health\nCycling provides mental health benefits through physical activity and stress reduction. Safe bike lanes encourage cycling, which has been linked to improved mental health outcomes, particularly important in urban environments where stress is high. By limiting bike lanes, government actions may inadvertently harm public mental well-being (Woodcock et al., 2018).\nLoss of Local Economic Benefits\nCities with safe bike infrastructure have shown economic growth as bike-friendly businesses attract more foot and bike traffic. Bike lanes encourage spending in local stores, fostering community engagement and economic resilience. Cutting back bike lanes risks reducing these benefits and hurting local businesses (Garrett-Peltier, 2011).\nReduced Opportunities for Physical Exercise and Health Benefits\nBike lanes promote regular exercise, decreasing chronic disease rates linked to sedentary lifestyles, including obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Without safe bike lanes, individuals lose easy opportunities for exercise, leading to long-term health costs that burden healthcare systems (Andersen et al., 2000).\nThese points highlight how government overreach in dictating bike lane placement could disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, hinder environmental goals, and negatively impact public health and economic resilience.\n",

The City of Toronto is working hard to resolve them in a fair and democratic process and inclusive manner. This process will be undermined by Provincial interference.  Specifically the issues regarding the Bloor Street bike a lane is best resolved at the municipal level.  Cities have been building bike lanes for many years they have a process in place for consultation and resolution of issues which best completed at the local level of government.  Some routes where the evidence points to low usage or may be revised or rerouted or removed.\n6.\t Before enacting legislation the province needs to determine what is causing traffic congestion and how to address it.  There no evidence that this has been done. The proposal appears to be based on, at best, anecdotal evidence and arbitrary decision making.\n7.\tThis legislation is massive overreach of the Provincial Government into the municipal jurisdiction, with absolutely no justification.\n8.\tOverturning the work of a local government comes at a tremendous cost. In the case of Toronto, if the province orders the removal of bike lanes, bill 212 must include compensation from the Province for the demolition of the lanes and construction cost to remediate the street, and also include the original construction cost of the lanes and all the associated planning costs.\n9.\tThe Province should concentrate on the many pressing provincial issues but if it insists on entering municipal jurisdictions it should at least work collaboratively with municipalities\n",

        "comment":"First, removing existing bike lanes constitutes both a massive waste of money and a blatant misuse of government power. I am one of a multitude who would much rather see tax revenue devoted to critical areas, such as health care.\nSecond, bike lanes reduce the scourge of bike accidents. The less accidents there are, the more willing people will be to use bikes.\n(Admittedly, cyclists can be irritating and hypocritical when they glide past stop signs and ride on sidewalks. But this is a false argument used far too often to counter proponents of cycling. These breaches of etiquette and the law by cyclists are no more prevalent than are drivers who block intersections, engage in \u201crolling stops\u2019 or make unsafe lane changes.)\nThird, studies have shown time and again that jurisdictions which encourage bike use become steadily less congested. Advocating for cycling is a natural companion of promoting the use of public transportation. Both result in there being less automobile drivers out there to become frustrated and potentially reckless. I might also mention that it is financial folly to spend vast amounts of money on constructing subway and LRT lines, only to fall short when it comes to motivating people to use them.\nIn University-Rosedale riding, 8.3% of people bike regularly, thanks in part to our evolving bike infrastructure. What is really needed are effective public education campaigns that contrast the use of public transportation, biking and walking, to the teeth-gritting experience of inching along in congested traffic inside vacuum-sealed, polluting metal boxes (if you\u2019ll excuse the hyperbole). A spectrum of decisions involving transportation could be made and aligned by a government that chose to apply rational thought, study and foresight.\n",

I have attached a document summarising my concerns and proposing solutions. Briefly:\n1) Highway 413 will not reduce gridlock and is only predicted to save drivers ~ 30 seconds per trip. An Advisory Panel that reviewed the corridor for MTO concluded that there are more effective ways to reduce gridlock. Highway 413 should be stopped\n2)  Highway projects in Bill 212 will have wide-reaching and long-lasting environmental effects that will increase risk to residents, municipalities, and Ontario. For example, the 2013 Toronto flood cost an estimated $1 billion and the 2024 flood cost an estimated $940 million. Removing green space in major watersheds will increase these costs by increasing the probability and severity of flooding events at a time when climate change is increasing the frequency of severe precipitation events. Ignoring these, and other effects by exempting projects from the EAA is bad business. The assessment and construction of priority Highway projects must be subject to the Environmental Assessment Act.\n3) Bill 212 undermines the public trust by disenfranchising Ontarians of their property rights without an option for independent appeal or legal remedy, and puts the Minister in direct conflict of interest.\n",

Within a couple of years, the average commute time will take just as long as it did before Highway 413 was built. The project will be a waste of time, money, and green space.\nSimilarly, preventing the construction of bike lanes will keep bike ridership levels low across the province, which will discourage commuters from making the switch from car to bike (which would take cars off of roads and reduce congestion!).\n",

These bike lanes are vital infrastructure that benefit all road users and play a critical role in making Toronto\u2019s streets safer, more accessible, and more sustainable. They are also good for local businesses. Think of any neighbourhood first as a place for people to live in, not an obstacle that a car has to be able to drive through as fast as possible. Removing bike lanes, and even sidewalks since we're at it, won't be able to accomodate all the traffic needed if we all decide to drive. If you really want to solve congestion in big cities invest in public transit, a good network of bike lanes, and establish flexible tolls on roads and a congestion charge downtown.\nThe requirement that municipalities seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic is a blatant overreach by the provincial government into matters that should solely reside with the municipalities. If this is not savage micromanagement and rampant red tape I don't know what else is.\nHighway 413 won\u2019t solve congestion, instead making it worse. The Greenbelt lands are vital for protecting our air, water, and wildlife. They also add to the quality of life of the many Ontarians who like to enjoy spending time in nature. The solution to getting people around from places far from major urban centres to the downtowns of major cities such as Toronto should rely on a solid and sustainable backbone of public transit. Unlocking new lands for suburban sprawl is a solution that does not scale as evidenced by the gridlock that this bill will not in the end reduce.\nI would like to invite the Ford government to go back to the future and leave the 1970s behind. That model for urban development has reached the end of the road. As per the famous line: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\n",

Decades of science has shown that building more highways induces demand for highways rather than improving travel times.\nA summary from the City Observatory describes how increasing road capacity \"generates a proportional increase in traffic, with the effect that congestion and travel times quickly return to (or worsen from) pre-expansion levels\". Given how bad the congestion already is and the many other priorities for tax dollars, Ontario cannot afford to expand highways.\nIn addition, removing existing cycle tracks and lanes seems reckless - both for public safety and responsible spending of public dollars. For example, after cycle tracks were installed in Toronto, there was a 38% reduction in collisions along tracks and 35% reduction in the streets around them. This benefit to Ontarians doesn't even account for the health benefits of actively moving and the congestion and cost benefits of saving car trips.\nI hope the Ontario government will focus on improvements to the transport infrastructure that will be more responsible use of tax payer dollars and help everyone who's on the road. There are innovations such as congestion charges, dedicated public transit lanes, and regional rail that are used widely in other countries but completely missing in Ontario.\nThere are many other sources to point to the same issues:\n1.

As a cyclist, I will have a decision to make to either 1) switch to driving (adding yet another car on the road) or 2) continue to cycle, and abide by the government's regulation, \"You do not need to stay to the right when...the lane is too narrow to share.\" This situation applies to many roads in the city, which means I will be riding in the centre of the lane in most instances, requiring cars to travel behind me (or pass me once the left-most lane is clear). Neither of these options will improve the driving experience for anyone, and will not lead to increased travel times.\nAdditionally, the legislation to remove bike lanes reduces safety for the large number of individuals who use bicycles in Toronto to travel between home and work, to school, to leisure activities, to visit friends, etc.  Bike Share continues to expand in the city (https:\/\/schoolofcities.github.io\/bike-share-toronto\/growth) and experienced 5.7 million bike trips in 2023 -- this means 5.7 million fewer car trips in the calendar year.\nAdditionally, every trip by bike helps to reduce damage to the environment. More people riding bikes reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, and as an added bonus, leads to improvements in one's personal cardiovascular health!\nIt's a no-brainer that more bike lanes rather than fewer are what is needed for a large urban environment like Toronto. We need a suite of options for effectively moving the folks who travel through the city every day - reducing the number of cars, by making the city more welcoming to those who choose these alternate ways to travel, including by foot, by bike, and by transit.\nPlease listen to the research evidence that so many well-informed folks have been publicly sharing with you, so that we can continue to make Toronto a livable, strong city for all.\n",

If I did not have access to those bikes lanes I would likely be driving adding more driving congestion rather than decreasing the congestion. The evidence bears this out and demonstrates that cycling infrastructure helps to convert vehicular traffic to cycling traffic which ultimately will make the city easier for all to get around. The answer to the GTA gridlock problem is NOT to eliminate bike lanes. I strongly oppose Bill 212.\nAlso, there is absolutely no excuse for removing the need for environmental assessments for the 413 project and I have grave concerns around the province's ploy for power to expropriate land.

Cycling has grown as a way to get around the city massively and the city has invested a lot of time and money into making sure cyclists can be safe. I understand if lanes will be removed in etobicoke where fewer people use them if the residents don't want them. However, it's clear that people living downtown do want bike lanes and do use them.\nThe city is growing more dense and bicycles offer a much more space efficient form of transportation. The province needs to invest in this as people want it and it helps reduce car dependency and the number of people driving cars. Everyone can win from cycling infrastructure including car drivers.\nPlease support all of your constituents and take a nuanced approach to your approach. There is no need for suburban transportation methods to be forced on people downtown who prefer walking  cycling and taking public transit.\n",

        "comment":"The Building Highways Faster Act that Bill 212 is proposing in order to reduce gridlock by speeding up the construction of Highway 413 and the creation of the Bradford Bypass will make little to no difference on users daily commutes. This proposed act does not make it clear that the government will not be completing environmental assessments for the areas that these roadways will be going through. The Bradford Bypass is proposed to go right through an important and strongly protected section of the Greenbelt, the Holland Marsh. The Holland Marsh is a very important provincially significant wetland and farming area. It has some of the most nutrient rich soils for growing crops in the province and many species at risk call this wetland their home. Flags have already been raised in past years about the construction of this highway. In 2021, concerns about how construction will affect three federally protected species at risk were brought to light. These concerns still exist and have been unanswered. Bill 212 discusses how they will manage environmental protection by discussing how construction will affect the surrounding communities with things like noise, dust and lighting but no mention of the impact this will cause to the biodiversity of the surrounding wetland and its inhabitants. Overall, the construction of these highways will impact the environment more than help people's commute. Bypassing environmental assessments on protected land could severely impact the population of a species at risk or even get rid of that population in the area all together. Saving commuters a couple minutes by reducing gridlock is not worth losing important protected wetland and species at risk.\n",

Ontario has historically lagged behind in smart urban development, including adequate density, sufficient public transit, and especially cycling infrastructure. Given the urgent challenges of climate change and social inequality, I believe we must prioritize and expand these areas, particularly cycling. A bill that makes building new cycling infrastructure nearly impossible is a step in the wrong direction for Ontario. I am aware that there is more to this bill than just Schedule 4, but it is enough to dismiss all of Bill 212 even if there are some parts I might agree with. I believe this is an example of legislation created completely in the absence of expert knowledge and purely for political reasons, considering just about all current information around cycling infrastructure would contradict this bill. Another key thing to keep in mind is that just because this comment is written in a more professional manner with greater technical terms, does not mean you should just think of me as someone not in touch with the genuine sentiment of Ontario residents. I am also someone who will suffer from this bill, who will have added difficulty getting around, and will be dealing with this bills consequences for decades to come.

On two Sundays in March when the weather was sunny, we counted cyclists to and from chiurch. On neither Sunday was there a single cyclist using Bloor Street. Rather than forsaking two traffic lanes for cycle paths, I am astonished that the cycle paths were not proposed for the ample boulevards on either side of Boor Street. The cost would be much less than tearing up the existing  pavement and just paving two paths for cyclists on the boulevards on either side of the existing Bloor Street.\nSo I'm against the current proposal because the potential cycle usage  does not warrant the cost to provide it and because reasonable steps were not taken to provide it as economically as possible\n",

The intention and spirit of this act is\nspecifically to include projects such as highway 413, and to protect people and the environment\nfrom potential negative impacts of the project.

It is well documented that measures which add more lanes do not reduce traffic, they make traffic worse through induced demand because they lead to more cars on the road. In addition, the worst area of gridlock in Ontario is downtown Toronto, and adding more car-routes outside the city could simply funnel more cars into the city onto streets that cannot take any more car volume.\nAs the population grows instead of taking up more and more land with car infrastructure, we should instead focus on space efficient solutions, such as bike lanes, buses and trains. These have greater density, allowing a larger volume of people to travel while taking up less area. This is particularly important in downtown Toronto, where space is at a premium - why is the government catering to the least space-efficient option? The money spent on highways would be better used to develop our public transport network, as this would have a greater impact on reducing congestion.\nI am also dismayed at the proposal to ignore environmental impact assessments.

I am urging you to reject Bill 212 and to:\n1. Ensure bikes lanes are not obstructed as a matter of ongoing public safety, not just periodic blitzes, and accelerate implementing automated enforcement parking programs and explore other reporting processes with an equity focused lens\n2. Prioritize construction zone safety, including maintaining dedicated cycling facilities, eliminating road hazards, tougher penalties for failing to comply, and a creating a \u201cmobility squad\u201d to ensure obstacle-free travel on the city\u2019s streets\n3. Accelerate and expand our cycling network of connected bikeways to enable more people to feel safe to choose to ride a bike\nOur safety depends on it.\nRecently, a 24-year-old woman was killed by the driver of a large truck while she was trying to maneuver around a blocked bike lane. Her death is a tragic reminder that even along one of our busiest bikeways that sees thousands of cyclists a day, and in which one can travel almost exclusively on protected bike lanes, one unsafe segment can quickly turn one cyclist\u2019s commute into a tragedy. I regularly encounter bike lanes blocked by parked cars or from construction chaos, and too often I\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s no big deal and to \u201cjust go around\u201d. My own safety often seems like an inconvenience.\nI was also heartbroken to hear Alex Amaro\u2019s parents share the loss of their daughter, who was tragically killed while riding her bike on a busy road without bike lanes. Their message was clear: \"Bike lanes could have saved our daughter.\"\nAlex\u2019s parents recounted how Alex was struck by three cars while riding home on Dufferin Street in December 2020, after a quick trip to the mall. Their courage in reliving this tragedy is inspiring, and their story highlights the human cost of inadequate cycling infrastructure.\nAs grieving parents, George Amaro and Karen Orme cannot understand how your government can consider legislation that would remove or block new bike lanes on streets like Bloor, University, and Yonge. George Amaro said, \"It\u2019s about safety. Politics should not be involved when it comes to somebody\u2019s life.\"\nSix people riding bikes have been killed on Toronto\u2019s streets in 2024 alone\u2014more than in the previous three years combined. Every death is a family\u2019s unbearable loss, and each new tragedy reopens old wounds for those who have already suffered. As Karen Orme expressed: \"For the rest of our life, having to deal with the grief that we know personally, that all of these families and their friends are going through. And we don\u2019t wish that on anyone. It is horrific.\"\nPlease reconsider Bill 212. Our roads should be safe for everyone, not just people driving. Please work with municipalities to implement data-driven solutions that can address both traffic safety and congestion. As George Amaro poignantly stated: \"We don\u2019t want just motorists to get home to their families faster, we want everybody to get home to their families... we never had that with our daughter. She never got home to us.\"\n",

It made me safer and it encouraged me to use a bike rather than take my car.\nRemoving bike lanes will, of course, have the opposite effect\u2014 it will discourage me from taking a bike and it will put me at more risk.\nWhy is this happening?  It sounds like it is an attempt to reduce gridlock in the city. But is that really going to solve the problem? Isn\u2019t the real issue that the population of Toronto has expanded to a point that it is straining the infrastructure of the city?\nThis quote from the Globe and Mail article (linked below) says it all:\n\u201cTo say giving more space to cars can solve congestion, that just does not work. That is world-is-flat stuff,\u201d said Shoshanna Saxe, an associate professor at the University of Toronto in the department of civil and mineral engineering, who studies sustainable infrastructure. \u201cThe consensus is that bike lanes are a critical tool for reducing congestion and increasing mobility. So, no, they don\u2019t cause congestion. Cars cause congestion.\u201d\nSo, by removing bike lanes, the city is actually increasing congestion. This seems like a foolish, not to mention costly, proposal.\nNow, to vent my frustration for a moment: this is another example of the Ford government making an ill-informed choice for purely political reasons. This is not a seriously considered proposal. It is not a real attempt to fix the problem of congestion in the city.

The urban planning for flow of motorist, cyclist and pedestrian traffic should be determined solely by the constituents of Toronto and elected officials of Toronto.\nThis policy is also largely based in conjecture as opposed to statistics or urban planning theory.\nTime and time again it has been proven on a global scale that gridlock is reduced not by creating more lanes and motorways but by incentivizing people to simply NOT DRIVE. This is the exact purpose of the bike lanes in the proposed routes for their removal.\nLikewise, should the Ontario government set a precedent for this, they will gain the audacity to pull further bike lanes into review. And conversely, should another party gain power, they may take it upon themselves to unilaterally ADD bike routes in municipalities around the province, which I also disagree with.\nAttached to my comment you will find four documents - three are images of Bloor Street prior to the bike lane installation, and one is a 2022 election map of Toronto screenshot from https:\/\/results.elections.on.ca\/en\/graphics-charts\nThe election map is to demonstrate that the regions in which the bike routes are under review are ridings in which Doug Ford's PC Party did not even win the seat.\nThe images of Bloor make it clear - prior to the bike lane installation there were primarily two lanes of traffic on Bloor and two lanes of parking. Now, there are two lanes of traffic, two lanes of parking AND two lanes of cycling. While I understand the current layout of street parking and the bike lanes prohibits the oscillation of parking (ie, no parking between 7am-10am and 3pm-7pm to ensure four lanes of traffic), any congestion on Bloor Street will actually remain largely the same.\nLikewise, the routes described (Bloor, Yonge, University) are largely traversed by cyclists commuting to businesses and employment, and subsidized by another form of transportation that is highly efficient and helps reduce vehicular congestion as well - it's called the subway.\nThe fact that the government wants to increase vehicular traffic SPECIFICALLY along routes that are already highly serviced by public transit is beyond me.\nLastly, the Bloor Street Pilot study in 2016 after the installation of the bike lane from Shaw to Avenue on Bloor determined the following data:\nTRAFFIC DATA\n- The average total traffic volumes on Bloor Street West decreased from approximately 24,300 per day prior to the bike lane to 20,000 per day (-16 per cent).\n- There was modest diversion of traffic volumes, with an increase of seven per cent to Dupont Street (+1470) and four per cent to Harbord Street (+580). Overall traffic volumes across all three corridors were down three per cent (-1840).\n- Six weeks after installation, travel times between Bay Street and Ossington Avenue initially increased by approximately four minutes eastbound in the morning peak period and approximately eight and a half minutes westbound in the afternoon peak period.\n- Signal timing adjustments reduced the increases by half \u2013 the eastbound direction in the morning peak period was reduced to approximately two minutes and the increase in the westbound direction in the afternoon peak period was reduced to just over four minutes.\nCYCLING DATA\n- more people are cycling with a 56% increase after install\n- safety improved for all users with a 44% decrease in all conflicts\nECONOMIC BENEFITS\nFollowing the implementation of the Bloor Street Pilot Project in 2016, two separate studies of the corridor found positive economic impacts associated with the bikeway.\nKey findings include:\nincrease in average number of customers\nincrease in customer spending\npeople who biked or walked spent more per month than those who drove or took transit\n(Source: https:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/services-payments\/streets-parking-transportation\u2026)\nIn other words, the positive impacts included that cyclists were safer, spent more money on Bloor Street at the businesses than motorists, and despite seeing an increase by A FEW MINUTES during peak hours for driving on Bloor Street, and a slight increase in traffic on Harbord and Dupont, the overall amount of traffic on the road went down because more people were cycling.\nThank you for taking the time to review my comment.\nYours truly - a deeply concerned constituent of Ontario.\n",

I also oppose Highway 413, which will simply add to Ontario's negative climate impacts, promote sprawl, and encourage more driving leading to more road traffic congestion.\nBill 212 --- and the regulation proposed by the Premier in his public comments --- is bad public policy. The bill, which is not based on any evidence or research (despite the resources accessible to the government from the Ministry of Transportation)  is clearly designed to scapegoat one road user group and to create a wedge issue for the benefit of the Conservative Party in the upcoming provincial election. This type of bill diminishes respect for our elected leaders and democratic institutions.\nI add the following comments:\n1. The province should not micromanage or meddle in decisions that municipalities are best equipped to make. This bill imposes a new level of government in local decision-making, or what might be called more red tape. Premier Doug Ford promises less government, but is imposing more government on the residents of Ontario.\n2. The bill does nothing to address the causes of traffic congestion, namely:\n- urban sprawl;\n- the subsidized cost of driving, including recent government actions to reduce gasoline taxes and vehicle registration fees; and\n- the lack of good alternatives, including mass transit and active transportation.\n3. The bill provides no meaningful solutions, such as:\n- slowing and addressing urban sprawl;\n- increasing investment in mass transit;\n- promoting car pooling; and\n- providing residents with safe, active transportation alternatives.\n4. The bill is not based on any evidence. It is beyond curious that there is no research or study to back up this bill -- including the proposed (yet to be published) regulation to remove bike lanes from Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street.\n5. By removing bike lanes from dangerous arterial roads --- as the Premier has proposed in his public statements, thereby contradicting his own Minister of Transportation --- this bill will lead to preventable deaths and serious injuries not only for cyclists but for pedestrians who have benefited from the extra safety buffer that a bike lane offers as part of a Complete Streets project.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the bill.

This has been demonstrated over and over again. Yet this piece of legislation proposes to REMOVE bike lanes, or make them harder to implement. This can only lead to a decrease in safety for everyone. In other words, more injuries and more deaths because of more collisions. Is that really what this government wants?\nFurthermore, bike lanes contribute to a reduction in traffic congestion. Before I leave my house, whether to go to work, to a medical appointment, to go shopping, or to visit a friend, I consider what is the best way to get there and back. I drive, but increasingly I use my bicycle because it's convenient, good for my health, cheaper, often faster, good for the climate, and ... it reduces the total number of cars on the road, thereby reducing congestion. It is incomprehensible that anyone would want to force me to replace all of my current bike trips with car trips.\nFinally, this proposal is not based on credible data or evidence. It is based only on the complaints of a minority of people (contributors to election campaigns) who have the ear of the Premier. It is impossible to believe that any serious person or other professional in the Ministry of Transportation would ever come up with such a proposal as an effective, sustainable way to reduce traffic congestion. They must be hanging their heads in shame at having to defend this whole piece of legislation.\nI urge you to retract this proposal and replace it with data-driven, evidence-based policy that ensures safety for ALL road users and actually accomplishes something to reduce motor vehicle congestion on the streets and roads of Ontario.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to oppose the removal of bike lanes from major city roads as proposed in Ontario Bill 212. The removal of bike lanes would be a step backward in creating safer, greener, and more efficient cities. Bike lanes benefit all road users, contributing to reduced traffic congestion, improved road safety, and a lower environmental footprint.\n**1. Traffic Reduction**\nStudies show that bike lanes help alleviate traffic congestion by providing a safe and efficient alternative mode of transportation. For example, cities like New York and Portland have observed reductions in car traffic with the introduction of bike lanes. According to a study by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), bike lanes can carry up to five times more people per meter of road width than car lanes during peak hours. Increasing the cycling infrastructure, therefore, reduces vehicle congestion by making it feasible for more people to switch from cars to bikes.\n**2. Safety Benefits**\nBike lanes are critical for improving safety on roads, not just for cyclists but also for drivers and pedestrians. A study published by the American Journal of Public Health showed that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions and injuries. Additionally, bike lanes create predictable paths for cyclists, which improves flow and minimizes conflicts with vehicles. And when cyclists feel like they have a safe route to travel on a bike, they are more likely to use a bike vs. drive, thus reducing traffic congestion.\n**3. Environmental Impact**\nEncouraging cycling through dedicated bike lanes directly benefits the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A study by the European Cyclists' Federation estimates that cycling saves approximately 16 million tons of CO\u2082 emissions each year in Europe alone. Expanding cycling infrastructure is an important step in Ontario\u2019s goal of reducing urban carbon emissions and improving air quality.\nFor these reasons, I urge you to reject any measure that would remove bike lanes from our cities or impede the addition of new bike lanes.\n",

We have data to show that bike lanes reduce traffic by reducing the number of cars on the road. Reducing bike lanes will force more people to choose to drive and thus increase traffic.

        "comment":"I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, which includes provisions for expanding highways and creating additional lanes in Ontario. While I understand the intention behind these measures is to alleviate congestion, I believe that such approaches are fundamentally flawed and will not provide the long-term solutions we need.\n1. Ineffectiveness of Highway Expansion:\nHistory has shown that simply adding more highways and lanes does not effectively reduce traffic congestion in the medium to long term. Instead, it often leads to induced demand, where the increased capacity encourages more vehicles on the road, ultimately resulting in the same or even worse congestion levels. To truly address the issues of vehicle congestion, Ontario must prioritize investment in public transportation systems that offer reliable, efficient, and accessible alternatives to driving.\n2. Importance of Cycling Infrastructure:\nThe inclusion of cycle lanes in urban areas like Toronto is crucial for enhancing public safety and promoting healthier lifestyles. Expanding cycling infrastructure not only protects cyclists but also encourages more residents to choose biking as a viable mode of transportation. This shift can lead to reduced vehicle traffic, lower emissions, and improved public health outcomes related to fitness. Instead, the City should prohibit street parking on major streets to free above lanes. Further, there should be congestion charges to enter Toronto which would again reduce congestion and generate revenue for the city\/Province to build better public infrastructure. The City of London (UK) is a great example of this. Building cities around cars is setting us back, limiting mobility in urban areas and increasing pollution.\n3. Concerns Over Property Rights:\nThe amendments proposed under the Building Broadband Faster Act raise significant concerns regarding property rights. The ability to expropriate land for broadband projects without adequate safeguards undermines the rights of property owners and could lead to unjust outcomes. It is essential that any infrastructure development respects and protects the rights of individuals and communities.\n4. Environmental Protections:\nI am particularly troubled by the proposed exemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act included in the Highways Act. Protecting our natural environment and biodiversity must be a priority in any infrastructure development. We cannot afford to prioritize concrete over the preservation of our ecosystems. Comprehensive environmental assessments are vital to ensure that we understand the potential impacts of our actions on the environment and take necessary steps to mitigate them.\nIn conclusion, I urge you to reconsider the direction of this bill. Instead of focusing on expanding highways, we should invest in sustainable public transportation solutions and prioritize the safety and health of our communities. This is where every major city in the world is heading. Building cities around cars is setting us back, limiting mobility in urban areas and increasing pollution. Additionally, we must uphold property rights and environmental protections to ensure a balanced approach to infrastructure development in Ontario.\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.\n",

There is a false statistic being used that about only 1% of Torontonians bike, this is from a study in the 90s. Currently (as of 2019), 71% of people regularly use a bicycle. The majority of people use a bike and also have a car; why would anyone want these bike lanes to be removed? It doesn't make sense. Which leads to the next point:\nOf even greater concern is that the Ford Government is using this cycle lane controversy to make sure that no one reads the other parts of the bill, which removes environmental restrictions on highway construction and also will remove landowner rights for delaying the date of expropriation of their property. No one wants another highway. We don't want Highway 413. It won't make anyone's commute faster. But you know what would? Better transit options. However, the Ford Government isn't interested in doing anything that would actually help people.\nAllowing for the expedited highway construction will ruin environmental areas, ones that could be protected with mitigation strategies, even if a highway was eventually put through there. If this bill goes through, it will allow Ford to shirk his environmental duties and push through a terrible project that he's set on doing for some reason.\nBad government, bad. Stop interfering in Toronto municipal politics, you aren't the mayor of Toronto. If you are so dead set on building highways, why not find ones that actually need to be built to provide easier connections for remote northern communities.

You can simply reduce gridlock instead, by reducing the number of cars on the road.

The people have already dealt with that.\nFurther money should not be spent to rip out this progress.\nMy recommendations include:\n1) for existing bike lanes that reduced lane traffic. There should be no change to remove these bike lanes.  This avoids further construction, related construction traffic issues, and additional cost.\n2) Study how to get better traffic flow through other corridors and on these existing streets.\nE.g would an idea like no left turns when travelling on Bloor street or these major corridors help?  In these existing bike lane areas could traffic be directed to go right and around to then drive across bloor from a side street. From a side street left turns are okay in this scenerio.  I have seen this approach used in New Jersey, USA.\nEg. Is there another corridor of streets that drivers can be directed to use.\n3) i would support plans for future bike lanes that require consideration to meet the goal of traffic flow but must also balance the need of safe bike travel across the city, BEFORE making the change for divided bike lanes.  Divided bike lanes help bikers and drivers from accidents. These have a place in the city and provide a safe corridor for bikes to ride.\nIn time, more and more people will use these or choose alternate ways of transportation if they see traffic is untennable or will shift their behaviour to stay local to home.\nThese are my comments.

        "comment":"re ERO 019-9265\nI am very much against tearing up existing bike lanes as proposed in Bill 12 and for expanding bike lane infrastructure in Toronto. I live in Toronto and own a car but prefer cycling when possible - and when I feel safe.  Cyclists still need to be aware of surroundings  when using a bike lane but it is far safer than in their absence. Major cities around the world are increasing their bike lane infrastructure but under Bill 212, the Province would be forcing Toronto to take retrograde measures that will lead to more cyclist deaths and more pollution generated by more cars on the road. I happen to live near a busy road and can attest to the pollution that vehicle traffic creates.\nCycling lanes need to be on some major roads to be useful for commuters. Winding through side roads is fine for a Saturday ride but are not helpful for commuting or otherwise in a time-efficient manner. All three lanes mentioned in Bill 212 are on streets where there are subways - Bloor, Yonge and University. That may be the most perverse aspect of the whole proposal!\nWhen I drive, I see that it is the vast number of (largely single-occupied) cars that clog the streets, exacerbated by the constant and never-ending construction.  I lived in London England for some time. Toronto  could learn from London and the construction industry there about hastening construction times through innovative processes and strict  time requirements.\nBike lanes save lives and promote a healthier city through the act of cycling and the reduction of emissions. There are much more egregious reasons for grid-lock in Toronto.  The Province should stay out of this and the City should continue to expand the bike lane protections that allow cyclists to accomplish tasks in a safe and time-efficient manner.\n",

        "comment":"What are your thoughts on the fact that this bill makes it easier for the Ontario government to take my property and the property of Ontarians all across the province? Quoting from the bill:\n\"3 (1)  Despite subsection 39 (3) of the Expropriations Act, a registered owner may not apply under that provision for an adjustment of the date of possession specified in a notice of possession if the Minister expropriated the land under the Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act for the purposes of a priority highway project.\"\nSo is Ontario moving to a system where people who live near highways have fewer tools to push back against government expropriation of their homes? As long as it's for a highway that won't actually cut commute times, we're fine with the Conservative government dictating when people have to move out?\nNext, from the bill:\n(2)  Every person is guilty of an offence who hinders, obstructs or interferes with the Minister, any employee in the Ministry or a person acting on behalf of any of them in taking possession of land that is vested in the Crown and which the Minister has the right to possess for the purposes of a priority highway project.\"\nSo if the Minister gives someone a date to move, and they need more time to get their possessions and finances in order, too bad, it's a criminal offence and the homeowner has no legal right to appeal the expropriation date?\nAfter that:\n\"13 (1)  A justice of the peace may issue an order authorizing a person named in the order to enter property specified in the order to do anything authorized under subsection 9 (1) or to take possession of land that is vested in the Crown and that the Minister has the right to possess for the purposes of a priority highway project if the justice is satisfied, on information under oath, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that...\"\nCentralizing the power of expropriation of Ontario's homes under the Minister, all to build highways that won't solve anything, do I have that right?\nOn a similar topic,\n\"4 (1)  The Minister may by notice require a utility company to take up, remove or change the location of utility infrastructure if, in the opinion of the Minister, the taking up, removing or changing in location is for the purposes of a priority highway project.\"\nSo we're putting the contractors and utility companies in the backseat in favour of what? The opinion of the Minister? Years of experience in infrastructure building vs. one man's opinion, and the one man's opinion wins out?\nFinally:\n\"(9)  An application for an order under this section authorizing the use of force shall specify the nature of the force that may be needed to be used to do the things authorized under subsection 9 (1) or to take possession of the land, as the case may be, and the order may authorize such use of force.\"\nSo in summary, people near highways are more vulnerable to expropriation, will have fewer rights when it comes to fighting expropriation, and they have to move out before some arbitrary date decided by the Minister, under the threat of violence? Cool.\nEven putting aside the clear land grab and overreach by the big government Conservatives, what will this bill do? Throw people out of their homes to build and expand highways, forcing them to move farther away from work and school, and so now they have to get on the highway to get there, increasing traffic congestion. Again, we see this government deciding the best way to reduce traffic is to put more cars on the road. This bill is terrible for Ontario and it needs to be withdrawn or voted down.\n",

Removing bike lanes and scaling back bike infrastructure directly endangers citizens, particularly as Ontario cities face increasing traffic congestion, pollution, and a need for safer, more sustainable transportation options.\nBike lanes are not luxuries\u2014they are essential infrastructure. They protect cyclists, reduce accidents, and encourage more people to choose an environmentally friendly mode of transport. Eliminating these lanes only reinforces car dependency, ignores climate change, and disregards the needs of citizens who rely on bikes for their daily commutes. Not to mention the people in mobility scooters who rely on bike lines to navigate the city.\nFurthermore, this plan is an expensive step backward. The funds required to dismantle existing bike infrastructure would be far better spent on improving our roads, sidewalks, access to healthcare, and enhancing public transportation. Investing in biking infrastructure promotes healthier lifestyles, reduces traffic, and lowers long-term costs for both individuals and the government.\nThis bill is misguided and illogical. Rather than stripping away the progress made toward safer streets, Ontario should be enhancing and expanding bike infrastructure to build a future that is safer, greener, and more accessible for all.\n",

It\u2019s important to recognize that the city should focus on solving broader issues, like congestion, rather than limiting the city\u2019s transportation options. Removing bike lanes in downtown Toronto will do nothing to alleviate the congestion on the 401 and other regional highways.\nIn fact, we need more bike lanes, not fewer. Expanding cycling infrastructure is a proven way to reduce traffic and provide more sustainable transportation options. The fact that Toronto Bike Share usage has grown from 600,000 rides per year to 6 million rides per year clearly demonstrates how much Torontonians want and need to bike. This growth in ridership speaks for itself, and it\u2019s time for the city to continue supporting cycling as a safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly mode of transport.\n",

        "comment":"This bill is a gross misuse of tax payer dollars and is overstepping provincial jurisdiction to impede on municipal decision making.\nTo begin, the proposed oversight of all new municipal bike lanes to the province will be a massive time misuse drawing the province away from larger more critical issues such as housing accessibility, reduction of cost of living and healthcare improvements all in the name of controlling municipalities right to make decisions which are best for their residents (of which the province does not have the same level of nuance and understand as the municipalities will).\nThe proposal to remove the recently completed bike lanes in Toronto is widely costly for works that are already completed and have not impeded traffic from my experience (as both a biker and car commuter). This is a misallocation of funds which should go towards more important and pressing issues like housing (perhaps funding the City of Toronto\u2019s request for provincial funds to help subsidize affordable rental housing rather than declining to comment or discuss the matter).\nI could go on about the environmental impacts of building then immediately removing critical and heavily used infrastructure and how critical it will continue to be as the share of bike ridership continues to skyrocket in Toronto.\nThis is a joke and a sham of a bill. Highway 413 serves no notable purpose and will not have any impacts on reducing highway 401 traffic. These funds could also be used much more efficiently. For a government who prides themselves on fiscal responsibility, this bill is the most unnecessary and useless spending of taxpayer dollars. As a taxpayer, please try to use our funds to actually fix something that is a real problem to us (like\nHousing affordability).\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which would grant the provincial government the authority to remove bike lanes in Toronto. This legislation represents an unnecessary and costly jurisdictional overreach, threatening the safety and sustainability of transportation in our city.\nBike lanes are essential infrastructure for modern cities. They provide safer commuting options, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and alleviate congestion on roads and public transit. Evidence shows that bike lanes foster economic growth by attracting businesses and encouraging active transportation. Removing these lanes would undermine these benefits, making Toronto less safe and less sustainable.\nContrary to the claim that only 1.2% of Torontonians bike to work, more recent and accurate data tell a different story. Based on the 2021 census, the cycling commute mode share in Toronto was closer to 2%, and in areas with established bike lanes, it reached as high as 10%. A 2019 City-commissioned poll reported that nearly 9.8% of people use a bike to get to work. Furthermore, Toronto\u2019s Bike Share data demonstrates explosive growth, with trips along targeted corridors like Bloor, Yonge, and University increasing by over 120% since 2020. This growth indicates a rising demand for bike lanes, not a justification for their removal.\nThe financial implications of this legislation are staggering. Allocating millions of taxpayer dollars to remove existing bike lanes\u2014essential infrastructure for thousands of residents\u2014contradicts responsible fiscal management. These funds could instead address pressing urban challenges such as housing affordability, transit improvements, or public health.\nBeyond its financial and environmental ramifications, Bill 212 also constitutes a jurisdictional overreach. Decisions about Toronto\u2019s local infrastructure should be made by Toronto City Council, which is best positioned to respond to the needs of its residents. Stripping the city of its autonomy undermines democratic processes and sets a concerning precedent for provincial interference in municipal governance.\nBike lanes save lives, reduce emissions, and contribute to a vibrant, healthy city. I urge you to reconsider Bill 212 and instead support initiatives that expand, rather than dismantle, active transportation networks.\nOn a personal note, bike lanes have made me feel safer as a woman cycling in Toronto. I have had multiple instances of aggressive drivers threatening me with violence or making lewd suggestions. The bike lanes provide an easy route for me to get away quickly from these aggressive drivers. I would encourage you to use an equity lens when considering this bill. Many of us cannot afford cars and rely on boke lanes to keep us safe in a myriad of ways. Removing them will be detrimental to the safety of so many Torontonians.\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.\n",

        "comment":"I strongly object to the proposed plan to remove existing bike lanes on Toronto and to the proposed plan to force municipalities to seek provincial approval in order to install new bikes lanes in place of a lane of traffic.\nThere is sufficient research to prove that more lanes (and indeed more roads) do not lead to less traffic. There is a brief period immediately after the change that shows improvement in travel times, but this result is not permanent and in fact backfires in the long term, because more lanes means more cars on the road, and more cars on the road means more traffic. Instead, what the government needs to do is find ways to reduce our reliance on personal vehicles overall. Cycling and public transit require more investment, not less.\nTraffic aside, there are other reasons this is a bad idea. One, the lanes that the government wishes to remove have been here long enough that cyclists and drivers have become accustomed to them. Removing them means removing a safe means for cyclists to travel on these routes. Drivers will have to be more attentive to cyclists sharing the vehicle lane instead of a dedicated bike lane. Toronto has had a number of serious and fatal collisions between vehicles and cyclists in this year alone; removing a dedicated bike lane will only make this problem worse. At the end of the day, what is more important to the Ontario government: traffic or people's lives?\nSecond, we are in a climate emergency. I urge the provincial government to remember this fact and to act for the long term, not the short. Yes, removing a bike lane now may speed up traffic but ultimately it will lead to more cars on the road and more pollution and more damage to the climate. The government should seek long-term benefits, not short-term benefits with long-term harms. I urge the government to plan for future generations, and again to ask itself what is more important: a temporarily faster commute or a liveable planet for our children and grandchildren?\nThank you for the opportunity to share my comment. I hope the government will take its constituents' opinions into consideration on this matter.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed addendum to a framework that would require the province to remove sections of Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto is extremely concerning. Equally disturbing is that the proposed framework would also provide the province with the authority to require municipalities to submit information about existing bike lanes on municipal roads where an existing vehicle lane was removed.\nFollowing are reasons this proposed framework is concerning:\n1.\tLocal road infrastructure is a municipal responsibility and should remain that way for the following reasons:\na.\tLocal expertise and context \u2013 municipal governments have a deep understanding of the specific needs and challenges of their communities and are better positioned to design and implement infrastructure projects, including the installation of bike lanes, that address local traffic patterns, population density and urban planning goals.\nb.\tCustomization and flexibility \u2013 municipalities can tailor infrastructure projects to fit the unique characteristics of their areas such as factors like local climate, geography and cultural preferences, which might be overlooked by broader, more centralized planning.\nc.\tSafety and Efficiency \u2013 Local governments can implement safety measures and traffic management strategies that are specifically designed for their roadways. This can lead to more effective solutions for reducing accidents and improving traffic flow.\nBy keeping roadway infrastructure under municipal control, cities can ensure that their transportation systems are safe, efficient, and aligned with the needs and values of their residents.\n2.\tThe proposed framework is not grounded in research. There is no evidence that shows bike lanes cause gridlock. Below is some research for consideration:\na.\tAfter New York City installed a protected bike lane on Columbus Avenue, bicycling increased 56 percent on weekdays, crashes decreased 34 percent, speeding decreased, sidewalk riding decreased, traffic flow remained similar, and commercial loading hours\/space increased 475 percent.\nb.\tAfter Chicago's Kinzie Street protected bike lane was installed, a travel time study found little to no effect on automobile traffic: Eastbound morning rush hour travel time from Milwaukee Avenue to Wells Street increased by less than one minute. - Westbound morning rush hour travel times from Wells Street to Milwaukee Avenue slightly improved. - Evening rush hour travel time in both directions slightly improved.\nc.\tA survey of Portland, Oregon, protected bike lane users found that 70 percent of respondents thought the lane made cycling safer and easier. Motorists generally thought it didn't make driving any less convenient or slower. Only three percent of cyclists didn't use the protected lane, compared to before it was installed, when 12 percent of riders rode in the street instead of in the bike lane.\n3.\tBike lanes create a safer environment for cyclists, enhancing safety and saving lives. Studies have shown that cities with well-designed bike lanes experience fewer accidents involving cyclists. Below is some research for consideration:\na.\tBecause they shorten crossing distances, control turning conflicts and reduce traffic weaving, New York City's protected bike lanes reduced injury rates for pedestrians by 22%.\nb.\tCycling lanes reduce fatalities for all road users \u2013 roads are safer for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists in cities with robust bike facilities.\nc.\tStudy shows that bicycling infrastructure is significantly associated with fewer fatalities and better road-safety outcomes.\nOn a personal note, I consider myself a cyclist but am also a motorist. My mode of transport to get to the office is by bike as I enjoy having the physical activity built into my day and being able to be outside to get to and from work. In addition to the health and mental health benefits of biking to work, there is the positive impact on the environment by lowering my carbon footprint. Research shows bike lanes saves lives and I am disappointed that the Ontario government is looking at putting legislation in place to remove them.\nI urge the government to reconsider putting in place this legislation as it is short-sighted, not progressive and is a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. It compromises the safety of cyclists, discourages environmentally friendly transportation and increases traffic congestion by reducing the number of people who choose to bike instead of drive. Research shows bike lanes help reduce gridlock, build stronger and more vibrant cities and protects all road users.\n",

When my government seems to, against all educated advice, advocate for deepening our dependence on owning personal motor vehicles for travel it shocks me. I find it most concerning and I want to emphasize INCREDIBLY concerning that this bill proposes to allow for the government to build through any land they choose for highway projects they deem necessary with no way for displaced peoples to appeal their case. I find this incredibly controlling and I do not believe a government should have the power to completely decide whether or not people's homes will be destroyed and for highways that I do not believe will be necessary or even a well educated decision.\nAny densely populated well developed nation leans heavily into public transport including subways and high speed rail. Another solution to a dense population is to create population centers that are walkable or easily traversed by transit or bike. The proposals laid out in this bill are not friendly to bike let alone walkable projects and I find this a step in the wrong direction if we are to become a better-developed densely populated nation. I feel as though our dependence on cars has arose from a lack of population and far distances between destinations. A highway system served Canada for a time but now that we are becoming a larger nation we need to step away from those old solutions that are starting to no longer work.\nIt is bills like these that make me want to leave Canada after my graduation. It is bills like these that make me lose hope in the nation as a whole. It is bills like these that will turn Canada destitute as any talent with sense will go elsewhere not as a means of maximizing profit, but as a means of survival.\n",

These lanes have proven their value by significantly increasing cycling volumes\u2014up nearly 49% since their installation\u2014while reducing conflicts between cyclists and vehicles by 44%. Removing them would not only erase these safety gains but also increase the risk to children who now rely on these protected lanes for safe and active transportation.\nFrom a cost-benefit perspective, the bike lanes are a high-value investment. They have optimized the movement of people along Bloor Street by accommodating thousands of cyclists daily while reducing motor vehicle congestion modestly. Their removal would impose unnecessary costs for dismantling, disrupt the area during construction, and waste the resources already invested, all while undermining the city\u2019s efforts to promote sustainable and efficient urban mobility.\nMaintaining the bike lanes is a practical decision that aligns with the province\u2019s goals for safer roads, healthier communities, and reduced emissions.

I have been commuting to a downtown-core office since 2017, primarily as a cyclist. It's my primary method of getting to work because it is (a) free; and (b) faster than any other option, including driving or TTCing. When I'm cycling, I'm in full control of my schedule to get to work, and not governed by construction delays, transit delays, or any other external impacts.\nBefore these bike lanes were formalized as separated, protected spaces, it was much scarier and less comfortable to get to work. Driving culture in downtown Toronto has been incredibly intense for years (and was intense and full of drivers who would be pushed to do illegal \/ scary things because they felt desperate in gridlock even before those bike lanes went in... this is NOT a context caused by the bike lanes), and the commute to work was not safe - but I did it anyway because of the reasons mentioned above.\nThe bike lanes have completely changed my experience. They make me feel safe, secure, and able to commute in a way that's much less stressful and on guard. I have been so proud to live in a city that's building progressive multi-modal infrastructure, which is in line with best practices in urban planning (I am an urban planner, with a Master of Planning degree). Beyond politics, there are many things your government is doing that are in line with best practices in planning (e.g. acceleration of the provision of housing, major moves to address municipal red tape), but this one is explicitly regressive and counter to best practices. Cyclists are also your constituents, and the fact that we don't necessarily have access to vehicles to drive to work, or that we just know it's always been impractical to drive into Toronto's downtown core during rush hour, should not exempt us from substantial infrastructure for a safe commute.\nFinally, the massive waste of taxpayer money involved in ripping out infrastructure that has JUST been built is mind-boggling, and it's amazing to me that this is even under consideration. Please, please don't do this.\nThank you very much for your time and attention.\n",

I no longer spend money in Toronto, where I live, but leave the city to get things done, go to restaurants and parks.  The bike lanes in my opinion make things more dangerous on the streets. Frustrated drivers do not drive better. As a pedestrian in Toronto, I am also afraid to cross the street.  Never seen such traffic before, all because there are not enough lanes for cars to go through and everyone is pushing through to get through the intersection or turn right or left.  Just horrendous. Bike lanes are fine, but on adjacent streets where there is no major traffic. The vast majority of bikers do not obey traffic rules, that is the simple truth. I hope the Ontario Government gets rid of these bike lanes for good. We have a lot of problems in the city due to traffic above ground, and underground. These bikers bring on their dirty bikes into the subway during rush hour. They dirty our clothes and take up space for riders. I saw a woman unable to move her baby carriage because a bike was blocking it, she missed her stop. Further to this the return back to the office initiative by companies is increasing the problem. There is too much traffic, with many working from home, now if they return to the office full time, you will get even more traffic in the subways and on the streets.  For many people with health issues or age, riding the bike on the streets of Toronto is not an option, they need to be in their cars due to disability or health challenges. Or take the subway and not worry about bikes getting them stuck unable to leave, or dirty them. Please get rid of the bike lanes, and get the city moving again! Police officers should also be encouraged to ticket the bike riders since most of them break the rules of the road.\n",

What will actually happen is that the lucky developers who conveniently\/coincidentally own land along the route will develop the land - which is remote and will not have any public transit development associated - attracting additional traffic and quickly creating new gridlock.\n- the removal of existing bike lanes seems suspiciously aimed at the Premier's route into Queen's Park.  the government has cited how low the bike riding numbers are, without acknowledging that cycling infrastructure development in the GTA is quite limited compared to the best examples in other cities.

        "comment":"Bill 212, the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act,\" has several concerning implications that could negatively impact Ontario's communities and environment:\n1. **Environmental Concerns**: The bill exempts certain highway projects, like Highway 413, from the Environmental Assessment Act, potentially leading to significant ecological damage and loss of green spaces. This undermines efforts to protect Ontario's natural environment.\n2. **Impact on Local Governance**: By overriding municipal by-laws related to construction, the bill diminishes local governments' authority to manage land use and infrastructure development, which can lead to poorly planned projects that do not consider community needs.\n3. **Safety Risks**: The bill restricts the construction of bike lanes and other pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, which could make streets less safe for cyclists and pedestrians, contradicting efforts to promote sustainable transportation.\n4. **Expropriation Issues**: The legislation allows for expedited land expropriation without adequate hearings or compensation processes, raising concerns about property rights and fairness for affected landowners.\nIn summary, while the intent to reduce gridlock is commendable, the methods proposed in Bill 212 could lead to environmental degradation, reduced local control, safety hazards, and unfair treatment of property owners. These factors make the bill problematic for the future of Ontario.\n",

        "comment":"Induced Demand Explained\nInduced demand refers to the phenomenon where increasing the supply of a good or service leads to a rise in its consumption. In transportation, this means that when road capacity is expanded\u2014such as by adding lanes or building new highways\u2014more vehicles tend to use those roads. This occurs because the perceived ease of travel encourages more people to drive, including those who might have previously used public transport or traveled at off-peak times. As a result, the new road capacity quickly fills up, often leading to the same or even worse congestion than before.\nImpact of Bill 212 on Gridlock\nBill 212 in Ontario aims to expedite road construction and expand highway capacity, which could exacerbate traffic congestion due to induced demand. By promoting the construction of new highways and lanes without adequately addressing public transit or alternative transportation options, the bill is likely to attract more drivers to these routes. This influx can lead to increased traffic volumes, negating the intended benefits of reduced congestion.\nMoreover, the bill's focus on expanding road infrastructure may divert attention and resources away from sustainable transportation solutions, such as public transit improvements or cycling infrastructure, further entrenching car dependency and contributing to urban sprawl. Consequently, rather than alleviating gridlock, Bill 212 could lead to a cycle of increased traffic and congestion, illustrating the complexities of transportation planning and the challenges posed by induced demand.\nIn summary, while the intention behind Bill 212 may be to improve traffic flow, it risks increasing gridlock due to the principles of induced demand, ultimately undermining effective transportation solutions in Ontario.\n",

Voici quelques points cl\u00e9s :\n### Avantages des pistes cyclables sur Bloor Street\n1. **S\u00e9curit\u00e9 accrue** : Les pistes cyclables cr\u00e9ent un environnement plus s\u00fbr pour les cyclistes, r\u00e9duisant ainsi les accidents et les blessures. Cela encourage davantage de personnes \u00e0 utiliser le v\u00e9lo comme moyen de transport.\n2. **Impact \u00e9conomique positif** : Des \u00e9tudes montrent que les commerces le long de Bloor Street b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de l'augmentation du nombre de clients qui arrivent \u00e0 v\u00e9lo ou \u00e0 pied. En effet, les cyclistes d\u00e9pensent souvent plus que les automobilistes.\n3. **R\u00e9duction de la congestion** : En favorisant l'utilisation du v\u00e9lo, les pistes cyclables contribuent \u00e0 diminuer le trafic automobile, ce qui peut r\u00e9duire les temps de trajet pour tous les usagers de la route.\n4. **Am\u00e9lioration de la qualit\u00e9 de l'air** : Moins de voitures sur la route signifie moins d'\u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, ce qui est b\u00e9n\u00e9fique pour l'environnement et la sant\u00e9 publique.\n### N\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de prot\u00e9ger les pistes cyclables contre le projet de loi 212\nLe projet de loi 212, qui vise \u00e0 retirer certaines pistes cyclables, y compris celles de Bloor Street, pourrait avoir des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9sastreuses. Voici pourquoi il est crucial de s'opposer \u00e0 cette l\u00e9gislation :\n- **Retour \u00e0 la circulation automobile** : La suppression des pistes cyclables pourrait entra\u00eener une augmentation du trafic, aggravant ainsi la congestion et les probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n- **Menace pour la sant\u00e9 publique** : Moins de cyclistes signifie plus de pollution et moins d'opportunit\u00e9s pour les citoyens de rester actifs, ce qui peut nuire \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la population.\n- **Ignorer les besoins des usagers** : Le projet de loi semble privil\u00e9gier les automobilistes au d\u00e9triment des cyclistes et des pi\u00e9tons, qui repr\u00e9sentent une part croissante de la population urbaine.\nIl est donc essentiel de d\u00e9fendre les pistes cyclables sur Bloor Street et de s'opposer \u00e0 des mesures qui pourraient nuire \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 de vie des citoyens.

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed Bill 212, specifically the provision that calls for the removal of established bike lanes on major streets such as Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. The bill explicitly states it will \"provide for the removal of the bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. in the City of Toronto and to return them to a lane of traffic\"\u200b\n. This approach is fundamentally flawed and poses significant risks to the city's transportation ecosystem, public safety, and environmental goals.\n1. Public Safety Risks: Removing these bike lanes will undoubtedly endanger the lives of cyclists, forcing them into shared lanes with motor vehicles. Protected bike lanes significantly reduce the risk of accidents, providing a safe space for cyclists who would otherwise be at higher risk of collisions with cars. Research has shown that cities with robust cycling infrastructure experience fewer traffic fatalities and injuries. The decision to eliminate these safe spaces directly contradicts the goal of making our streets safer for all users, including pedestrians, who also benefit from the reduced risk of cars veering onto sidewalks when bike lanes are present.\n2. Worsening Traffic Congestion: The bill's intent to reduce gridlock by increasing vehicle lanes is counterintuitive. Studies in urban planning repeatedly show that expanding road space for cars only encourages more driving, a phenomenon known as induced demand. By removing bike lanes, the government will likely push many current cyclists back into cars, increasing the number of vehicles on the road. This influx will exacerbate congestion rather than alleviate it. On Bloor Street alone, bike lanes currently accommodate thousands of cyclists daily. Eliminating these lanes could result in a significant increase in cars, negating any potential traffic improvements the bill seeks to achieve\u200b\n3. Environmental and Public Health Setbacks: Encouraging more car usage by removing bike lanes would directly undermine efforts to combat climate change and reduce emissions. The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in Ontario. Promoting active transportation, such as cycling, is a key strategy in reducing our carbon footprint. Bike lanes not only help lower emissions but also reduce noise pollution and improve air quality, contributing to better public health. By removing this infrastructure, the bill disregards these critical environmental benefits and sets us back in our fight against climate change.\n4. Economic Implications and Misuse of Taxpayer Funds: Eliminating bike lanes would waste substantial public investments already made in developing these lanes. Data from the Bloor Street BIA show that since the installation of bike lanes, local businesses have seen increased foot traffic and sales, as cyclists are more likely to stop and shop. The economic benefits of well-placed bike lanes are well-documented, with many studies highlighting their positive impact on local commerce. Removing these lanes would disrupt this economic activity, potentially harming businesses that have come to rely on the increased footfall from cyclists\u200b\n5. Overreach in Municipal Affairs: This bill represents an overreach of provincial authority into municipal planning, stripping cities like Toronto of their ability to make transportation decisions tailored to their local needs. Toronto's city planners and community consultations have repeatedly supported the expansion of cycling infrastructure as a vital part of the city's transportation strategy. By overriding these local decisions, the provincial government is disregarding the voices of residents and experts who have carefully studied the benefits of bike lanes.\nIn conclusion, Bill 212 is a step in the wrong direction. It prioritizes short-term traffic flow over long-term solutions that could lead to a safer, healthier, and more sustainable city. Instead of dismantling existing cycling infrastructure, the government should be investing in expanding it, enhancing public transit options, and implementing policies that reduce car dependency. I strongly urge the government to reconsider this bill and protect the bike lanes that have become an integral part of Toronto's transportation network and urban landscape.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 212, known as the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act,\" has raised significant concerns regarding its potential to worsen traffic congestion and incur high costs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of why this legislation could have these negative impacts:\nIncreased Congestion\n1. Removal of Bike Lanes: One of the key components of Bill 212 is the removal of bike lanes on major roads. This decision is expected to lead to more cars on the road, as fewer people will feel safe cycling. Studies indicate that bike lanes help reduce overall vehicle congestion by encouraging cycling and walking, which in turn decreases the number of cars on the road.\n2. School Traffic: A substantial portion of morning rush hour congestion is attributed to school drop-offs. By discouraging active transportation options like biking, Bill 212 could exacerbate this issue, leading to even more vehicles on the roads during peak times.\nHigh Costs\n1. Financial Implications: The city of Toronto has estimated that dismantling existing bike lanes could cost taxpayers at least **$48 million**. This includes not only the loss of previous investments in bike infrastructure but also the costs associated with redesigning streets and managing construction disruptions.\n2. Long-Term Inefficiencies: The removal of bike lanes is unlikely to yield significant long-term benefits for car travel times. In fact, the construction phase alone could worsen traffic conditions for months, leading to increased frustration and delays for drivers.\nEnvironmental and Health Concerns\nBeyond congestion and costs, the bill could also hinder efforts to promote healthier, more sustainable transportation options. The removal of bike lanes may lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, as more people revert to driving instead of cycling or walking. This contradicts broader goals of reducing pollution and improving public health.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is poised to create a cycle of increased congestion and financial burden while undermining efforts to promote sustainable transportation.\n",

        "comment":"Adding extra lanes to a road might seem like a straightforward solution to reduce congestion, but it often leads to reduced capacity and efficiency. Here\u2019s why:\n1. Induced Demand\nWhen you add more lanes, you might think it will ease traffic. However, this often leads to induced demand, where more drivers are encouraged to use the road, ultimately filling those new lanes. It\u2019s like loosening your belt to fight obesity\u2014counterproductive, right? More lanes can attract more cars, leading to the same or even worse congestion over time.\n2. Braess's Paradox\nThis phenomenon, known as Braess's Paradox, suggests that adding roads can actually slow down overall traffic flow. When drivers choose routes based on their own interests, the addition of a new lane can disrupt the optimal flow, causing longer travel times for everyone. It\u2019s a classic case of \u201ctoo many cooks spoil the broth,\u201d but in this case, it\u2019s too many lanes spoiling the traffic flow.\n3. Diminishing Returns\nEach additional lane provides diminishing returns in terms of capacity. Research shows that wider lanes do not significantly increase road capacity. For instance, a 3-meter lane has about 93% of the capacity of a 3.6-meter lane. So, the difference isn\u2019t as impactful as one might expect.\n4. Increased Speeds and Safety Concerns\nWider lanes can lead to higher speeds, which paradoxically increases the likelihood of accidents. When drivers feel they have more space, they may drive faster, leading to more severe crashes. This can create a less efficient road environment overall, as accidents cause delays and congestion.\n5. Impact on Alternative Transportation\nMore lanes often mean less space for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport. This can discourage these modes of transport, leading to a reliance on cars and further congestion. A well-balanced transportation network is crucial for efficiency, and prioritizing cars over other forms can undermine that balance.\nConclusion\nIn summary, while adding lanes might seem like a quick fix for traffic woes, it often leads to increased congestion, reduced efficiency, and safety concerns. A more holistic approach that considers all modes of transportation is essential for creating a truly efficient road network.\n",

In Toronto, it seems residents need more encouragement, not less, to ditch their cars or leave them at home more often. Bike lanes encourage cycling not just for commutes to and from work and school but for all kinds of errands and recreation. This is a lop sided change. Why make it harder and less attractive to cycle? This just puts more people into cars to create more congestion and more pollution. Bike lanes are so much safer. When I am cycling  on roads without a bike lane I am against the curb and am frequently cut off by cars who cut closely in front of me totally ignoring the supposedly required distance of three feet. If I can't find a route with a bike lane for most of the route I will try to TTC although with the TTC becoming less and less reliable I do sometimes feel like I have to drive. If Toronto's best bike lanes are reduced I'll be in my car all the time to the detriment of the air and to congestion. Why doesn't Doug Ford put the $200 rebate towards improving TTC? Better TTC combined with MORE rather than less bike lanes would be the way to reduce congestion and pollution.\n",

        "comment":"I am a 40 year resident of Scarborough Ontario who regularly cycles to my job downtown in the City of Toronto. My wife over the past 4 years has had jobs in the downtown area and in the middle of Scarborough, and she cycles every day to work.\nThe bike lanes save my family between $5,000 and $8,000 every single year because we no longer own a truck. I owned a 2003 Honda Pilot, a large 8 seat SUV, but only drove to work when I broke my leg in the middle of winter.  The added stress on the vehicle caused by driving every day downtown and back to Scarborough led to one of the highest maintenance bills over the last ten years, and I believe significantly contributed to the vehicles decline. I broke my leg in 2018, before the pandemic and before bike lanes on Bloor Street East or Danforth Avenue.\nAt the start of the pandemic, before the bike lanes on Danforth Avenue were installed, I was forced to cycle with my wife each morning to the downtown where she worked and then race back to our home to start my day. Even with the reduced volume of cars, cycling in the morning without protected cycling infrastructure was dangerous. I continued to cycle with her after the protected bike lanes were installed to Dawes Road, both for the increased safety in numbers and because we enjoyed the morning commute.  She, a small Asian woman, continued to cycle all winter long. I previously would never cycle to my office from Scarborough during the winter because it was too dangerous to do without the protected bike lanes.  In order to ride safely with the rest of the traffic on an unprotected street, I need to maintain a high rate of speed. If I cannot maintain the high rate of speed, then I risk being hit from behind or sideswiped by a distracted driver. In the winter, maintaining a high rate of speed is dangerous because if I hit a patch of snow, ice, salt; or if a car turns in front of me, I will likely not be able to maintain my balance.  Protected bike lanes which are cleared of snow & ice all winter long have allowed us to cycle to and from our work safely.  Protected bike lanes save my family between $5,000 and $8,000 every single year.\nThis past summer I had an early morning medical appointment in the downtown hospital district. On my bike I noticed something about the riders along my commute:  There were A LOT of women, and A LOT of new cyclists. These people were along Danforth Avenue, Dundas, Shuter Street in sufficient numbers that I would argue the bike lanes were congested for a speedy cyclist like myself.  Protected cycling infrastructure allows all manner of people, rich and poor, to get into biking as a mode of transportation. Ripping out these lanes will either force these people onto dangerous streets or back into their car ... causing more congestion through traffic fatalities or additional cars on the road. Emergency trips by an ambulance to one of the hospitals in the downtown are easier now with the bike lane on University avenue because those lanes are wide enough for an emergency vehicle to drive up or down.  Same for police cars. Maybe same for fire trucks.\nMy wife now works in the west end of Toronto. The route by car avoids all bike lanes across the Scarborough to the 401, across to the west end of Toronto, and south to her work. The estimated google trip in each morning is 55 minutes, without an accident on the 401. It takes her 63 minutes to cycle the 18 kilometers through the traffic and construction. Biking is about the same speed as taking the highway where there are no bike lanes. We are both in favour of keeping the existing bike lanes.\nThe bike lanes in Toronto did not cause the congestion. 20+ years ago when I was a student at the University of Toronto Scarborough College, I saw Ellesmere packed each morning bumper to bumper. After graduating I took a language course downtown at UofT, offering to drive to the hospital district to pick up my classmate once because the congestion was insane and frustrating. This was 20 years ago when there were fewer people in the downtown, fewer condos, and fewer cars.  It is not possible to out-supply demand for the road, more so when that road is free to use.  I strongly advise the panel to use their powers to install more cycling infrastructure in the City of Toronto, all other large important cities and encourage smaller cities to build out protected bike lanes.\nTo summarize:  I live in Scarborough, commuting ~12 KM to an office every days. I save $5,000-$8,000 each year, more than 10% of after tax income, because I don't have a car.  My car died during the pandemic and even though I make decent money I cannot afford a new car.  The protected bike infrastructure should be expanded. Congestion has been an issue for a long time & ripping out the bike infrastructure will not solve congestion.\n",

        "comment":"Opposing Ontario's Bill 212 is crucial, especially when you consider the troubling parallels to the Greenbelt scandal. This bill seems to be another instance where the interests of Doug Ford's friends and donors take precedence over the needs of everyday Ontarians.\nKickbacks and Conflicts of Interest\nJust like the Greenbelt debacle, where developers with close ties to the Ford government stood to gain billions, Bill 212 raises serious concerns about favoritism. The bill is being framed as a solution to congestion, but many see it as a way to benefit a select group of wealthy insiders. It\u2019s hard not to wonder: who really stands to gain from these changes?\nLack of Transparency\nThe Greenbelt scandal revealed a lack of transparency in decision-making, with processes bypassed to favor certain developers. Bill 212 appears to follow the same playbook. When decisions are made behind closed doors, it breeds distrust. Ontarians deserve to know how these policies are crafted and who is influencing them.\nFinancial Implications\nThe financial implications of Bill 212 could mirror those of the Greenbelt land removals, where taxpayers might end up footing the bill for decisions that primarily benefit a few. If this bill leads to costly infrastructure changes or legal battles, it\u2019s the public that will bear the burden, while the well-connected profit.\nConclusion\nIn summary, Bill 212 is not just about traffic\u2014it\u2019s about accountability and fairness. We need to ensure that our government prioritizes the needs of all citizens, not just a privileged few. Let\u2019s learn from the mistakes of the past and demand transparency and integrity in our legislative processes. What do you think? How can we push for better governance?\n",

        "comment":"Opposing Ontario's Bill 212 is essential, especially when we consider the significant role bike lanes play in Toronto's daily life. Here\u2019s why this bill is a step in the wrong direction:\nHigh Use of Bike Lanes\nIn Toronto, bike lanes are not just a luxury; they are a vital part of the transportation network. Many residents rely on biking for their daily activities\u2014commuting to work, running errands, or simply enjoying the city. Removing these lanes would disrupt the routines of countless cyclists who depend on safe routes to navigate the streets. Studies show that bike lanes encourage more people to cycle, promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing traffic congestion.\nIncreased Risk of Deaths\nBill 212 poses a serious threat to safety. By eliminating bike lanes, we risk increasing the number of accidents involving cyclists and pedestrians. In 2024 alone, Toronto has seen multiple cyclist fatalities, highlighting the dangers of inadequate cycling infrastructure. Without dedicated lanes, cyclists are forced to share space with motor vehicles, leading to a higher likelihood of collisions and, tragically, deaths.\nImpact on Small Businesses\nThe removal of bike lanes could also hurt local businesses. Many small shops and cafes benefit from the foot traffic that bike lanes generate. Cyclists often stop to shop or grab a bite, contributing to the local economy. If bike lanes are taken away, we could see a decline in customers, which would be detrimental to these businesses already struggling in a competitive market.\nWorsening Traffic and Gridlock\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about traffic. Bill 212 is touted as a solution to gridlock, but history shows that adding more lanes for cars often leads to more congestion. With fewer bike lanes, more people will revert to driving, exacerbating traffic issues. This creates a vicious cycle: more cars lead to more congestion, which leads to calls for even more road expansions\u2014none of which effectively solve the problem.\nConclusion\nIn summary, Bill 212 threatens the safety of cyclists and pedestrians, jeopardizes small businesses, and will likely worsen traffic congestion. Instead of removing bike lanes, we should be investing in safer, more efficient infrastructure that supports all modes of transportation. Let\u2019s advocate for a city that prioritizes safety, accessibility, and economic vitality for everyone.\n",

I am deeply disturbed by the thought that the province would decide to remove high quality transportation infrastructure, especially in the face of clear evidence of it's benefit economically, environmentally, and socially. I believe removing provided cycling infrastructure also fundamentally impacts the ability to freely (and safely) move around our cities for our young people, those with disabilities, and those who can't drive.\n",

I consider them to be essential for my daily life, much like sidewalks and roads\n3.\tSafety of cyclists is important, and we can help by adding visual, and physical barricades to ensure cyclist safety.\n4.\tStudents. Highschool, college, and middle school students as well as seniors, often commute by bicycle due to the lower cost opposed to driving. By reducing bike lanes, we are directly putting these groups at risk unnecessarily.\n5.\tAs a driver, I would much rather cyclists be in designated areas so they don\u2019t have to be navigated around the road way. Without bike lanes, cyclist will inevitably end up using roads, and sidewalks (which should be legal when bike lanes are absent), this creates danger for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians.\n6.\tBy having bike lanes connect to transit stations, we can reduce the number of cars on the road. This would reduce gridlock more effectively than adding more lanes.\nIn conclusion, I think bike infrastructure is absolutely essential to any urban landscape to diversify commute options for the community.\n",

Those deaths were caused by collisions with cars, the same cars this province is choosing to prioritize over the very lives of many who choose to travel by bicycle through the city. The promise that removing bike lanes and adding car lanes is not backed by any evidential research. What is back by evidence, is that bike lanes create a safer environment for people to travel by bike, which not only saves lives, but also reduces vehicular traffic by encouraging people to use alternative forms of movement through the city.\nThe provinces statements are clear - lives and safety do not matter as much as supposed reduced traffic. Where will the cyclists that still use these routes go? On the road with the cars, increasing risks of accidents. Nice choice.\n",

        "comment":"Exemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act for Highway 413 should not be granted. The Assessments should not be rushed through as the new highway will be cutting through farmland, the Greenbelt and Nashville Conservation Area in Kleinberg. These areas are vital for wildlife and wild plants that are declining in population due to development. It is short sighted to disrupt these areas without proper understanding of the impacts. The Greenbelt absorbs rainwater preventing flooding, provides food for Ontario's people and provides habitat for wildlife. Without these vital resources and ecosystem services the province will be less equipped to deal with the coming changes in climate and the increases in population. We should be steering away from cars and highways and if transportation issues are arising investments should be made in public transit and making walk-able cities and towns.\nThere is no evidence that the removal of bike lanes will decrease traffic congestion. In the short term removing the Bloor, Yonge and University bike lanes will cost $48 million according to Toronto City Council and disrupt Toronto traffic for two years. That is an unacceptable cost and that money could be used to do something that actually benefits the people of Ontario. We should be building more bikes lanes not removing them. More safe cycling infrastructure will encourage more people to cycle around the city, this will reduce traffic congestion. This money and time should be put into finishing the transit projects around the city such as the overdue Eglinton Crosstown or investing in the TTC that is woefully underfunded. The solution to traffic congestion is not to remove bike lanes it is to get cars off the road with better public transit and cycling infrastructure. The less cars the better air quality and the lower the CO2 emissions. Cars are also prohibitively expensive and impracticable for many people living and working in Toronto. People like me who cycle everywhere are going to be put in danger if this act goes through.\n",

There is no immediate need for them and so fast tracking does not make sense.\nRegarding Hwy 413:  400 acres of the Greenbelt and 2000 acres of farmland would be paved over to make way for Highway 413. First of all, the Greenbelt is supposed to be protected - the Ford government already agreed not to touch the Greenbelt. And for farms, already too many farms have been removed surrounding Mississauga. We need this to stop. Ontario doesn't grow enough food to feed itself, but it could and should. With the Canadian dollar weakening, and food insecurity made clear when CoVID hit, we need more farms, not less.\nThese highways come at a huge cost which is not well substantiated. They would allow housing to be built way out in the middle of nowhere, in other words sprawl. That does not help traffic, that puts more cars on the roads. If you want to reduce congestion, highway 407 is sitting there already built and ready to be used. The money allotted for 413 could be used to subsidize 407. I am not opposed to tolls, but the pricing is extremely high and needs to be reduced to about 20% of what it is. Perhaps even make it free for large trucks shipping goods. You could reduce congestion with immediate results by doing so.\n",

It makes roads more dangerous not only for bikers, but also pedestrians. With fewer bike lanes, it encourages more people to stop biking and to drive due the lack of walkable communities. Why does a provincial power such as Doug Ford need the feeling to change what communities want for the public infrastructure when it is supposed to be a municipal decision. Overall I think this bill is a bad idea and it should not be allowed to pass.\n",

Multiple studies (including our own internal government documents) have shown that building more highways does not reduce traffic, they just allow for more cars on the road. We are going to waste billions of dollars on a project that will negatively impact our environment and agricultural sector. If we want to reduce traffic and put money into our cities and infrastructure, put that money into desperately needed public transit improvements.\nI'm also opposed to the proposal to bypass important checks and balances before projects, including environmental assessments. These are in place to protect people and our environments and I see no reason why we would want to make any of our projects exempt to processes that have been put in place for our protection.\nFinally leave the bike lanes alone. The time, money and traffic you'll cause with construction to pull them out is ridiculous. Pulling bike lanes just makes it more dangerous for bikers and drivers, plus cities are reporting that emergency service response times have improved in areas with bike lanes, not the opposite.\n",

        "comment":"I have strong reservations about Ontario's Bill 212 and its implications for our communities. First and foremost, I believe that the bill undermines local governance by allowing the provincial government to remove bike lanes and other infrastructure without proper consultation with municipal councils. This top-down approach feels dismissive of the voices of residents and local officials who truly understand the needs of their communities. Decisions about public spaces should be made where they matter most\u2014at the local level.\nMoreover, I\u2019m particularly concerned about the environmental impact of the bill, especially regarding the expedited construction of highways. Bypassing environmental assessments for projects like Highway 413 could lead to significant ecological harm and worsen traffic congestion in the long run. It seems counterproductive to rush into construction without thoroughly evaluating the consequences, which could ultimately compromise the quality of life for residents.\nFinancially, the bill raises red flags for me as well. The costs associated with removing existing bike lanes and potentially needing new infrastructure could strain municipal budgets that are already tight. I believe the province should focus on investing in sustainable transportation options rather than dismantling infrastructure that encourages cycling and reduces car dependency. This shift could lead to increased traffic and pollution, which goes against the bill's stated goals of improving mobility.\nIn summary, I feel that Bill 212 needs a more collaborative approach that respects local decision-making and prioritizes sustainable development. It\u2019s crucial that we listen to our communities and work together to create solutions that truly benefit everyone.\n",

        "comment":"ERO 019-9265      Response to Bill 212: Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act (specifically, sections regarding the restriction of bike lanes)\nI do not support the above legislation for the following reasons: it does not respect local democracy and municipal planning decisions; it will make it much more difficult or even impossible for Toronto to meet its climate emissions goals, specifically the city\u2019s target to become carbon neutral by 2040; and the 48 million dollar price tag will put more cyclists in danger without achieving the professed goal of reducing traffic congestion.\n1. Lack of Respect for Local Democracy\nThe City of Toronto (and other Ontario municipalities) is better able to make planning decisions based on local needs and local priorities than the provincial government. In the document \u201cImpact of Bill 212: Bike Lanes Framework\u201d, the Toronto city manager summarizes the impact of this legislation in a detailed, meticulously researched report. Among its conclusions, it states that \u201cthe absence of bikeways has a disproportionately negative impact on low-income communities and Indigenous, Black and other communities of colour.\u201d It notes that Toronto is the busiest city in North America due to construction and that \u201cthe reduced network capacity due to construction-related road closures is a primary factor contributing to congestion across the city.\u201d\nMunicipalities, like Toronto, know what their residents need and have local knowledge about the challenges they face, including gridlock. In fact, it is their responsibility as locally elected municipal governments to make these decisions.\n2. Climate Goals\nTo achieve Toronto city council\u2019s goal to become carbon neutral by 2040, it will have to reduce emissions from passenger vehicles which account for almost a quarter of its GHG emissions. The city has increased funding and capacity to expand and improve its cycling network, \u201cspending $30 million on bikeways in 2023, the most it has ever invested in a single year\u201d (Toronto Star, \u2018A truly poisonous intervention\u2019, September 26, 2024). In the same article, authors Kate Allen and Mahdis Habibinia state, \u201cstaff reports have consistently found that adding and improving [bike] lanes results in vastly more cyclists on these roads. At Adelaide and Richmond Streets at Spadina Avenue, for example, cyclist counts jumped from 562 in 2013 to 3,763 in 2022, an increase of 570 per cent, and the number of people using the city\u2019s Bike Share system spiked from about 665,000 trips in 2015 to more than 4.5 million in 2022.\u201d\nThe Transportation Tomorrow Survey, done in partnership with the province and Golden Horseshoe municipalities to support planning for transportation infrastructure, shows that in 2022, 5.8% of city commuters took bikes or other forms of \u201cmicromobility\u201d to work. The number of daily cycling trips has more than tripled in two decades (55,000 in 2001 to 172,000+ in 2022).  People are choosing to use bikes, scooters, etc. to get around. That means fewer cars on the road, and more people able to get to where they\u2019re going without getting into a car.\nEven so, Toronto has a long way to go to meet its climate targets and needs to take many more gas-powered cars off the road. Patricia Wood, a professor in York University\u2019s Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change, sums it up: \u201cSo to have the province even float the idea of reducing the possibility to create space for active transportation by prioritizing private automobiles over bike lanes is a truly poisonous intervention \u2026 even debating this only drags us backwards and wastes our time.\u201d\n3. Bike Lanes Save Lives\nAccording to a Toronto Star editorial (September 25, 2024), research from around the world has shown that bike lanes separated from cars improve the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and motorists: \u201cAn American study published last November in the Journal of Transport and Health \u2026 found that protected bike lanes make roads significantly safer for cyclists and other users. Cities with dedicated bike lanes had 44 per cent fewer deaths and 50 per cent fewer serious accidents than other American cities\u201d.  The city manager\u2019s Bike Impact report reveals that, \u201cresearch and experience from across North America and around the world have shown that a connected and safe cycling network is a key part of mitigating congestion in a growing city, while improving safety and mobility\u2026.Independent peer-reviewed research has shown that the introduction of separated bikeways reduces the risk of cycling injury (about 9 times lower than a major street with parked cars and no cycling infrastructure). It also increases the feeling of comfort and safety for all road users.\nMy husband and I cycled in Germany in 2019 and can attest to that feeling of comfort and safety when we were able to cycle for long distances in separated bike lanes. They were an accepted part of the transportation infrastructure.\n4. Blaming Bike Lanes for Congestion is Not Supported by Research\nBoth the Toronto Star editorial and the city manager\u2019s report reiterate that \u201cit isn\u2019t cyclists and bike lanes that are the main culprits in creating gridlock. It is construction, road closures and traffic returning to pre-pandemic levels\u2026. [I]n Paris, London and other metropolises, these lanes have often had the opposite effect [to gridlock], leading to more cyclists and fewer cars on the road.\u201d Even \u201csmall reductions in the number of vehicles on the road can produce large improvements in traffic flow\u201d.\n5. $48 Million Dollars\nTaxpayers will be on the hook for $48 million dollars (plus other costs the city of Toronto and other municipalities will face) to tear out bike lanes that will make the roads more dangerous, and won\u2019t solve the problem of gridlock. This is a very expensive, ill-considered gambit.\nI would suggest a better name for this bill would be \u201cFailing to Reduce Gridlock, Endangering Lives For No Good Reason Act\u201d.\n",

Myself and my family (including two children under age 10) regularly use the bike lanes to traverse the City of Toronto, including those that are immediately targeted for removal (without any sense of if\/when alternatives would be provided).

It is shameful to see politicians selfishly ignore the abundant evidence. This move will not ease traffic congestion, it detracts from the viability of the cycling network in Toronto that is only just coming together, and only serves to make vulnerable road users more exposed to risk. It is a cynical move that tramples municipal democratic decision-making in order to create a political wedge issue at the expense of the safety and well-being of families like mine.

The province need not create any new regulations on cities lest it boat the bureaucracy, duplicate checks and impede local development.\nThe province is better off using those funds on health care, the economy and regional transportation and leave local transportation to the cities.\nBike lanes are clearly a local issue that does not warrant a discussion at the provincial level as it's the cities who tax and spend on them and other local transportation projects making input from MPPs from 'out-off-town' an overreach and renders the money and time that councils spend a waste of they allow the provincial government's bureaucracy the power to overrule and over review their decisions. I don't live in Toronto not does it make sense for me to tell them what to do and for my tax dollars to pay for removing or adding any of their infrastructure at such a minute level without their consent.\nWhen and if a local decision is made, the people if that city or town will work with their local councils to make the best decision for themselves based on evidence. The province has not the resources and research to demonstrate an empirical need to up load bike lanes specifically.\nPeople at the local level know what's best to protect themselves and deal with their transportation needs. Bike lanes can and do help with reducing cars on the road and increase the safety of everyone using publicly funded infrastructure.\nOn the environment, it's without saying but to say it, evidence is needed in order to protect it. If the government keeps bypassing any review then it will suffer to everyone's detriment. Being ignorant on purpose is to proceed with arrogance. Any infrastructure project at a large scale should go through a review process to allow the public to know the impacts and decide if they still wish to spend their tax dollars on it.\n",

The proposal to expedite highway construction and expropriate properties to make room for these projects raises concerns about potential impacts on local communities and, importantly, on cyclists' safety.\nExpanding highways could lead to increased traffic and pollution, ultimately undermining efforts to encourage greener modes of transportation, like cycling. Moreover, if infrastructure planning continues to prioritize cars over alternative transportation methods, it could make our cities less bike-friendly, thus negatively impacting the safety and well-being of cyclists.\nI believe that while highway construction projects are important, they should not come at the expense of alternative transport solutions that are better for the environment and public health. A more balanced approach that includes investments in cycling infrastructure, alongside improvements to highways, would be more beneficial to all Ontarians in the long term.\n",

        "comment":"This bill is an overstep and gross mishandling of tax dollars.\nFirstly I will cover what the media has covered:\nThe handling of bike lanes by adding more bureaucracy on a provincial level not only makes it even more expensive and tedious to build. It also brings the representation and autonomy of municipalities into further question. What is the point of a mayor and a municipality if they can't even build bike lanes?\nNot only does it affect that, it also is a safety hazard. Bloor St's bike lane was built because people died biking on it. There was an elderly lady who was dragged under a truck biking on the road. Bike lanes, protected bike lanes, protect people.\nBike lanes also reduce traffic. As people are given the option to bike, they won't take the car. Each car on the road increases traffic exponentially. (please refer to link1). So by removing bike lanes, congestion will only increase as it leaves more space for cars, which will be filled up by cars quickly.\nThe financial cost of this is also something to question. These bike lanes are young. And cost a few million to install already. Then to remove them, it will cost even more millions of dollars. It is a waste of money to sate the feelings of a few people who see cyclists pass them in traffic.\nMind you, the cyclist being faster than the car, despite cars having more lanes than bikes, should be a suggestion to think that perhaps cars are not an ideal mode of transportation.\nNow onto the meat of the bill:\nThis bill pushes forth Highway 413. A highway that bypasses the 401 and the 407 by bypassing Brampton while going from Vaughan to the edge of Mississauga.\nFirstly this highway does not seem to be helpful in any regard. It is a large detour for most motorists. To add to this, if highway 413 was a toll road, it would reduce its impact even more as people would not use it.\nOnce again referring to the study (among others that exist), more vehicles means more traffic. Meaning more space for cars and trucks means more cars and trucks, means more traffic. Highway 413, if used effectively by the people, will only cause more traffic in the area and would not reduce congestion in the long term. Your own documents show this.\nThe financial cost of highway 413 is also quite high, and it would be a long construction project with not only a large environmental impact, but also a large cost. $4 billion is a conservative estimate of the cost. This cost could be used elsewhere to actually provide alternatives to cars, thus relieving congestion.\nWe could be building rails to increase service on the GO. Not just on the lakeshore lines, but also in other areas. What if we connected the rails between Bramela and Lisgar to allow freight to bypass more of the GTA. This would allow GO trains greater access to the rail network that exists in the GTA, providing much greater connection than any highway could provide. An example of this can be found in Link3.\nYou might ask \"how much better can a train be?\" The daily average ridership of GO Transit in 2024 was 275,900 people.\nThat rivals parts of the 401 in people moved. And that is with a considerably smaller footprint, and a fairly cheaper operation (especially if you include the cost of a each individual vehicle). If we expanded the service of the GO, not only in frequency on existing lines, but also opening new lines on previous freight lines, this would provide a much greater relief to traffic by providing the alternative to driving that many people need and want.\nThis car-based obsession is a ridiculous notion that must be left behind. I myself enjoy a good drive now and then, but I do not enjoy traffic, and I do not enjoy the stress of driving on a busy highway. I like many others, would rather and do take the train when possible and convenient. We should strive to provide alternatives to driving, not because we don't want people to drive, but because we want people to have the CHOICE to choose to drive or not to. At the moment the design of the GTA is very car-oriented, to the chagrin of many residents who for various reasons either suffer financially by having to maintain a car, or cannot drive due to disability, or are otherwise stressed and infuriated by the inability to access amenities because it is only reasonably accessible by car.\nI implore you to scrap the majority of this bill. All it will do is cost the province money and increase traffic.\n",

        "comment":"This bill is shortsighted and will not solve the problems it claims to solve. Regarding giving the province more powers over bike lanes, it very much appears to be a personal vendetta of Doug Ford against the City of Toronto in wanting to remove existing bicycle lanes along Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. Bicycle usage is rapidly increasing in cities across Canada as a viable alternative to driving a motor vehicle for commuting to work, running errands, and generally getting around town. Usage has dramatically increased in Toronto in particular - consider the fact the the number of bike share trips has increased roughly tenfold in the last 10 years from 600k annual trips to 6 million (and I myself ride almost every day!). Bike lanes are necessary to separate bicycles from motor vehicles, as they are really a separate class of vehicles that should not mix with motor vehicles. Without bike lanes, people riding bicycles will have no choice but to ride on the road in front of cars and trucks, which is not only more dangerous, but will increase gridlock as more users clog the streets (since there would not longer be a bike lane for the bicycles to ride in). Doug Ford himself rode a bicycle in Toronto along with Jagmeet Singh, and stated that he felt safer riding in the bike lanes than on the road, and that it was important to reduce cyclist deaths in the province.\nFurthermore, the proposal to accelerate the development of highway 413 is also shortsighted and will have negative impacts. Numerous studies have been conducted multiple times that this new megahighway will, in the long term, not save drivers a meaningful amount of time in their commutes. A better solution would involve opening up the highway 407 ETR (which is in debt to the government of Ontario) to transport trucks. This would actually help reduce congestion on the 401 as larger vehicles could use a completely separate highway to travel east\/west in the GTA while passenger vehicles can continue using the 401. Additionally, it is also known that simply creating more highways will create induced demand, encouraging more people to drive rather than take other forms of transportation. The only effective way of reducing traffic is to offer viable alternatives to driving to get more drivers off of the road. Which means to invest in higher quality, more frequent, and more options for public transportation. Finally, the ecological impacts of building the megahighway are also severe. The proposed route takes highway 413 through some of Ontario and Canada's best and most productive farmland. Canada as a whole has less than 5% of its territory as arable land. Why are we destroying some of out most productive farmland for a false promise of more convenience for drivers? With the climate crisis in full swing, we need to invest in resiliency, and this includes investing in local, sustainable agriculture - not reducing it.\n",

I take my bike all the time because it is significantly faster than driving and public transport. I deserve just as much as a driver to have a safe way to get around and get to work. It is not my fault that drivers are stuck in traffic - it is the province's fault for not providing other, more varied transit options. Owning a car has become so incredibly expensive, that I moved downtown Toronto so that I didn't have to have one. I struggle with the cost of living just like everybody else these days, and it's unfair for the province to make owning a car an essential feature of getting around. It is unfair and undemocratic. The City knows this and worked with the community to make these lanes happen after years of consultation and planning. The province does not know better than the communities who live here and travel around the city every day. If the province wants to get involved, it should be working with city hall instead of discounting its legislature. Democracy is not the Ontario Premier losing every riding in downtown Toronto and then coming in and demanding his policy to rip up the bike lanes built through community-led initiatives, which he didn't even run on, goes through.\nThe province claims these lanes cause congestion, but cites no evidence. Studies all over the world prove bike lanes help with traffic congestion, the environment, and the economy, and make people safer & healthier. There are no legitimate studies that show bike lanes cause congestion, but there are plenty that show adding another lane of traffic does. There is no positive to getting rid of these bike lanes because study after study shows the short-term gains from removal end up making traffic worse. It is called induced demand. If we build the proper infrastructure, people (like myself!) will choose to bike instead of drive and this will in turn take more cars off the road. They do it in cities all over the world, like Montreal, New York, or Paris, and it works. Toronto has the opportunity to become a major global city and this careless, political decision is jeopardizing Toronto's attractiveness to talent in the future. Adding bike lanes to only side streets would make travelling by bike take significantly longer. This will not make anyone more safe or improve traffic. Arterial roads have bike lanes for a good reason: It's where people are trying to go. Cars transport way fewer people for the amount of space they take up and I don't hear anyone complaining about that. They are terrible for the environment. Why should private cars get better access to public spaces than public transit, or active transit? it makes no sense.\nThe premier is using this as a wedge issue and as a way to package the other terrible things in Bill 212, like skirting environmental regulations for the newly planned highway I disagree with these but nothing impacts me more than these bike lanes. I take the Bloor bike lane almost every day. There isn't congestion in the bike lanes because they get people where they want to go fast. I am a young person in this province, and I believe in Toronto and Ontario's potential for future success. We won't get there by implementing an emotion-based infrastructure policy because the premier wants to base major urban planning decisions on archaic 20th-century urban planning ideas around cars. We need innovative, forward-thinking people who are involved in their communities directly. Doug Ford lost the 2014 mayoral election. Olivia Chow was elected with the promise of implementing bike lanes. The province needs to get out of our local jurisdiction and do the things they were elected to do, like finish the Crosstown LRT and fix congestion on the highways. There are no bike lanes on the 401, and yet it is the busiest highway in North America. The province should be looking at facts, long-term impacts, and comprehensive studies from around the world to base its decision.\nI implore the province to at least listen to reason and the data, and plan WITH the city to improve traffic. They want to get rid of the bike lanes? At least consult with the community. It is unfair to the hardworking people of this city to have our infrastructure in tatters because of a hasty political decision.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to strongly oppose Bill 212. Bike lanes should be a municipal decision, built according to the needs and desires of the municipality in which bike lanes serve as important transportation infrastructure.\nThe basis of this proposal - that the removal of bike lanes will alleviate traffic - has no scientific, practical, or financial basis.\nBike lanes are life-saving infrastructure that allow for a city's inhabitants to more easily opt out of driving. Studies of bike lanes in Toronto show that bike lanes increased cyclist volume by over 2.5x, which translates to a real reduction in the number of cars on the road. The use of Bike Share in Toronto has increased many times over - amounting to almost 6 million rides taken in 2023 alone.\nMoreover, many of Toronto's worst traffic problem spots, such as Lakeshore and Jarvis, are in no way related to the presence of bike lanes.\nBike lanes create induced demand, which means that over time, more people will choose to bike over take their car. They are future-oriented infrastructure - not only for the fundamental fact that they prevent fatalities, but for the economic and environmental wellbeing of cities. Bike lanes are scientifically proven to reduce cyclist fatalities and reduce emissions. There is no supporting scientific evidence that the addition of car lanes reduces traffic; in fact, the opposite is more often the case.\nShould the provincial government remove bike lanes, many cyclists will be forced to use car lanes to navigate the city, which will increase confusion and create gridlock and frustration among car users. Removing bike lanes will not remove cyclists. They will simply remove SAFE cycling, forcing bikes onto the road with motor vehicles.\nThe provincial government should not spend taxpayer money on undoing municipal infrastructure projects and should instead focus on fixing the Gardiner, finishing the Eglinton LRT, and developing non-car-related methods for alleviating traffic in the city.\n",

        "comment":"I have significant concerns about Bill 212 and the included Building Highways Faster Act and the Highway 413 Act, as well as the amendments to other Acts with respect to highways. Nearly every municipal and regional council from along Highway 413\u2019s proposed route has voted to either oppose the highway altogether, or to request a full environmental assessment from the federal government. I believe the provincial government is intentionally putting emphasis on the polarizing discussion of bike lanes and tapping into collective frustration with traffic (caused by a lack of alternative transit options, not bike lanes) by targeting bike infrastructure, particularly in Toronto, to draw attention away from other sections of the bill. Bike lanes account for a small portion of this bill, yet it is the \u201chot button issue\u201d that dominates the discussion and presentation of the bill to the public. While I could support a just and fair expropriation process that seeks to address individualistic or greedy opposition to important, viable, and sustainable infrastructure projects (especially that address affordability and accessibility for low-income citizens such as high-speed commuter rail), this should not be tied to bypassing environmental assessments, supporting expensive car-dependent sprawl, and ripping up much-needed alternative transportation infrastructure.\nBill 212 is unprecedented jurisdictional overreach that will impact the safety of all road users. This will not reduce gridlock, save money, or improve the quality of life of Ontarians. Highway 413 will not reduce congestion, and internal documents from the ministry of transportation indicate that even if it is built, significant gridlock will persist. You should not build another highway when the 407 is already underutilized, and expected to remain underutilized according to your own government documents. The government has not stated that the 413 will not be tolled or sold to private interest, telling since this bill also contains amendments to the Building Broadband Faster Act, allowing for expropriation along highways for broadband projects that would support the infrastructure needed to toll highways. If that is the government\u2019s plan, they should be clear about their intentions in the bill.\nThe province\u2019s auditor general found that it would likely cost more than $4 billion, with the opposition saying it is closer to $10 billion of taxpayer money! I have significant doubts that Highway 413 would save any significant time and the government has not sufficiently proven any estimates; in fact, many experts believe it will save drivers less than 1 minute\u2026 I do not want to spend billions to save 30-60 seconds! Highway 413 and other such projects are merely another way for the government to put developers ahead of its constituents, opening up the land around the highway to car-dependent development that will generate more traffic and congestion, increasing our environmental impact and continuing to put financial pressure on us as we are reliant on having a car to get anywhere (gas, insurance, maintenance costs are continuing to go up!) If you want to connect the province, increase accessibility, ease the financial burden on individuals, and reduce gridlock, invest in non-commercial railways and high-speed commuter rail today. We need viable transportation alternatives, not more of the same!\nThe government must get serious about reducing gridlock; we need massive public transit infrastructure with dedicated transit lanes that use priority signalling, municipal streets with alternative means of mobility (like separated protected bike infrastructure), and more secure pedestrian pathways to prevent deadly accidents within our cities and make them economic centres full of vibrant destinations. Instead of more highways that induce more car traffic and are a taxpayer money sink, you must build out our local trains and a high-speed rail corridor, which would be more efficient at transporting more people (and money) into cities at more reasonable maintenance costs.\n",

        "comment":"This is a flawed bill that should not be passed as written.\nPremier Ford and the government have had 6 years of a majority government to reduce gridlock yet have failed to deliver any of their promised transit projects. Gridlock is a serious issue, but this government is using bike lanes as a scapegoat for its dismal track record on transit.\nThe Premier is not letting municipalities decide what is best for them with this proposed legislation. He is adding more red tape and forcing cities to get provincial approval for bike lanes. I believe that municipalities are quite capable of making decisions about bike lanes on their own. Removing bike lanes puts cyclists in more danger, leading to more accidents, injuries and deaths while causing further delays on our roads.\nThis bill claims that the government is committed to balancing environmental protection with the need to support crucial infrastructure development that will benefit the economy. But I don\u2019t see balance here. Instead, this bill does away with environmental protections in favour of creating projects that favour developer friends of Premier Ford. He is not putting the people of Ontario at the centre of his decisions, but rather, the profit to be made by interested stakeholders who have contributed to Ford\u2019s campaigns. This is corruption and is unacceptable.\nThis bill paves the way to build Highway 413 without a proper environmental study, even though it is known that the highway would specifically impact 85 waterways, 220 wetlands, put at risk at least 10 different species and hundreds of acres of vulnerable wildlife habitat. The building of Highway 413will encourage urban sprawl through induced demand, as research shows that building new highways tends to attract more drivers and fails to improve congestion levels on other roads. It would increase car dependency in surrounding areas and ultimately only save commuters around 30 to 60 seconds of travel time.\nInstead of building more highways and more urban sprawl, we should be building affordable and reliable public transit including investing in GO Transit Regional Express Rail. Let people get to work faster while getting work done and spending less money instead of sitting in traffic and increasing carbon emissions. So many better ways of easing gridlock have been suggested, such as working with the owners of Highway 407 to increase capacity on that highway, or subsidizing truck drivers to use Highway 407.\nDo better by the people of Ontario.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government\u2019s recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria\u2019s claim that \u201cnot everybody can use a bike to get around\u201d ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario\u2019s transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \u201ca better place, an easier place to get around,\u201d as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver\u2019s investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city\u2019s transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario\u2019s cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support  your government in the upcoming election.\nI hope you will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n",

If you care to read the City of Toronto's website for information on bike lanes and travel times, you will see that they have a negligible effect. But they do encourage people to use bikes as means of transportation, meaning fewer motor vehicles on the road and less congestion overall. Sometimes this process take a couple years, but it does happen. It's called modal shift.\nIf this ill-conceived process does come to pass, who will review municipal applications and make the decisions about whether bike lanes should go in? The MTO? They specialize in maximizing efficiency for motor vehicle traffic, and do have have the expertise to make balanced local decisions about transportation. And how long will each process take?

        "comment":"Dear Premier Ford,\nWe, the city builders of the National Capital Region are writing to express our strong opposition to provincial legislation that would make it more difficult to build safe cycling infrastructure. As developers, architects, urban planners, urban designers, landscape architects, and transportation planners, we believe this decision would be detrimental to the safety, health, and overall well-being of Ontarians. Specifically, we urge you to reconsider the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act.\nIt's clear you are passionate about working to save people\u2019s time when they travel around their cities, it\u2019s right there in the title of the act. We are too! However, it is important to understand that prioritizing cars over bikes will not get people moving faster. It will however increase congestion, increase emissions, increase altercations on our roads and ultimately lead to more fatalities. We are not advocating for a war on cars, we simply want to provide the residents of Ontario with options to move around their city safely.\nLet\u2019s talk about why restricting bike lanes would not be good for Ontario.\nWe need alternative modes of transportation for the density and pace we are building at. We are in a housing crisis that needs homes built quick and at higher densities than what our cities currently have. Your provincial government, as well as the federal and municipal governments, have identified intensification as a key strategy to achieving our housing targets. Our cities are already choked with vehicle traffic and adding more cars to the road will not solve the issue. There is no space in our cities to endlessly widen our roads, instead we need to rethink how the space on our roads is currently distributed. Transit, walking, and yes, cycling need to be realistic, safe, and direct options for getting around our cities.\nBuilding bike lanes reduce congestion.  A two-way protected bike lane can move 7,500 people per hour whereas a single lane of vehicle traffic can only move 600-1,600 per hour, all while the bike lane takes up less space.  This is simple physics, a bike lane moves more people than a car lane does. To get that many people using our bike lanes, we need to continue to build a connected and safe network of cycling infrastructure. You said it best on Political Blind Date, \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s not bike lanes\u201d.\nThe idea that bike lanes slow emergency services is also a misconception. The City of Toronto has studied how emergency service response time has changed after bike lanes were installed on Bloor and there has not been a significant difference in response times compared to the city average.  In fact, when designed and built correctly, bike lanes can speed up emergency response times as emergency vehicles can use bike lanes.\nBike lanes increase economic production. Bike lanes allow more people to access stores, encourage people to stay longer, and make it easier for people to move from one store to another. In the City of Toronto, installing bike lanes on Bloor Street has been correlated with increasing economic activity.  A study out of the University of Arizona showed that a $600 million investment in complete streets that included cycling infrastructure was associated with $6 billion in redevelopment investments.  For businesses to benefit the most, bike lanes need to be built on main streets, where our business are and where people want to go.\nAs cities across Ontario densify, protected cycling infrastructure is a key part of the future. It reduces our dependency on cars, alleviates traffic, lowers our cost of living, and helps to build greener, more livable cities for everyone. Ontario has the opportunity to be a leader in sustainable transportation by supporting, not restricting, cycling infrastructure.\nWe, the developers, architects, urban planners, urban designers, landscape architects, and transportation planners of the National Capital Region, urge you to reconsider the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, listen to the experts in the field, and position Ontario as a leader in the development of protected cycling infrastructure.\nThank you for your attention to this important issue.\nSigned,\nBrigil\nWindmill Developments\nTheia Partners\nDream\nTCU Development Corporation\nLinebox Studio\nHobin Architecture\nCSV Architects\nSiteform Inc\nPerkins&Will\nWSP Canada Inc.\nArcadis\nRe:Public Urbanism\nDS Studio\nArchitects DCA\nKadus Group\nS.J.Lawrence Architect Inc\n",

Bike lanes are part of an overall balanced transportation strategy for the City, and the more we provide cycling infrastructure and encourage people to not use cars in the City the better off we all will be. Bike lanes enhance safety for all road users, will reduce congestion by getting more people out of their cars, will encourage healthier lifestyles, will reduce our carbon footprint, thereby making the City a more desirable place to live, work and play. We are eliminating the requirements for min. parking spaces in new developments in Toronto and elsewhere, and in its place adding more bike parking spots in new residential developments.\nRipping out bike lanes and facilitating more cars is regressive and sends the wrong message to those that have an interest in healthier lifestyles and wish to reduce pollution.

        "comment":"On October 21st your Ministry introduced Bill 212, which includes the Building Highways Faster Act. On October 28th you announced that you have awarded the contract to build the western portion of the highway between highway 400 and Yonge St. This, despite the absence of design or feasibility studies for building the eastern part of the Bradford Bypass, over the very sensitive Holland Marsh river valley. Until your government started piecemeal building this way, this process was illegal. This is against Environmental Assessment best practices to say the least.\nHaving followed the Bradford Bypass project in detail for three years, we believe that fast tracking major infrastructure projects means removing more health, environmental, and property rights, and is not in the public interest. The province has yet to reasonably defend the need or justification for this project against any alternatives such as alternate routes or transit expansions. Unless your government substantially answers these questions, we are of the opinion that your government is set on this route in order to please sprawl developers.\nFurther, this action is a slap in the face to First Nations rights as we understand that consultations about the Lower Landing and their buried ancestors are ongoing.\nThe Department of Fisheries and Oceans has neither reviewed nor approved designs or mitigation plans, which they initially wanted to see before granting a permit to destroy fish habitat, as has been done by the Yonge St. early works bridge.\nThe Ontario government has not sought federal permissions for Endangered Species which will be impacted by this highway and appears to have little regard for its own provincial Species at Risk. Neither has it obtained permission to destroy habitats of Migratory Birds.\nPlease tell us how you can possibly avoid the habitats you are legally responsible for protecting with 24 hour construction?\nPlease answer these points -\n1. Publicly release the traffic studies, clearly indicating the points of origin and time savings to justify this project;\n2. Do a value for money audit of this project comparing it to regional road and public transit alternatives;\n3. If traffic studies and the evaluation of alternatives justify it, pay for regional road improvements;\n4. Plan for sustainable transportation. Prioritize getting Lake Simcoe watershed area GO stations built: Innisfil Orbit, Barrie Waterfront; and all day, two way electrification of the GO line;\n5. Complete studies that are not being done - impacts to Lake Simcoe, cumulative climate impacts, cumulative health assessments and cumulative water impacts;\n6.

What was once a two-lane traffic jam that became a race track at night is now a much more comfortable road with dedicated, separated bike lanes, allowing me to take my bike to work and other errands and my family to easily and safely take our bikes out together in public, a huge boost to all of our health.\nMy youngest (9), used to have a lot of hyperactivity issues in school, since these bike lanes were built it is possible for him to burn off energy before arriving to class. Since the bike lanes were put in and my children started using them daily, there have been NO more cases where he was sent to the principal's office.\nThese bike lanes are a huge bonus for us and many other families in the neighbourhood!\n",

I\u2019ve also noticed that University and Yonge street feel much safer with the new bike lanes. I own a car, and could drive much more than I do, but with the new lanes, riding my bike has become the preferred option: I save money and get exercise, all while knowing that I\u2019m contributing a little less to the greenhouse gas emissions that are a serious risk to my future and future of my children.\nI\u2019ve biked in Toronto for 20 years and noticed a massive increase in the number of cyclists. This gives me hope that in time, the air quality and traffic congestion  in Toronto will improve.\nInvesting in bike infrastructure and public transit is essential to ensure that we have a livable city in the long term, and reduce the risk of the many health consequences associated with cars.\nI urge the province not to waste tax payer money removing bike lanes that improve public safety, health and the environment.\n",

        "comment":"Hello,\nI am a frequent user of bike lanes, as are many of my friends and family members. Bike lanes make travel by alternative means than combustion engines more accessible and safe.\nIt is despicable that the Province of Ontario is prioritizing inefficient, dangerous, and high-carbon emitting transportation means rather than supporting transit options that are faster, promote health, promote environmental action, and overall create a stronger sense of community.\nWho do you think wins in a situation where is it a person on a bike vs a one tonne vehicle? By removing bike lanes, and making it harder for municipalities to add bike lanes, and are directly impacting the safety of Ontarians.\nHow many more lanes and roads do you think will solve traffic? The answer is none. Doug Ford needs to prioritize rapid public transit and alternative means such as bike lanes.\nSome key questions:\n- If bike lanes are causing so much traffic, than why do highways such as the 401 (where there are no bike lanes), experience so much traffic? (I\u2019ll give you a hint, it\u2019s not the bikes causing traffic)\n- What type of studies or scientific information is being used to make these decisions? (A quick google search offers a wide variety of academic articles that provide evidence that bike lanes only increase delays slightly)\n- how is induced demand being taken into account? (The proposal to add more room for cars, will in fact, just make sure there are more cars and more congestion in the area).\nThanks!\n",

The public has made it very clear to this government that it opposes this expansion of highway infrastructure for many reasons.\nBill 212 will exempt Highway 413 from any further environmental assessments. W-h-a-t!?\nThis highway will destroy 2000 acres of farmland and 400 acres of the Greenbelt and damage many Conservation Areas in Peel and York Regions.\nThe highway will slash the Nashville Conservation Reserve in half, cut across pristine streams and waterways that feed the Humber and Credit rivers and chop up what is currently a broad swathe of natural areas into pieces and pockets which won't be able to sustain the same beautiful diversity of plants and animals.\nThe building of this highway will not decrease traffic congestion but will increase it by creating more urban sprawl, adding thousands more cars to the highway systems of southern Ontario.

        "comment":"Removal of existing bike lanes is a gross overstep of provincial authority.\nIt needs to remain under the purview of the city\/local planning and the City is the best suited to handle this.\nThe City is the one with the vision, the LONG term plan, and the DATA and statistics supporting how bike ridership has been continuously increasing with every year after a bike lane on a given stretch is implemented. That's more people out of cars and less cars on that stretch to creat congestion. Win win.\nClaims that businesses suffer with bike lanes is also completely false. The province is only citing anecdotal evidence and it's simply not true. Talk to boor Street BIA - business has increased. Remember, people don't want to walk along, and shop along, a highway centred around cars. Inviting public spaces drives PEOPLE traffic (not car traffic) into the area and makes them spend more money.\nBike lanes only on secondary routes is absolutely not a solution. They need to be in addition to, not instead of.\nI challenge the province to find any continuous side road immediately parallel to Bloor where bikes lanes are proposed to be removed. It doesn't exist in Toronto's street fabric. This is another clear example where the province has not informed themselves and is just hastily pushing this forward without any critical thinking.\nSo far all claims I've seen to date made by the province and the Minister of Transportation as evidence to why removals of Bloor, University and Yonge bike lane is warranted, is flat out false, and\/or misleading.\n1.2 % are bikers is entirely false. That census data includes so many GTA car centric suburbs which significantly dilutes the numbers of users in downtown Toronto where these bike lanes are.\nIt's imperative the province realizes there absolutely cannot be enough road space available to have every single person in Toronto and GTA drive for every trip they make. It's was never possible and shouldn't be possible because one would want to live in a place where that is possible because it would be just massive highways everywhere and nothing else.\nBuild bike lanes, and people will come. This results in less emissions, more people getting around using a significantly smaller portion of the right of way per capita than cars which helps the provinces case in lower congestion.\nBuild road capacity for cars and people will come - this is law of induced demand. A principle that has been proven over and over again here and all around the world. Building more road space for cars DOES. NOT. SOLVE. CONGESTION.\nThe public should not need to teach the government on how this works.\nThe province seemingly chooses to have traffic engineers only look at the modelling in the first year or so after implementation of increased road capacity to see that it briefly lowers congestion, but fails to analyze all the years after; how congestion will be just as bad, or worse. Increased capacity will just bring out more drivers into the road. It's a never ending cycle therefore capacity does not solve congestion.\nI work for a transit agency in Ontario and am proud to be working on solutions and bringing new transit lines to fruition - getting people out of cars and where they need to go, faster and more conveniently.\nTransit and active transportation is a crucial and long term plan with a lot of different pieces and capital needed over time to make a comprehensive network, and the province is exclusively looking very short term which undermines and destroys the years of long term planning the City has done.\nThe province seems to be making opinion based decision instead of evidence based decisions, relying on personal opinion and anecdotal evidence, to try and justify this as opposed actual planning experts (not just traffic engineers).\n",

        "comment":"Friends and Families for Safe Streets is a group whose loved ones were struck and killed by a motorist, and people who survived being struck with severe life-altering injuries. We are unwilling experts on the human toll exacted by dangerous road design, and car-centric laws and public policy.\nWe are appalled to see our government attack safe streets. The complete streets that Doug Ford wants to rip out would have saved our loved ones\u2019 lives, by preventing the collisions that killed them entirely, or by reducing driver\u2019s speed to something survivable.\nBy prohibiting municipalities from building safe streets, the sole outcome of passing Bill 212 is that more people will be violently killed in crashes that would have otherwise been prevented. It is unconscionable and unforgiveable that this government is openly trying to get more Ontarians killed.\nLast year in Ontario, 616 beloved Ontarians were senselessly killed in crashes. Their families and wider communities were devastated. 36,090 Ontarians were injured, ranging from minor to life-threatening injuries. Between 2015-2023, 5216 loved people were killed in car crashes. A jaw-dropping 392,904 people were injured, ranging from minor to life-threatening injuries. That is a devastating amount of carnage, grief, anguish, and loss. In a province with such a shockingly poor road safety record, it is perverse to destroy safe streets, and prohibit municipalities from making road safety improvements, effectively prohibiting them from saving their own residents\u2019 lives.\nDoubtless, countless experts in many fields will weigh in with research and studies to demonstrate that Bill 212 is a wasteful travesty. What we can offer is our unwilling expertise in abject suffering in the aftermath of senseless road violence, of losing a loved one or nearly losing a life in a preventable crash. This Bill will directly cause: more funerals, more anguish and grief, more tear-filled days and nights, more irreparably shattered families and communities, more empty chairs around tables, more joyless holidays, more silent bedrooms in homes, more children without their parents, more parents without their children, more bloodstained clothing and wallets and wedding rings handed back in paper bags, more isolation, more devastation, more lives destroyed, more brain injuries, more spinal cord injuries, more jobs lost, more people living in poverty and unhoused, more lifelong chronic pain, more strain on our overburdened health care system, more trauma to bystanders, more fear, more white-hot rage at the callous injustice, more cruelty unleashed on people who did nothing to deserve it.\nThe reasoning publicly stated for Bill 212 is perverse, insulting, and a callous slap in the face to the thousands of people in Ontario grieving their loved ones. Minister of Transportation Prabmeet Sarkaria has said he wants to give people more time with their families. What about the thousands of families across Ontario who can\u2019t spend time with their loved one, because their loved one was killed in a preventable crash? How can anyone spend time with their family when they are struck and killed by a motorist? What about all the families of those who will inevitably be killed where this government rips out or prohibits safe streets? If Minister of Transportation Prabmeet Sarkaria wanted to guarantee families more time together, he would act to build safe streets across the province instead of ripping out the safest streets. You can\u2019t spend time with your family if you are killed in a crash.\nLet us share what it is like in the aftermath of road violence. First, the police unexpectedly call you or show up at your door and deliver the news that shatters your world and your heart into millions of pieces. You are brought to the hospital where your loved one is, whether they are your spouse, child, parent, brother or sister. You have to see them lying there, dead, to identify them. Your heart breaks with the care the health care staff took to clean the blood up for you, even as you see the spots they missed. Or your loved one haven\u2019t died yet, and you are helplessly trapped at their bedside in horror and desperation, begging any possible higher power for them not to die, until they eventually succumb to their injuries.\nYou receive your loved one\u2019s belongings handed back to you in a paper bag. Wallet, keys, maybe a wedding ring. You receive back your loved one\u2019s torn, bloodied clothing. You are paralyzed for years, struggling to decide what to do with it.\nYou are thrust into planning a funeral. You probably didn\u2019t have a chance to ask what your loved one\u2019s preferences would be, because they were killed so suddenly and so long before their natural death would have occurred. Burial or cremation? Secular or religious ceremony? What are you supposed to do? What if you do the wrong thing?\nYou are left with an empty chair at your family\u2019s table. Your family holidays are subdued and bleached of joy. There is an empty bedroom that simultaneously is silent while also screaming at you. What do you do when your loved one\u2019s scent fades from their clothes and sheets, and the meagre comfort you drew from that withers away? What do you do with the furniture? The trinkets and memories? What do you do with the photographs on their walls?\nYou might receive support from your community in the early days. But it falls away gradually, until you feel forgotten. People move on and think you should have gotten over it too, but there is still a gaping hole in your heart that you carry around every second of every day.\nYou are subjected to legal processes that are shockingly hostile and insulting. If the driver who struck you or killed your loved one is charged at all, it is likely a trivial highway traffic act infraction. The value of human life is reduced to a small fine, a few hundred dollars maybe, and a few demerit points if you are lucky. You are utterly denied any sense of justice, while the driver who devastated you is allowed to keep driving and put more people at risk. Having recently voted down Bill 40, Moving Ontarians Safely Act, 2023, Conservative MPPs will be very familiar with the lack of consequences for at-fault reckless drivers who kill and severely injure others.\nTHAT\u2019S what happens in road violence. It is not just numbers. It is not abstract. It is gut-wrenchingly real and it destroys lives. This is the fate that will be inflicted on more Ontarians if you move forward with Bill 212. It is infinitely worse than being stuck sitting comfortably in your car for a few extra minutes.\nWill this government start paying for funerals and lawsuit settlements for all the people guaranteed to be killed on the streets they ripped up, and on the streets they denied lifesaving upgrades to? In the face of an ongoing affordability crisis, will this government start reimbursing Ontarians for their increased transportation costs, when they are forced back into their cars and have to spend thousands more every year on gas and car maintenance instead of using active transportation?\nSpeaking on behalf of crash survivors, and for countless Ontarians who have lost their voice because they were killed in a preventable crash, our membership demands you change course. You must not rip out safe streets and sentence more of our neighbors to the anguish we have experienced. You must not prohibit municipalities from saving lives and preventing injuries. Crashes kill pedestrians, cyclists, and car drivers alike, and human life is more important than speed or convenience. If what happened to us had happened to you, it would never occur to you to inflict this horrible fate on more people in this province, solely for a cheap political point in what is the ultimate non-partisan issue. If you continue on this reckless, immoral path, you will own every preventable death and serious injury on Toronto\u2019s roads.\n",

        "comment":"Hello. I am a young adult resident of a small town in the Durham Brock region, Beaverton. I regularly cycle to work in my home town, but also commute weekly to Oshawa for my university education. I favor public transportation where possible, and don\u2019t agree with car dependent transportation on a fundamental level. To put it briefly, the cost in lives and health both for those who are obliged to drive and those who can refrain has never been acceptable; legislation to further reinforce automobile dependance and impair the use of public transit and micro mobility like bicycles, goes against my hopes for the future of Canada as a whole.\nIt is my opinion that Bill 212 is a step in the wrong direction; Bill 212 will ultimately worsen the efficiency of the transportation system and increase the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with it. Additionally, the inclusion of highway development in a bill primarily about bike paths on roads is not relevant and appears to be in bad faith.\nI don\u2019t like the inter-meshing of Bicycle infrastructure legislation with highway development legislation: they are separate topics, and Bill 212 appears to be using any negative outlooks on the former to quietly push rushed expansion of the latter. They should be kept separate in legislation and in discussion. Bill 212 includes changes to overwrite protections and safeguards built into highway development. Rushing highway development, especially without long term input from the communities directly disrupted and affected by that development should not be permitted to pass\u2026 regardless of the biking infrastructure effects the bill primarily pushes.\nBill 212 pushes for the removal of existing bike lanes and heavy suppression of establishing bike infrastructure going forward. The Bill originates from the city of Toronto, but disconcertingly applies these restrictions to the entirety of Ontario. I am not a resident of the dense city centre, so I cannot provide first hand opinions of the existing bike infrastructure, or how this bill impacts the city. However, by trying to apply these restrictions universally and overwrite the agency of other areas to choose for themselves, Bill 212 acts as an overreach beyond the areas of contention it came from. Why should the opinions and perspectives of a dense urban area, determine if my rural hometown and suburban place of study are allowed to develop safe biking infrastructure? These are different, unique places that should be shaped and developed according to the people who live there. I as someone who has a great many years of time in the workforce left, and want a subrural future where safe biking and public transit options are widely available\u2026 I want the agency and freedom to shape the places where I live, not have it controlled or interfered with by strangers who live radically different lives in the city.\nAddressing Bill 212 directly, it is my opinion that destroying existing and preventing the establishment of safe bike lanes will have the inverse effect that the \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\u201d is claiming to provide. I actively choose to bike to work for personal reasons, such as getting additional exercise, minimizing my carbon footprint, and saving money to one day own a home. Regardless of these reasons however, is that each commute, shopping trip, or visit to friends and family done via bike is another vehicle not on the road [or lining its sides]. A person choosing to bike = one less car contributing to congestion, pollution, wear and tear on infrastructure, or at risk of accident involvements. By removing\/restricting the infrastructure that enables safe travel by bike across the entirety of Ontario, people who want to bike for any reason are denied that choice [or risk becoming part of a growing statistic by travelling beside automobiles https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/opp-says-cyclist-deaths-up-300-p\u2026]. When travel by car left as the best available option, then those trips end up being made in a car. Adding more lanes, especially by removing safe alternatives to driving between destinations, will directly cause more congestion\u2026 not alleviate it.\nI want to be able to bike to safely and comfortably where I need to go, without worrying about dying because someone is not paying attention behind the wheel. Bike lanes, paths, and especially separated bike paths are the best way to do that. But Bill 212 comes from a city I don\u2019t live in, to actively remove and deny that option in a short sighted to rush development of road infrastructure at a steep cost in funds and lives: which itself will put more vehicles on the road in a time where we need less.\nIf we as Ontarians want to be rid of congestion, the only real option is to enable viable alternatives to driving. Please don\u2019t erase the real progress made to give people the freedom to choose. Stop Bill 212.\n",

The City of Toronto says that response time for first responders has not increased. BIAs are opposed. There is no logical reason to do this, and no data that prove eliminating bike lanes will have a noticeable impact on traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is caused by too many vehicles. Take out the bike lanes and cyclists are still going to be riding in traffic. All those couriers and food deliverers will be in traffic or on the sidewalk.\nIt's also another example of the premier meddling in Toronto's business\u2014reducing the size of council during an election, destroying Ontario Place, moving the Science Centre on the flimsiest of pretenses to justify building a parking garage for a foreign-owned spa nobody wants.

The impact of building this highway and further encouraging driving will have grave effects on the environment. As stated in a report from Environmental Defence, Highway 413 would cause over 17 million tonnes of additional CO2 emissions by 2050 \u2013 the same date by which Canada is committed to reach net-zero emissions.

Look at major cities like London, New York, and Tokyo\u2014they\u2019ve invested heavily in public infrastructure, while we seem to be going backward.\n",

        "comment":"Removing bike lanes would not ease congestion. Adding more car lanes never ends up easing congestion over an extended period. The only way to solve congestion is to encourage active and public transportation. Creating a network of bike lanes can help alleviate congestion since a good network can encourage drivers to cycle, thus reducing the number of cars on the road. Removing bike lanes also increases the risk of serious injury and death not only for cyclists, but for pedestrians and drivers as well since drivers drive more calmly on streets with bike lanes.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 212: Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\nThe purpose of this legislation is to reduce gridlock and save time for drivers in Ontario.\nThese comments focus on Part XII, which requires Government of Ontario approval\/review of:\n\uf0b7 municipalities\u2019 plans for bicycle lanes that reduce lanes for cars, and\n\uf0b7 bicycle lanes that have been built in the past five years (with the potential for removal of lanes that are in place.)\nThese measures will not significantly reduce gridlock.\nThere is no evidence that bike traffic and bike lanes contribute to gridlock.\nThe problem with gridlock is too many cars.\nIncreasing space on roads leads to increases in car use, more congestion, and eventually more\ngridlock.\nReducing infrastructure for cyclists may contribute to congestion and gridlock if they opt for\nmotorized transport instead.\nThe legislation makes no provision for improvements to public transport which could at least\nabsorb the trips of some of the cyclists who will ride less because they have lost bike lanes.\nThey will also degrade the benefits of cycling to Ontario.\nTransportation\nEliminating or slowing the growth of bike lanes will drive cyclists back to motorized\ntransportation--which will increase congestion.\nThe transportation system will be less efficient, incenting use of expensive (car\/transit) modes\nover the less expensive one (cycling).\nHealth\nFewer bike lanes will reduce safety for cyclists, leading to more injuries and possibly, fatalities.\nReductions in cycling infrastructure will lead to less riding, exercise and fitness, which will\nreduce population health.\nEnvironment\nCycling is the one of the most efficient modes of transportation in terms of space, energy and\npollution.\nMore trips by car and public transit will only lead to more pressure on available space on roads,\nas well as increased energy use and GHG emissions.\nCars require much more land than bicycles: both while travelling and not in use (parking\u2014which\nis often under priced). They require more public space per passenger mile--so are a less efficient\nuse of that space.\nMunicipal Finances\nRoads and car infrastructure are expensive. Municipalities across Ontario are struggling to build\nand even maintain the road networks needed to support \u201ccars first\u201d transportation.\nIn municipalities such as Ottawa, (which has a \u201crevenue shortfall\u201d) the huge investments in road\nbuilding and maintenance are crowding out expenditure on other important public goods and\nservices.\nMunicipalities, whose revenues are constrained by their narrow tax bases, tax increase\ncommitments and dependence on other levels of government for funding, will not be able to\nsupport ever-growing road networks.\nCycling lanes are a fiscally responsible means to increase transportation capacity in Ontario, at a\nlower cost than roads dedicated primarily to cars.\nRecommendation:\nRemove section XII from the proposed legislation.\n",

        "comment":"While Bill 212 is well intended, it will neither meaningfully reduce gridlock or traffic congestion, and will damage our environment. It must not be passed.\nHighway 413 will actually make traffic work, in part due to induced demand. The creation of more options for driving results in more people driving or taking similar routes and thereby creating traffic. This also results in sprawl, spreading things out and forcing more people to use cars, which are space inefficient.\nWorsening this is that it encourages car use at the detriment of alternative forms of transportation that are not only more economical, but better for Ontarians health and Ontario's environment. Bicycle infrastructure promotes activity, reducing health care costs, emits less, helping the environment, and is less costly to maintain for both the government and the riders, saving both money.\nFurthermore, car infrastructure, like highway 413, harms people, especially vulnerable groups like children, both directly through accidents and indirectly through air pollution both from the tires wearing out and the exhaust.\nLastly is the problem that it exempts highway 413 from the Environmental assessment act, as quote, \"The following are exempt from the Environmental Assessment Act: 1.  The Highway 413 Project, including any change to the Highway 413 Project.\" That act helps us make sure the environment is minimally harmed, this cannot be an exception. In addition, are the carbon emissions. Given the nature of the project it will produce a tremendous amount of emissions and currently we are not reaching our emission targets. Climate change is already harming us, physically, mentally, and economically, we must not exacerbate it and cause needless suffering.\nIt is due to these reasons that Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, must not be passed. Instead, more effort should be put into helping alternatives to cars such as buses and bikes. These latter two are good for Ontarians, Ontario's economy, and Ontario's environment.\n",

        "comment":"As a Peterborough resident, I am deeply concerned about the implications of Bill 212, particularly its potential to reverse the progress our city has made in creating safer and more inclusive streets. Initiatives like the Bethune Street project have introduced well-designed cycling infrastructure and pedestrian spaces, making Peterborough not only safer but also more vibrant and attractive to residents and visitors. Bill 212 threatens to derail this progress by centralizing decision-making at the provincial level, removing local autonomy, and prioritizing car traffic over all other road users.\nThe requirement for provincial approval for new bike lanes, coupled with the risk of removing existing infrastructure, would be a step backward for Peterborough. This city has worked hard to create streets that accommodate everyone\u2014drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike. Projects like Bethune Street have demonstrated clear benefits: fewer accidents, more active transportation options, and a growing sense of community. Why jeopardize these successes?\nMoreover, discouraging cycling infrastructure in a city like Peterborough ignores the clear economic and environmental advantages. Accessible bike lanes encourage people to spend time downtown, supporting local businesses. They also reduce traffic congestion and emissions, making the city cleaner and more pleasant for everyone\u2014not just cyclists.\nSome might argue that cyclists \u201cdon\u2019t bike in the winter anyway,\u201d but that\u2019s a shortsighted view. With proper infrastructure and maintenance, cities worldwide\u2014yes, even ones with winters more severe than ours\u2014see year-round cycling as a viable and growing mode of transportation. Why should Peterborough, or any Ontario city, settle for less?\nBill 212 doesn\u2019t just target bike lanes; it undermines the idea that streets should be safe for everyone, not just those in cars. In Peterborough, where active transportation projects are just starting to bear fruit, this legislation would send the wrong message: that the safety of cyclists and pedestrians is an afterthought, and that progress should be sacrificed to maintain the status quo.\nI urge the provincial government to reconsider the sweeping implications of this bill. Local governments are in the best position to understand the needs of their communities. Provincial overreach will only make it harder for cities like Peterborough to build on the progress they\u2019ve made. Let\u2019s keep moving forward, not backward.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing today to indicate my strong opposition to Bill 212, not with my opinion but with data and evidence. I want Ontario to move faster, and I strongly support efforts to reduce gridlock. However, so much of this bill is not considering accurate data or studies on how to build road infrastructure. Most of my comments refer to how the bike lane legislation will affect Ontario\u2019s streets for cars and all other road users.\nTravel Times\nToronto City Council produced a thorough report (https:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/legdocs\/mmis\/2024\/cc\/bgrd\/backgroundfile-250545\u2026) in response to this bill with many important figures. I highly recommend the entire committee read the full report, as this bike lane legislation seems to be targeted at Toronto without using data from Toronto. The city planning experts who wrote this report reported that travel times on streets where bike lanes are proposed to be removed will increase greatly for 4\u20139 months as lanes will be closed for construction to occur. Then, after the lanes are reopened, the non-partisan planning staff report that there will be \u201clikely minimal improvements in travel time once lanes are removed\u201d. This is largely due to induced demand, where making driving the only viable option for many people puts many more cars on the road, which over a short period of time will fill the reclaimed car lane and then some with no easy way to improve traffic once car demand has increased even more. Also, driving times often only increase by mere minutes. As the Toronto Star reports (https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/news\/gta\/do-cycling-corridors-really-slow-traff\u2026) the major streets with bike lanes do sometimes see travel time increases, but they are \u201coften by a minute or less.\u201d These slight increases could also be uninfluenced by bike lanes, as Toronto is one of the fastest growing cities in North America which would naturally increase drivers and thus travel times. Another main travel time measure is emergency response times. In a recent community consultation for the Bloor Street West Complete Street Extension bike lanes, Toronto Fire Deputy Chief Jim Jessop reported that the fire department has not seen an increase in travel times and he told members of the community that \u201cYour response times have been improving,\" (https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/bike-rally-community-meeting-bik\u2026)\nBike lanes on University Ave, Toronto\nThe new University Ave bike lanes are some of the best in the city. They are protected, preserved street parking where it was needed and separate cyclists from cars with a green barrier of plants creating a more beautiful street. This bill proposes removing these lanes which are not meaningfully contributing to traffic. Healthcare experts including the President of Mt Sinai Health (https:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/legdocs\/mmis\/2020\/cc\/comm\/communicationfile-1028\u2026) and the President of Sick Kids Hospital (https:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/legdocs\/mmis\/2020\/cc\/comm\/communicationfile-1025\u2026) that strongly support bike lanes on University.\nThe Environment\nEnvironmentally, this bike lane legislation along with the removal of environmental requirements for highways is in fierce opposition to our province\u2019s environmental targets and our country\u2019s climate goals. Road transportation is the largest source of pollution in the province, responsible for more than a quarter of all of Ontario\u2019s emissions and by subsidizing driving with new highways and making environmentally friendly options like cycling far more dangerous and disincentivized, the government is contributing to climate change and risking the future of our province for future generations.\nRoad Safety\nSeparated bike lanes will always prevent road deaths full stop. As reported by 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto (https:\/\/healthydebate.ca\/2024\/10\/topic\/legislation-road-design-safety-t\u2026) these senseless tragedies are avoidable and cannot continue to happen on our streets. I strongly urge the committee to carefully read this open letter from physicians in Ontario who cannot keep treating drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists in our emergency departments.\nThe Future of Ontario\nLastly, we need this bill to consider the future. Not just the environmental future but how we will continue to grow and allow a growing population to move around the city. In a recent City of Toronto council meeting on Nov 6th, of all the new buildings that were approved that day \u201c22% of units in the most recent developments being debated at Toronto City Council have access to a parking space\u201d as reported in the Toronto Star (https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/opinion\/contributors\/doug-ford-wants-a-toronto-\u2026). Toronto, but also many municipalities in Ontario will not be able to sustain the population growth if we do not create non-car options for transportation. There is simply not enough space on the roads, or as seen in these new developments, the parking garages of new homes for everyone to drive as their primary mode. 78% of individuals in these new developments will not have a car, and we cannot leave these people stranded. We also need our businesses of Ontario to thrive and continue growing. The Bloor BIA reported that removing the bike lanes on Bloor \u201cwould be disastrous to the neighbourhood\u201d. (https:\/\/www.torontotoday.ca\/local\/politics-government\/bia-warns-removal\u2026) It is not fair to punish small business just to allow cars to fly by them without stopping to make purchases and help our economy.\nI hope you take this data and thoughts from all linked articles and letters into consideration and amend this bill. I am not alone in these thoughts and as of this submission, 22,164 people have signed Cycle Toronto\u2019s petition (https:\/\/www.cycleto.ca\/ilovebikelanes) wanting to stop this bill and protect our bike lanes. to improve our communities safety, the environment, small businesses, and stop gridlock for good by investing in non-car modes of transit.\nThank you.\n",

Contrast the language in the bill with doing the work to simply installing barrier separated bike lanes to better demarcate the road and improve the road speeds. This basically assumes from the jump, a bike lane doesn't offer any benefit to drivers, when it literally would move them out of the way..\nKeeping barrier separated bike lanes wouldn't degrade overall road safety either and would likely improve traffic flow, since that is the justification for the extra powers and uploading of bike lanes to the Minister. Other suggestions here include increase traffic flow along roads that have bike lanes such as better timing of intersections to let drivers drive more efficiently and prevent dismantling of good infrastructure that everybody has to fund one way or another..\nYou physically can not go faster on roads which are gridlocked anyway, regardless of bike lanes being present or not. Why does everybody who uses the road environment have to suffer in the worst possible way by removing transportation infrastructure when practical solutions are being proposed that offer flexibility or options?\n",

I believe decisions about bike lanes should be left in the hands of the municipal governments.\nI live in south Etobicoke. I own a car and a bicycle - I'm both a driver and a cyclist. I'm very disappointed when leaders try to pit residents against each other with labels that really don't reflect reality.\nI want to see more bike lanes in Etobicoke and in the rest of the city so people on bicycles can get around safely, and because evidence shows that well-designed streets with bike lanes are safer for everyone - pedestrians, people on bikes, drivers, and everyone else.\nWhen I drive, I find congestion is terrible almost everywhere in the city. I don't see worse congestion on Bloor than on lots of other streets that don't have bike lanes. Removing the few bike lanes we have will not begin to solve our congestion problems. Improving our transit system and providing a network of bike lanes will provide needed alternatives to driving, which will help solve our congestion problems.\nI regularly use the bike lane on Bloor between Old Mill and Royal York Road as part of my commute. I always used to avoid the section of Bloor between Old Mill and Prince Edward because it felt so unsafe, with cars speeding past. I'm so grateful to have that protection. It allows me to safely get to shops on that section of Bloor on my way home from work.\nI live near Evans and Browns Line. I would love to use the bike lane lane on Bloor west of Royal York more often, but there's no safe route for me to connect with it. I risk my life on Evans when I commute because at least it gets me to and from the painted bike lane on Royal York, which is better than biking on a street with no lane.\nSpeeding and running red lights are huge problems on our streets, and one thing I notice is how much worse the speeding is on streets with no bike lanes. Evans is treacherous, and Bloor west of Kipling, where the lane ends, is also incredibly dangerous. I like the way bike lanes have a calming effect and make neighbourhoods feel more welcoming, not just places to speed through on your way to somewhere else.\nI've been so happy to see children with their parents, or young people on their own, biking safely on Bloor in the lanes. We know that the new developments coming to Bloor are going to bring many thousands of new residents to the neighbourhood, and we'll need options for them. We must not remove what little bike infrastructure we have. Instead, we need to see it as the spine of a network and give our kids and all of us the safety on our streets that we all deserve.\nThis work is best left in the hands of municipalities who know local needs and have the long view in mind.\nThank you for considering my comments.\n",

        "comment":"Incentivizing cycling is one element of several that should be taken to reduce the existing gridlock in our cities by reducing the number of vehicles on them.  A cyclist (or even 2 or 3) who would otherwise occupy a private vehicle requires far less space than that of a vehicle both while in transit and upon reaching their destination (i.e. parking space for a bike is tiny compared to that of a vehicle). The proposed legislation that prevents municipalities from installing bicycle lanes where doing so would reduce the number of lanes for automobiles is based on the claim that doing so will improve automotive traffic flow.  What is the evidence to support this claim?\nAn article entitled \"The Traffic Calming Effect of Delineated Bicycle Lanes\" published in the Journal of Urban Mobility in June 2024 makes the following observation in the literature review section:\n\"The relationship between introducing a bike lane and motor-vehicle travel speeds has been a topic of conversation among cyclists and transportation planners, although there is a lack of empirical evidence on the topic.\"\nThe same article highlights the safety benefits of bicycle lanes as do many others, some of which are cited in the article.\nRemoving cycling lanes installed in the past 5 years is an even worse idea. By now, such routes will have become established for some cyclists and though many will stop using it when the cycling lane is removed, some will continue with bad outcomes resulting for cyclists and motorists alike.  Poor cycling infrastructure leads to poor behaviour by both parties which will hamper traffic flow and may lead to increases in serious injury or death of cyclists.  Furthermore, it requires spending money to reverse a change which has already been paid for!\nThis legislation is unsupported by evidence and it restricts municipalities and their citizens from making appropriate decisions locally.\n",

It upsets me that bicycle lanes have become a political wedge issue in this province when the focus should be about the right for people to be able to choose a mode of transportation and get to where they want to go safely.\nAs a health care worker working in one of the hospitals on University Avenue in Toronto, biking to and from work using the Danforth, Bloor Street, and University Avenue bike lanes has been essential for me.\nI used to take the TTC, but due to consistently poor service (ie overcrowding of trains, frequent delays due to various medical emergencies) it was not a dependable mode of transportation.\nDriving to work was not an option either as parking expenses and gasoline costs significantly cut into our family budget.\nBiking has not only been an effective way to help me and my family live within our means, it has also improved my physical and mental health, both of which were severely tested as I helped to treat patients during the Covid pandemic.\nIt has been a joy for me to see my wife and children bike safely along Danforth Avenue and observe how the bike lanes have increased foot traffic at local businesses and livened up the neighbourhood in which we live.\nRemoving bike lanes for more car lanes is not a long-term solution to relieving traffic congestion.  More car lanes will only result in induced demand (ie more cars on the road) and endanger the lives of people like me who will be forced to share the road with faster, heavier moving vehicles.  Continuing to build bicycle infrastructure in this city and expanding public transit are the only long-term solutions to the congestion issue we currently face.\nIt is for these reasons that I urge you to reconsider Bill 212.\n",

        "comment":"The province and Premier are rightly prioritizing building new housing for the people of Ontario. New houses and new residents create new travel needs. People will use the transit systems that the province builds and it is therefore very important that Ontario builds the transit systems that make sense in each region. In a busy city like Toronto or Hamilton the roads are already congested and new cars on the roads will make it worse unless we use public space smartly.\nSmart usage of our streets includes bike lanes to absorb the large demand for short-trips to local businesses or events that surrounding neighbourhoods create. Absorption of this demand frees up our roadways for longer trips that need to be made by car. The residents of Ontario can all appreciate a pleasant walk or short bike ride to a local store. The province removing bike lanes unilaterally means that the space freed is taken up again by locals who don't feel safe enough to walk or bike a short trip. Instead, good faith negotiating between municipalities and the province should be used to address both provincial and local demands for our streets. This bill does not balance the different demands in a healthy way.\nIf this bill passes, the Ministry of Transportation will be responsible for a large number of very local decisions across the province. The Ministry's resources, and that of the government of Ontario more broadly, should not be directed to reviewing and fighting cities on traffic hotspots. It is my concern that the Ministry of Transportation's resources are not adequate to give each local decision the due consideration and time it deserves. Especially so in the context of cities implementing more bike lanes to help reduce carbon emmissions. The end result will be rubber-stamping every bike lane or denying every bike lane. Niether situation is desirable. Both scenarios work at cross purposes with the municipalities of Ontario which share the provinces goal to make our roads more pleasant and reduce congestion.\nFurther, the public comments made by the Minister and the Premier do not appear consistent with an intent to negotiate in good faith. The comments are instead aimed at unilaterally changing small spaces of cities without consideration of the whole city as a system. There is nothing in this bill binding the Minister's decision making to any metric or plan consistent with the data or projections provided by municipalities.\nFinally, this bill lacks language binding the Minister to safety considerations for those people who bike, or must bike, regardless of the existence of bicycle infrastructure. The province's goal to save people time is a good goal that should be pursued. However, it should not be pursued at the cost of injuries to people using our roads. Bicycle lanes, whether they remove a lane of traffic or not, help to naturally slow drivers and keep them alert. Alert drivers improve safety for themselves, people crossing traffic, and people biking. These safety outcomes are important and should be part of any provincial bill touching road safety.\nI urge lawmakes to amend this bill or vote it down as written.\nThank you for consideration of my comment.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Bill 212 \u2013 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 \u2013 Building Highways Faster Act , 2024\nI would like to put forth my concerns regarding Building Highways Faster Act , 2024.  To be clear, I am a motorhead, and rely on driving as my main means of transportation.\nDespite this, I am putting forth my concerns with this Act as it has been criticized as something that does not address the issue of reducing gridlock.  On an intuitive level, it would appear that building more expressways would help alleviate gridlock.  However, this intuitive approach ignores a phenomenon called induced demand where the increase in road space dedicated for car traffic has a strong tendency to attract more people in choosing to drive.  Often creating a vicious cycle where more lanes leads to more cars which leads to more lanes built to accommodate the additional cars which only further fuels the demand.  Los Angels, California, USA is a prime example of such where despite being famous for its multi lane expressways, is also infamous for its traffic jams.\nInstead of contributing to this vicious cycle, we should instead look into ways to encourage the use efficient forms of transportation (e.g. walking, cycling, and public transportation).  This goes beyond gridlock.  Effective transportation is what keeps the economic engine going and it is not possible to add more road space to allow everyone to drive.  Reducing car dependency also means opening up the door to having apartment buildings with fewer parking spaces.  This in turn reduces the costs of construction.  The entire nation is facing housing crisis and one of the means of speeding up construction is to make it easier to have viable housing project.  The last thing we need to make projects more expensive having to put in more parking as the residents will not have other options.\nFurthermore, making alternatives to driving less attractive does a great disservice to people who have to drive.  Increasing the number of cars on the roads simply adds to the congestion making the transportation network less efficient.  It also means car enthusiasts do not get the chance to enjoy their prized cars like they are meant to be enjoy and instead every drive will be one through gridlock.\nThe bottom line is that favouring the use of the car at the expense of alternatives like active transport is a losing proposition for everyone regardless their preferred method of transportation.\n",

        "comment":"I am very appreciative that finally decisions are being made to consider both automobiles and bicycles needs. It is irresponsible to choose and build bicycle lanes specifically along Bloor St. in Etobicoke without considering the impact to traffic.\nI travel from Mississauga along Bloor St whenever l need to see my Doctor located in the area of Bloor West Village.  A car drive  prior to the installation of bike lanes  from  Mississauga  (Bloor St and Dixie Rd. ) along Bloor St. to Etobicoke (Bloor St and Jane St.) would take me on average 20 to 30 minutes. After the bike lanes were installed in Etobicoke the drive now taken anywhere from 45 to 75 minutes depending on the time of day.\nThe frustrating part of the situation is as l have had to sit in traffic l have observed a maximum range of between 4 to 6 bicycles traveling between Islington Ave  and Jane St. along Bloor St. especially in the fall and winter months.\nUnfortunately l too have seen other results of this poorly conceived plan to have bike lanes along Bloor St. in Etobicoke. Along with gridlock l have observed side streets with vehicles speeding trying to avoid the traffic.\nSimiliarly, I have seen drivers not being able to enter onto Bloor St. from side streets since only one lane is available. I have also observed elderly people as well as people requiring mobility devices needing to be let our at an intersection so that they can try and get to the sidewalk and access the businesses along Bloor St. while avoiding speeding bicyclists.\nI can only imagine how impossible it would be for an emergency vehicle to try and pass the traffic congestion along Bloor St.\nAs l mentioned, l live in Mississauga where the City is trying to put in bike lanes along Bloor St. I am not against bike lanes but l am against an engineering design where both the needs of automobiles and bicyclist are not considered. If bike lanes can be added safely to existing lanes of traffic without the removal of existing car lanes then this would be a \"win- win\" scenario.\nUnfortunately, when l have attended meetings in Mississauga regarding the bike lanes citizens have asked for the studies and data to support bike lanes and none have been provided.\nAnswers from Mississauga politicians  have been \" the public wants them ( bike lanes)\". Since to the best of my understanding there has been no data ( bicycle traffic report ) made available to support bike lanes l suspect that either the data does not exist, was poorly collected or does not support having bike lanes.\nIn addition, different designs for the Mississauga Bloor St bike lanes where presented by the City where lanes of traffic where not reduced but bike lanes were added. This option was rejected in favor of reduced lanes. I suspect that the design option to  reduce lanes in order to construct bike lanes was the easiest and therefore most economical option not the best option.\nIn addition, there has been a big push for densification in order to provide much needed housing in Ontario however when you want to add thousands of new housing units  ( as being considered in the area of Bloor St. In Mississauga) the infrastructure needs of the City have to be considered. Housing densification and development approvals cannot be an afterthought after the road traffic lanes have been reduced.\nHow does one make smart decisions that support both automobile and bicycle needs when there is a lack of data, lack of transparency and a lack of understanding by local politicians.\nPolitical decisions and engineering traffic design  decisions should not be made to favour bicycle riders needs at the expense of automobile traffic needs.  Emergency vehicle access needs also have to be considered.\nFuture housing development \/ densification decisions also need to consider the transportation needs of various stakeholders.\nExisting bike lanes along major (primary) roads should be removed in areas where they are not supported by data and when there will be additional traffic congestion and\/ or safety concerns.\nSimilarly, new bike lanes should not be created along major(primary) roads.\nSmart political and engineering decisions should be made to incorporate bike lanes along secondary roads where traffic congestion would be minimal.\nI thank Doug Ford and the Provincial government for having the fortitude to stand up and listen to the people of Ontario.\nPLEASE  FIX THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION PROBLEM!\nLET'S FIND A \" WIN- WIN\"\nSOLUTION TO TRAFFIC CONGESTION!\nThank you\n",

        "comment":"I am strongly against Schedule 4, Part XII of this bill. This is an egregious case of additional red-tape and over-reach. I am displeased by this government's lack of fiscal responsibility. Our focus should stop being on motor vehicle traffic and consider traffic as a whole. The goal should be to move people, not machines. Focusing on cars moving faster will only make our city streets more unsafe.\nSince we seem to be operating on anecdotes instead of data-driven studies, I have a couple to share. I have several friends who moved out of the municipality (due to lack of affordable housing). They moved to satellite cities near GO train stations with the desire to use that mode of transport to continue visiting the city. Ever since, they\u2019ve had to drive into the city because of line construction or infrequent \/ no service. I have friends within the city who live close to GO train stations who still choose to drive for the same reasons, who would gladly switch to transit if it were a truly feasible mode of transportation.\nDue to underfunding and lack of proper accountability, people are pushed to congest. And removal of the option of safe alternatives to driving will only encourage it more. We\u2019d be building a city of roads, not of destinations. Several studies have shown that a majority of customers to business on Bloor\/Danforth are frequented by those who walk, take transit, or cycle. Several experts and studies show that cities encouraging modes of active transport are healthier and happier.\nAs a driver, cyclist, and public transit user, the biggest reason I would drive is due to overcrowding on transit (even during off-peak hours) due to lack of frequent service or unreliability and a patchwork of safe bike routes that would take me twice as long compared to a direct path to my destination.\nIf you want to reduce gridlock and save people time, without going back in time, fund transit operations and finish rail projects. Give people options. That\u2019s the solution to congestion.\n",

My much more educated on this topic friend, also suggests to replace street parking in major streets to free up lane space as well as introduce a congestion tax to help fund public transit infrastructure.\nBuilding cities around cars is setting us back, limiting mobility in urban areas, increasing pollution and it affects everybody equally, rich or poor.\nI'd imagine that if you've got money, you value your time a lot more than the average person and the last thing you want is be stuck in traffic instead of growing your business or enjoying social time with friends and family.\n\u00a0\nConcerns Over Property Rights:\nThe amendments proposed under the Building Broadband Faster Act raise significant concerns regarding property rights. The ability to expropriate land for broadband projects without adequate safeguards undermines the rights of property owners and could lead to unjust outcomes. It is essential that any infrastructure development respects and protects the rights of individuals and communities.\n\u00a0\nEnvironmental Protections:\nI am particularly troubled by the proposed exemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act included in the Highways Act. Protecting our natural environment and biodiversity must be a priority in any infrastructure development. We cannot afford to prioritize concrete over the preservation of our ecosystems. Comprehensive environmental assessments are vital to ensure that we understand the potential impacts of our actions on the environment and take necessary steps to mitigate them.\n\u00a0\nIn conclusion, play dirty for the right team instead of letting the corrupt boys ruin our city.\n\u00a0\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.\nP.S. check out the YouTube Channel \"Not Just Bikes\" -- he breaks these issues down eloquently.\n",

Not only will it be ineffective, it will inevitably result in a loss of human life when cyclists get hit by cars.\nClosing bike lanes won't reduce gridlock or save you time. Simply put, motor vehicles cause congestion, not bikes. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary, the evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion, whereas people switching from bikes to cars does. Combined with proposals to build the new 413 highway and create a traffic tunnel under the 401, these plans further lock us into the car-centric planning decisions that lead to congestion in the first place.\nRemoving bike lanes can be considerably more costly than installation. Municipalities have not budgeted for this, and even if the province picks up the tab, ripping out functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible.\n\u2022\tBike lanes are an incredibly efficient way of moving people and are able to move many more people per hour than a lane focused primary on moving motor vehicles.\n\u2022\tBike lanes help to provide transportation choice, which helps to reduce the overall number of motor vehicles on the road. Just as highways result in more car trips, bike lanes increase cycling trips.\n\u2022\tBike lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles.\n\u2022\tReallocating road space to transit and active transportation reduced traffic volumes and GHG emissions without substantially changing traffic speeds.\nI urge you to revoke your support for Bill-212.\n",

It happens because of the greed and short sightedness of drivers.\nIf the government is blaming gridlock on bike, they are being misleading and deceptive.\nIf the Ford government wanted to improve travel times on major streets, they  should encourage municipalities to remove parking, and crack down on illegal parking\/stopping by couriers and delivery people.\nHighway 413 will not be a long term solution to traffic.

NFU-O policy calls on all levels of government to enact and follow transparent, rational planning guidelines, regulations, and bylaws to ensure fairness to all citizens, to protect farmland and ecologically sensitive areas from development, and to prevent the further privatization of public lands.\nIt\u2019s bad enough that Highway 413 will pave over 400 acres of the Greenbelt and another 2,000+ acres of Class 1 and Class 2 farmland \u2013 some of Ontario\u2019s most productive agricultural land \u2013 but the farmland loss won\u2019t stop there as the highway will only accelerate urban sprawl until much of the remaining prime agricultural land farmers require to feed Ontarians is encased in cement and covered in asphalt. Choosing highways over farmland is a grave mistake.\nThe Government has yet to provide any independently verified data to prove that the Highway 413 project will achieve the Acts goals of actually reducing gridlock or saving commuters\u2019 time. Instead, the research suggests that the highway will save less than one minute of commuting time on average and will have the effect of increasing overall vehicle traffic within the GGH.\nThe NFU-O urges the provincial government to revoke these Acts before it is too late. Instead of spending a minimum of $10 billion on an unnecessary highway that will vastly increase our CO\u2082 emissions at a time when we must play our part in reaching net zero emissions, we call on the government to do the right thing and instead make better use of the existing Highway 407 to alleviate current gridlock and to reallocate taxpayers\u2019 money destined for Highway 413 to support a public transit-orientated GGH.\nThe NFU-O strongly objects to the measures in these Acts that exempt Highway 413 early works projects from any environmental impact assessment (EA) under the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA). All three of these early work projects (ramp embankment near the existing Exit 330 on the westbound Highway 401, a bridge near Highway 10 in Peel Region, and a bridge near Bovaird Drive West in Peel region) are on or directly adjacent to arable farmland and\/or sensitive natural heritage; the environmental impacts of these early work projects are unknown. Fast-tracking these early works projects by eliminating any EA deliberately avoids an assessment of the cumulative impact of the entire Highway 413 project and will make it much more difficult to change course and offer sustainable solutions to traffic gridlock in the GGH.\nSimilarly, creating an \u201caccelerated EA process\u201d that exempts all activities by or on behalf of the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) that are for or related to Highway 413 from the EAA is giving the MTO license to irrevocably destroy farmland and our natural environment without any legally-binding assessment, public consultation, or real analysis of alternatives. The environmental impact assessment report process that will replace the EAA has no legal teeth and offers no requirement that the Government take into account objections from Indigenous communities, environmental and agricultural organizations, or the broader public that show evidence of the negative environmental impacts of the Highway 413 project. These Acts pave over the democratic processes of the EAA.\nThe NFU-O is of the opinion that any Highway 413 proposal should require a legally-binding comprehensive environmental assessment under the EAA wherein the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks must review all documents, require the approval of the Minister and Cabinet to proceed, and allow for public requests for more extensive review or public consultation. Public consultation should include full public access to all the key documents related to Highway 413, consultation events where the public can provide feedback, and the opportunity to submit written comments directly to the Ministry about their concerns. Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act disallow these most basic processes to ensure our natural environment is protected.\nThe decision to exempt Part II of the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993 that allows for an amendment or revocation of an instrument for or related to the Highway 413 project is nothing less than a wholesale denial of the right of all Ontarians to ensure that their government upholds \u201cas a common goal the protection, conservation and restoration of the natural environment for the benefit of present and future generations.\u201d\nFinally, the NFU-O objects to Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act empowering the government to expropriate land for the purpose of the Highway 413 project. We also protest the Act\u2019s weak Indigenous consultation plan wherein there is no real ability for Indigenous communities to exercise their land or treaty rights to stop or significantly alter the project, beyond minor alterations in the course of the highway.\nIf built, Highway 413 will be an irrevocable and costly mistake that will forever be seen as a betrayal of the public\u2019s environmental rights, a huge step away from a green and just transition in the face of climate change, and the beginning of the end of farming and environmental protection within the Greater Golden Horseshoe. It\u2019s not too late to prioritize the protection of our finite farmland and dwindling natural heritage and pursue sustainable public transit networks over a highway destined to endanger the quality of life for all in its vicinity\nSincerely,\nMax Hansgen\nPresident, National Farmers Union - Ontario\n",

If bike lanes were removed, cyclists would continue to ride their bikes, but have to rely on the same lanes as cars, slowing down traffic.\nFor cyclists:\n- Bike lanes protect cyclists from often fatal collisions with cars.\nFor store owners on Bloor:\n- I often have trouble finding space to lock my bike up at the bike stands. Bike lanes instead of cars allow for more people to park in front of stores via bike than could possibly park with cars (maybe 1.5 cars per store versus 4 bike lock spots in front of each shop).\nThe unprotected areas of the Bloor Street bike lanes already feel unsafe as cars pull into the bike lanes. When cars pull into the bike lanes, cyclists have no choice but to enter the main road. The problem here is that when there are bike lanes (that are inaccessible), drivers do not expect cyclists to be on the road and thus it is drastically more unsafe for cyclists.\n",

        "comment":"I am wholeheartedly disappointed in our Province for proposing such a dangerous bill that compromises the safety of its citizens by removing bike lanes and using this as a ruse to hide the fact that this bill permits the Province to to take lands from registered owners in order to \"expedite building highways\".  The Province should not be granted such power that they can infringe on property owners without permission and public discussion.  This Province continues to disregard provided facts and statistical data from the transportation and traffic experts that bike lanes do not contribute to congestion but primarily provincial infrastructure construction (eg: Metrolinx construction, utility upgrades).  Furthermore, it has been historically proven that the solution to congestion in major cities around the world is not to build more highways, that only contributes to creating more traffic and congestion.  Removing bike lanes will not stop cyclists from biking, but doing this will force them into sharing the road with ill-informed and aggressive drivers putting them at high risk to be killed. It also does not help that when collisions happen between a car and a cyclist, the general car-centric attitude of our provincial government is to side with drivers.  As both a cyclist and a driver in Toronto I agree that congestion is a huge problem that needs to be addressed and people understand that traffic is expected in order to complete critical projects for infrastructure development (ie: public transit, utility maintenance, etc.), but Bill 212 is absolutely not the way to go about this.  People do not have a problem with the Province trying find solutions to create better living conditions but they do have a problem with a corrupt government that puts its own needs and benefits above its citizens in pursuit of profits.\n",

        "comment":"Introduction\nThe comments set out below stem not only from my views on such matters, but also from over 30 years professional experience working on the planning and design of transportation systems (of all types) for towns and cities. This experience gives me huge insight into the need to holistically consider all forms of transportation, and their interactions with land use, the built form of the city and economic development. It is imperative that transportation analysis and development considers the merits of ALL forms of transportation and how each is best placed to contribute in each circumstance. There should not be a sole focus on a single form of transportation to the detriment of all else. And to be clear, this is reflected in my personal life where I walk, cycle, drive or take transit depending on the trip being made. Better decisions are made when one has personal experience of all the possible options.\nSchedule 3 \u2013 Highway 413 Act \u2013 Exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act\nI am opposed to Schedule 3 of the Bill. The Environmental Assessment Act is there to ensure a robust, transparent and credible analysis of all the environmental impacts of major infrastructure projects, such as the proposed Highway 413. Given the contentious nature of Highway 413, it is imperative to set out the environmental impacts fully, alongside the broader case for the project. To simply pick and choose what projects the Act applies to is wrong.\nOf course, this exemption is for a project that itself should not be built. Aside from the obvious adverse environmental impacts, in the long term it will do little to alleviate congestion. Empirical evidence over decades has shown that induced demand, that well known phenomenon whereby traffic in urban and suburban areas simply expands to fill the available space, will return congestion to the same level. Even the MTO\u2019s own modelling is showing this (see https:\/\/www.thetrillium.ca\/news\/municipalities-transit-and-infrastructu\u2026). Experts at the Bill\u2019s public committee hearing on Monday September 18, 2024 were of this view. Overall, Highway 413 simply locks us further into the failed 1950s car dependent planning paradigm.\nSchedule 4 \u2013 Highway Traffic Act Part XII Municipal By-Laws and Bicycle Lanes\nI am opposed to Schedule 4 of the Bill.\nFirstly, it is egregious overreach and anti-democratic for the Provincial Government to interfere in matters best left to local municipalities. The local municipalities are best placed to consider the needs and interests of the local populace for local matters such as bicycle lanes. They will take a holistic view of all the competing demands for road space, alongside wider policy objectives around safety, improving transportation options (not just cars), equity, business impacts and environmental considerations (from micro to macro). Of note, bicycle lanes are often an integral part of complete streets that aim to recognize and accommodate the needs of all users of public space, not just those in cars. In short, bicycle lanes should be a matter for local municipalities ONLY.\nSecondly, the proposal to waste taxpayers money to REMOVE existing bicycle lanes in the City of Toronto (on Bloor, Yonge and University) is counter to all contemporary thinking around city building and placemaking. Not a single credible organization has supported this proposal, with the Ontario Traffic Council, the Ontario Professional Planning Institute, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, the Bloor Annex BIA, and 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto against this proposal. To date, the Province has provided no data or evidence to support it\u2019s assertion that these bicycle lanes are materially impacting motor vehicle congestion; only anecdotal and misleading evidence has been provided. To state that only 1.2 % of people commute by bicycle and 70% by car as justification is disingenuous and frankly fraudulent when these numbers relate to the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), an area that stretches from Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe and includes places like Richmond Hill, Oakville and Vaughan. When considering the case for bike lanes, a much more focused area or corridor analysis is the appropriate level for data analysis and these show much higher levels of bicycle usage on these corridors with the bike lanes. Even if the bike lanes are removed, most of these corridors will have some level of parking, such that there will still only be 2 lanes for traffic for most of the time, thus achieving no material benefit. And any material benefit will quickly be nullified by induced traffic, that will known phenomenon whereby traffic simply expands to fill the available space, thus returning congestion to the same level. In short, the proposal to remove these bicycle lanes is simply not supported by policy or evidence and they should be left in place.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my opposition to the addendum to Bill 212, which requires the province to remove the separated bike lanes that have been installed on Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street in the City of Toronto. I live in the Trinity Bellwoods neighborhood in the city, and I have used the separated bike lanes since their installation. I use the bike lanes several times each week to commute to work, run errands and attend events in the city center. While I own a car, population growth is making Toronto and its suburbs increasingly congested, and building additional roads and capacity to address long term demand is not feasible in congested urban areas. Cycling on separated bike lanes presents a safe and efficient alternative to driving. Removing the bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge will make it harder for me to commute to and from work, reduce my ability to visit and spend money at local businesses, and ride through the city with my young son, all of which I have been able to do more easily since bike lanes made it faster and safer to ride downtown.\nIn addition to the personal reasons that I have for opposing the removal of the bike lanes, I oppose their removal due to the apparent lack of technical justification for removing them. The City of Toronto went through a lengthy (and expensive) planning and design process that justified the installation of the separated bike lanes prior to installing them. Section 195.5 of Bill 212 implies that the Ministry of Transportation should undertake its own review and analysis prior to making a decision to remove any separated bike lanes. However, while the premier and minister of transportation have made various statements about the negative impact of these bike lanes on motor vehicle traffic, the province has not produced any studies or data that demonstrate that the bike lanes are having a negative impact on mobility within the city overall, which should be metric that determines whether the bike lanes stay or go, in my opinion. On the other hand, the City of Toronto has produced studies and data showing significant increases in cycling and use of bike share facilities - including significant increases of bike share facilities along Bloor - since the separated bike lanes were installed, which supports the notion that the bike lanes are improving mobility for many.\nIn the absence of a technical justification for removing the bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge, I oppose the the enormous expense to taxpayers that removal of the separated bike lanes will require. An analysis completed by City of Toronto's city manager indicates that removing it will cost tens of millions of dollars to remove the bike lanes - not to mention the tens of millions already spent by the city to design and build the bike lanes in the first place - and I think it would be an enormous waste of money for the province to proceed with this work at this time, without a sound rationale for doing so.\nI hope the province will reconsider its decision to remove the separated bike lanes on Bloor Street, University Avenue and Yonge Street at this time and at least subject these bike lanes to a thorough and impartial review to determine their value prior to spending millions to remove some or all of what has been installed.\nThanks.\n",

        "comment":"To the Ford Government:\nIt is the belief of countless enviornmental activists and biology professionals that Bill 212 does not take sustainability and environmental protection into account in a productive way, and is therefore reckless and destructive. Highway projects like Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass are not going to fix any problems. In fact, the loss of vital wetland areas and wildlife habitat will be destructive in the long run. Replacign wetland areas, natural water filters and storage areas, and replacing them with concrete and other hard surfaces will make the GTA more susceptible to large flooding events such as those that were experienced this summer. Reparing the damage to infrastructure from frequent flooding will cost the government and the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years. Moreover, the traffic gridlock issues that these highway projects are trying to fix could be addressed by increasing access to public transit and encouraging alternate forms of transportation such as biking. Bike lanes should be added to urban areas, not taken away as will be demanded by Bill 212 if it passes. These highway projects are unecessary, and will cause harm to human lives and wildlife habitat.\nFinally, the amount of power given to the Minsiter of Transportation through Bill 212 is frightening. No one person should be able to make all those construction  project decisions without proper environmental impact assessment and consultation with public groups, especially indigenous communities who are the stewards and caretakers of the land. This is a dangerous precedent and will inevitably lead to important details being overlooked in the name of getting the projects done faster.\nPlease reconsider Bill 212, and make human safety and environmental protection higher priorities.\n",

So many food delivery folks are able to bypass traffic with these lanes, reducing congestion during rush hours.\nPlease also keep environmental reviews for highway projects.

        "comment":"This legislation appears, from what information has been made publicly available, to be myopic and misguided in the extreme. The only proven method to reduce traffic congestion is to reduce the trip share by single-occupancy vehicles. This means increasing modal share of active transportation, transit, and micro-mobility users. How will this bill achieve an increase in non-vehicle travel mode share? What data or reporting was used in formulating this legislation? Please listen to the experts who are significantly concerned that this bill will worsen traffic congestion in the near term due to construction impacts; in the medium term due to induced demand; and in the long term by making it unsafe for non-vehicle users to use the roads and decreasing long-term adoption of non-vehicle modes. Finally, while I am in favour of reducing red tape in order to accomplish projects quicker, the type of red tape being cut matters. Cutting review and input from experts will likely lead to lengthier construction, more disruptions, changes in the field, cost overruns, and poorly planned and implemented projects that ultimately do more harm than benefit considering opportunity costs of how money could be more appropriately allocated.\nIn short, please listen to the experts and their comments on this proposed bill. Legislation should be supported with facts and clear evidence of the expected impacts. This bill does the opposite and should be rescinded or significantly amended until greater thought can be put into achieving the intended outcomes. Thank you.\n",

That's because there is none. Bikes do not cause traffic, cars cause traffic. If the Ford government actually wanted to address traffic congestion, it would work to make other transportation options attractive for uptown and suburban commuters, namely, transit options including expanded subway and bus networks.\nThe Ford government's attack on bike-users and neglect of public transportation in Toronto is an attack on average Torontonians who want a more livable city. The Ford government has decided to ignore the hundreds of thousands of us who are not capable or who cannot afford to drive.

Bulldozing through wetlands will impact the area's ability to handle water, something the GTA already struggles with. It will devastate local wildlife, which all play a part in our environment. Any future costs for flooding, food insecurity, clean water, environmental cleanup\/restoration will be borne by tax payers.\nBuilding Highway 413 will encourage more drivers to get to their destinations in areas that will not support any more car traffic. The concepts of induced demand, sprawl and the astronomical costs of maintaining all of that have all been researched. Adding more cars and roads will introduce more gridlock, the complete opposite of this bill's intention.\nWe are in a climate crisis and this government is not taking the steps to provide any alternatives to car dependency.\nSecondly, removing bike lanes will just cause more morbidity and mortality. Collisions, even when not causing death, often cause permanent mental and physical damage for both the vulnerable road user and driver. It also discourages new cyclists that are not confident on the road with dangerous and speeding drivers (of which, there is very little enforcement).\nI am an orthopaedic nurse. The amount of serious injuries from cars I see is devastating. If airplanes or any other form of transit caused as much death and destruction, no one would use it. The research exists to reduce this, but this government has chosen to ignore science.\nI cycle to work, and my family and friends worry every time, wondering if I will make it there in one piece. Why do I still do it? The hospital has limited parking and I want to save spaces for people who have no option but to drive. It also keeps my mental health and physical health in shape. It addresses my eco-anxiety, as I try to do what I can, even though I know the climate cannot be fixed by my singular actions.\nOpponents to cycling lanes often cite their physical need to park closer due to disabilities and their age. What about people who cannot afford vehicles? What about children who cannot drive? There are complaints that youth can't cope, but they have no opportunity to practice independence due to dependency on cars. Many would be in a healthier mental and physical state if active transport options were made a priority.\nNot only will removing the bike lanes endanger lives, it will continue to make congestion worse. As a cyclist, I will take the whole lane (as is my right) to protect my life. Too many drivers pass too close as a \"misjudgment\" of distance, or don't see me when I ride too close to the right.\nBike lanes are a municipal matter and should not require approval from the Provincial government.\nThis bill is intended to be inflammatory on climate, vulnerable road users, the poor, and the people who care about the above. I am so disappointed that the government is choosing to ignore their own research, statistics from businesses around bike lanes, research from around the world that contradicts the sections for Highway 413 and requiring Ministry approval of bike lanes.\n",

Here are several key points I would like to highlight:\n1. Bike Lanes Do Not Cause Gridlock:\nResearch consistently shows that bike lanes do not contribute to increased traffic congestion. In fact, they can help alleviate it. The principle of induced demand indicates that expanding road capacity for cars often leads to more driving, not less. When new lanes are added, they attract more drivers who were previously discouraged by congestion, ultimately leading to a return to previous traffic levels or even worse conditions. Conversely, dedicated bike lanes encourage cycling and can reduce the number of cars on the road by providing a safer alternative for transportation.\n2. Counterproductive Impact on Traffic Flow:\nRemoving bike lanes from main streets would have a counterproductive effect on traffic flow. This action would force cyclists to take more circuitous, impractical routes, potentially discouraging cycling altogether and pushing people back into cars. The question arises: Does the government truly want more people in cars on city streets? If cyclists revert to driving due to a lack of safe, direct routes, they will contribute more to traffic congestion than they would as cyclists. A single car occupies significantly more road space than a bicycle and moves fewer people per unit of road space.\n3. Safety and Economic Benefits of Bike Lanes:\nBike lanes significantly enhance safety for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike. Research indicates that dedicated bike lanes reduce the likelihood of accidents involving all road users by creating a clear separation between motor vehicles and cyclists. This separation not only protects cyclists but also contributes to a calmer driving environment, leading to safer roads for everyone. Studies have shown that cities with more bike infrastructure experience lower rates of traffic-related injuries and fatalities. Furthermore, bike lanes can boost local economic activity; businesses near bike lanes often report increased customer traffic as cyclists tend to shop more frequently and spend similar amounts as car drivers.\n4. Cost Implications of Removing Bike Lanes:\nThe removal of bike lanes would not only be costly in terms of construction but could also exacerbate gridlock during the removal process. The disruption caused by such construction would likely lead to increased congestion in the short term while failing to provide any long-term solutions.\n5. Equity and Accessibility:\nBike lanes provide an affordable transportation option for those who cannot afford or choose not to own a car. Removing this infrastructure disproportionately affects lower-income individuals and limits transportation choices for all residents.\n6. Inconsistency with Government Policy:\nThis bill contradicts the government\u2019s own Bill 185, which aims to remove minimum parking requirements in Protected Major Transit Station Areas and Major Transit Station Areas. This policy encourages residents to utilize alternatives such as biking and public transit instead of relying solely on cars. Supporting Bill 212 undermines these efforts by promoting car dependency rather than fostering a diverse and efficient transportation ecosystem.\nIn conclusion, I urge you to reconsider the implications of Bill 212. Rather than focusing on expanding highways and removing bike lanes, we should invest in infrastructure that promotes safe, efficient transportation options that benefit our communities. Thank you for considering these points as you deliberate on this important issue.\n",

As someone who does not bike in the city too often, every time I bike in the city I\u2019m almost hit or run over by a vehicle. Half of those times it\u2019s because the bike lane turns into a regular car lane, putting me directly in the line of traffic - but still safer than if there was no bike lane at all. My Dad bikes to work downtown from East York every day, I want him to be safe. My Downstairs Neighbour bikes around the city, I want them to be safe. My roommate bikes around the city, I want her to be safe. I bike around the city, I want to be as safe as any car.\nStaying safe as a cyclist is difficult when someone simply opening a car door can break your arm.\nWhen I think about Toronto, I see images of the CN tower, street cars on Spadina, round little raccoons, and bikes. Discouraging this important part of our city\u2019s culture discourages our city\u2019s identity. This will also have an incredibly negative effect on both the autonomy of movement for those without cars, as well as the mental health and physical well-being of Toronto citizens.\nI am a human being, trying to live my life and get where I need to go. I just want to get home safe. If that\u2019s an inconvenient for those in cars, maybe they should try to bike a mile in our helmets.\n",

        "comment":"I do not think that the construction of highways should be made without adequate environmental assessments being done. Wetlands are a large part of our local ecosystems and support life in many different ways. This includes migratory birds, amphibians, fish, and insects. The highway will not only heavily damage local ecosystems, a critical habitat - but fragment them and displace wildlife.\nSecondly, water quality will be heavily degraded by runoff and pollution. Runoff can contain oil, heavy metals and chemicals that can leach into the wetland. This is a provincially significant wetland and it would be a shame to run a highway through it.\nSpecies at risk have also been seen in the Holland marsh. After these sightings were made, construction was stopped. It should be brought up and discussed - as we do not want to endanger the lives of these species at risk by destroying their habitat.\nHydrology would also be heavily disrupted. The Holland marsh naturally stores and regulates water in the area. This reduces flood risks and maintains groundwater levels. Highways can divert and block water flow.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limit the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario. This decision is not just short-sighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nFirstly, and from a legislative perspective, requiring provincial approval for bike lanes is an overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Drawing on local expertise and community feedback, municipalities create transportation plans that effectively balance traffic management with key priorities such as active transportation, multimodal transit options, and environmental protection. It remains unclear how the Ministry of Transportation can make more informed decisions about local transportation issues than the municipalities themselves. Instead of micromanaging bicycle lane implementation, the Ministry could better support the development of new housing by streamlining its own approval processes.\nAs for the impact of bike lanes, evidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes significantly reduce gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those relying on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without vehicle access, including myself. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto, but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the environment. The province must respect local decision-making when considering transportation planning.\n",

        "comment":"I seriously believe Bill 212 should rethink the notion of taking away bike lanes in Toronto. By removing bike lanes, you are taking away a safe avenue for many Torontonians' commute. Removing will not reduce congestion.\nIf anything, by logic, by removing a part of a road to favor cars, it will just put more vehicles and cars on the roads. By having a diverse landscape of transportation, it supports peoples' choice on how they want to commute. Therefore, with more people using bike lanes over their cars, there will be less congestion, as some may opt to use their bicycles over cars.\nAdditionally, some residents in Toronto, like myself, cannot afford to own a vehicle. Using bike lanes is ESSENTIAL to getting around the city. Many rely on bikes lanes top be kept safe while on busy roads, like Bloor St West. It is insensitive to assume that every person in Toronto stands on equal footing, and would benefit from taking these away in the name of reducing congestion.\nBy having bike lanes on these major roads, it is an act of fairness, and an act of choice. Taking that away, leaving people stranded, is unfair, and that is not what a leader of Ontario should be doing to its people. It shouldn't be about what's beneficial for one mode of transportation, but instead a balance of both.\nBiking is physical activity. Its good for the environment, keeps people healthy and happy through exercise, and many who cannot afford cars rely on it. By taking bike lanes away off major roads and intersections, you and endangering those who choose to ride bikes.\n",

        "comment":"RE: Opposition to Bill 212 Specific to the Building of Highway 413\nI am writing on behalf of Town of Caledon Council to share our opposition to significant elements of the proposed Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. Specifically, we object to the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 (Schedule 2), which infringes on the rights of residents whose properties are impacted by the construction of Highway 413.\nMore than 45 per cent of Highway 413\u2019s length spans Caledon. Residents with properties in the 413\u2019s Focused Analysis Area have ostensibly had their land uses frozen since the project\u2019s initiation in 2007. Family farms could not expand knowing they would never recover their capital investments before expropriation. Several homeowners could not sell due to market rate suppression due to speculation of future expropriations.\nNow, Bill 212\u2019s expedited timelines to take possession of resident\u2019s lands needed for this priority highway will leave those residents vulnerable and potentially unhoused. Resident rights during the construction of Highway 413 must be upheld. To that end, Caledon seeks the following changes to the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 (Schedule 2):\n\u2022\tRevise the expropriation provisions to ensure clear and fair compensation that may help minimize disruption for affected residents, small businesses, vulnerable groups, and low-income communities.\n\u2022\tRemove the punitive, first offence fines of $50,000 plus $10,000 for each additional day that will be imposed on individuals who struggle to find appropriate alternate housing within the expedited timelines permitted by the Bill.\n\u2022\tRemove Section 13.6 which authorizes entry into the private dwelling of a Caledon resident and the use of force to take possession of their land.\nIn addition, Caledon also seeks these additional revisions to Bill 212:\n\u2022\tRestore comprehensive environmental assessments that evaluate the impacts on water sources, ecosystems, wildlife, noise, air quality, and local habitations.\n\u2022\tStrengthen provisions in the Bill that protect water sources, forests, and other natural resources from the adverse effects of highway construction, ensuring that such policies are integrated into highway planning.\n\u2022\tCreate independent oversight bodies to monitor the execution of highway projects to ensure the projects are aligned with the public interest and promote Provincial accountability and transparency.\n\u2022\tProvide legal and planning frameworks for land-use planning surrounding the highways to prevent further legal implications and zoning issues that may arise from unregulated developments around new highways.\n\u2022\tRevise the Bill to include clear and accessible processes for public participation to ensure that any changes to land use, zoning, or environmental regulations are subject to appropriate legal scrutiny.\nWe are registering this opposition with the Environmental Registry of Ontario before the November 20 deadline.\nSincerely,\nplease see attachment for full details\n",

The solution to congestion has been proven time and time again to increase mixed modes of transportation (which cycling is a huge part of) instead of catering to drivers, most of which are single occupancy. Removing vital cycling infrastructure will inevitably lead to more drivers, more congestion, and more dangerous and toxic environment for all of the citizens. I also strongly oppose the powers the bill would grant to circumvent environmental policy to build more highways. It is 2024. We know that climate change is the biggest existential threat to our planet. This bill would only accelerate this threat, and as a resident of Ontario, I am outraged, disgusted and embarrassed.\nCyclists are not going anywhere. We don't cycle just as a choice, for many it is a necessity. By removing lanes and barriers, you are not removing us from the transit equation, but are removing the only safety measures we have. If this bill passes, all future cycling injury and death that could've been avoided by having bike infrastructure will be blood on this governments hands. You wouldn't imagine removing safety barriers on the sides of highways, so why would you do it for the least protected commuter?\nThere is sufficient data from a multitude of trustworthy sources that prove that cyclists are not the cause of congestion, and that they are in fact part of the solution.

        "comment":"Putting bypass highways as a priority form of infrastructure planning is the absolute wrong path to choose in attempting to alleviate vehicular gridlock. Highway 401 was constructed as a bypass highway through Toronto in the mid 20th century. Then highway 407 was built as a bypass to highway 401 in the early 21st century. Now the planned Highway 413 will be a bypass to both roads? It has been consistently proven that the 'one more lane' (or in this situation 'one more highway) is not effective in reducing road congestion.  If there is any excess capacity in our roads and highways, our vehicular dependent society will overload it until it is not efficient anymore. In addition relying on private vehicular transportation is the absolute least efficient way to transport people from.one point to another.  Consider the space that a single vehicle takes up on the road, and compare it to the carrying capacity of a bus. Even assuming there is more than one person travelling in a car at a time, a bus or train that is at 50% capacity far exceeds the effectiveness for transporting people. If the Premier and elected members of the Conservative Party who are blaming the traffic issues while driving in the GTA only need to look at themselves for being a part of traffic they so despise. If there were feasible mass transit options for people to commute in and out of the GTA along the Highway 401 corridor, people would make the choice to take a bus or train! This will reduce the amount of vehicular traffic on the highways which improves the strain on the highway for people who need to use those roads.\nIn addition, the details in the bill that will provide the Minister of Transportation powers to reject municipally proposed bike lanes when they are proposed to replace a vehicular lane is dangerous to vulnerable road users and will be a financial strain on the taxpayers in Ontario.\nFirstly, the Ford government prides themselves on being \"open for business\". This part of bill 212 creates more red tape for hundreds or thousands of active and potential infrastructure projects in the Province of Ontario. Creating additional bureaucracy for construction through the provincial approval of municipal affairs will stop municipal infrastructure projects dead in their tracks, negatively impacting jobs provided by the construction of these infrastructure projects.  As a civil engineer in Ontario, I am well aware of how ineffective the provincial government is when it comes to obtaining approvals on development and infrastructure projects, and there is no reason to think there would be any changes with this new bill.\nI think the proposed sections of the bill in relation to the removal is an absolute ghastly waste of municipal and provincial tax payers money. Why remove a piece of valuable infrastructure that was recently implemented and is positively impacting traffic congestion? The estimated 48 million dollars to remove the existing bike lanes in Toronto is an absolutely immature way to spend taxpayers hard earned money. That is also not to include the municipal funds that were used to recently construct the infrastructure. Also, not to mention the negative impacts to traffic gridlock from the deconstruction of recently implemented road infrastructure will cause the exact opposite of what this bill is proposing to solve in the first place.\nNot only will the proposed changes in this bill not reduce gridlock, or save people time, they will also be a heavy burden on the taxpayers and make roads more dangerous and ineffective.\n",

The Ford government repeatedly cites a decade-old and irrelevant figure to paint an inaccurate picture of cycling in Toronto. There are much more relevant figures available to the government but they choose to manipulate public perception and pander for political gain. I am not going to cite those numbers here because I am certain that the government is already aware and choosing to ignore these.\nOur metrics for evaluating projects should consider the efficiency and safety of movement of PEOPLE, whether they are in vehicles or not. Prioritizing one method of transit is a narrow view and will lead to higher costs, longer travel times, and deaths. This is in addition to additional economic losses created by undermining our transportation systems.\nWith an ever-densifying Toronto (based on provincial targets), the best way to move PEOPLE can only be achieved with a holistic view. Transit alternatives such as the Eglinton LRT can have a massive impact on vehicle traffic and travel times. Cycle paths such as those on Bloor and University are already moving numbers of cyclists that are comparable to vehicular traffic.\nNone of this is news to the current provincial government. Unfortunately, though, they are choosing to pander to their supporters at the cost of the economy and public safety - all while stoking divisions within the province. This is not leadership.\n",

Additionally, this Act would enable the province to override the transportation planning within municipalities, which in cities like Toronto, would mainly benefit individuals who do not live in the city, rather than Torontonians themselves. Continuing to build more highway infrastructure will never result in less traffic and gridlock, as building more highways will only continue to encourage more people to get on the roads with their personal vehicles. Instead, the province should be focusing their efforts in building better infrastructure for public transportation, and safe cycling infrastructure, as this would allow more people to be moved in cheaper, more sustainable, and healthier ways. If the efforts in attempting to pass this Act and the resources that would be spent thereafter, would instead be redirected on creating more public transportation infrastructure, the benefits would be experienced on a much larger scale.\n",

        "comment":"\"Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\" would negatively affect the future of mobility in the Province of Ontario. Slowing or reversing the installation of bike lanes will have an adverse impact on children\u2019s health and the environment.\nAccording to the Government of Canada, only 37.6% of children aged 5-17 are getting the minimum 60 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous activity recommended by Health Canada. Across Ontario, fewer kids are using active modes of transportation (e.g., walking, cycling, rollerblading, scootering and rolling for wheelchairs or other mobility devices) for their school journey: 22% of kids walk to school and 4% cycle, whereas 74% travel by motorized transport. Bicycle lanes are important for kids who currently ride their bicycles, but also for reversing these trends.\nDriving kids to school has led to several serious impacts:\nMore inactivity. Kids miss the opportunity for much-needed physical activity, fresh air, and quality interaction with parents, caregivers, and friends.\nLess focus. Students are less focused in class, contributing to poorer academic outcomes.\nWorse congestion. An estimated 25-40% of vehicle congestion during morning rush hour is related to school drop-off.\nRiskier roads. 78% of Ontario parents reported witnessing unsafe driving behaviours in school zones.\nMoreover, evidence shows that creating more car-centric lanes and roads ultimately leads to even more congestion. Reducing congestion and creating safer, healthier roads requires creating additional bike lanes and encouraging people who are able to switch from driving to cycling. Clearly, we need more safe routes to school \u2013 not fewer \u2013 to get children and families walking and cycling to school safely.\nHigh quality networks of protected bike lanes on main streets are critical to providing safe routes to school and supporting higher rates of physical activity. By design, Ontario communities do not generally have side streets that run parallel to main streets for long distances. In suburban communities, they are designed to discourage traffic, and in urban communities like Toronto and Ottawa, they are often fragmented, with designated one-way sections that prevent traffic. While neighbourhood streets are important for bike lanes, main streets are the major connectors providing direct routes for students to get to school.\nOntario\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are rising: in 2022, they rose to 2017 levels after a pandemic-induced reduction. Road transportation is the largest source of pollution in the province, responsible for more than a quarter of all of Ontario\u2019s emissions. While we acknowledge that the intensity of Ontario\u2019s emissions reduced as Ontario\u2019s population and economy grew, we are concerned that emissions from road transportation continue to rise and that we are not on track to meet our 2030 climate goals.\nProtecting the health and safety of our communities, while also reducing congestion and fossil fuel pollution, requires that we do as much as we can to encourage cycling. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is unequivocal: \u201cTargets to reduce carbon emissions by 2030 in line with the 1.5-degree limit for global warming cannot be achieved without a systematic increase of cycling.\u201d\nAccording to research, a standard vehicle releases around five metric tons of carbon dioxide a year. Choosing a bike instead of a car just once a day cuts an average person\u2019s transportation-related carbon emissions by 67%.\nOntario contains the most densely populated areas in the country and is home to 40% of Canada\u2019s population. We urgently need the government of Ontario to demonstrate leadership that provides its residents with more \u2013 not fewer \u2013 opportunities for achieving a sustainable, safe, and prosperous future.\n",

This is true for both North American and European cities. Thinking that there somehow is a Canadian exception is misguided.\nWhat reduces gridlock is a concerted, coordinated and long-term effort to get people to leave their car and choose alternate means of transportation: transit and active transportation. This requires vision from decision-makers, and the willingness to achieve results in the long term, not for the next 12 months.\nBicycle infrastructure across Ontario cities has, over the past decade, resulted in a significant increase in bicycle usage as a legitimate means of transportation for all ages, helped by the rapid development of e-bikes.\nDedicated infrastructure has encouraged youth or seniors to embrace cycling because of the increased safety it affords. Without this infrastructure, and in the absence of credible enforcement on some motorists' repeated disrespect for bicycles as legitimate, full-fledged users of roadways, an increase in accidents is to be expected, followed by cyclists likely returning to their cars and adding to traffic issues.\nThe proposed dismantling of bike infrastructure, and the greater hurdles for municipalities to implement them, is an ill-informed, short-sighted measure that will not help mobility in our cities in any effective or durable way, but rather undermine it. It will only set Ontario further back, and make the future achievement of livable cities more difficult and costly.\n",

I have significant concerns about the effects this bill will have on the environment, local communities, and cyclist safety.\nIn terms of environmental impacts, by increasing highway construction, this could lead to irreversible damage to vulnerable ecosystems, including wetlands and endangered species habitats. These areas are essential to fight the effects of climate change and protect biodiversity. Prioritizing the development of more highways poses a critical risk to the environment. This will lead to an increased reliance on personal vehicles and higher greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, we should use these resources to improve public transit, ensuring it caters to all communities, including low-income individuals who rely on transit and cannot afford cars. Prioritizing highway expansion serves the wealthy and car owners, and as a Toronto citizen, this feels inequitable and unethical.\nLastly, one of the most critical issues to Bill 242 is its dangerous impact on cyclist safety. Without bike lanes, cyclists are left to navigate traffic alongside larger vehicles. This creates a hazardous environment where even minor mistakes by drivers can lead to lost lives.  A recent report indicates that from 2015 to the present, 28 cyclists have been killed and 380 seriously injured in Toronto, with 68% of those incidents occurring on streets lacking cycling infrastructure (Draaisma, CBC News, 2023).\nI am disgusted that the safety of cyclists is being sacrificed in the name of highway expansion\/reducing gridlock for cars. We must prioritize the needs of ALL road users, not just drivers.

In our neighbourhood in Mississauga, several roads have bike lines placed in them that have reduced the number of traffic lanes for cars and thus increased lineups, traffic confusion, traffic, congestion. The addition of bike lines on the road in Mississauga has led to more danger for car drivers due to reduce lanes head-on traffic trying to turn left with people coming into your lane because they\u2019re swerving the people in the bike lane. On the Aquitaine bike lanes here in Mississauga there\u2019s been virtually no bike use of this road over 30 years and since these bike lanes have been installed, there\u2019s been absolute minimum use of the bike lanes. I use this roadway every day 3 to 4 times a day and since the lanes have been introduced, I have seen less than 10 bikes on the Road. There have been several meetings locally with our counsellor and although we continually tell them, we do not want these bike lanes on the road. They continue to ignore our comments and our experiences as a driver.\n",

Bike lanes are some of the only protections that cyclists have to protect against the violence inflected upon us by raging drivers looking down on us from their armoured, air conditioned living rooms on wheels. We do not feel safe on our roads. Cyclists and pedestrians pay taxes to the city just like drivers but are not afforded the space, care or protection that a car-owning class is given. For many, biking or similar forms of motion are our only way to get around, taking that away from us is classist, environmentally short-sighted  and cruel.\n",

This is supported by studies discussed in recent publications. For example:\nGlobal studies show bike lanes can ease congestion, reduce emissions and are a boon to businesses\nResearch shows that dedicated bicycle lanes are not behind perceived traffic congestion and can have many benefits.\nCBC  Oct 22 2024\nShoshanna Saxe, Research Chair in Sustainable Infrastructure, said the city\u2019s current problems are the result of a lack of proper investment in public transit combined with significant growth.\nShe said expanding road capacity and accommodating vehicles is not a sustainable solution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a decade of unfortunate urban planning coming back to bite us \u2026 the physics of it is not possible. You cannot move millions of people around the city reliably in personal automobiles.\u201d\nEconomists Matthew Turner and Gilles Duranton coined \u201cThe Fundamental Law of Road Congestion,\u201d based on a study that found that increased road capacity did not relieve a city\u2019s traffic burdens \u2026Their study of U.S. cities found that whenever a town expanded road capacity by 10 per cent, the amount of driving also went up by 10 per cent.\nGlobe and Mail  Nov 12 2024\nThe key to solving Ontario\u2019s traffic woes is not about maintaining the status quo of car-dominated roadways. Instead, we need to embrace multi-modal transportation \u2014 an approach that supports different forms of transport that cater to the needs of the people in each community.\nOSPE firmly believes that each municipality should have the ability to design and implement transportation infrastructure that suits its communities\u2019 unique needs. Different neighbourhoods face different challenges, and the solutions must be tailored accordingly.\nOntario Society of Professional Engineers Blog  Nov 19 2024\nThe last quote points to a need for municipalities to have the ability to control their own transportation infrastructure, but Bill 212 counterintuitively opposes that ability. It proposes to add more red tape to municipalities\u2019 ability to fight gridlock with effective deployment of cycling infrastructure. This translates to more years of gridlock while municipalities\u2019 efforts to combat it are hamstrung. If the provincial government truly desired to combat gridlock, it should instead focus its efforts on expanding public transit, and redouble its efforts to open the badly needed Eglinton Crosstown LRT.\nTearing out recently built bike lanes is a reckless waste of taxpayer dollars that will not result in long term improvement of traffic gridlock. As cycling infrastructure has grown into a comprehensive interconnected network, so has demand for safe cycling options. There has been a huge increase in e-bike production in recent years. Municipalities should have the ability to develop a variety of modes of transportation as part of their strategy to combat gridlock.\n",

It\u2019s the quickest, healthiest, the least polluting and contributes the least towards congestion. But it has to be safe for people to do it. If bike lanes are removed and cycling is made unsafe, I will be forced to leave my bike at home and take my car which will add to congestion.\nDowntown condo towers are being designed to be taller and taller in order to meet housing targets. And they are being given exemptions on how many parking spaces they are providing. The assumption is that new downtown residents are going to cycle rather than drive. That only works when there is sufficient, safe cycling infrastructure.\nHere is a quote from Doug Ford when he appeared on TVO in 2017 after riding a bike in Toronto: \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes.

And ultimately if it is removed, it will be rebuilt once this provincial government is voted out of office.\nDon\u2019t waste our time, our money, our lives on a fantasy that downtown traffic will disappear.

I pass the University bike lanes every day on my way to work, and even as a pedestrian they make me feel safer, as an additional barrier between me and all the cars. The bike lanes took time and money to install. They are popular, and many of the people who use them would continue to bike on these roads even without separate lanes, they would just weave in and out of car traffic. Removing existing bike lanes would make these streets more dangerous and stressful for all road users, and there is no evidence travel times would improve.

Over the past several weeks, there have been many letters and statements from associations and organizations such as the Ontario Traffic Council, the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, and the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, which include myriad reasons as to why Bill 212 is short-sighted, regressive and undermines municipalities' efforts in making their communities safer for vulnerable road users.\nThese letters include data and statistics that have been collected and interpreted by engineers, physicians, researchers and professionals who are far more experienced than I am, so I will avoid reiterating their statements and instead focus on a topic that I am more familiar with, which is the consultation process involved in planning and designing bike lanes (I will present my experience from a Toronto perspective).\nDespite popular belief, bike lanes are not installed as a hasty decision by planners or engineers who are \"influenced by advocacy groups.\" There is a detailed and lengthy consultation process that involves project teams meeting with local councillors, stakeholders, institutions, business improvement area staff, police, EMS and fire services, and municipal services staff to refine bike lane designs and ensure they meet the very individual and specific needs of communities; this occurs at least one year prior to installation. Then, the designs are presented to the public for their review and comments before they are further revised and presented to Council for approval.\nThe consultation process can sometimes last years because there are many perspectives and nuances to consider when designing a street for all modes of travel, ages and abilities. Project staff spend time and effort building relationships with stakeholders by holding in-person meetings, conducting site visits, and spending hours responding to emails and calls. Often, the final bike lane design appears very different from the City's original proposal, but it is the result of careful consideration and refinement according to communities' specific needs.\nI am concerned that if Bill 212 is passed, this consultation process will be diminished (as it would be unfair and unrealistic to expect provincial staff to conduct consultation to the same degree as municipal staff), and municipalities will miss opportunities to install cycling infrastructure that would improve their communities, or would be forced to use bike lanes that are not suitable according to the speeds and motor vehicle traffic on their streets.\nPlease keep bike lane planning as the responsibility of the municipalities, who have the resources, expertise, and experience to design infrastructure that addresses the needs of the residents they serve.\n",

For a government that seeks to 'remove red tape' and 'speed up development', this is adding a lot of red tape and undue government intervention. This is not respecting local democracies and is not respecting municipalities' ability to plan for their communities.\nFurther, requiring the removal of bike lanes along Bloor Street Yonge Street, and University Street in Toronto is ridiculous - a waste of resources (potentially $48 million), will create worse traffic (through construction and induced demand of vehicles), and increase danger to all road users, especially the most vulnerable. Removing bike lanes and preventing future ones from being built is increasing the likelihood that cyclists will be severely harmed, and is reducing a healthy, climate-supportive commuting choice. It is targeting Toronto and is unnecessary.\nWhile the bike lane changes have received the most spotlight - a tactical decision - there is even more harm in the proposed Highway 413 Act. To exempt any of the works and\/or planning of the Hwy 413 from an Environmental Assessment and to exempt Hwy 413 from the Environmental Bill of Rights (1993) is deplorable. To suggest that an Environmental Impact Assessment, the contents of which the very same provincial government will determine, is an acceptable alternative is disappointing and misleading by design. The Bill outlines how the EIA will be used and outlines that the provincial government does not have to address any concerns raised - merely try to mitigate identified negative impacts, and 'consider' comments from Indigenous communities and the public at large. There is nothing preventing the provincial government from pushing forward on developing the Highway 413 despite any environmental consequences.\nFurther, the Bill highlights that the Minister shall publish the studies and updates of studies described in the draft EIA \"except where in the opinion of the minister the studies or updates of studies contain information about sensitive natural or cultural heritage matters\". This is extremely broad and should be removed and\/or altered to reduce the scope - otherwise this is likely to be used by the province to hide behind should there be any request from the public to view said reports.\nThe contents of this omnibus bill are far reaching and damaging and need to be significantly revised.

If we look at our own history, despite having one of the largest highways in North America (the 401), Toronto still has an extreme amount of traffic congestion even when compared to other cities with larger and denser populations. This result of induced demand means that any actions to widen highways or create new highways will inevitably result in more traffic. Additionally according to research commissioned by Environmental Defence, Highway 413 would cause over 17 million tonnes of additional CO2 emissions by 2050. Highway 413 will also damage and disrupt the ecology in the area.\nIf the goal of this bill is to reduce gridlock and save citizens' time, a better idea would be to invest in alternatives to driving. Investing in smart public transit projects could be extremely beneficial to the region. Investing is safe cycling infrastructure would also be beneficial in reducing car traffic and moving people more sustainably and efficiently. For every person who does not need to drive anymore (because it has been made easier and faster for them to take an alternative method) there is one less car on the road, thereby reducing gridlock. If its faster to not drive to work (because of good transit and bike infrastructure) a significant number of people will take this option instead. This method of planning cities has been proven to be effective by plenty of others across the globe and even in some select parts of Toronto. Additionally, this method is beneficial to a much larger portion of citizens, especially those who do not have the privilege of owning a vehicle or the desire and ability to drive.\nI hope that we can learn from other cities around the world while taking notes from our own history in order to create policies that can effectively help all of our citizens. As such, I implore you to reconsider Bill 212 and instead work on a plan that reduces traffic by offering alternative solutions.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria's claim that \"not everybody can use a bike to get around\" ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario's transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \"a better place, an easier place to get around,\" as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver's investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city's transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians.

They will damage sensitive ecological lands that provide critical ecosystem services. Further, there is strong evidence that new highway construction does not reduced congestion, because of the well-attested phenomenon of induced demand.

        "comment":"Bill 212 is incredibly backwards, especially given this climate crisis and clear data that adding lanes for cars and removing bike lanes is anti-reducing gridlock.\nReducing cycling lanes will not only lead to the reduced physical safety of many road users, it will also result in increased congestion and gridlock. Induced demand, which means travellers from other routes, modes, and times, will use up that additional capacity and the system will return to equilibrium and the same level of service as before. There is simply not enough physical space to have enough lanes for everyone to sit in a 5 x 2 m steel box (aka car), the math doesn't add up. The only way to reduce congestion is to have better transportation demand management, which means getting some portion of people to use transit, bikes, and walk... so that way only the people that need to drive are driving.\nIf you actually want to reduce gridlock, provide users with alternatives: add more bike lanes, add more frequent and reliable transit, and enhance the pedestrian realm. This will not only reduce congestion, it will also enable healthier citizens and more sustainable communities.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria's claim that \"not everybody can use a bike to get around\" ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario's transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \"a better place, an easier place to get around,\" as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver's investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city's transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable.

Adding more roads (including highways) and preventing the removal of motor vehicle road space for bicycles will both increase gridlock. This isn't an opinion, it's the proven result of these activities around the world over the last century. The proposal will only further dig Ontario deeper into the hole that is car-dependency and increase the cost and time for us to get out of it. If we want Ontario to be a place that is enjoyable for humans to live and thus continuing to attract businesses and skilled immigrants, we need to refocus all efforts on every alternatives to personal vehicle driving. Between the health and environmental effects of cars directly (pollutants and noise, not to mention collisions) and indirectly through mining and car-dependency, reduction and pollution of agricultural lands, there is no reason to make the problems worse, as in this proposal. The exemptions proposed to reduce environmental assessment is a perfect example of why the assessment process exists in the first place: to prevent dangerous ideas like these. Not to mention the disrespect for property owners in limiting their ability to face the threat of expropriation.\nIf that all sounds abstract and impersonal, how about this: my life, the life of my child, other family members, friends, and many others across the province will literally be in greater danger every single day due to the reduced safety from loss of current and proposed safe cycling infrastructure; infrastructure that is only necessary as a result of our car-dependency and prioritization, i.e. what this proposal aims to further entrench.\nThis proposal takes us backwards, while other regions are moving forward.\n",

I strongly urge you to preserve the Midtown Yonge Complete Street as it currently exists.\nAs someone who regularly uses the Yonge Street bike lanes to commute to work, I can attest to their importance for ensuring my safety on the road. Without these bike lanes, I would be forced to share the road with high volumes of vehicle traffic, significantly increasing the risk of being involved in an accident.\nThe Midtown Yonge Complete Street has never been solely about bike lanes. It represents a comprehensive effort to create safer, calmer, and more accessible streets for everyone, regardless of their mode of transportation. The Complete Street promotes walkability, supports local businesses by increasing foot traffic, and enhances the vibrancy of the area with parkettes and streetside cafes.\nRemoving these bike lanes would not only endanger cyclists but also result in increased vehicle congestion and harmful emissions. It would erode the progress made toward creating a safer and more inclusive community space.\nIn February 2023, Toronto City Council made a clear and democratic decision to make the Midtown Yonge Complete Street permanent. This decision followed extensive public consultation and reflects the needs and desires of the community. To see this effort undone without proper consultation would undermine local democracy and disregard the voices of those who call this area home.\nI ask you to stand with residents like myself who depend on the bike lanes for safe and sustainable transportation.

It is all too easy to focus jealousy, even anger on them. However, when I began to think about the issues supposedly addressed in this \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\u201d, I realized that it is more political dog-whistle than good traffic management.\nIncreased Toronto traffic congestion accompanied installation of many separated and protected bike lanes in Toronto, but it coincided with a dramatic uptick in vehicle traffic after the covid epidemic.  Those who conclude that the bike lanes caused congestion are discounting this overwhelming post-covid effect.\nI have come to oppose Bill 212 because -\nRemoval of separated and protected bike lanes and failure to install necessary new ones will increase accidents involving cyclists, with consequent death and injury. Cities with robust cycling facilities are proven to be safer for motor vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians1.\nThe above injuries will increase health care costs and place further pressure on a medical system that is already under huge stress. Cyclists cause less wear-and tear on road systems, with reduced costs. Has anybody assessed the economic costs of negate most of the benefits to motor vehicle drivers. In contrast, traffic congestion was actually ameliorated by installing bike lanes in New York2.\nThe legislation will discourage cycle use in favour of motor vehicle use, with consequent increases in carbon and other emissions\nDiscouraging cycling will result in more car use, and more pressure on parking spots in downtown areas2.\nThe legislation will waste public funds in the unnecessary removal of bike lanes in Toronto, costing taxpayers at least $48million PLUS the loss of $27m of public money for the original installation3.\nThe legislation discriminates against people too poor or too young to operate a car, who are obliged to cycle.\nThe legislation ignores the increasing popularity of cycling infrastructure. The installed facilities in Toronto increased the number of bike trips from 0.6m in 2017 to 4.7m in 2024 (by Sep. 12)4.\nLast, and crucially:\nI want to see more local autonomy. The bill takes away powers of the municipalities and vests them with politicians in the provincial government at Queens Park, furthering the centralization of power there. Bill 212 places arbitrary authority in the hands of a minister, permits retroactive decisions and subjects the rest of our Province to the supposed congestion-cure for Metro Toronto. It ties more red tape round an already complicated system.\nAs a cyclist (Yes, many cyclists are also car drivers!), I use roads with separated and protected bike lanes daily. On very busy streets that lack cycling facilities, I tend to use sidewalks. Yes, that is illegal, but I do it to avoid being injured or killed. This legislation terrifies me!\nWesley E.

As proposed, it will do little to reduce gridlock, while causing significant damage to the environment, municipal relations, affordable housing and Ontario's reputation as a place to grow (healthily).\nThis Highway 413 has been part of a highway package proposal that has been under consideration for over a decade. The time-frame is not excessive given it reflects the significance of its potential impact both positively and negatively. To accelerate building  such a Highway by pretending these impacts don't exist, risks far wider ramifications to our province than just the building of this Highway 413. I quote from the proposed Bill 212, \"it would also enable other highway projects to be designated in the future\", \"over-ride most municipal bylaws\", \"would create offence and penalty provisions\", \"compel provision of information\", \"block FOI requests\" and \"withhold critical sensitive study reports\". This  Bill is not about approving one highway but approving an over-ride of municipal, corporate and individual rights, especially environmental rights, which is where this ERO comes into play.\nBalanced development is critical to Ontario's growth but that balance must be of risk versus gain and in this case the environmental risk alone outweighs any community gain as shown by independent studies (between thirty seconds and two minutes saved daily by commuters). You'll notice I didn't include developer gain as this Bill seems clearly aimed at maximizing their gain regardless of environmental cost.\nThe balance when considering this Bill 212 clearly requires continuing to prioritize the environment not only for the future but to ensure we have a future.

I sent the city of Toronto numerous pictures and videos evidencing how the new lanes for parking were limited for people like myself who have physical disabilities and require reasonable access. I often use a cane and must exit on either side of the vehicle into fully live traffic, either cyclists if I am a passenger and also speeding e-bikes and scooters and none in a bike lane will ever stop for anyone trying to get out of a vehicle they just scream and say move it or hit their bell- it's horrible and this is to elderly and visibly disabled people forced to step into live bike lane traffic over a cement barrier. The other concern is the amount of accessible parking the city removed for bike lanes, it's over 40% and for those of us who cannot move freely this is a lot. The other issues are during the winter when the city clears the snow for bike lanes and I notified the city that 6 ft high snow banks made it impossible to exit as a passenger and there were no mid block breaks to get to the curb. The city told me, knowing I used a cane, to walk several blocks in the snowstorm on the street in live traffic to get to the end of a large block on Danforth Ave. This is the way the city views disabled people and bike lanes. Also at St. Mikes all but one spot vs. the two blocks at the emergency for a trauma hospital have been removed for bike lanes and ambulances are frequently stuck getting to the hospital after exiting the DVP and trying to get up Gerrard St. Exit to go to the trauma unit due to bike lanes. Police, Fire and Ambulances are trapped on all streets because cars cannot pull over and in Toronto we are left with one single lane and then foreign people new to Canada who don't care about road rules and driving uber simply block the lane and sit there- it's utter chaos. The city and their people they rally around say bike lanes don't cause traffic- it's not true, they have. Our population has increased 17% in the last 10 years and in 2021 when the pandemic happened we had traffic, but nothing like this. Now that the city has put in all of these horribly designed bike lanes we are at a complete standstill and we simply can't go anywhere. We didn't get millions of people in a year and a half and those who did come in are low wage earners per the federal guidelines, they are the e-bike users and not a large volume of car drivers so the only thing that is causing the traffic jams are that every single street in Toronto is one lane only from two due to bike lanes, no advance green lights being used so cars just sit there trapped due to bike lane barriers and often streetcars will block intersections causing you to sit in a car for up to 6 light changes and not go anywhere while traffic builds for blocks and blocks- it's utter insanity and this mayor has ruined the city. Worse the city of Toronto does not have a disability advocate on staff who works on projects but rather has a very vocal bike TO advocate who is paid with tax dollars to swing the public opinion and provide unequal views at any meeting, again not fair and not how government decisions on projects should be made. Hospitals, main arteries and any street with a streetcar should not have a bike lane. I ask you to consider Dundas Street and Adelaide Street East the two streets downtown that both link up to the DVP. They should be free of bike lanes. Most certainly Dundas St should never have had a bike lane because it's widely used to get to the DVP and with the streetcar traffic is often backed up from River Street to just west of Jarvis solid bumper to bumper and this is what prompts the extended TTC streetcars to then pull up and block intersections like Sumach and Dundas, which because of the bike lanes prevents anyone from turning right and then just forces a giant traffic jam and blocks access to parking garages. It's a total horror show. I also find it appalling that the city of Toronto is dragging out BIA reps who are political jockeys and not the hard working business staff who have lost business and this was evidenced by the store owners on Bloor Street West who said they have a loss of business since the bike lanes went in. The arrogance and bravado of this mayor to ignore them is the problem we have in Toronto and I do not know one person who thinks the bike lanes are a good idea. I also talk to the store owners, bar and restaurant owners all along Danforth and they all say the bike lanes coming out of the pandemic destroyed them and they lost even more money they they could absorb. This is telling and you can see what was once a thriving city with cute busy stores where you could go pick up  a large load for your home and drive it home, you are now prevented from doing so- clearly this hampers business owners and no one is riding on their bike to go buy large items and then hop back on and ride off into the sunset. All the Mayor has done is to wage a war on the car and ignore an aging city and ignore disabled people with her bike lane agenda. The city of Toronto councillors have also failed to identify their connections with bike lobbyists which is clearly a conflict of interest when the lobbyists have so much pull in this city and my question is who is getting a kick back at city hall over this bike lane business?  The city of Toronto should never have continued with shoving in bike lanes once they knew there were concerns raised about disability access and they knew going back to 2022 there were concerns, but they ignored them. The city has taken away parking from people on Broadview ave by randomly adding a bike lane at Cosburn northbound to Pape and has then threatened to close two full streets one going north and one going south to make each fully bike only access- again another fully unbelievable move as people own homes and have cars on all of these streets. People have families and need to use their vehicles and the city arbitrarily just decides to slam these in and on Broadview the planned building will further compound reduced lanes the mayor has now created, grinding this area and turning it into a total circus. It's also an issue because when the DVP has road closures Broadview is the secondary road along with the Bayview Extension and when the Bayview Extension floods Broadview again is the secondary road used and this city fails to ever consider these things just like they fail to consider the massive builds and massive road retstrictions with the subways that are already in play. All we get is a very underwhelming city response where it's so clear this mayor doesn't care and doesn't consider anything else going on and has an agenda that aligs solely with lobbyists but doesn't serve the majority of society. I am asking the Premier and Member to ensure the Bill moves forward and that they remove the majority of the bike lanes and look at a strategy to move them into the city bike trail system and free up our roads. What we will see is an immediate reduction in traffic. All that has to happen is remove the white pickets and repaint the roads, this is not the cost the mayor is saying. Also we need to have clarity if she is tossing out these numbers as to what she has wasted on this poor design. Lastly I would like to close with the design of these bike lanes is flawed and not natural. Cars parked obstruct the sightline of the bikes and when turning it's almost impossible to see anyone in the bike lane while looking for pedestrians also crossing, those who simply walk out into traffic and then oncoming traffic. It would have made more sense to have cars remain where they were beside the curb as drivers were already used to looking out for bikes and put any lane on the outside. Again all of this is such poor design and function it should be scrapped. I believe once this is fully viewed the Premiers office will be able to safely say the park system is where these should have been originally put with key intersections into the city thus leaving the majority of the streets free and clear and disability access must be at the forefront of the minds and not excluded and all concrete barriers that are knee high and all concrete bollards must be removed due to tripping hazards and design must be redone with a disability consultant involved. I have tripped when using a can exiting a bike lane on to the city sidewalk bays due to the ice and the city of toronto simply doesn't care. This is a recipe for disaster and litigation waiting to happen due to negligence.\n",

        "comment":"One main concern for the passing of Bill 212 is, fundamentally, it's exemption of certain projects from the Environmental Assessment Act, which has the following purpose: \"The betterment of the people of the whole or any part of Ontario by providing for the protection, conservation and wise management in Ontario of the environment.\" Not only does the Environmental Assessment Act mandate that assessments include information about expected impacts to the affected environment, potential impacts, and the actions necessary to mitigate damage, which allows for a critical consideration of potential habitat destruction for native species and species at risk, it also mandates that information in Environmental Assessments be made available to the public for review. Bill 212 implies that the public which may be directly or indirectly affected by these projects may not be notified or fully informed of the impacts of these projects, and removes the voice of concerned Ontarians from the planning process. This removes the ability of the public to share their concerns for a project, and their opinions on whether or not the advantages of the completion of these projects outweigh the disadvantages, thus taking the ability of Ontarians to determine whether or not we feel these projects are necessary, or effective to remedy highway infrastructure challenges. This could also severely impact certain species at risk, including Jefferson's Salamanders and various species of turtles that rely on the wetlands that will be affected and divided by these projects.\nIn addition, the important role of wetlands in natural flood control could be severely impacted by these projects. The Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time, and Building Highways Faster Act lists it's purpose as \"to expedite the construction of priority highway projects by streamlining and supplementing existing processes in order to alleviate delays to the timely completion of such highway projects.\" While on a surface level this may seem to be a matter of efficiency, one could wonder how it may affect the carrying out of important processes that ensure longevity of the infrastructure and proper construction. Will this leave room for cutting corners on assessments for the purpose of building a highway faster? Current policies and assessments allow for critical consideration and investigation of potential factors that may impact the efficacy of the proposed infrastructure. Drawing on incidents of flooding on the Don Valley Parkway since it's construction, it seems counter productive to have a policy in place that, at it's core, cuts corners in favour of faster construction, considering that faster construction will not make a difference if the construction is flawed in a way that makes these highways unusable or ineffective at remedying the traffic issue, such is the case with the Don Valley Parkway after instances of heavy rainfall.\nI urge those deliberating on this Bill to sincerely and serious consider the negative environmental impact that these acts could have on the areas affected by the currently proposed projects, but also how it could affect areas that could be the site of similar projects in the future.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria's claim that \"not everybody can use a bike to get around\" ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario's transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \"a better place, an easier place to get around,\" as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver's investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city's transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario's cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support  your government in the upcoming election.\nI hope you will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n",

Municipalities across Ontario have invested significant resources in developing bicycle lanes, which are increasingly being used by residents, including myself during the summer months. Expanding and improving bicycle infrastructure is vital for several reasons: it promotes health and well-being, provides affordable and sustainable transportation for those who cannot or choose not to own a car, and helps reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhile cities around the world are moving towards prioritizing active transportation, passing Bill 212 would push Ontario in the opposite direction. Focusing solely on highway expansion undermines efforts to create vibrant, livable communities where people can rely on safe, accessible, and eco-friendly transportation options. Instead of doubling down on highway development, we should prioritize infrastructure that encourages active transportation, such as protected bike lanes, pedestrian pathways, and transit-oriented projects.\nI urge the government to reconsider this bill and focus on building infrastructure that aligns with global trends and community needs, making Ontario\u2019s cities more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient.

A world class city, focuses on efficient urban design, safe neigbourhoods\/streets for pedestrians and tackling climate change through a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\nI am born and raised in Toronto, and I am fortunate to have also travelled to other parts of the world, primarily Europe where my grandparents reside. While I understand Canada is much larger in geographical area than that of countries in Europe (or even Europe as a whole) I see the benefits of incorporating bike lanes in the city.\nWe don't even half to look far, when looking for improved state of life of residents, for example Montreal, who are taking a lead in building bike lanes to get people moving around the city. I am against the proposal and urge the province not to interfere with the design of municipal areas, specifically regarding bike lanes, as there are numerous health benefits and congestion relief benefits to bike lanes. Further studies should look into the air quality effects of idling, however removing bike lanes and adding back a lane for vehicles will only result in more traffic and more cars on the road via \"induced demand\".\nOne thing to note, is that building bike lanes is not sufficient enough to reduce gridlock, as improvements in transit systems must also be made to ensure there are safe and reliable options for citizens. While cities in the West were primarily designed for cars, numerous studies show that this is not sustainable for the future of mobility as populations grow and more people move to or live in the city.\nUpdating street designs to make it more safe for pedestrians, removing spaces for cars in certain areas, adding various modes of mobility all have a place in our discussions today for a better state of living for future generations.\n",

        "comment":"As I navigate through our modern urban landscapes, I am increasingly disheartened by the car-centric design that dominates our cities. This infrastructure, which prioritizes automobiles over people, not only impacts the environment and public health but also perpetuates ableism, marginalizing those with disabilities.\nThe Predominance of Car-Centric Design\nCar-centric design has become the default mode of urban planning in many parts of the world. This approach prioritizes the convenience and mobility of car owners while often neglecting the needs and safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users. Wide roads, expansive parking lots, and urban sprawl characterize this paradigm, creating environments that are challenging and sometimes even hostile for those who do not or cannot drive.\nImpact on People with Disabilities\nFor individuals with disabilities, car-centric urban design poses significant barriers to accessibility and independence. Many people with disabilities cannot drive due to physical, cognitive, or sensory impairments. In a car-centric city, this means they must rely on public transportation, walking, or cycling\u2014all of which are frequently underdeveloped or unsafe in such environments.\nInadequate Public Transportation\nPublic transportation systems in car-centric cities are often insufficient, infrequent, and poorly connected. This inadequacy forces individuals with disabilities to navigate long distances to reach the nearest bus stop or train station, which might not be wheelchair accessible. Furthermore, the lack of reliable transportation options can severely limit their ability to access employment, education, healthcare, and social opportunities.\nChallenges for Pedestrians\nPedestrian infrastructure is another area where car-centric design falls short. Sidewalks, if they exist, are often narrow, uneven, or obstructed by parked cars and other barriers. Crosswalks may be few and far between, and traffic signals rarely allow sufficient time for those with mobility impairments to cross safely. These issues not only endanger individuals with disabilities but also discourage their participation in everyday activities.\nExclusion of Cyclists\nCycling can be a viable transportation option for some individuals with disabilities, particularly those who use adaptive bicycles or tricycles. However, the lack of dedicated bike lanes and the dominance of car traffic in car-centric cities create a hazardous environment for cyclists. This exclusion further limits the mobility of people with disabilities, reinforcing their dependence on cars or inadequate public transit.\nAbleism in Urban Planning\nThe ableism inherent in car-centric design is a critical issue that needs addressing. By prioritizing the convenience of drivers over the needs of all city residents, urban planners effectively marginalize those who do not fit the mold of an able-bodied car owner. This exclusionary approach disregards the diversity of abilities and modes of transportation that make up a truly inclusive society.\nSocial and Economic Implications\nThe social and economic implications of ableist urban planning are profound. When individuals with disabilities are unable to access transportation, they are often cut off from job opportunities, education, healthcare, and social interactions. This isolation can lead to increased unemployment, poverty, and social alienation, perpetuating a cycle of marginalization and inequality.\nThe Need for Inclusive Design\nInclusive urban design is essential for creating equitable and accessible cities. This approach involves prioritizing the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users, and ensuring that all infrastructure is accessible to individuals with disabilities. Wide, well-maintained sidewalks, frequent and accessible public transportation options, and safe, dedicated bike lanes are key components of inclusive design.\nMoving Towards a More Inclusive Future\nTo move towards a more inclusive future, we must shift away from car-centric design and embrace urban planning that considers the needs of all residents. This transition requires a commitment from city planners, policymakers, and the community to prioritize accessibility and inclusivity in all aspects of urban development.\nPolicy Recommendations\nPolicy changes at the local, regional, and national levels are necessary to promote inclusive urban design. These changes might include:\n\u2022\tImplementing strict accessibility standards for all new infrastructure projects.\n\u2022\tInvesting in the expansion and improvement of public transportation systems.\n\u2022\tEnsuring that pedestrian and cycling infrastructure is safe, well-maintained, and accessible.\n\u2022\tConsulting with individuals with disabilities and disability advocacy groups in all stages of urban planning.\nCommunity Involvement\nCommunity involvement is also crucial in the push towards inclusive urban design. Residents can advocate for more accessible infrastructure, participate in public consultations, and support policies that prioritize the needs of all city dwellers. By working together, we can create cities that are welcoming and accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, car-centric design is not only environmentally unsustainable and detrimental to public health, but it is also inherently ableist. By prioritizing the convenience of drivers over the needs of individuals with disabilities, we perpetuate inequality and exclusion. It is time to rethink our approach to urban planning and embrace inclusive design that considers the diverse needs of all residents. Only then can we create truly equitable and accessible cities where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\n",

Also add speed bumps before entering a roundabout if there is a concern for high speed moving vehicles.\nTo improve highway traffic, please enforce the passing lane only law! Many drivers seem to have forgotten or completely ignore the fact that the left lane is a passing lane and should only be used for passing a slower moving vehicle.

        "comment":"Why I Oppose Bill 212 and the Push for Highway 413: A Case for Sustainable Infrastructure\nAs an regular cyclist and a resident of Scarborough, I have experienced firsthand the challenges posed by inadequate cycling infrastructure. My father, who recently began using an e-bike for shopping and errands, shares these concerns. Bill 212, which seeks to restrict the installation of bike lanes, and the proposed Highway 413 project, threaten to exacerbate these issues, undermining Ontario's environmental, economic, and social well-being.\nThe Case for Bike Lanes\nBike lanes are more than just pathways for cyclists; they are vital components of a safe and connected community. Bill 212's restrictions on bike lanes overlook the clear benefits these structures provide. Research indicates that protected bike lanes can reduce road fatalities and serious injuries by up to 50% (sciencedaily.com). They safeguard cyclists, encourage active transportation, and improve safety for all road users.\nIn Scarborough, the lack of cycling infrastructure is particularly pronounced. Many bike lanes have been removed before they could form a cohesive network, leaving cyclists like my father and me to navigate busy streets without adequate protection (cycleto.ca). This absence not only discourages cycling but also poses significant safety risks.\nMoreover, bike lanes contribute to local economies. In Toronto, the Bloor Street bike lanes led to a 49% increase in cycling, making it the second-highest bicycle facility by volume in the city (torontomu.ca). Cities that embrace cycling infrastructure have demonstrated that these investments lead to thriving, walkable communities. Removing bike lanes, as proposed under Bill 212, would dismantle these gains and impose substantial costs\u2014up to $48 million in Toronto alone\u2014for benefits that are, at best, uncertain (toronto.ca).\nLocal communities and businesses have expressed concerns about the removal of bike lanes. The Bloor Annex Business Improvement Area (BIA) in Toronto stated that removing bike lanes would be \"disastrous to the neighbourhood,\" highlighting the role of bike lanes in promoting local commerce and community well-being.(toronto.citynews.ca)\nEncouraging cycling through dedicated infrastructure contributes to environmental sustainability and public health. A study published in BMJ Public Health reported that cycling commuters had a 47% lower risk of early death and a 10% lower risk of hospitalization compared to those who drive or take the train. (nypost.com) Bike lanes also play a critical role in combating climate change. Encouraging cycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions, eases traffic congestion, and lessens our dependence on fossil fuels. To strip communities of this vital infrastructure is not only shortsighted but also counterproductive to Ontario\u2019s environmental goals.\nHighway 413: A Step in the Wrong Direction\nThe push for Highway 413 epitomizes outdated thinking that prioritizes cars over communities. This proposed 52-kilometre highway would destroy 2,000 acres of productive farmland, pave over critical wildlife habitats, and disrupt the watersheds of the Humber and Credit Rivers (environmentaldefence.ca). It\u2019s a textbook example of how not to build for the future.\nHighway 413\u2019s environmental toll is staggering. By 2050, it\u2019s estimated to generate 17.4 million tonnes of additional greenhouse gas emissions, undermining our commitments to combat climate change (environmentaldefence.ca). While proponents argue that the highway will reduce congestion, decades of research on induced demand show that building more roads simply encourages more driving, perpetuating the cycle of gridlock.\nFrom an economic perspective, Highway 413 is equally flawed. At a projected cost of $10 billion, the highway represents a massive public expenditure with questionable returns. Instead of building new highways, why not optimize existing infrastructure? Highway 407, for example, remains underutilized. Subsidizing truck tolls on this route could alleviate congestion without the environmental and financial costs of a new highway (environmentaldefence.ca).\nA Better Path Forward\nOntario doesn\u2019t need more highways or fewer bike lanes. What we need is investment in sustainable, inclusive infrastructure. Public transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly streets offer far greater returns, fostering vibrant communities while addressing the pressing challenges of climate change and urban sprawl.\nIf we are serious about building a livable future, we must reject Bill 212 and resist projects like Highway 413. These proposals cater to outdated, car-centric paradigms that have proven to be both costly and unsustainable. Instead, let\u2019s champion solutions that prioritize people, planet, and prosperity.\nTogether, we can build a better Ontario\u2014one that values innovation, community well-being, and environmental stewardship. It starts by saying no to Bill 212 and yes to the infrastructure that will truly move us forward.\n",

Made it a lot more livable, and more enjoyable to spend time in the street. The businesses I have spoken to agree. Foot traffic is better because fewer cars make for a nicer walk.\nEvery bike on that lane is a car off the road.\nFurthermore, the bill introduces a way to circumvent environmental assessments of the ghihway 413, which is disgusting. It should follow assessments like every highway.\nLastly, the bill increases the right of government over my personal property too much by allowing the government to use my property for building without my consent. And without warning!\nThis is clearly another move by the Ford government to abuse power and give his friends favours.\n",

There is no factual basis for the conclusion that reducing bike lanes will help reduce gridlock.\nIf bike lanes are removed, the cyclists will then simply be riding in traffic, which by any thought process would singularly impede the steady flow of traffic. When there is a bike lane, cyclists are safely removed from the flow of automotive traffic, allowing both cars and bikes to move as freely as traffic enables them to.\nBeyond the total lack of sound reasoning behind this bill, it is both an obvious infringement on the jurisdiction of municipal governments by Doug Ford and their provincial Conservatives; and a clear case of pandering to morons on social media who have misplaced rage towards cyclists for small inconveniences in their daily lives. Doug Ford has once again proven that they are utterly devoid of any reasoned thought, and singularly thinks of ways they can help their 1 percenter developer friends, and pass idiotic laws intended to get right wing internet trolls riled up. Where's my buck a beer Doug? Oh right that never made any sense.\nSincerely,\nAn Ontarian that despises Doug Ford\n",

Every informed expert agrees that this won't help with \"gridlock\".\nThe proven negatives to removing bike lanes:\n* Removing bike lanes can lead to more traffic congestion during construction.\n*  After construction, there may be little to no improvement in travel times.\n* Removing bike lanes can make cycling less safe.\n*  Removing bike lanes is expensive.\nThe clear positives to keeping bike lanes:\n* Bike lanes can help ease congestion.\n* Bike lanes can reduce emissions, which helps fight climate change.\n* Bike lanes can be good for businesses.\n* Bike lanes can make roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists.\nIt's not hyperbole to say that lives are at stake as bike lanes are safer for our residents. The Ford government is comfortable risking and taking Torontonian lives just for political point.\nIn the end, with Doug Ford's Conservative Party, this bill is bald-faced electioneering.  The Ford Government is comfortable punishing Toronto and its residents in return for rural and small town votes.\nPlease reconsider.

        "comment":"This act would give the minister unchecked permission to build unnecessary projects according to his whims. It reeks of corruption, and only serves to make ministry-approved construction companies a nice, juicy profit without addressing any of the actual causes of traffic and congestion on our roadways (like lack of public transit!!!) Such projects, like the building of highways, should be subject to thorough environmental assessment and community input, all of which this act would bypass. I absolutely disagree with all aspects of the proposed act. Stop building highways, and instead increase trains, bike lanes, and access to public transit. Regarding the new bike lanes on Bloor Street - these are an absolutely necessary piece of infrastructure for cyclist safety along a major access route, and a much needed alternative to car and ttc transit. The bikes lanes ARE the solution to traffic and roadway congestion. Before they were installed, I personally have experienced many close calls as a cyclist, with reckless drivers putting me in danger. Since the bike lanes were added, I have been able to commute safely along Bloor Street. Removing the bike lanes would not only be devastating and an absolute waste of taxpayer money, but it would be putting my life in danger,\nas well as the lives of the many other cyclists (and taxpayers) who use this route daily. Removing the bike lanes would communicate to me that the current ministry of transportation values a slightly shorter commute more than it values my life and the lives of other cyclists (the people who are actually helping reduce roadway congestion). I firmly disagree with the proposed removal of the bike lanes along Bloor, as well as all other parts of the proposed highway construction act, as they do not reflect my values.\n",

As an older adult who commutes by bicycle, I rely on bike lanes for a safe route to my workplace.  I regularly travel on the Bloor bike lane to do shopping as well as travelling to and from work.  In fact, I frequent businesses along this route because the Bloor bike lane provides an easy and safe way to get there.  At this time of year, it is dark on my way home from work.  Visibility is poorer for any vehicle on the road.  It is even more crucial to have dedicated cycle infrastructure for cyclists who are even more vulnerable in the evening.  Not to mention the safety concerns for vulnerable road users with the increased availability of alcohol.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University have already been built.

        "comment":"As a citizen of Toronto, I completely oppose Bill 212. This is an absurd direction to try to take the city of Toronto in 2025. We are facing a dire climate crisis, and gridlock will not be solved by allowing more cars into our city. Invest in public transportation and we will see improvement in traffic. More public transportation and more bike lanes will increase safety and commuter flow, not more cars. Athens and Florence are both examples of cities that have placed restrictions on driving within the city and are both top destinations for tourists and are good pedestrian cities. Athens has an incredible public transportation system that allows tourists to easily move around the city and get to all the monuments and they built this system even with the insane amount of archaeological material they had to sift through (1993-200). Yet somehow, because our municipal government continues to devalue and defund and privatize our public transportation, we can't even get the Eglinton CrossTown Light Rail built within a twenty year period.\nProhibiting the building of and removing bike lanes will lead to more deaths from bike accidents. The reason Toronto started building bike lanes was to reduce the number of accidents and deaths caused by cars hitting bikers. This is public health and safety issue as well as an environmental one.\nI am also deeply concerned about the act about Highway 413. Removing the Environmental Assessment requirements is ridiculous in the climate crisis. The environmental impact of a highway is also a health and safety issue, since highways increase air pollution for residents as well as damaging the ecosystem they are built in, which has knock-on effects for people. If you can't bring yourselves to care for the environment and the ecosystems in the area, at least try to find some empathy for the voters living in this area. Deregulation always leads to disastrous results. The environmental assessment is not the only regulation that the Ford government has sought to bypass during his time in office and it won't be the last. Last year in Greece there was a horrifying train crash that killed at least 30 people. This train crash was a direct result of the deregulation of safety checks enacted by the prime minister, Mitsotakis. Deregulating environmental impact leads to unhealthy living environments and irreparable damage to the ecosystem, which both lead to a decrease in quality of life.\nFord has made it his mission it seems to mess with the few things Canada really has going for it: our beautiful natural landscape and our free healthcare. Now he proposes to \"reduce the gridlock\", by enacting laws that will only increase the number of cars contributing to Toronto traffic and bike accidents, as well as going against the worldwide movement towards environmental protections, while simultaneously decreasing funding for public healthcare and public transportation all in a desperate bid to decrease the quality of life of everyone living in Canada.\n",

        "comment":"Ontario's Bill 212 is a step in the wrong direction for the province. Instead, the Province should be investing in better investment in public transportation rather than more highway lanes. The goal for the province should be to encourage more active and public transportation, by increasing the infrastructure for public transit (buses, trains, subways) and increasing the number of bike lanes in cities to support alternative and safe modes of transportation. Significant research has shown that when the number of car lanes increases, so too does traffic, so increasing the number of highways and car lanes does not mitigate the problem. Instead, offering effective public transit and safe, especially separated, bike lanes provide alternative modes of travel, and increase commercial success in the areas with this infrastructure.\nAdditionally, Bill 212 is a massive overstep on the part of the Province of Ontario, as bike lanes are a municipal concern. Removing bike lanes in Toronto would be costly and also counterproductive for the city and for the province. The Province would be wise to repeal this proposed action.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria's claim that \"not everybody can use a bike to get around\" ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario's transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \"a better place, an easier place to get around,\" as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver's investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city's transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario's cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support  your government in the upcoming election.\nI hope you will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n",

It continues the track record of this government's override of local planning and policy decisions when those decisions don't align with conservative ideology. It is part of a systematic approach to reduce or eliminate environmental protections and to criminalize actions that, in the view of this government, would \"impede progress\".\nThe impetus behind the removal of existing bike lanes and the delay and discouragement of building new ones, ignores the imperative of providing safe infrastructure for vulnerable road users and the necessity to reallocate valuable road space so that people are encouraged to make sustainable transportation choices.\nFast-tracking highways that perpetuate automotive dominance and encourage urban sprawl development is both economically and environmentally unsustainable. So too is the removal of on-street bicycle infrastructure that reduces transportation choice, leading to more dangerous roads, higher carbon emissions, poorer community health outcomes and negative economic impact for local businesses.\n129 cyclists died in the Province of Ontario between 01\/01\/2006 and 31\/12\/2010. These deaths prompted the government of the day to ask the Ontario Office of the Chief Coroner to provide a Death Review report. This report provided 14 recommendations including, \"Adoption of a 'complete streets' approach - focused on the safety of all road users - to guide the redevelopment of existing communities and the design of new communities throughout Ontario\". It took the better part of a decade for those recommendations to become guidelines and policy and then be implemented by communities across the Province.

The proposal to eliminate bike lanes to reduce traffic congestion is flawed and lacks evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes won't decrease traffic; studies and historical data show the opposite. This action is likely to lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately increasing costs in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto illustrates this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city's own data showed that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the goal of reducing congestion. Removing bike lanes endangers cyclists and discourages sustainable transportation options, increasing reliance on cars and worsening gridlock.\nInstead of enacting policies that jeopardize lives and degrade urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as improving healthcare and education. This approach would better serve the long-term interests of Ontarians than dismantling bike lanes to appease drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government should aim to create a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just those who drive into the city for work.\n",

        "comment":"I am a driver, walker, transit rider and cyclist. I use the method that is safest and most efficient in the situation. My primary consideration is getting from one location to another, not to advocate for a single travel modality.\nThe considerations when developing transportation must balance moving the most people in the most efficient way (time and cost). Depending on the specific location this may be walking, cycling, public transit, shared vehicles (e.g. taxi, rideshare) or private vehicle. Most importantly, some methodologies which are best in one location (e.g. private vehicle in rural or sub-urban\u00a0Ontario) are different in another (e.g. public transit, walking, and cycling in dense urban environments). Trying to impose an inefficient solution will actually make transportation efficiency worse - building a subway in a small town is as ill suited as depending solely on private vehicles\u00a0in a large city. It is impossible to successfully build an urban environment which relies on private vehicles, there will always be serious traffic congestion, there is just not enough space to build enough roads as there is in low density rural and suburban spaces.\nPeople have the freedom to choose between transportation strategies - the primary influence for this choice is safety, and second time efficiency, of course within affordability parameters.\u00a0\nRemoving bike lanes is counter-productive. A safe and efficient bike network will complement safe pedestrian infrastructure and efficient public transit. Such a system cannot be built\u00a0only on secondary roads, they are not continuous and intended for transportation, they are designed for local access. To remove and limit a city's ability to design their transportation is counter-productive: in the long term it will only create more congestion and ensuing loss of productivity among residents in cities and those who commute into cities.\nThere has been a significant increase in cycling in Toronto in the past several years. As the network grows, this trend will continue, which will alleviate road congestion. Removing infrastructure will put people back in cars, and will increase congestion. Either strategy creates a feedback loop.\nThe priority must be moving people - Bill 212 has the false premise that we need to build more highways and roads as the primary way to reduce congestion. This only has a very temporary impact - many studies have proven this repeatedly. The only way to reduce congestion and improve transportation efficiency is an overall system view, not a single parameter (private vehicle).\n",

I commute to work 3x a week (and often to other places as well, such as the gym and social activities) via cycling as it saves me both time and money compared to driving or taking the bus. If I didn't have as many safe, separated bike lanes to take on my commute, I would certainly think twice about cycling, especially in the early mornings and evenings when it is darker outside, as I would start to be concerned about my own safety as a cyclist. According to StatsCan, an average of 74 Canadians die each year from cycling collisions, 73% of which were collisions with cars. Areas where cycling is more prevalent, and therefore with better cycling infrastructure, tend to have lower rates of bicycle-related fatalities. The proposal to remove bike lanes on busy roads throughout the province to \"improve traffic\" shows no consideration for the safety of cyclists and active commuters and will almost certainly result in higher bicycle-related collisions. Are the safety and lives of active commuters less important to your government than the amount of time it takes drivers to reach their destination?\nAccording to a poll by CAA, 40% of Canadians say that they would be more motivated to cycle more if bike lanes are separated by a physical barrier. In this period of time where many people are rightfully concerned about climate change and are actively looking for ways to go green, the government should be encouraging active transportation, not discouraging it by removing infrastructure that makes it safer and more convenient for the public.\nThis proposal is extremely shortsighted and serves only to address an immediate concern that commuters such as the Premier have to sit in their cars for a few minutes longer on their drive into downtown Toronto. It does not show consideration to the fact that active commuting is on the rise: between 1996 and 2016, the number of Canadians using bicycles as their main method of commuting doubled (The Globe and Mail). It additionally does not show consideration to the taxpayers; this proposal will result in millions of dollars being spent to undo work that already cost millions of dollars. I don't see any way that taxpayers should be happy with your government spending double the initial cost with nothing to show for it at the end, not to mention that EVERY commuter will now be inconvenienced by construction road closures yet again while the bike lanes that were just recently installed get ripped up.\nIn summary, I strongly urge the government to reconsider this shortsighted and costly proposal, which shows no consideration for the safety of active commuters, no consideration for the environmental benefits of active commuting, and no consideration for the cost and inconvenience to taxpayers for yet more pointless construction work on their roads.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes, and we urge you to vote against this misguided legislation.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria's claim that \"not everybody can use a bike to get around\" ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. Your government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario's transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \"a better place, an easier place to get around,\" as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver's investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city's transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario's cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support  your government in the upcoming election.\nI hope you will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n",

        "comment":"I am a resident of Toronto who is strongly opposed to the proposed Bill 212. I urge Premier Ford and the MPPs not to pass this act which will, contrary to its stated goals, be a massive waste of money and cause even worse traffic in some of Toronto's main thoroughfares.\nI lived nearby Bloor during the bike lane construction and was indeed annoyed by the congestion, although it never came close to the levels of gridlock seen in transit corridors like the 401 and Gardiner. Having gone through this construction once it seems ludicrous to go through it again, especially seeing as Toronto City Council has estimated the removal will take years to plan and 9 months (which in contractor terms means 1+ years) to actually execute, in addition to a cost of 48 million. How is this how we're spending our transit-related money, while the TTC regularly breaks down and Metrolinx still hasn't established regular coverage across the province?\nAgain I want to emphasize the wastefulness of taking out infrastructure that has already been paid for and put into place - and is seeing usage! The City's report on bike usage along the main bike lanes targeted by Bill 212 has seen increases of up to 600% - a classic case of build it and they will come. And lets face it, with climate change coming and our winters only getting milder, cycling is becoming more of a viable transportation method than ever before. Removing infrastructure only to return to a state of being that already didn't work is absolute folly, a waste of taxpayer money and government time.\nPlease Premier Ford, don't take us backward and don't waste our money.\n",

        "comment":"This is a regressive bill that proposes unproven strategies which recklessly endanger Ontario's wetlands and ecological health, farmland and food security and citizenry and public health. Projections do not anticipate any material benefit (i.e. time savings\/reduced gridlock) to the construction of such infrastructure, and in fact show just the opposite: notably time saved in the case of highway 413 would be only on the order of a few minutes compared with existing infrastructure. This is clearly an abuse of provincial powers and a siphoning of taxpayer money into development projects which do not benefit the people of Ontario, except for those few in office orchestrating this farce and the developers who would build such useless projects.\nFurther, the destruction of the newly constructed bike lanes along University Ave., Yonge St. and Bloor would also be extremely regressive. The answer to reducing gridlock in the heart of downtown is not to limit access to cyclists but rather to explore multi-modal solutions which would alleviate the burden of car traffic as the only means of transportation instead, which must inevitably be the case in the most populous city in Canada, where the streets can be only so wide, and the parking only so dense. Demand for access to the city must be met by other means, especially for those who live within the city and who would simply no longer need a car to get around--of which there would no doubt be many--all to the effect of reducing gridlock and saving time for all Ontarians.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to outline my concerns with multiple aspects of Bill 212, primarily Schedule 3 but also Schedule 2 and Schedule 4.\nSchedule 3 focuses on Highway 413 and beginning early works before the environmental assessment has\nbeen completed. The Highway 413 proposed route goes through a large area of what is currently\nprotected under the Greenbelt Plan. On the Ontario Government\u2019s own site\n(https:\/\/www.ontario.ca\/document\/greenbelt-plan), it defines the land protected by the Greenbelt Plan as\nareas \u201cwhere urbanization should not occur in order to provide permanent protection to the agricultural\nland base and the ecological and hydrological features, areas and functions occurring on this landscape.\u201d\nThe areas build a resilience to and mitigate climate change, protects agricultural lands, and \u201cprotect the\nnatural heritage and water resource systems that sustain ecological and human health.\u201d Yet, this bill\nintends to fast-track the construction of a highway that would go right through those lands, defeating\nexactly what the Greenbelt Plan was enacted to protect in the first place.\nBecause of the environmental importance of the Greenbelt areas, Tim Gray, from Environmental Defense,\nhas submitted a letter requesting Highway 413 to be designated for a federal Impact Assessment as part of\nthe Impact Assessment Act (see attached). It goes through the negative environmental effects that\nbuilding the highway will have on multiple habitats and currently endangered species that rely on those\nhabitats. Severe damage to these areas of the greenbelt may already be done and not reversible if the early\nworks are allowed to continue before the environmental assessment is complete. This also goes against\nthe prescribed order for a project. If work is completed before all studies are performed and the risks are\nassessed, what happens if the environmental assessment outlines several mitigations that need to be\nperformed to reduce the negative effects but can no longer be implemented, or if the project is decided to\nbe too damaging\/not worth it? Money and materials will have already been wasted and the damage would\nhave been done.\nBuilding the highway will have a negative effect on Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions targets as well. A\nstudy on US cities, performed by Gilles Duranton at the University of Toronto, had found that vehicle\nkilometers travelled increases proportionally with the amount of highway present and has an effect that\nleads to an, \u201cincrease in driving by current residents; and increase in transportation intensive production\nactivity; and an inflow of new residents\u201d. The study has been included as an attachment for reference. If\nCanada\u2019s overall goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, will building Highway 413 lead towards that\nfuture? The Environmental Defense letter made an estimate that CO2e emissions may increase by 0.57\nmetric tonnes per annum. This new highway will cause a large amount of CO2e emissions during its\nconstruction, and keep emitting due to drivers using the highway in personal vehicles over possible\nalternatives. It will push more people to use personal vehicles as their main method of transportation\ninstead of considering alternatives that work towards our greenhouse gas emission targets.\nIt is also difficult to understand why Highway 413 must be constructed, who will benefit from it, and how\nmuch it will cost. The Ontario Government\u2019s website for Highway 413 (https:\/\/www.highway413.ca\/)\nstates that \u201csomeone travelling the full length of the route would save 30 minutes compared to the time it\nwould take via Highways 401 and 400.\u201d Yet there are other studies, some performed by the Ministry of\nTransportation themselves, that shows that using the 407 will be even faster than what is possible using\nthe proposed Highway 413. This is covered in the Toronto Star article: Will Highway 413 actually cut 30\nminutes from your commute \u2013 A Ministry of Transportation Analysis\n(https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/news\/gta\/will-highway-413-actually-cut-30-minut\u2026-\nministry-of-transportation-analysis\/article_2ceab5ed-342e-54cf-8c94-518c344d3800.html). I have also included a PDF of the article for review. The main claim of saving people time is being brought into\nquestion by the government body in charge of the project.\nHighway 413 had first appeared in the public space approximately 20 years and has been amended a\nhandful of times over the years. Many things have changed in the last decade alone with regards to the\npopulation of Canada and Ontario, the economy, and the climate. There should be proper assessments for\nnot only the environmental impacts that Highway 413 and other Highways may have, but a new\nassessment on whether these proposals are even beneficial to the people of Ontario and worth the\nfinancial and environmental costs. Are alternatives like using the money to subsidize 407 tolls for trucks and people a viable option instead of building a new highway? This would make better use of existing infrastructure and can be implemented immediately instead of within a decade.\nMany of the points I have mentioned above are with respect to  Highway 413. But Schedule 2 of the Bill outlines other highways that it is attempting to fast-track. Will those fast-tracked projects, and others in the future, follow in the same footsteps of Highway 413 if this bill is accepted and implemented?\nMy issue with Schedule 4 is the Ministry of Transportation, a provincial body, is requiring information from municipalities to prove the benefits of bicycle lanes to ensure drivers are not negatively impacted and it will approve what the municipalities can and cannot do. This is overstepping the ministries jurisdiction. The ministry had gone to the Supreme Court of Canada for a similar issue with regards Highway 413 not long ago as well. Highway 413 was designated for a federal impact assessment and the ministry argued that the federal government had overstepped their boundaries. This is the exact same thing that is happening, but not it is the provincial government overstepping boundaries into how municipalities choose to govern themselves.\nIt is also hypocritical of the Ministry to require data and then decide if it will approve the implementation of bike lanes. Where was all the data and information with regards to Highway 413 that led to the decision that it must be built? The Highway 413 site (https:\/\/www.highway413.ca\/2021\/03\/31\/timesavings\/) states that, \"not everyone will enjoy the direct benefit of time savings\" and then argues other examples such as building hospitals and how it benefits the local residents in the area. The same argument that they use to argue for Highway 413 applies to the bike lanes they want to limit and even remove along Bloor, University, and Yonge. There is a group of people who benefit from the bike lanes, but that is not enough to expand the bike lane networks anymore, yet it is enough to argue for more highways.\nThere have been multiple studies on the return on investment when investing in cycling networks in cities. Australia's Queensland government has a website (https:\/\/www.tmr.qld.gov.au\/travel-and-transport\/cycling\/cycling-strateg\u2026) speaking about the topic. They invested into their cycling networks and wanted to promote a more active lifestyle for their citizens. They found that for every dollar they invested into the cycling infrastructure, it led to approximately 5 dollars worth of benefits. This came in the form of improved health benefits and reduced traffic congestion to name a few.\nExpanding the cycling network also helps deal with the first\/last mile issue, where people using multiple forms of transportation require more options for the first and last mile of a trip. Cars and walking are typical forms, but cycling also can be used to solve this issue as the individual can go wherever they need to and are not limited by the predetermined routes used by buses and trains.\nOverall, alternative methods, including cycling, should be explored and developed more to reduce traffic congestion, improve the health and quality of life of citizens, and reduce GHG emissions and pollution. Just like how induced demand applies to new highways and roads, it applies to cycling networks as well. The amount of people using Bike Share programs in Toronto has been dramatically increasing over the years. People want to cycle, but they want to be safe when doing so.\n",

        "comment":"Ask any transport planner, city planner, or engineer, not only will Bill 212 cause incredible violence on vulnerable and racialized citizens, it will INCREASE gridlock.\nReducing cycling lanes will not only lead to the reduced physical safety of many road users (WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT - remember the death of Alexandra Amaro on Dufferin St?), it will also result in increased congestion and gridlock.\nTransportation planning 101 tells us that adding driving lanes only momentarily reduces congestion. Induced demand, which means travellers from other routes, modes, and times, will use up that additional capacity and the system will return to equilibrium and the same level of service as before. There is simply not enough physical space to have enough lanes for everyone to sit in a 5 x 2 metre steel box (AKA car). The math doesn't add up, and there is no amount of lanes you can add that will make it add up. The only way to reduce congestion is to have better transportation demand management, which means getting some portion of people to use transit, bikes, and walk. That way, only the people that need to drive are driving.\nIf you actually want to reduce gridlock, provide users with alternatives: add more bike lanes, add more frequent and reliable transit, and enhance the pedestrian realm. This will not only reduce congestion, it will also enable people to have healthier lifestyles and more environmentally sustainable communities.\n",

My first suggestion to the government is to leave it up to the democratically elected municipal council to determine what is best for its citizens. I'm sorry you didn't win the mayoral election in 2014, Mr. Premier, but you shouldn't be legislating for Toronto from Queen's Park.

The buildout of bike lanes in my region, Kitchener-Waterloo, has allowed me to cut my car usage almost in half. Every day the weather is nice, I can bike or take an EUC to work or on other errands. This gets my car off of the road, and improves my physical and mental health. It also would not have been possible where I live 10 years ago.\nThe buildout of bike lanes in our region has made it a better place to live, but it is not yet sufficient. So long as we have multiple stories a year of people commuting dying on our local roads, uptake of this form of transportation will be limited. For those counting, this means more cars on the road and slower traffic. We need more bike lanes, and more support for slow, unprotected forms of locomotion.\nI strongly suspect any extra roadblocks to better infrastructure will reduce the speed at which the network is built out, which will reduce uptake of personal transportation, making our roads busier; non-drivers less mobile; our residents less happy and healthy; our province worse.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider requiring provincial consent for any new bike lanes.\n",

Yet again, the height of insecurity, Doug Ford is obsessed with Toronto and how he can micromanage it and sell it off by the pound, as he is doing with his shady deals at Ontario Place and the Science Centre.\nIf these bike lanes are removed, more people will die, at Doug Ford\u2019s hand.\nI will continue to use Bloor Street and University Avenue as my main cycling routes, as is my right, even though with bike lanes removed, it will jeopardize my safety. And I vow that if bike lanes are removed, I will occupy an entire lane of traffic to ensure my safety, regardless of the effect on \u201cgridlock.\u201d\nShame on the province and on Doug Ford.\n",

        "comment":"The following is the City of Waterloo\u2019s feedback regarding Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024.\nOver numerous years, the City of Waterloo, at the request of our residents, has invested in the creation of a safe, active transportation networks across the City and Region of Waterloo.  Currently, there are over 230 km of multi-use trails, protected bike lanes and signed bike routes. These connect to a larger regional network of bike lanes and multi-use paths.\nAs you are no doubt aware, numerous studies clearly indicate that drivers are also concerned about potential collisions with people cycling on the road and do not feel that the current infrastructure is safe for walking, cycling and driving.\nAs requested, Waterloo staff have reviewed and analyzed the numerous road reconstruction and rehabilitation projects which reduced vehicular lanes and added safe cycling infrastructure.  Staff compared a total of 21 years of collision data before road re-construction to 21 years of collision data after project construction\/completion.\nWe are very pleased that this analysis clearly showed that the reduction of the vehicular lanes and addition of the safe cycling infrastructure resulted in an improvement in road safety.\nSpecifically, the addition of safe cycling infrastructure resulted in a 42% reduction in overall crashes.\nAs I\u2019m sure you will agree, safety for drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and people who use mobility devices \u2013 from the youngest to the oldest in our community \u2013 is of paramount importance.\nAffordability is another key reason why the City of Waterloo invests in safe cycling infrastructure. Waterloo\u2019s 230 km of networked, safe cycling infrastructure provides people with affordable mobility choices particularly for short and medium length trips.\nAs you know, vehicular ownership, insurance and operation costs are rising. Numerous residents have shared that the safe cycling infrastructure across Waterloo and our neighbouring municipalities has given people choice for how they move around our community. These options are helping people reduce household expenses and, for some, has enabled them to become a one-vehicle rather than a two-vehicle household.\nDespite the introduction of Bill 212, Waterloo is pleased to work in collaboration with the Ministry of Transportation Working Group comprised of engineering experts to co-design standards to facilitate the timely approval and installation of safe, secure active transportation corridors over Ministry controlled roadways and interchanges. Establishing standardized designs will greatly reduce the length of time for construction while \u2013 most importantly \u2013 significantly improving the safety of drivers and active transportation users.\nWe were also pleased to learn that you have extended the e-scooter pilot program until 2029. The City of Waterloo appreciates this decision and the opportunity to work in collaboration.\nFinally, given the important relationship between the provincial government and Ontario municipalities, we are particularly concerned about the jurisdictional interference embedded within Bill 212.\nAs proposed, Bill 212 will significantly impact the City\u2019s ability to represent our community\u2019s needs. Local councils are best positioned to make decisions on bike lanes and local transportation planning. The City\u2019s Transportation Master Plan and Active Transportation Committee work in tandem to create a safe, more affordable and connected transportation system.\nOur plans are created based on local knowledge and community input. We develop these plans to balance traffic flow with planning priorities like active transportation, multimodal transportation and environmental and health protection.\nBill 212 however proposes serious overreach into municipal jurisdiction. I hope that you will work with your municipal partners to reconsider these aspects of Bill 212 in order to find a better way forward.\nThe City of Waterloo\u2019s goal is to provide safe and reliable transportation options for all. I know you and the provincial government shares this goal. I look forward to continuing to work together to ensure our residents have affordable and safe mobility choices.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\n",

        "comment":"Building new highways faster does not seem to be an effective solution to gridlock. It may exacerbate the problem. New highways can lead to more cars trying to access these routes, which ultimately results in even worse congestion. Take the 407 toll highway as an example: when it was first built, it was free to use, but after being sold to private investors, tolls were introduced, making it less affordable for drivers and pushing more traffic onto nearby highways like the 401. The 407, intended to reduce congestion, has instead contributed to gridlock. Similarly, building new highways like the proposed Highway 413 will likely not alleviate car congestion in the long run. More highways will simply invite more cars, as cars remain the fastest, most affordable, and reliable mode of transportation for many people.\nTo reduce gridlock, we need to shift away from designing cities around cars. As shown in this video, which illustrates how much space cars take up when everyone drives alone (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e_oWmY_mkCA), we can move people more efficiently by investing in alternative forms of transportation like buses, trains, and bikes.\nLooking at examples from other countries can help us see how we might do better. For instance, Tokyo, Japan, has a population of over 37 million people, yet the city does not suffer from constant gridlock. This is because their transportation system was designed to prioritize trains and buses. In 2023, Japan's railways transported 21 billion passengers (https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/627136\/japan-number-railway-passeng\u2026), and that number is only growing. If Japan had 37 million cars on the road, the traffic would be unimaginable. Toronto, and Ontario in general, could be headed down a similar path if we don\u2019t make changes now.\nWe can also learn from Japan\u2019s success by improving our public transportation. Currently, trains only transport about 4% of people in Toronto compared to Tokyo (https:\/\/www.ttc.ca\/transparency-and-accountability\/Operating-Statistics\u2026). If we invested more in making trains faster, more affordable, and reliable, we would see a reduction in car usage, as those who rely on cars for speed and convenience would have better options for commuting.\nMoreover, cities like Copenhagen have proven that alternatives like cycling can work without relying on trains. In 2018, 1.44 million km were cycled per weekday in Copenhagen, and Dronning Louise\u2019s Bridge, the most heavily trafficked cycling stretch in Denmark, saw more than 40,000 cyclists daily (https:\/\/www.visitcopenhagen.com\/copenhagen\/activities\/copenhagens-bike-\u2026). This shows how far and how many people can be moved by cycling. Instead of making it harder to build bike lanes, we should prioritize creating more pathways for cyclists. Building bike highways and innovative bridges for cyclists can also improve health, reduce noise, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nMaking it easier to build more highways is not the solution to reducing gridlock. The real solution lies in reducing the number of cars on the road by offering more transportation options, such as walking, cycling, and public transit. If we design our cities with these alternatives in mind, we can follow the example of successful cities worldwide that have found ways to transport people quickly and safely without relying on cars.\n",

The move by Doug Ford to remove bike lanes is part of a political campaign to try win suburban support in his next election cycle. The infrastructure that has been put in place is saving the lives of many Ontarian's that chose active transportation in urban centres. Doug Ford is willing to put people\u2019s lives at risk to win a few more votes, rather than presenting real ideas that will solve any of the many issues he and his government could be solving. Further this short sighted move is a huge waste of money as inevitably the infrastructure will be rebuilt as this kind of work that is happening around the world as many leaders see the benefits of active transportation and how it helps solve congestion. The small minded and short sighted move will cost the tax payers of this province the money that was already spent to put in that infrastructure, the more money it will cost to take out the infrastructure and the money that it will cost to put in the infrastructure in again when we have leaders in power that are actually serious about solving issues, not playing culture war politics because after nearly two terms in power they have no real issues that they have championed.\n",

I've been a cyclist the whole time, using bike lanes to get to work, do groceries, see friends and family, attend events, and generally get around. The bike lanes on Bloor, College, Sherbourne, and Shaw streets have enabled me to travel more safely to and from all the places I need to go as a citizen of Toronto. Traversing Spadina and University avenues while travelling east or west can either be a treacherous, chaotic, and scary endeavor (on Dundas with no bike lanes) vs. efficient, safe, and non-intimidating (on College St, with bike lanes). They make a huge difference in the way traffic flows for cyclists and drivers, who are able to better know what to expect and act accordingly where bike lanes exist. Removing them will be a detriment to cyclists and drivers alike, putting peoples lives at risk. There are other solutions to explore in order to improve congestion in the city which would be less harmful and avoid endangering the lives of cyclists. Improving access to bike lanes, rather than removing them, will get more people on bikes and relieve some of the car traffic. It takes time and going back on all the improvements on bike access we've made so far is a step back in the wrong direction in terms of dealing with congestion and safety.\n",

        "comment":"I am concerned with this bill for two main reasons. The first is the removal of the need for environmental assessments for the proposed Highway 413 development. There was a study by the Federal Highway Administration in the US that details all of the potential impacts of the extensive highway network within the US (Ref 1) This report clearly shows that there is significant wildlife disruption caused by these highways and underpins the complex nature of the interaction between roadways and surrounding wildlife. I therefore think it is imperative that an extensive study be conducted to better understand any potential impacts that could be caused by the new highway to allow for plans to be implemented to mitigate them prior to the highway's construction. To circumvent this process with a piece of legislation is an egregious misuse of power.\nMy second concern is to do with the proposed removal of existing bike infrastructure, alongside the need for the province to grant permission to install new complete streets. Putting to one side that this is an overstep by the provincial government into municipal affairs; it represents a huge step backwards in the development of Toronto's (and any other instances where the removal of bike lanes is being proposed) development. The MPPs keep referring to common sense policy but I am not sure of their definition of common sense. It doesn't feel like it would be common sense to spend, what is estimated to be in the realm of $48 million dollars of public money to contravene expert testimony, including recent comments from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (Ref 2) on measures that will fail to reduce congestion in the city. If the 'common sense' is that there are currently too many vehicles using the roadways of concern to warrant them being a single lane, then with the expanding population of the city, what is going to happen when there are too many vehicles using a roadway for two lanes to be enough? Multi-modal transport solutions represent the best opportunity to combat vehicle dependency. My final comment on this is that complete streets initiatives also act as traffic calming and make streets safer for everyone. This can be seen in the average speed reductions on Bloor Street over the Humber River bridge which were in excess of 70km\/h (unacceptable for an inner city residential street) prior to the lanes being installed to around 56km\/h after the installation. After 6 cyclist deaths so far this year in the city of Toronto, it feels irresponsible to revert back to our original unsafe road designs and put the cyclists who have completed over 360,000 trips on the Bloor Street bike lanes (based on the counter by High Park) back into harms way.\n",

I do not have a car, and will occasionally use a car-share for groceries, commutes, or other needs. I do not support Bill 212.\nThis proposed legislation directly affects me as a resident, as a cyclist and as a driver. It concerns me that my government, instead of making evidence-based, data-driven decisions about urban design and the environment is instead taking regressive action and wasting taxpayer dollars on removing NEW bike lane infrastructure in downtown Toronto.\nThe Bill does not provide any evidence that bike lanes increase congestion. I understand it's a catchy idea that no doubt plays well with car commuters, but where is the study\/research\/numbers to back up this assertion? The government has failed to provide any or point to any actual evidence that congestion in Toronto is made worse by bike lane infrastructure.\nThere is however, ample evidence on the positive impact of bike lanes for Cyclist, Driver and Pedestrian safety (SOURCE 1), environmental benefit (SOURCE 2), physical and mental health benefits (SOURCE 3), economic benefit (SOURCE 4) and in fact for reducing congestion (SOURCE 5). There is also plenty of evidence showing that creating cycling infrastructure will will promote more cycling and therefore reduce the number of cars on the road (induced demand, SOURCE 5). Given this abundance of evidence, it is shocking to me that my provincial government isn't doing more to promote cycling in urban environments but is actually impeding public works that would encourage this healthy behaviour.\nIs congestion as in issue? Of course. It creates pollution and stalls movement in the city. However, there are many factors contributing to congestion, including increase in population, and shortfalls in our public transit systems. It seems this bill is designed to make people think the government is taking action on a issue in a visible way (wasting taxpayer dollars on destroying current infrastructure), while avoiding actually working on sustainable solutions to congestion (removing on-street parking in high traffic areas, congestion charges in the downtown core, improving public transit, addressing the housing crisis that is driving people out of the downtown Toronto and creating more commuters in the first place).\nAlso, people WANT to bike!! Use of BikeShare TO has literally skyrocketed and will continue to. Why not invest in a mode of transport that is good for the environment and for our health?\nI think the premier needs to stop trying to by Mayor of Toronto and starting being a leader for the whole province. Where is evidence informed, progressive leadership? It is certainly not reflected in Bill 212, and that is why I am firmly opposed to it passing into law.\n",

By providing choices for alternate travel for rural Ontarians like trains, Ontario can become a more equitable place to live and get around, no matter who you are.\nMultiple studies over decades (2 sources listed below) show that adding lanes of highway only produces more traffic. If it's easier to drive then more people will, and therefore the congestion is ultimately the same. It is instead more effective to provide alternatives to car travel by providing *reliable* and *convenient* modes of public transit like trains, LRTs, etc as well as infrastructure like bicycle lanes. Of course, sometimes driving is the only option depending on where you're going and what you're carrying with you. In which case, if more people take the train or their bike, highways will be less congested with commuters going to the office and be open to the people that need them.\nIf it's easier to take the train to work, why *wouldn't* people use it?\nInstead of building more highways, I'd instead suggest reacquiring the 407, infrastructure that already exists and is severely underutilized.\nCanada is lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to high speed trains and interconnected networks of reliable and convenient transport. Train travel to BC is SLOWER than when it was first built over a century ago. In Germany, there is a train station in every small hamlet creating transportation equity between both rural and urban regions of the country. Rural Ontarians don't need to be isolated from the rest of Ontario.\nWith more choices for travel to suit everyone's needs, we'd make it more equitable for everyone, no matter where you live.\n",

This is absolutely not acceptable! MPPs are elected for a reason - and creating legislation like this, that takes away rights of our citizens and completely disregards negative impacts to the environment is not democratic at all!\nBill 212 will take away consultation with Indigenous Peoples about Highway 413.  Given all that has happened in the past few years, I cannot fathom why the Province would think this is acceptable at all.\nThe details in Bill 212 about the expropriation of land are shocking [Building Highways Faster Act, sections 3(1), 9(1)(e), 13(6), 13(9), 13(11)]. This Bill allows police to enter dwellings, land to be taken by force and no opportunity for an individual property owner to be able to appeal the date on which they need to leave their land. Many of the people that own these lands are seniors that have lived on the land for many decades - imagine if you were near the end of your life (or even in a palliative state) and were told you need to vacate your property and all your decades of belongings within 90 days. And you can't even ask for a reconsideration of the timeline. That's not the kind of Ontario that I want to live in. The Province should not be bullying its citizens - that is not democracy, that's a dictatorship.\nThe fines to an individual for obstructing or not vacating the land to be expropriated are shockingly high [Building Highways Faster Act, section 12(4)]. It's a shame that the Province would go to these lengths to advance projects they deem are important (without having the backing of the citizens), but the Province would not take the same action to increase fines for illegal land use (which is a problem all over the GTA). If only the Province would take action to punish the people breaking laws, instead of bullying good and decent citizens - this Province would not be deteriorating as badly as it is.\nThe details in Bill 212 regarding the impact to the environment and cultural heritage are also terrifying. The proposed Highway 413 Act, section 2(1) means that Highway 413 (or any GTA West Corridor project) does not have to follow the Environmental Assessment Act. We have the Environmental Assessment Act for a reason - to protect the environment. To proceed with any project and completely disregard the Environmental Assessment Act should be illegal. The Province should not be writing a Bill to absolve them from following the law. Paving over environmentally sensitive lands and destroying habitats for threatened and endangered species to build a highway that we don't need makes no sense at all.\nWhat I find even more shocking is section 6(4) of the Highway 413 Act - this allows the Minister to not publish studies or updates to studies that contain information about sensitive natural or cultural heritage matters. To me, this means that whatever studies are done, any studies that are negative or the public would not see as positive - these studies would be hidden from the public. What exactly does the Province have to hide here? How is this democratic at all??? Why even bother doing studies at all, if you are only going to accept ones that say go ahead with your project? I don't really know how you can live with yourselves in doing this.\nThe Highway 413 Act, sections 12(1) & 12(2) would allow the highway to go against policies in the Planning Act and Provincial Plan. What is the point of having these pieces of legislation if you are just going to disregard them? And how are municipalities expected to plan their communities if you keep changing the rules?\nSection 13 of the proposed Highway 413 Act removes the ability of the public to participate in anything to do with the environmental assessment process. Again, this is shocking that the rights of Ontarians to have a say in how their land is being used is being taken away. The existing process that involves the public is that way because we are a democracy - our elected officials are expected to follow the laws that are in place - not write legislation to circumvent those laws.\nWhat kind of place is this? The last time I looked, I lived in a democratic country - with this bill, my rights and the rights of all Ontarians would be completely disregarded in order to pave over green space and agricultural land for a highway that this Province does not need. This would also set the precedent for the Province to keep doing this same thing over & over again for whatever project they deem is important (without consulting or considering what the people who elected you actually want). That is a dictatorship - not democracy. You should all be ashamed of yourselves - I don't know how you can proceed with this bill and look your families and your constituents in the eye.\nI ask that the Province scrap Bill 212 and instead, focus your time and energy on following the laws that are already in place and proceeding with infrastructure projects that will actually help this Province and the environment (like investing in public transit and better using the highways that already exist, like the 407 and allowing trucks to use that highway either for free or at a highly discounted rate). You should not be spending your time taking away the rights of Ontarians and destroying the environment - that is not why you were elected. Follow and respect the laws of our democracy - that's what we expect of you.\nA concerned Ontario resident\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my concern about Bill 212, regarding the provincial overreach impacting Toronto\u2019s infrastructure management, adversely affecting the safety of cyclists and fast-tracking Highway 413 ahead of indigenous consulation and environmental assessment.\nAs a resident of Toronto, I am deeply concerned about the implications of Bill 23 and the proposed Bill 212. The significant reduction in our city\u2019s infrastructure budget due to Bill 23 has already strained our ability to maintain and improve essential services. The additional measures proposed in Bill 212 threaten to further disrupt our city\u2019s carefully balanced infrastructure planning, which is crucial for addressing street space allocation, climate action, affordability, road safety, and overall quality of life.\nI believe that the City of Toronto, with its unique needs and challenges, is best positioned to manage its own infrastructure. The proposed section 195.2 of the Highway Traffic Act represents an overreach that undermines local governance and the ability of our elected officials to serve the interests of their constituents effectively.\nFurthermore, it puts the safety of the cyclists at risk. A 2019 City of Toronto report suggests that nearly  44% of Toronto residents identified themselves as utilitarian cyclists which means they use biking to commute to work, school, shopping or social purposes. Data from the 2016 census indicate that the mode share of cycling in some Toronto neighborhoods is as high as 34%. Copenhagen in Denmark saves an estimated $357 million a year in healthcare costs by encouraging biking instead of driving. With the provincial government wanting to make the best use of taxpayers' money, ensuring safe biking can be an effective way to do so in the long run.\nI urge you and your colleagues to support this motion and advocate for the withdrawal of the proposed section 195.2. It is essential that the Province respects the jurisdiction of municipalities to manage their own infrastructure and address the competing demands of their residents. It is also important to prioritize sustainable transportation modes like biking and ensuring the safety of the cyclists.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"I completely oppose Bill 212. The bill is a complete over-reach of legislative authority, poorly thought out, not based in facts or reality. The bill will make the lives of all Ontarians worse environmentally (destroying sensitive lands, species loss, farmland lost, decreasing local food production, etc.) and financially (subsidizing more urban sprawl, taking on more debt to pay for highways, etc.), and less safe (faster speeds, fewer safe roads to bike on, etc.).\nAs a driver, the government should be focusing on making our streets safer by restricting vehicle size and weight, as well as maximum speed and acceleration. Heavier vehicles wear out our roads faster which means more costly, congestion inducing construction on a more frequent basis. Heavier vehicles and faster moving vehicles also result in more severe injuries; the combination of the two factors is deadly.\nAs a driver, I wish that the government would instead restrict the size of vehicles too make more room on the roads for additional vehicle traffic. The average vehicle size in 2013 was 4.45m, but by 2023 that had increased to 5.00m. That means that in a 1km stretch of road you can fit 25 fewer vehicles than just 10 years ago. The result is that on 40kph road, such as Bloor St, 1,005 fewer vehicles per hour can flow through the same stretch of road just on increased vehicle size alone. The over-sized pickups and SUVs have no place in our province unless needed for professional purposes (but even that is a lie, tradespeople in the rest of the world get along fine with smaller vehicles that are more practical and with better visibility).\nAs a driver, I wish the government were serious about clearing up congestion and ban on-street parking EVERYWHERE, all of the time, and require that if on-street parking were allowed that vehicle owners be charge the FULL and TRUE cost of parking. The public subsidization of private property (vehicle) storage needs to end. We do not allow people to store their clothes in our water pipes, and we certainly would not let them do it for less than the full cost of maintaining that pipe. I can\u2019t store the contents of my garage on the road, why should I be allowed to store my vehicle? Especially when it is impeding and reducing the flow of traffic.\nThe BUILDING HIGHWAYS FASTER ACT and HIGHWAY 413 ACT are not needed because we need to stop building new highways, and stop widening existing highways; especially when there is a completely underused highway 407 that could be better used.  We are in a climate crisis and building new highways will only increase emissions (both from construction and road material production, but from more congestion and more kilometres driven). The 407 could be bought and its tolls removed essentially overnight for a fraction of the cost of a new highway (and unlike a 413 would be completed immediately not a minimum 15 years from now). Tolls could be placed on other roads and highways to shift demand away from congested routes.\nStudy after study, and city after city, have shown that bike lanes do not cause congestion. Bike lanes are a part of the solution. Part of the issue is that the government is using the wrong metrics. Roads are meant to move PEOPLE and GOODS, not VEHICLES AND GOODS. So instead of measuring number of VEHICLES moved per hour the better metric would be the number of PEOPLE moved per hour. By measuring by that metric then bike lanes, bus lanes, transit lines, etc. improve those metrics most AND get people out of their cars leaving more space on the roads for others who want or need to drive. People need viable, safe options. As a driver I prefer when roads have dedicated and separate space for motor vehicles and bicycles. It makes both drivers and people who bike much more predictable, and yes, it often forces drivers to slow down. Just because someone used to be able to \u201cget across town in 15min\u201d, does not mean that they should have been able to do so. It just means that previously they were excessively speeding, and are now the being forced to travel the speed limit.\nRequiring Ministry approval for a bike lane is the opposite of red-tape reduction; it is unnecessarily bureaucratic. Limiting a municipality from even marking (painting) a bicycle lane is also extremely petty and vindictive. You are telling me a municipality that has a 5m wide lane and wants to paint a line to denote 1.5m of it is now for bicycles and leave 3.5m for cars needs Ministry approval because it \u201cmight\u201d unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic?\nThe government should also legislate that all self-driving vehicle features should be able to communicate seamlessly across makes, models, and manufacturers. This will allow for vehicles to travel closer together, at faster speeds, with greater safety and efficiency than an unpredictable human driver.\nNew and wider roads are only going to exacerbate and accelerate the impacts on our climate. More and wider roads only induces demand. We are at the point where congestion is a geometry problem. We simply cannot fit any more vehicles into our city cores. We should be focusing on how to reinvigorate our rail lines to rely less of truck shipping, how we can re-establish industry closer to our cities so that we don\u2019t need to ship things across the globe, but make them closer to home.\nThe government should also launch an investigation into why infrastructure projects in Ontario (highways, transit, water, etc.) are so much more expensive and slower than in the rest of the world. There must be illegal collusion and price fixing involved.\nGiven that the government just spent $100 million dollars on satellite internet the portion of the bill pertaining to amending the BUILDING BROADBAND FASTER ACT, 2021 seem irrelevant now.\nI can only imagine the outage of a then Councillor Ford had if a provincial government tried to over-step on municipalities like this back then.\n",

        "comment":"This bill will will not save you time, nor will it reduce gridlock. Below are some major issues with the bill:\n- It is extremely authoritarian. The Provincial government has no business dictating how every single municipality in the province should be building local infrastructure. Municipal governments are elected for that, not the province. For example, they will have power over whether Timiskaming will be able to install a bike lane on a residential street, which is extremely overreaching.\n- It completely ignores the overwhelming amount of research (see a meta analysis of induced demand in the attached link) showing how bike lanes reduce congestion. Induced demand governs traffic patterns, so if there are more car lanes, more people will drive (not the amount that drove under less car lanes). In addition, the people who would've cycled will now use cars instead, further adding to car traffic congestion, and reducing the number of available travel options.\n- The province was dishonest in saying 1% of people use bike lanes, quoting a study for the entire region. On Bloor, University, and Yonge in particular, there are large amounts of people that ride bikes, which is certainly far more than 1%.\n- The province appears set on moving as many cars as possible instead of moving the most amount of PEOPLE as possible, opting for extremely inefficient modes of transport (cars) which take up far more space than bikes and transit. If they really want to reduce car congestion, they should build public transit which is far more space efficient than highways (line 1 moves more people than the 401 daily despite the 401 being 18 lanes wide at its widest point - but a few more lanes will surely solve it instead of building transit, right?).\n- The city of Toronto already paid millions of dollars to install the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University, and even the province reimburses them, those are 100% wasted tax dollars on behalf of the city\/province.\nFrom spending $250M of tax payer dollars to expedite sales of alcohol in convenience stores, to bad ideas like the Bradford bypass which will cost billions to save people 10 minutes of travel time between the 400 and 404, which will clog up with traffic within a year or so due to induced demand, to withholding funding to the health sector, etc.\nMost importantly with this bill, they ignore the fundamental concept that the only way to reduce car traffic, is viable alternatives to driving. This government is not representing the best interests of the people, and are wasting our money. As someone who voted for the conservatives in the most recent election, they have absolutely lost my vote. Along with my entire family.\n",

It would undermine local decision making to give the province this kind of over reach on planning decisions that will have impacts on a local, community level.\nOver 20 km of cycling infrastructure has been proposed for removal (Younge Steet, University Avenue and Bloor Street West), which will have wide reaching negative effects on the City of Toronto's transportation system.

Complete Communities include a full range of transportation options, meaning bike lanes. Removing bike lanes would violate this section. Would Bill 212 override the PPS and, by extension, the Planning Act?\nSecond, there could be delays in the planning process. With Bill 212, a municipality would have to wait for the province to review its application to reduce a laneway for vehicular traffic and decide whether to approve it. This shows that the province does not trust municipalities to use common sense when installing a bike lane. Municipalities either conduct traffic studies or hire consultants to do so. If a bike lane were structurally and politically impossible, a city would not install it.\nThird, with the added delay, some municipalities would decide not to add bike lanes to arterial roads. This could make the streets more dangerous and prompt cyclists to drive or take public transit, increasing vehicular traffic. This would wear the roads down even faster, increasing infrastructure costs a municipality would have to pay.\nThe Province should leave the city planning details to the municipalities and focus on regional objectives.\n",

Those increasing emissions are due to more people driving cars, not bicycles (The Atmospheric Fund, https:\/\/carbon.taf.ca\/2023\/sectors\/transportation, 2024).\nMaking driving faster and more convenient results in more cars on the road, and more traffic. The solution to traffic gridlock, increasing carbon emissions, and air pollution is absolutely not adding more cars on the road.\nRather than wasting taxpayer dollars removing existing infrastructure that well-used and loved by the public, I suggest investing in more and better transit and infrastructure to support active transportation.\nI use the Bloor bike lanes every day, at least twice, to take my children to school. Without that bike lane in place, we wouldn't feel safe enough to ride. It is the most joyful part of my day to see dozens of other families, children, seniors, people with disabilities, flooding the bike lanes instead of using cars. Many of those people are there because of how hard the City has worked to make cycling safer. The cycling network is a vision of a vibrant, connected, healthy, and beautiful city, and it's saving lives. And, there is no network that exists \"on side streets.\" People on all modes of transportation need to reach the same locations that people in cars do.\nThe provincial government's overreach into municipal jurisdiction, and their intervention into decisions that have been made based on evidence and expert planning, is not welcome here.

Prabmeet Sarkaria\u2028Minister of Transportation of Ontario\u20287700 Hurontario Street, Unit 402\u2028Brampton, ON L6Y 4M3\nGood day Minister Sarkaria and representative staff,\nThis comment is directed at the proposal of Bill 212, the \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act.\u201d Below, I will address Schedule 4 outlined in the bill relating to the Highway Traffic Act.\nPREAMBLE\nHaving lived most of my life in the City of Toronto and City of Ottawa, I\u2019ve observed the consequences of the rapid population growth since 2021. As someone that commutes by car, TTC, train, bike and walk, I believe there should be great consideration of the rights granted to municipalities to plan their cities. Businesses and residents have to grapple with the consequences of the drastic growth of an already strained social infrastructure. As recent studies have shown, it was concluded that direct actions taken by the federal and provincial government\u2019s policies on temporary foreign workers and international education programs, and other recent schemes to have accelerated strain or \u201cgridlock\u201d the bill claims to want to address.\nIt was found that the application of policies of strategies in programs to increase immigration of students and temporary foreign workers indiscriminately caused a surge in the population specific to the City of Toronto and surrounding municipalities as these are in-demand locations. Recent provincial and federal mandates have also identified significant deficiencies with housing, population displacement, and public infrastructure to support the rapid population growth. It goes without saying that immigration of asylum seekers and giving opportunities to educate individuals to lift our communities is fundamental to the functioning of Canada and Ontarians of metropolitan populations. Toronto is revered for it\u2019s vibrant culture, with a progressive economic ideology for city planning that caters to the businesses and residents of the city. The municipality is best equipped to balances the intricate needs of it\u2019s residents, businesses, and their employees.\nThe amended provisions seeks to transfer certain rights from municipalities to the Province regarding matters affecting the pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles otherwise reserved to the municipality to plan for it\u2019s residents. These amendments are required for the Province to remove popular bike infrastructure in heavily populated areas of town where the consequences of passing the amendments will a) increase congestion of already congested roads of the City, b) allow the Province to make decisions on matters affecting the diverse needs of the neighbourhoods, and c) continue to endanger cyclists, pedestrians and all in between.\nCAUSES OF \u201cGRIDLOCK\u201d IN TORONTO\nPopulation increase, rapid immigration, housing deficiencies, and strained public transportation have led to the reliance of vehicular transportation as commuters are forced out of living where there jobs are, businesses having to transport goods to support the population and is the driving factor of gridlock on motor roads, as claimed by the bill.\nResidents of the City are less likely to have ownership of personal-use vehicles and instead elect to use the TTC, cycling, or alternate means to transport themselves to their destinations. Vehicles owned for personal use tend to be by individuals or families that have to leave the City on a regular basis or for jobs that require driving in the City. Motor vehicles are the cause of majority gridlock of all other modes of transportation, with the exception of special events hosted by the City, an understanding I hope the Ministry recognizes as well.\nAs cars, vans, and trucks don\u2019t typically offer the same occupancy density as walking, cycling or taking public transportation, bike lanes used by couriers, commuters, and for leisure, offers more of the population to get to their destinations. Investing in providing housing to people of a variety of socio-economic backgrounds, paying them adequately to live closer to their place of work will decrease gridlock. Reducing commuters depending on cars to come into the City\u2019s core (Yonge, University, College, and Bloor) will be the only sustainable mode that will alleviate congestion for transportation vehicles and residents.\nTherefore, decreasing access of protected lanes, which supporting denser flow of non-vehicular traffic, will lead commuters to rely on taxis and cars more often which will only increase congestion.\nOVERREACH OF PROVINCIAL POWERS\nAlthough, information sharing of key highway infrastructure granted by the Municipal Act, 2001, should be expanded to ensure proper disclosure and collection of engineering data to help make informed decisions based on research and science. An argument can be made that the Province is not equipped to require large municipalities to require the approval of the Province for the construction or decommission of bike lanes, as the concerns of local communities are the ones using the infrastructure, and not typically used by visitors or commuters in other parts of the province or have the diverse needs addressed for municipalities, such as Ottawa, Toronto or Thunder Bay.\nSupporting the growing population, expanding the Province\u2019s rights to require the approval of the municipality would result in stagnation of key development of boroughs and cities. There would be an significant delay from one government to review the needs of the people at this scale. Powers are already granted to cities to conduct projects affecting it\u2019s businesses and residents based on democratic, localized, and studied communities using the infrastructure. Existing bike lanes already go through careful consideration and local oversight by governments, associations and residents before approving construction.\nApproval of this amendment will result in additional bureaucracy, expense, and regulation from a provincial government for such complex degree on a provincial scale. As mentioned, the City of Toronto is unique and requires careful, thoughtful, and detailed consideration localized outside of the Province\u2019s ability to provide at this scale. The Province would be able to focus instead on improving the transportation requirements of trans-urban infrastructure like rehabilitation of the Gardiner and Don Valley parkways, continue making GO trains better adapted to reduce reliance of single-occupied vehicle commuters, and provide funding to municipalities to expand local public transportation with greater efficiency than having the Province conduct construction themselves as with the ongoing costly16 year Eglinton Crosstown Line and the ongoing of the almost 6 year Ontario Line construction.\nSAFTEY OF BOTH MOTOR VEHICULAR AND NON-MOTOR VEHICULAR TRAFFIC\nThe climate crisis is worsening, and cars have a reliance on fossil fuels or precious metals which continue to endanger the future of the population. While the abolition of fossil fuels is not possible with our current infrastructure, removing safe access to commuters, businesses, and residents will not help with the country\u2019s emission goals. We\u2019ve seen the affects of climate change in the City, with floods, wind, and fires accelerating the destruction of our environment, affecting biodiversity, along with the economic cost to residents and businesses.\nMotor vehicles when compared with other forms of transportation cause the most injury on highway roads. Mixing various modes of transportation increases this risk. Combining bike lane traffic with pedestrian traffic also leads to an increase risk of injury. Segmenting traffic of motor vehicles from cyclists (delivery, e-bike, accessibility devices) from pedestrians (walking, running or using accessibility devices) is the only way to maximize safety in congested areas of metropolitan municipalities.\nThe health implications of having the population rely on using single-occupied motor vehicles is also affected. Having the population cycle or walk has profound health benefits and decreases the number of vehicles polluting denser local communities.\nThe removal of bike lanes or adding bureaucratic barriers to any municipal study supporting for proper segmentation of traffic will only increase injury and deaths. Therefore it is not the place of the Province to overrule these municipal determinations. The amendment of this bill will decrease in the adoption of using the other forms of transportation as motor vehicles will continue to pose an increased risk on the growing population of cyclists, pedestrians, and all commuters in between.\nCONCLUSION\nExistence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, more people are able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population making the roads less safe, have municipalities lose their autonomy to serve their population, and all while not addressing the problem of gridlock.\nThank you for your time in taking our considerations regarding the amendments to the Highway Traffic Act as outlined in Schedule 4 of the bill. For the reasons outlined in this commentary, I oppose Bill 212.\nRegards,\nA City of Toronto and City of Ottawa resident.\n",

Another example is Copenhagen that has a network of bike lanes that support reduction of car traffic and as result do not experience our immense traffic.\nOur decision makers need to travel to leading European cities and take example of how smart policies and focus on public transit can reduce dependency on cars and as a result no need to expand highways .

Please let local communities decide when and where they are deployed.\nI want to remind the committee that Bill 212 will not cause cyclists to migrate back to their station wagons and sedans. It\u2019s not 1974. Today, parking spots, at a cost of $200,000 each are being built in Toronto at a ratio of less than 1 for every 3 new residential units. This ratio must continue to drop as our population swells. Let\u2019s build housing instead of parking. Cycling, along with transit, is here to stay\u2013 please don\u2019t stand in its way.\nThis committee will hear many submissions that remind it that bike lanes save lives. This government will have blood on its hands if the swelling number of individuals on bicycles are forced to merge with individuals who need or choose to manoeuvre 2-ton steel vehicles through our streets. I also want to remind the committee that active transportation, enabled by the complete-streets model, supports the physical and mental health of our workforce. And it appeals disproportionately to the young, creative demographic that will drive the economic growth of our province.\nFinally, evidence indicates that cycling, and the infrastructure that supports it, is key to relieving congestion on our roads so that they are available for emergency services, the disabled, deliveries\u2026 and motorcades. Please be guided by the plea of the Ontario Professional Planners Institute and return to evidence-based policy-making. This government should not punish those citizens who have given up car travel. They are modern-day heroes, making way for those who truly need to travel by car. I encourage this government to celebrate and support cyclists rather than limiting and removing bike lanes.\n",

The legislation aims to reduce traffic congestion and expedite infrastructure projects, but by doing that, it is risking local stakeholders and destroying years of urban planning work to maintain sustainable communities.\nThe plan to make large traffic lanes for more vehicles by removing bike lanes might have a negative consequence in the long run, such as less safety for riders and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which can even lead to less trust in the government's decision-making power. The possibility to bypass environmental reviews is especially troubling, as it implies a lack of accountability for any environmental damage.\nFurthermore, the cost ramifications for towns like Toronto, who have already invested considerably in bicycle infrastructure, are significant and appear misaligned with the broader climate and safety goals. While the goal of removing gridlock looks absolute, a detailed, researched, and balanced plan that represents multimodal transportation, municipal sovereignty, and environmental sustainability is more likely to provide better benefits for people in Ontario. In addition, a chance to participate in the decision-making process should be given to every stakeholder to make sure that such policies are beneficial and reflect the needs and values of the communities affected by them.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposed through Bill 212. Staff from the Town of Halton Hills has the following comments:\n\u2022\tThe Town is concerned with the provisions of the Act that override most municipal by-laws that might prevent or restrict the delivery of goods or services to facilitate around-the-clock, 24\/7 construction of HWY 413, including restrictions relating to noise or the use of highways under the jurisdiction of the municipality. It is critical that activities which will be disruptive to the municipality and its residents be communicated in advance and mitigation strategies be put in place to minimize impacts to residents and businesses in the area. It is important to highlight that Project 1 (embankment for a ramp for the 401\/413 interchange) is located within the Town\u2019s Premier Gateway Employment Area. Currently there are a number of planned and ongoing municipal transportation and water\/wastewater projects, active businesses such as the Toronto Premium Outlet and ongoing development in the area. Coordination with active businesses and ongoing construction projects in the area should be prioritized. To minimize disruptions and ensure a regular communication channel, municipal staff should have direct access to a construction liaison officer or other field staff working on the project.\n\u2022\tThe Act places restrictions regarding obtaining compensation in relation to a site inspection on land under municipal ownership. Specifying that if the property owner is a municipality or a local board within the meaning of the Municipal Act, 2001 or the City of Toronto Act, 2006, the Minister may compensate the property owner for any damages resulting from the site inspection, but does not have to; and that if the Minister compensates the property owner, the Minister shall decide the quantum of compensation and may provide only partial compensation. Site inspection activities, include altering in any manner any natural or artificial feature of the property to carry out early works. To alter in any manner could mean that negative impacts on the Town\u2019s NHS are not mitigated, including compensated for. The wording should be clarified to add that reasonable harm to the environment will be avoided during site inspections and if reasonable harm is proposed that the Town be consulted to review mitigation and that any residual losses be compensated.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my serious concern about Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. This bill would negatively affect the future of sustainable mobility in the Province of Ontario and do little to nothing to actually reduce gridlock.\nInduced Demand\nStudy after study worldwide shows us that building additional lanes onto or creating new highways has little impact on overall congestion. The additional space for cars encourages more people to drive, and in a matter of months to years the travel times go back up to pre-expansion levels or worse. In my lifetime, the numerous expansion to highways across Ontario and in the GTA have not improved my travel times. Instead, thanks to the dramatically higher number of cars I avoid driving on 400 series highways if possible during the day for safety reasons and will even take back routes to avoid them because there are no alternative modes of transportation available. I\u2019d much rather be on a train taking a nap but I\u2019m forced to stare at a strip of pavement for hours at a time.\nFor a specific example, we can look at the recent 18 km Highway 401 expansion project between the Credit River in Mississauga and Regional Road 25 in Milton, at a taxpayer cost of $640 million, which has failed to alleviate traffic congestion on the 401. How many more times must we do the same thing, while hoping for a different outcome, before we start using taxpayer money on solutions that actually work?\nGovernment Overreach in Municipal and Other Local Decision Making\nHaving grown up in Grey-Bruce and lived in both Waterloo and Toronto before moving back to the area, it is obvious that the specific transportation needs of these regions vary significantly. Locally elected governments are in the best position to address and respond to these needs because they live in the towns and counties they serve, and their staff have the expertise and data to provide prudent recommendations case by case. Whether or not you personally think bike lanes are important, requiring provincial permission to adjust lanes of traffic for the installation of bike lanes is an egregious overreach by the province into municipal governance and adds red tape to decisions that should be made by our locally elected officials.\nDiverse Transportation Options\nProviding a range of transportation options like buses, streetcars, subways, local and regional high speed trains, and safe walking and biking infrastructure encourages people to make different choices about how they get around, taking cars off our roads and highways and reducing gridlock.\nIn Toronto, investing in these options allows people to save money on transportation because they can own fewer cars or use them less (average car ownership in Canada costs over $1,300 per month, money that would be better off in people\u2019s pockets). City staff also note that \u201cResearch and experience from across North America and around the world have shown that a connected and safe cycling network is a key part of mitigating traffic congestion in a growing city,\u201d\nSimilarly in Grey-Bruce, we could be encouraging people to leave the car at home for short in-town trips and providing incentives for e-bike purchases; this would reduce air and noise pollution, save people the thousands of dollars it costs to own a car, and the light, regular exercise would improve local health metrics and give people the opportunity to meet others in their community more frequently (an important factor in community cohesion and safety as more and more new people move here).\nAdditionally, many people in our ageing population are going to lose their driver\u2019s licences for medical reasons in the next decade or so. It can already be seen in Hanover as the number of mobility scooters and electric bikes is steadily increasing. Many of these people choose to ride on the road because our sidewalks are uneven or non-existent, creating a dangerous situation for all road users, increasingly so in the winter.  If Hanover or Grey County wanted to install a lane separate from the pedestrian sidewalks for these people, would the province veto it because it might take space away from cars? This attitude tells our residents that how they get around only matters if they drive, that they don\u2019t deserve transportation safety unless they drive. How must it feel, I wonder, to realise that as soon as your driver\u2019s licence is gone you are perceived by the province to be an invalid, undeserving of the same consideration we give drivers so immediately.\nCost\nBill 212 would have the bike lanes on Bloor, Young, and University torn out to reinstall a car lane. I question the financial responsibility of a government that wants to waste the $27 million spent to install these and then spend an additional $48 million (likely more if other recent construction estimates are any indication) to reconstruct those roads when Toronto\u2019s data show that \u201cThe reduced network capacity due to construction-related road closures is a primary factor contributing to congestion across the city.\u201d for example, \u201cthe ongoing construction of major provincial transit projects including the Eglinton Crosstown Light Rail Transit (Line 5), Finch West Light Rail Transit (Line 6), and Ontario Line, private development activity to support population growth, and major infrastructure renewal including the Gardiner Expressway reconstruction\u201d. Surely many more months of bonus construction to tear up bike lanes up isn\u2019t the answer, especially when the result will be \u201clikely minimal improvements in travel time\u201d.\nBeyond the direct cost, there is also the cost of lost business and job opportunities. A study from 2019 noted that only 10% of visitors arrived by car to businesses on Bloor West in the Korea town and Annex neighbourhoods. 18% of visitors arrived by bike, and half of all visitors arrived by walking. A new report (November 17th) from the University of Toronto calculates that should the Bloor Street bike lane be removed, \u201cthose businesses will no longer be reachable by bike to on average 88,000 potential customers. Businesses on Yonge will do even worse, and will no longer be reachable to on average 138,000 customers.\u201d By reducing access to safe and connected cycling infrastructure \u201c600,000 people across Toronto will have fewer destinations they can safely reach by bicycle. Of those 600,000, the average person will lose access to 84,000 job locations, making it harder for them to reach workplaces, food stores, parks, shopping and healthcare.\u201d\nThere is also the as yet to be estimated cost to relocate bike lanes, if the province even permits it. Nearly any bike lane in Toronto will require shifting some space away from cars, even the side streets the province suggests they would be moved to, and it is extremely unlikely that an appropriately connected cycling network could be achieved without astronomical costs. City staff noted that a significant amount of infrastructure would need to be built to put bike lanes on side streets, including additional land acquisition, and construction disruptions to local residents. These same city staff have already spent years researching and collecting data on the best places to put high-impact bike lanes in accordance with Toronto\u2019s long term strategic plans. If there were better places to put bike lanes, they wouldn\u2019t be where they are. If the province has to review all new bike lane installations to replace these existing ones (requiring extra staff and time), I again question the financial responsibility of this government given such redundancy and red tape.\nEnvironmental Protection\nBill 212 also seeks to provide exemptions from Environmental Impact Assessments for the Highway 413 Project. Having studied and completed these in university, I understand how time consuming even small ones are. However, they are a vital part of ensuring that we do not cut corners and cause undue environmental damage with our infrastructure projects.\nOntario\u2019s own Provincial Climate Change Impact Assessment, uses the government\u2019s own data to show that Ontarians\u2019 food, homes and health are at very high risk of harm within the next few decades \u2014 particularly if responding and adapting to a rapidly-changing climate doesn\u2019t happen immediately. Shirking EIAs to pave over more of Ontario is an irresponsible and short-sighted measure that will impact our children and grandchild long after we are gone. Again I say, I\u2019d rather be on a train enjoying the scenery while I read a book than driving on yet another concrete scar across our beautiful province. Let the government invest in mass transportation solutions that make sense and do less harm to the environment.\n",

        "comment":"Ontario is experiencing rapid population and economic growth, particularly in urban centres and surrounding regions. This growth demands a modernized approach to integrate land use and transportation planning to accommodate increased development while maintaining the ability to move people and goods effectively. On a municipal level, cities are responsible for providing safe and efficient transportation networks for all users. Cities achieve this by using a variety of tools available to build wisely and maintain effective, affordable and connected transportation networks:\n\u2022\tcities are obligated and committed to provide public service facilities, including roads and active transportation corridors with a goal to reduce traffic and create safe roadways that include multiple options including walking, cycling, public transit and driving;\n\u2022\tbike lanes are an integral component of a connected system that supports inclusive and complete communities in accordance with the direction of provincial policies; and,\n\u2022\tbike lanes are a tool to help ensure that road design is convenient, equitable and provides options for people to access their daily needs.\nProper planning for growth is an essential service municipalities must provide for the benefit of all people living in Ontario. Without careful planning the increasing development could:\n\u2022\tcompromise the integrity of existing transportation networks;\n\u2022\tlead to increased congestion, reducing the efficiency of transportation corridors, goods movements and transit;\n\u2022\terode environmental sustainability, including impacts on green spaces, agricultural lands, cultural heritage and waterways;\n\u2022\tcreate challenges for municipalities in balancing infrastructure investments with growth needs; and,\n\u2022\tadd to a growing asset base of infrastructure for which municipalities are not able to sustainably afford the full lifecycle costs of maintaining those assets.\nBill 212 introduces measures contrary to the principles of good planning, including those in Environmental Assessment Act, municipal Official Plans and the Provincial Policy Statement. The proposed Bill establishes an additional bureaucratic layer for infrastructure improvements, contrary to Provincial initiatives to reduce red-tape. The proposal will restrict municipalities\u2019 ability to plan, design and implement safe multi-modal transportation systems in accordance with community-developed and Council-approved visions and priorities.\nTo support growth while still moving people and goods effectively, Bill 212 should be revised to:\n\u2022\treinforce municipal authority to align development with existing transportation networks;\n\u2022\tsupport municipal initiatives to encourage travel by transit and active transportation, recognizing these modes are more cost effective and more efficient in the long term;\n\u2022\tprioritize policies that support investment in transit infrastructure and active transportation, ultimately with a goal of building communities with reduced car dependency; and,\n\u2022\tmaintain protection of natural and cultural heritage features through a strong and robust environmental assessment process for major highway corridor projects.\nBill 212, in its current form, undermines the very transportation and land-use planning principles necessary to support Ontario\u2019s growth. To ensure sustainable development, the legislation must be amended to reinforce integrated planning, preserve strategic transportation networks, and align growth with economic, social and environmental objectives.\nThe need for a rethink of this Bill is reinforced by the outpouring of statements and positions being released by countless organizations representing  the many professional fields that grapple with the intersection of land use planning, infrastructure investments and planning our transportation systems daily. We support the positions to revisit this Bill put forward by the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, the Canadian Institute of Transportation Engineers, the Ontario Traffic Council, the Association of Ontario Municipalities, the Ontario Public Health Association, Good Roads, the Ontario Association of Architects, the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects, and countless municipalities across the Province of Ontario.\nCity of Peterborough staff would be happy to assist provincial officials in making improvements to Bill 212 that would achieve the stated goal of reducing gridlock through evidence-based approaches. Further, we would be willing to assist the Province with development of new policies and programs to support municipalities in their efforts to plan and build efficient and connected transportation networks for all users.\n",

While I understand the importance of improving infrastructure, this Act raises significant concerns about environmental protection, community engagement, and public accountability.\nEnvironmental Concerns:\nThis Act disregards critical environmental safeguards. Wetlands in the Greater Toronto Area are already essential for minimizing flooding and mitigating climate risks. Paving over these natural defenses without thorough environmental reviews will cause irreparable harm to ecosystems, endangering both human health and local wildlife. Accelerating highway construction without proper study risks amplifying flood risks and destroying habitats critical to Ontario's biodiversity.\nAdditionally, investing in expansive highway construction contradicts Ontario\u2019s commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Public funds should be directed toward sustainable transit systems and renewable energy infrastructure that align with climate action goals rather than perpetuating reliance on car-centric development.\nMunicipal Overreach and Inequity:\nOntario municipalities are already struggling financially, leading to eroded trust in government decision-making. This proposed legislation further undermines local governance by granting the provincial government sweeping powers to bypass municipal bylaws. This overreach ignores the unique needs of communities across the province and centralizes authority with an out-of-touch government at Queen\u2019s Park.\nThis inequity is particularly concerning for cities outside the Greater Toronto Area, including Ottawa, Sudbury, North Bay, Thunder Bay, and Sault Ste. Marie. Time and time again, provincial investments disproportionately benefit Toronto while municipalities in other regions are neglected. This Act not only strips local governments of their authority but also fails to provide meaningful resources to address infrastructure needs across Ontario.\nProperty Rights and Fairness:\nThe removal of legal protections for property owners is deeply troubling. Eliminating the right to appeal expropriation timelines under the Expropriations Act undermines fairness and leaves individuals vulnerable to undue hardship. Landowners deserve the ability to protect their interests and negotiate timelines without the looming threat of accelerated government action.\nConclusion:\nIn its current form, the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 sacrifices environmental protection, public accountability, and local decision-making in favor of hastened timelines. I urge the Ministry of Transportation to reconsider this legislation and instead pursue infrastructure solutions that respect Ontario\u2019s natural ecosystems, empower municipalities, and prioritize sustainable development for all regions of the province.\n",

Environmental Defence has shown that this project will destroy over 400 acres of environmentally sensitive land.\nIn addition to environmental damage, Bill 212 promotes car dependency by removing essential bike lanes. These lanes aren\u2019t just for cyclists\u2014they make our streets safer for everyone, reduce traffic congestion, and help lower emissions. They also boost local economies, as businesses on bike-friendly streets benefit from increased foot and bike traffic. Removing this infrastructure will make our cities less accessible and less sustainable.\nHighway 413 will cost over $8 billion\u2014a staggering amount for a project that won\u2019t reduce gridlock. Decades of research show that building more highways only leads to more cars on the road, worsening traffic and emissions. Ontario should focus on expanding public transit and cycling infrastructure, which deliver far greater economic and environmental benefits.\nBill 212 is not the solution Ontario needs. I urge you to abandon this legislation and instead focus on sustainable, forward-looking transportation policies that benefit all Ontarians.\n",

        "comment":"Hello as a permanent resident for the last year of Canada, working in the advertising technologies industry, one of the great draws of Toronto was its versioning cycling culture. This great city design was one of the things that drew me to move to Canada from the United States. This draw of talented professionals is now endangered by the premier who claims to be focussed on increasing business in Ontario.\nAdditionally, the reach of this bill goes against cities rights to self-determination. Wow, constitutionally the province can overrule cities the cities, and the people that live in them have a right to determine how their roads sidewalks by lanes transit, and any other infrastructure is executed. It only makes sense that the people that have to live every day with these decisions Are the ones who get to make them. It should not be determined by those who happen to commute through certain neighborhoods. While the need to accommodate multiple types of transportation is a parent the benefit of having multi Moto main thorough affairs is greatly apparent to me as I commute through the city daily , I make daily use of the bike lanes, particularly on poor and University additionally the proposal to use side streets as bike lines either would make cycling a secondary form of transportation which it is not or would put cyclist intermixing with traffic, causing even greater congestion, potentially, though of vehicular cycling are much greater to the cyclists and then the drivers . Cycling can be efficient because cycles are space efficient but they are so space efficient that 70 or 80 cyclists an hour in each direction of a bike claim are almost unnoticeable 70 or 80 cars an hour take up a tremendous amount of space. And if we look at the side streets of Toronto , there are almost no side streets that run the length of lower East west or university north south in fact in those examples there are zero side streets that are suitable for that. To make Mike lanes through side streets viable, we will have to use as we did for cars eminent domain to knock down  Houses in neighbourhoods to make straight efficient bike lines. Now I am not really proposing we do that but we have done much more destructive options in order to accommodate drivers.\nThe lowered amount of space from the bike lanes is quite minuscule, and it is shown that more lanes do not typically improve traffic flow. In fact, it could be seen that having fewer lanes can make drivers pay more attention and react quicker because there are fewer distractions coming in from other lanes. Additionally, there is the discussion of cost ultimately vehicle taxes, and gas taxes are insufficient to cover the cost of roads in order to make this plan work. It may be necessary to implement tolls on city streets or raise property taxes. Since property taxes are a major revenue stream that is used for roads and mini cyclist, pay property taxes, and of course sales taxes, which are used  For roads logically follows that cyclist should get cycle lanes. Additionally, the biggest logic is that for everyone who is on a bicycle there is a good chance that they could be driving a car and we know that the biggest driver how much traffic there is is how many drivers there are.\nBike lanes, especially on these main thorough fairs, greatly improve safety make Toronto and more attractive city for hard-working highly skilled professionals and save lives and infrastructure cost. Getting rid of them and causing the province to interfere with Toronto and every other municipalities right to determine how their infrastructure is created is a horrendous and something that we will surely regret. Please do not pass this bill. It will not do anything that it says in the title, and it will needlessly endanger the lives of cyclists.\n",

        "comment":"Hi There,\nIt disappointed me when I first heard the news that the Province was considering removing bike lanes. As a resident of Toronto, with a car, the bike system in Toronto is still my favourite way to commute around the City. When I'm travelling within the City, I use the bike system, before driving and before public transit. My boyfriend bikes every day to and from work with lanes along the road through his whole journey. We love how bike friendly the City is with the bike lanes and feel extremely safe biking here, which plays a significant role in our decision to use biking in the City as our main form of transportation.\nIf we reduced the amount of lanes, I may resort to calling more Ubers or begin driving (which doesn't help with the traffic issue). We want to promote healthy ways of commuting around the City and find alternative solutions to traffic issues. Possibly reducing public transit costs, or removing street cars?!! We shouldn't be taking away bike lanes after we spent so much work and money putting into the City in the first place.\nThanks for listening. I hope this made a little bit of difference!\n",

Not only will this bill add more red tape to municipal governments, but the bike lanes in Toronto were approved by democratically elected local representatives. Bike lanes are what Toronto wants and has voted for. Bike lanes make streets safer for all road users. As a mother, I much prefer bloor street with bike lanes. I feel safer taking my kids on bloor street to shop\/go to a restaurant with less traffic speeding by right next to the sidewalk. I also use the bike lanes to get to work and removing them will put me in danger. Bloor, University, and Yonge street should be main streets and not highways for the rest of the province to get downtown faster.\nThis bill is a distraction and is based on politics and ideology instead of facts and evidence.  It will do nothing to ease congestion and will only make congestion worse. The province should focus on their responsibilities like housing, healthcare, and education instead of municipal matters. I am deeply disappointed in this bill and urge the Ford government to reconsider this bill and prioritize safety, sustainability, and livable communities.\n",

        "comment":"Canadians don't need more infrastructure for personal automobiles. What they do need is more alternatives to get people out of cars so that traffic congestion can be eased. Bike lanes are necessary urban infrastructure and are good for the local economy. It is much easier to bike up to a store than it is to drive, park and then shop. In reality, large amounts of sales are lost due to car-centric urbanism. Cars are just not well-suited to urban environments unless they are there for utility and\/or business. They are certainly incompatible when the road is saturated with them. The limited space on tight urban streets is quickly filled up due to amount of area a single vehicle occupies. It is preposterous to believe that adding more lanes is going to do anything for very long, as this will simply induce demand and the new space will fill up and we will back to the same old problem, now with double the volume. We need transportation solutions that allow the largest volumes of people to be moved with as little space as possible to be prioritized. Bike infrastructure is one of those solutions and a comprehensive network of protected bike lanes will allow people of all ages to traverse the city with ease at a low cost. Investing in better public transit on top of this will also work wonders in improving travel times.\nBeyond this, this act will save no one time. Highway 413 is going to be a colossal waste of taxpayer money. What Premier Ford should do is right the wrongs of his predessors and buy the 407 back for drivers or do whatever is necessary to reduce or outright eliminate tolls. The 407 is underutilized during most of the day and sits fully built and ready to accept traffic. It is my understanding that congestion is costing Canadians 10 Billion dollars annually which means that we need a solution as soon as possible. The 407 will allow for instant traffic relief on the 401 and other major highways. The Bradford Bypass is a slightly better idea but I believe it is still flawed. The 407 would effectively do the same job as the Bradford Bypass, again, already built and ready with large capacity.\nPremier Ford, your bill is self-serving to yourself and those who would benefit from its implementation. But it does not benefit most Canadians. It is going to cost them a lot of money for little, of any gain. And in the case of bike infrastructure, it is going to cause many deaths that could have been avoided. Someone's cherished family member will be killed by this bill. Stop pretending Premier. This is not going to save us time or money. It is just going to cost us our tax dollars and our loved ones. I urge you to hire urban planners and those who understand how to build loveable, livable, enviable cities.\nI know you stand to gain a lot from this bill but it's going to hurt your fellow countrymen and women. You can still make the right choice and drop this bill. Say no to your rich friends and go back to the drawing board. You can still gain our respect by making the tough choices no one wants to make. Buy back the 407. Invest in GO expansion to further accelerate our regional train service. Consider a GO train service between Bramalea GO and Pickering GO with transfer points and other stations along the CN corridor. And for God's sake, do not remove bike infrastructure. Add to it and watch the local economy boom. People will have more money in their pockets to spend if less of it is being spent on cars!\nAsk any financial advisor: cars are a bad investment!\n",

        "comment":"This is an irresponsible Bill that will not improve gridlock across Ontario, especially in Toronto. Our over reliance on cars, and designing cities that only work for cars, makes gridlock worse. There is no way out of congestion by planning for more cars. The phrase \u201cif you build it they will come\u201d applies for both bike lanes and vehicular lanes. This bill will not mean that the existing amount of cars on the street will get more space- this will just result in more people having to drive and the road will end up with the same (if not more!) congestion that was there and sparked this Bill. If your goal is to reduce gridlock, we need to make transportation planning choices that encourage a more even mode split, and promoting safe and separated bike lanes is one way to do so. I cycle around Toronto, but not when there is no bike lane. When you take them out (or make them difficult to build) you take away a plausible mode choice for me. And that will put me in my car with the rest of us that \u201cinterested but unsure\u201d about cycling to get around.\nAlso- the amount of fatalities and serious injuries caused by collisions between cyclists and vehicles is unignorable. As our provincial government, you should be concerned with the safety of your constituents, yet that will be deprioritized through the passing of this Bill. It is terrible to think this government cares more about the commute time of someone in a car than the life of someone on a bike. Even for those who don\u2019t bicycle- bikelanes make walking around safer- especially at intersections- where drivers may be more attune and aware than in roadways without a bikelane. In addition, the environmental impacts of Highway 413 would be detrimental to ALL Ontarians.\nThis bill is, at its core, a fundamental misunderstanding of transportation planning and will result in worse cities and towns for everyone if passed.\nThe future of our Province is not in catering to the car- we\u2019ve had nearly 70 years of that- and we need to be more progressive (and think outside of the car) to actually make better transportation!\n",

        "comment":"I have a few concerns regarding Bill 212, especially the Oct 31st update that proposes the removal of bike lanes.\n1.)\tFord frequently mentions wanting to save the tax payers money. So, why is he wasting my money and the money of others to remove much-needed bike lanes? As statements like \"getting drivers where they need to go faster\" suggest, Bill 212 favours drivers. However, drivers are not the only tax payers in this province. I am tax payer who does not drive and this bill does not address my needs. The Ford government\u2019s limited car-centric vision signals a larger issue: The issue is not cars needing more lanes, but rather the lack of government funding for public mass transportation like trains and buses. As a tax payer, I also need ask: What are the projected costs for road maintenance on highways and city streets with increased traffic?\n2.)\tThe Ford government's proposal is not guided by data or research. Studies show that bike lanes reduce congestion and generate more business for local business (https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/media\/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026). There is no clear and evidenced backed connection between reducing bike lanes and increasing traffic flow in cities and on highways. However, as the linked source shows, there are some very good reasons (including road safety AND INCREASED TRAFFIC FLOW) to keep bike lanes.  Ford\u2019s government has either read this research and decided to disregard it because it doesn\u2019t suit their plan or his government doesn\u2019t care enough to read it. Both are unacceptable for elected officials who are meant to represent all peoples of Ontario. This brings me to point 3.\n3.)\tIt cannot be overlooked that adding the removal of bike lanes to Bill 212 is Ford pandering to his base and this decision targets and discriminates against those who live in Toronto; specifically, Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. This discrimination is further amplified by the punitive measure of requiring the City of Toronto to bear the cost of removing these lanes. The removal of bike lanes is not only poor urban management and costly, it is also the peak of pettiness. However, this is not surprising. Let\u2019s not forget that Premier Ford and his government have a history of making decisions out of self-interest rather than integrity. Part of this history was Premier Ford\u2019s unilateral decision to sell off the Greenbelt to property developers with whom he seems to have had personal ties (https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/ont-greenbelt-timeline-1.6974715). Bearing this in mind, further inquiries need to be made into Premier Ford\u2019s ties with those who will undertake construction work if Bill 212 is passed. Is Premier Ford\u2019s goal to also create potential avenues of income for himself by taking honorary board seats with any of these companies in retirement? As sign of good faith, would Premier Ford sign a legally binding document that he will take no such seats and will in no way financially benefit from the proposed changes of Bill 212?\nBill 212 is myopic. It is populist pandering. It is not good, long-term planning. It will prove to be both a waste of time and money for all.\n",

Peel Region staff have comments and questions regarding various aspects of the legislation.  These include:\n\u2022\tPriority highway projects potential impacts on the environment\n\u2022\tPriority highway project potential impacts on Peel Region infrastructure\n\u2022\tUtility relocations\n\u2022\tExpropriation related provisions\n\u2022\tMiscellaneous\nOf primary importance to Peel Region is the protection of its water, wastewater and stormwater assets, Regional roads and Public Sector Network (fibre optic communications) in relation to priority highway projects.  Peel Region staff\u2019s specific comments and questions on the Building Highways Faster Act (BHFA) are outlined below. Please note that the following comments are provided by Peel Region staff and may be considered by Regional Council for endorsement at a later date.  If additional or differing comments are provided through a Council resolution, they will be forwarded to the Ministry for consideration.\nExpedited Construction for Priority Highway Projects Potential Environmental Impacts\nWhile Peel Region appreciates the need to build and expand highways in a timely fashion to accommodate current and future growth in Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Greater Toronto Area, designated priority highway projects are significant undertakings that could have impacts on the health and the environment of the surrounding community and environment as well as affect Peel Region\u2019s ability to plan, design and build future public works utilities and infrastructure.\nAny highway project designated as a priority could be exempt from the Environmental Assessment (EA) process and subject to an expedited assessment process. This is the case for Highway 413 under the proposed Highway 413 Act, which is also part of Bill 212. As a result, expedited EAs may not allow for a solid understanding of the environmental impacts and mitigation strategies (i.e. air quality study) and community concerns regarding the impact on air quality and health, especially for those living or working near highway construction sites, may go unaddressed due to the fast-tracking of these projects.\nPeel Region values MTO\u2019s commitment to mitigate environmental impacts and address local concerns on a project-by-project basis and that construction activities will be undertaken in a manner to minimize noise levels and reduce impacts to the community. Should 24 hour, construction be permitted for priority highway projects, the Ministry should produce and publish a mitigation plan to address the negative health impacts from construction such as noise pollution and poor air quality that can be aggravated by increased traffic and congestion in the project area. Moreover, construction activities should be undertaken in a manner to minimize and reduce impacts to the Region\u2019s infrastructure and budget.\nPriority Highway project impacts on Peel Region infrastructure\nAllowing expedited construction for priority highway projects, like Highway 413, may also impact Peel Region\u2019s ability to plan, design and build future public works utilities and infrastructure.  If passed, the BHFA would allow the Minister to accelerate receipt of infrastructure information, such as the location of underground utilities, as well as utility relocation and property access and acquisition. Accelerated utility relocations would impact the Region\u2019s ability to appropriately design any changes to our utility systems and to secure necessary and appropriate lands or easements required for relocations. Peel Region staff comments specifically regarding utility relocations are outlined in the next section.\nPeel Region staff request that MTO consult Peel Region at the very onset of design for all early works projects to coordinate all roads, stormwater and existing water and wastewater assets. The proposed early works may have a major impact to Peel Region\u2019s underground assets that may require relocation or rehabilitation of pipelines prior to the proposed early works occurring.\nAccelerated property access and acquisition could impact Peel Region\u2019s typical real estate policies, procedures and best practices, impacting our ability to appropriately circulate any dispositions to other utilities, municipalities, and entities such as the school boards prior to those lands being taken by the Province.\nPriority Highway projects could also impact the delivery of infrastructure construction projects that are already in the pipeline. Peel Region has identified the following questions\/comments:\n\u2022\tWhat will happen to those infrastructure construction projects that have already been awarded and will be commencing and designated as a priority?\n\u2022\tWill priority be given to finalize those projects that have already been awarded?\n\u2022\tSome utility projects have seen significant expenditures throughout the different planning\/design\/implementation phases. What would happen with that initial design\/planning time\/funding invested into those utility projects already underway?\nUtility Relocations and Rehabilitation Stemming from Priority Highway Projects\nThe Minister may require a utility company to take up, remove or change the location of utility infrastructure if, in the opinion of the Minister, the taking up, removing or changing in location is for the purposes of a priority highway project.  As Peel Region is a utility provider of water and wastewater services, it is impacted by the provision.\nPeel Region staff have comments, concerns and questions regarding the utility relocation provisions in the BHFA, as outlined below:\n\u2022\tThe BHFA, if passed, would move from a court-driven appeal process to an expedited appeal process through the Minister of Transportation for disputes on MTO notices for utility relocations on priority highway projects.\n\u2022\tThe change to the appeal process would potentially impact on Peel Region if the Ministry were to expropriate lands owned by the Region to building future infrastructure. The expedited appeal process would limit Peel Region\u2019s ability to protect Region-owned properties as the property requirements are substantial for highway infrastructure and this could have negative impacts on existing facilities on Region-owned properties and could impact the ability to develop vacant Region-owned lands for future facilities.\nIt could also create a situation where Peel Region would not have the appropriate lands to relocate its water and wastewater infrastructure and MTO relocating Peel\u2019s infrastructure to another location without the knowledge and expertise for the relocation and installation of water and wastewater utilities, which are critical to Peel residents.\n\u2022\tThe proposed amendments also provide authority for the Minister to cause work to be done if the utility company fails to undertake the relocation.  Peel Region staff request clarification around the Ministry\u2019s interpretation of failure to relocate infrastructure, as the current language in BHFA is broad and general. It would be helpful to understand how much notice will be given to the utility owner and how many attempts will be made for challenging relocations, as well as who is responsible for the cost of the relocation. All infrastructure relocations are unique, where large feeder watermains and sewer forcemains are more challenging to relocate than small local mains. Accordingly, Peel Region would like to understand what concessions the Ministry of Transportation would make for these challenging relocations.\n\u2022\tThe ability to complete utility relocation work could be impacted by the availability of lands and easements to work and install utility infrastructure within, which would be beyond Peel Region\u2019s control. If lands are provided by others to Peel Region for such a purpose, then those lands may not meet our standards, increasing construction costs and complicating future maintenance activities. This could be problematic, namely for our water system, as we are governed by the requirements of our Municipal Drinking Water Licence.\n\u2022\tPeel Region staff further request that the topics of technical design standards and cost sharing principles, as discussed in its letter to the Ministry of Transportation dated June 3, 2024 (attached), would apply for all Peel assets that require relocation\/rehabilitation as part of the proposed early works.\n\u2022\tSome utility relocations may result in significant impacts for vulnerable communities (such as health care, child and youth care, and social care facilities) and relocation may require extra planning efforts for impact mitigation. Will the Ministry of Transportation consider time extensions for such scenarios?\n\u2022\tFinally, Peel Region staff have several questions regarding impacts of utility relocates on water and wastewater utility assets in particular:\no\tWhat is the current process for receipt of infrastructure information, and how will this new proposed process change the onus on the utility owner?\no\tWill the owner of the assets be granted the same powers to accelerate the process for utility relocation? For example, if the utility relocation requires an Environmental Assessment, does the utility owner have the right to follow the Highway 413 Act process if said infrastructure is in support of the Highway 413 construction?\nExpropriation Related Provisions\nPeel Region staff would like clarification on the following expropriation related provisions in the BHFA:\n\u2022\tWhere MTO has determined that property expropriation is necessary to support a priority highway project, the proposed legislation would, if passed, remove a property owner's ability to apply to a judge for a later date of possession under 39(3) of the Expropriations Act. This would help to ensure that the construction schedule for designated projects is not impacted, while the Ministry of Transportation would continue to work with property owners to determine appropriate expropriation and possession timelines. Staff request that the Ministry clarify whether this expropriation right extends to infrastructure owners carrying out infrastructure projects to support the BHFA.\n\u2022\tThe BHFA proposes to add offences and penalties provisions for individuals and corporations that obstruct Ministry of Transportation officials from accessing property to carry out field studies or refuse to relocate from expropriated property by the date of possession for designated priority highway projects. Penalties, in the form of fines, would mirror those in the Building Transit Faster Act for obstructing inspections. It would be helpful to understand if this right will extend to infrastructure owners for carrying out infrastructure projects to support the BHFA.\nMiscellaneous Provisions\nSection 9 (1) of the BHFA allows the Minister to authorize a person to enter a property to conduct a site inspection to the purposes of constructing a priority highway project.  Under 11(8) of the BHFA, the Minister may but is not required to compensate municipal property owners for any damages resulting from a Ministerial authorized site inspection of a property and can provide only partial compensation. Generally, the Minister is not required to compensate property owners for any activities done as part of the site inspection.\nIf the Minister is not required to compensate for damages, Peel Region may be at financial risk. In these circumstances, Peel Region recommends that the BHFA include a compensation framework for impacts of site inspections on existing municipal infrastructure (e.g., culverts, road intersections etc.) for highway priority projects.\nThe BHFA indicates it may override municipal by-laws that prevent or restrict the delivery of goods or services to the priority highway project, with certain exceptions continuing to apply (including weight restrictions on bridges, speed limits, and the closures of municipal roads for maintenance, construction, and special events) only where the Minister designates a part or whole of such a project in regulation. Provided that these provisions only pertain to portions of Regional roads being absorbed into MTO permit control areas related to new facilities only, Peel Region is not likely to be affected by this so long as it is still afforded the ability to regulate roadways under its jurisdiction outside of MTO permit control areas. It would be appreciated if the Ministry could confirm that the BHFA would only apply to their Controlled Access Highway limits, noting Peel\u2019s preference that work be staged such that Peel\u2019s Strategic Goods Movement Network provides options for goods movement across the Highway 413 corridor during construction.\nConclusion\nPeel Region staff once again appreciate the opportunity to comment on Building Highways Faster Act, 2024 with the intent of improving the legislation so that Peel Region can continue to provide housing-related infrastructure while facilitating the building of priority highway projects to meet future growth.\n",

        "comment":"I oppose Bill 212 in its entirety, for the following reasons. I am opposed to any fast-tracking of the proposed highway 413 or hwy 427, hwy 410 extensions through exemptions from a full Environmental Assessment process. I am speaking today through the lens of a young farmer who farms in the proposed path of the highway, and as a Rural Planning and Development graduate student. Environmental Assessments are an important part of the planning process that allows officials to make a proper cost-benefit analysis, plan the route and construction by mitigating impacts, and ultimately allow for an informed decision on whether the project is acceptable or whether alternatives are better. Without this, the project may be more costly and far more impactful upon Ontarians in the long run. There is no acceptable reason in this day and age why any project, especially a government led one, should be exempt from proper process. If the project has merit, it should pass through the proper channels without problem. If it does not have merit, it will not. It should be judged as all other projects should be judged. Environmental assessments are in place to safeguard the public from poor planning and decision making. To exempt any project from the law amounts to injustice against our communities.\nThe justification behind Hwy 413 is also suspect to begin with, and has not been backed by sufficient evidence for choosing a new highway over cheaper and less environmentally impactful alternatives, such as regional rail investment and other transit investments.\nFurther, I am also opposed to any measures that expedite the expropriation act. People should have as much time as is fit to seek appropriate legal counsel, and have the right to protest expropriation within their own home.\n",

        "comment":"I strongly oppose Bill 212 and urge the province to withdraw the proposed amendments.\nThe bill undermines the principles of local governance and decentralized decision-making, which are foundational to a healthy democracy and the effective management of cities. This legislation imposes top-down control, removing decision-making power from local governments and communities, and prioritizing motor vehicle traffic over public safety, economic well-being, and environmental sustainability.\n1. Local Business Impacts\nLocal businesses thrive when their communities are accessible. Bike lanes bring customers and employees to businesses along key corridors, such as Yonge and Bloor, where bike access is critical. Bill 212 would reduce bike access, which in turn harms local economies by limiting consumer and employee mobility. For example:\nBusinesses on Yonge Street would lose, on average, half of their potential customers arriving by bike.\nBusinesses on Bloor West would lose, on average, 56% of their potential bike customers.\nThis bill disregards the importance of local decision-making in fostering a thriving local economy. By restricting access for over 600,000 people who rely on bikes to reach essential services and destinations, the province would make it harder for people to support businesses and access jobs, healthcare, schools, and entertainment. The long-term economic consequences of this bill on small businesses and neighborhoods would be severe, limiting their growth and vitality.\n2. Undermining Local Decision-Making\nBill 212 centralizes control over infrastructure decisions, taking power away from municipalities and imposing unnecessary bureaucracy. This contradicts the core conservative principle of decentralization, which holds that decisions should be made as close to the people as possible. Local governments, guided by their unique knowledge of community needs and priorities, are better equipped to determine what infrastructure best serves their citizens.\nThe financial burden of removing bike lanes on major streets like Bloor, University, and Yonge is estimated at $48 million, a direct cost to provincial taxpayers. Rather than empowering municipalities to make informed decisions, the bill forces cities to reverse investments in sustainable transportation that have already been made, creating unnecessary costs and logistical challenges.\n3. Safety of Vulnerable Road Users\nThe bill\u2019s failure to prioritize safety for cyclists represents a clear disregard for the responsibility that local governments have in protecting their citizens. Municipalities, like Toronto, are best positioned to address the unique needs of their communities, including ensuring safe and accessible transportation options for all. By stripping cities of their ability to manage bike lanes, Bill 212 effectively ignores the importance of local context, where bike infrastructure plays a vital role in promoting road safety and public health.\nEvidence from local health experts, including 120 physicians and researchers, shows the crucial role of bike lanes in reducing accidents and promoting active transportation. Removing these lanes not only puts cyclists at risk but also undermines the very local strategies that aim to improve safety for all road users.\n4. Impacts to Farmland and Natural Habitats\nBill 212 also includes provisions to fast-track Highway 413, which would directly impact Ontario\u2019s Greenbelt and undermine local environmental protections. This approach disregards the decentralized decision-making process that has enabled communities to protect their natural resources and limit urban sprawl. The construction of Highway 413 would harm vital ecosystems, destroy agricultural land, and increase carbon emissions, further complicating efforts to address climate change and maintain a sustainable environment for future generations.\nInstead of prioritizing highways over transit and active transportation infrastructure, the province should work collaboratively with municipalities to develop solutions that reduce congestion, protect the environment, and promote sustainable growth.\nConclusion\nBill 212 represents a troubling shift away from local decision-making and decentralized governance. Rather than stripping municipalities of their ability to make informed decisions based on local needs, the province should empower them to implement transportation, environmental, and economic policies that reflect the values and priorities of their communities. Local governments, not provincial mandates, are best suited to address the diverse needs of Ontario\u2019s cities and ensure safe, sustainable, and thriving communities.\n",

        "comment":"I am a Registered Professional Planner, specializing in Transportation Planning with nearly 10 years of experience working for both public and private sectors in Ontario. I, along with all of my colleagues, are absolutely opposed to the proposed changes under Bill 212, for several reasons.\n1) The political theatre created around the inclusion of bike lane changes into this bill is not only fundamentally dangerous for mobility and WILL undoubtedly result in an increase in congestion, reduction in road safety, and increase in deaths and serious injuries.. but it also furthers the politicization of mobility as a fundamental service. In an era of increased polarization, basic infrastructure should be immune to politics and determined based on facts not feelings.\n2) I urge MPPs see that the range of experts and professionals opposed to Bill 212 far exceeds transportation planners, traffic engineers, and road safety professionals.\nSafe streets and bike lanes have multi-disciplinary (and positive) implications across public health, emergency services, educators, data and tech, business owners, and are critical tools to activate the public realm for community building. The elimination of bike lanes and increased red tape will cause significant harm to communities across Ontario who are looking to activate their public spaces, reduce transportation costs on households, and rejuvenate their main streets.\n3) It is a disgrace that the main effort of this bill to eliminate EA requirements for highways has been slid under the rug and hidden from public discourse over the last several weeks. It is shameful that the province, after repeated assurances that they will \u201cnot touch the greenbelt\u201d continues to push ahead to build a highway that none of the communities want, that will expand auto-dependant sprawl and worsen congestion across the region, and will pave over the very environment we need to protect to reduce the severity of flooding and effects of Climate Change in the densest region of the country.\nThere are plenty of areas across the province that would benefit from the development the premiere is intent on \u201cunlocking\u201d for his friends who purchased the land along the 413 alignment. Communities on the other side of the greenbelt who have developable space for housing and services. Concentrating everything around Toronto and investing in highways instead of rapid regional rail services is a policy rooted in the 1950s with no regard to the lessons learned from our mistakes over the last century that led us to the crippling congestion and unsustainable land use we experience today.\n4) Equal and accessible mobility has no gender, no race, and no political affiliation. At least it shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s simply about moving more people, more efficiently, safely, and sustainably through our communities. But somewhere in the past decade Mobility - and in essence anything related to environmental sustainability, accessibility, or equity - has unfortunately fallen victim to the left-vs-right culture wars, enveloping our whole society. There is no winning side, everyone loses when congestion worsens, active mobility is too dangerous, and when limited tax dollars spent on infrastructure are wasted to rip up the same because a few in power prefer to find a group to demonize for votes, rather than further invest in a proven solution.\n5) this has been said endlessly by others - but the data used by this administration to justify this Bill is fundamentally flawed, rooted in a desire to pad the pockets of the oil and gas lobby, and stoke anger among suburban voters who are not even directly effected by these bike lanes.\n6) If the province wants to fix congestion, then activate the uptown and midtown CP and CN rail corridors through Toronto (parallel to 407 and south of the 401) as indicated in the provinces own Regional Transportation Plan. Activate these for Rapid GO rail services with stations across the city to service trips that cross the region and not concentrate downtown. Expand the tracks and run the trains as we had them decades ago, and watch how many cars you can take off the 401 tomorrow.\nFinally, expand transit investment to an Ontario Line North (to Shepard or finch), Ontario Line western extension (up Dufferin to Downsview, or up Jane to Wonderland), accelerate construction of the Shepard east and west subway projects, extend the finch LRT south to Pearson and east to Scarborough, and fund the Waterfront east and west LRTs.  Outside Toronto, upgrade the Lakeshore BRT to an extension of the Waterfront LRT, increase funding for YRT operations, and extend daily GO service to London.\nThe possibilities are endless, but the current vision is limited to short sighted desires for votes against the public interest.\nFinally, I urge decision makers consider how this Bill is rightly opposed to the Provinces own planning legislation, and policies in communities across the province. This is anti democratic, will worsen congestion, hurt the environment by destroying the function of Greenbelt, and cost many lives.\n",

        "comment":"We don\u2019t need more highways to combat traffic and long travel times. Every study on increased lanes and more highways induces demand for car travel and we end up with more traffic and longer travel times. It\u2019s something we should have learned a long time ago with highway 401 and its endless expansion from its very inception. Studies on Highway 413 have shown that it will only alleviate traffic in the short term and then cause travel times to become much longer. We need to invest in alternative modes of travel to alleviate traffic.\nFinancially, these projects for Highway 413, the Bradford Bypass, and others are going to be super expensive and cost the taxpayers billions to construct and maintain. The 407 took 14 years to complete so it\u2019s most likely that we won't see highway 413 for decades even with everything the Provincial government is trying to expedite this process. At the end of it all we won\u2019t even save travel time.\nThe Premier has already been told by Ontarians and the Federal government that we don\u2019t want him paving through the Greenbelt. Instead of listening to any of us, the Premier and the PC\u2019s decided to write Bill 212 so included a small section on bike lanes (1.5 pages of the 28 page bill) and made that the talking point. That way the public wouldn\u2019t notice that he and his government put things in Bill 212 like exceptions to the Environmental Assessment Act so they could start construction of certain items before completing a limited environmental impact assessment. If the environmental impact assessment says by building these highways you\u2019re going to do major damage to the wetlands, protected native species and the environment at large, how are you going to fix that when the construction has already begun? Hide the assessment from the public under the new clause in Bill 212 that allows the government to keep it secret if they \u201ccontain information about sensitive natural or cultural heritage matters\u201d? Any environmental assessment is basically guaranteed to have information on sensitive or cultural heritage matters so I guess we\u2019ll never know the damage you\u2019ll do until it\u2019s far too late.\nI would also really appreciate the Provincial government being open about whether or not Highway 413 will be a toll road. What reason do you have for Bill 212 to include a clause to expedite the construction of broadband for highways if not tolls?\nThere seems to be a total disregard for municipalities and Ontarians in general in this bill. We don\u2019t want 24-hour construction and you shouldn\u2019t be able to override most municipal bylaws that ban or limit such practices. I also don\u2019t agree with more projects being given this priority status in the future. You can\u2019t just force highways and other construction projects through because that\u2019s what you want.\nIt\u2019s exhausting having to tell this government to just listen to the experts like engineers (see the response from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers) and Ontarians instead of just forcing through whatever they want to do for them and their buddies. It seems that if you don\u2019t like it then they\u2019ve thought of that too with increased fines for anyone who interrupts construction. Yet another part of Bill 212 I object to.\n",

The province should not be wasting time and resources introducing new bureaucratic red tape that micromanages municipalities.\nThe idea that removing bikes lanes will improve gridlock is not grounded in evidence.

The Premier is knowingly choosing to put the lives of Ontarians at risk by choosing to make cycling more dangerous. Removing existing bike infrastructure that cities have spent extensive time planning and constructing is also a gross waste of tax dollars.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is a short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and tauna, and as a floodplain\/natural flood control measure-forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn't care about the environment and is not serious about eliminating gridlock but instead cares more about the interests of developers and not the interests of Ontarians.\n",

After careful consideration, it is clear that this legislation fails to address its stated goal of reducing gridlock while introducing significant risks to Ontario\u2019s environment, economy, and public health.\nHighway 413, which is exempt from environmental assessments under this bill, will destroy crucial Greenbelt lands, including wetlands and farmland. These areas are vital for flood prevention, carbon storage, and biodiversity. Environmental Defence has reported that Highway 413 will pave over 400 acres of this protected land, irreparably harming our ecosystem. Exempting a project of this scale from proper oversight undermines the integrity of Ontario\u2019s environmental protections.\nFurthermore, the removal of bike lanes contradicts well-established principles of sustainable urban planning. Bike lanes improve traffic flow, promote safer streets, and reduce emissions by encouraging active transportation. They also provide economic benefits, as demonstrated by increased retail sales along bike-friendly corridors in Toronto. Removing this infrastructure will lead to more congestion and undermine local economies.\nThe financial cost of Highway 413, projected at over $8 billion, is another cause for concern. This money could be better spent on public transit, healthcare, and affordable housing\u2014areas that provide far greater economic and social returns. In short, Bill 212 prioritizes costly, outdated solutions over modern, sustainable alternatives.\nI urge you to reconsider this legislation.

        "comment":"I think that the government is really focusing on the wrong things with this bill.\nPart XII of the bill says that a municipality cannot create a bike lane on a highway or part of a highway unless it has been approved by the Ministry.\nIt is stated earlier in the bill that \"highway\" has the same meaning as in the Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act, where it is defined as \"a common and public highway, street, avenue, parkway, driveway, square, place, bridge, viaduct, trestle or any other structure incidental thereto, any part of which is intended for or used by the general public for the passage of vehicles and includes the area between the lateral property lines thereof\".\nThis part of the bill will be applied where the bicycle lane would reduce the number of marked lanes available for cars, meaning that this can be applied to almost any street in any municipality, which will waste an enormous amount of time and money when the Ministry has to review proposal after proposal for bike lanes.\nThe municipal governments are the ones who know their city and streets best and are the ones that should be making this type of decision, not the Ministry, whose employees may never have even seen the municipality whose bike lane they will be reviewing.\nDoug Ford is also planning to rip out bike lanes in Toronto, wasting the millions of dollars spent on building them in the first place, as well as millions more get the work of removing them done in order to speed up car commute by a few minutes, or seconds. I consider this as well as the money that will be spent reviewing all the bike lane proposals to be a very poor use of funds.\nAll that money could be used to focus on actually building planned LRT projects, improving train infrastructure, bus infrastructure, or many, many other options for public transit. We need more ways of getting people out of cars and onto busses, trains, and bikes. These all take up much less space than cars and will free up road space for drivers and make their commutes shorter because there will be fewer cars on the road.\nMore options for transit will also put money back in the pockets of lower income families, which could be critical for them. Being able to bike more often, or take the train or bus instead of driving everywhere will mean they can save huge amounts of money not having to pay for gas. They can drive their car when it is necessary and enjoy other methods of getting around when it is not. Instead, this bill will make it even harder to survive without driving.\nFewer cars on the road will also mean less maintenance is required for their upkeep, saving millions of dollars. Fewer cars also means less traffic on the 400 series highways, and less of a need to continue expanding them. The farmland, wetlands, waterways, etc. that will be damaged by the proposed 413 are much more valuable to Canada than another highway that will soon be clogged with traffic as well because we are not reducing people's need to drive everywhere.\nSpeaking for myself, the only thing holding me back from biking to work is that there is one stretch of incredibly busy road that is very dangerous for cyclists. I can get most of the way there safe in a bike lane, and if there was also a bike lane on this last stretch of road I would not hesitate to bike to work. There are many other people like me, and we should focus on building more bike lanes to get people out of cars and off the roads, reducing traffic and speeding up commute times for everyone instead of adding useless bureaucracy and making it harder to make the lives of commuters better.\n",

        "comment":"I believe a proposal to re-acquire Highway 407 would be more suitable to remediating passenger vehicle traffic congestion in the short-to-medium term through Southern Ontario. This would allow for work to to better develop active transportation and public transit solutions to traffic with a long term emphasis. People driving automobiles on its' own is not necessarily a bad thing - but in high density population centers and there is a point where there are simply too many cars to handle the volumes of traffic using these roads (particularly in Toronto). Removing pedestrian\/cycling\/transit infrastructure would take away some of the features that allow cities to thrive. Additionally, the removal of said existing infrastructure to re-develop more car lanes is short sighted. The issue will come back for residents to deal with once more |(due to induced demane), and proceeding this way would be short-sighted at best (as well as unnecessarily destructive).\nI also believe the development of a hew highway 413 would be highly counterproductive to long term environmental conservation and pollution reduction efforts. We should be looking to develop higher modes of transportation within and between Ontario cities, including getting the Eglinton Crosstown LRT system  working once and for all.\nBased on the above I state my opposition to this bill.

        "comment":"As a Scarborough resident who frequents downtown Toronto and North York City Centre, does not own a car (because I don't want to) and believes proteting our extremely valuable agricultural land is crucial for the province's future, I am STRONGLY opposed to bill 212.\nThis bill not only aims to accelerate and ease the construction of a highway, which are known for bein extremely disruptive, destructive, dangerous, and just generally bad places to be at, but also it disregards the need for public infrastracture prioritizing safer vehicles and pedestrians.\nThis bill disregards hundreds of thousands of people advocating for safer, pleasant and useful streets. Our streets are public domain, we have the right to use them as pedestrians, bikers and mobility-scooter users, cars have the privilige of using them, they are a guest in our street landscape but this has been lost in the last 80 years. For thousands of years we have used the streets as not only places to go through but places to go to. What makes the Danforth, Bloor, Yonge and most of downtown is the fact that they are so full of places to go to, instead of parking lots or lanes or traffic that only serve as a thoroughfare to out of city folks.\nIf you were really serious about the economy, you would not allow cars to dominate the transportation landscape, making it so more and more businesses need to buy parking lots or go bankrupt because not enough people live within walking or biking distance to them. Parking lots are a waste of space and money. Downtown Toronto and the City of Toronto's more walkable, mixed-used, low car areas are subdizing the suburbs, where kids are stuck in their cul-de-sacs, far away from their friends and hang-out spaces. If you were serious about caring about Ontarians and Torontonians, you wouldn't be limiting our mobility to cars, but expanding it to bikes, scooters, walking, public transit and anything else out there. It's not about limiting cars, that comes as a byproduct of giving pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders their space and priority. When you have privilige, equality feels a lot like oppression.\nAs an engineer and social safety advocate, this bill makes no sense, it feels like a government-controlling attempt at destroying our quality of life. This bill reads as a political move rather than a well-thought-out, well-structured, well-meaning, and sensible bill. Engineers, economists, TRAFFIC ENGINEERS, and a plethora of professionals disagree with this bill. Climate change disagrees with this bill. All the families of people who have lost their lives to a car accident disagree with this bill. This call for change is not about bikes or bike lanes, this is about enjoying our communities and bringing back common sense and science to our government.\nI plead, ask and demand that this bill is dropped completely and we let each jurisdiction in our province decide what makes their streets better. I unfortunately don't think this will happen, and the misinformation that have led the automobile-centric policy of Toronto and Ontario will persist, but I still hang onto a sliver of hope that the province will make the right decision, for my future kids, my friends, my family and all my neighbours and co-citizens.\nSafe streets save lives, it's just common sense.\n",

        "comment":"My comment is focused on the proposed Bike Lane Framework.\nAs a citizen of Ontario and a resident of Toronto for 10 years now, I am deeply concerned about the prospect of bike lanes in the city being removed. I beg the province reconsider this proposal; passing it in its current form would put lives at risk, including my own, and make this province a worse place in which to live.\nProvincial overreach and increased red tape\nPassage of this bill would increase red tape for municipalities across the province, making it more difficult to build critically needed infrastructure and improve cities. Decisions around transportation and city planning should be left to municipalities.\nWaste of taxpayer dollars and harm to small businesses\nRemoval of critical infrastructure such as the Bloor, Yonge and University bike lanes in Toronto would be a massive waste of taxpayer dollars at the hands of the province. Local businesses have seen an increase in sales\/customers since the installation of the bike lanes, and multiple BIAs have come out in opposition to this proposal.\nCyclist and pedestrian safety\nRemoval of these critical bike lanes would put lives at risk, full stop. I cycle to work daily and fear for my life even with bike lanes. A young woman my age, Alex Amaro, was killed by a driver on Dufferin Street in 2020. Her life could have been saved had there been a bike lane, and every day I fear that tomorrow this could be me. Countless studies show that narrower streets with fewer lanes of traffic and reduced speed limits are safer not only for cyclists, but for pedestrians and drivers as well. Human lives should always come first, full stop. Even if bike lanes did cause congestion (which they don't!), the safety of a city's residents is far more important than saving a few minutes in a commute. There's no comparison.\nPolicy founded in fact\nThe statistics that the province has cited around Bill 212 have been erroneous and shared without context. Yes, congestion has increased in big cities in the province, but that has kept up with the pace of population growth, not the installation of bike lanes. Bike lanes globally have been found to increase the number of cyclists, decreasing the number of motorists on the roads and decreasing congestion, or in the worst cases, not resulting in any change. Please listen to the advice of experts, including the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, on these issues. The removal of bike lanes will not help with congestion.\nEnvironmental impact\nOntario is also facing a climate crisis, and the province should be doing all in its power to fight against global warming and reduce emissions. The switch from motor vehicles to more sustainable forms of transit, including cycling, is key to solving the climate crisis. The province needs to encourage more cycling in order to protect our environment for generations to come, and removal of bike lanes is in direct contradiction to this.\nPassage of Bill 212 would be disastrous for the health and safety of the people of Ontario. This government must respect the lives of its constituents.\n",

While I understand the importance of infrastructure development, I believe the approach outlined in the bill raises significant concerns.\nFirstly, the expanded powers for expropriation without sufficient public consultation, as described in the Building Broadband Faster Act, 2021 and the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024, undermine landowners' rights and due process. Stripping protections such as hearings of necessity fails to balance infrastructure needs with community impacts.\nSecondly, the amendments to the Highway Traffic Act that restrict municipal authority over bike lane projects are a step backward for sustainable urban planning. Removing or limiting bike lanes compromises efforts to reduce emissions and promote safe, active transportation for residents.\nI urge the government to reconsider these provisions and ensure that infrastructure projects prioritize environmental stewardship, community input, and fairness.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n",

        "comment":"As a bike rider AND a driver, I am deeply concerned about bill 212 for a number of reasons: 1) our cities are suffering with traffic congestion, which has gotten worse since before the pandemic despite less commuting and likely owing to lower transit use. Adding MORE safe and affordable options to get around including safe, dedicated bike lanes will help ease congestion (look at Montreal that has seen traffic decrease by 10% and cycling increase by 28%. The change is visible: traffic has decreased in Montreal making for a much more pleasant and safe city for everyone including drivers but mostly importantly for those who live, visit and work in Montreal.) 2) taking away cycling infrastructure takes away options for a cities\u2019 most vulnerable: seniors, low-income and kids who can\u2019t or don\u2019t drive creating even less equitable cities at a time when urban living is at an all time high; I see many seniors and youth biking in my neighbourhood to school, work or for exercise. Bike lanes allow these users to safely travel without a car. 3) Transportation projects are YEARS in the making from studies to detailed engineering. Adding a layer of bureaucracy not only slows these projects, it threatens to eliminate funding or requires a complete redesign. Both of which will be MORE COSTLY and less effective in delivering any road work for cars or bike riders. 4) Cities are generators of majority of Canada's GDP but they are also places where people live, work and visit. Focusing on moving cars through a few neighbourhoods to save drivers who are travelling in secure, safe and comfortable vehicles to save a matter of MINUTES to someone's commute is antithetical to creating livable, sustainable and climate resilient cities. Removing bike lanes will either force more people into cars thus exacerbating the problem OR result in cyclists biking in car lanes creating opportunities for conflicts, accidents and less efficient movement for both cars and bikes. The province should be focused on solving the real crises: housing, healthcare and transit NOT spending tax payer money to remove millions in existing infrastructure for no demonstrable benefit.\n",

        "comment":"To whom it may concern,\nI have significant concerns with Bill 212 for serveral reasons - the ones I will highlight in this comment are concerns about the planned regulatory changes around bike lanes and the exemption of Highway 413 from environmental assessments.\nThe intention to 1) remove key bike lanes and 2) require the Minister to approve any new bike lanes that would remove a lane of traffic is misguided and ignorant. Bike lanes have emerged as a key piece of infrastructure that keep cyclists safe, and give drivers more confidence (separating cyclists from cars - it's safer for everybody!). The 1.2% statistic put forward by this government is fully incorrect - we have data on how many people ride bikes where bike lanes have been installed, and the numbers are much higher. I would encourage this government to actually review current data, and not use incorrect statistics to support bad policy.\nI personally ride my bike - to work, to play sports, to get places that are less well-served by transit (like the beach), to ride on trails, and to meet friends. I don't ride my bike every day, but it's an important option that I have. Removing bike lanes will take this option away from me, because I won't feel safe riding on the road without a bike lane. This bill is states that it will reduce gridlock and save \"you\" time, but what it's actually going to lead to is far more people choosing to drive when we could have actually biked. This will lead to FAR more gridlock and will cause more traffic than we already have.\nCities have actually done studies to understand this, and we know that gridlock in cities like Toronto is actually caused by 1) more people living in the city, and 2) the massive amounts of construction causing routes to be closed and redirected. It's not bike lanes. Again, bike lanes are getting more people out of their cars - bike lanes are helping to reduce gridlock and save us time.\nRemoving bike lanes will also be a massive waste of taxpayer money. The province has promised to foot the bill for municipalities to remove bike lanes. I am a citizen of a municipality, but I am also a citizen of Ontario. MILLIONS of our tax dollars are going to be spent on ripping up perfectly good roads, wasting all of the staff time that went into planning and installing the infrastructure in the first place. This is a disgusting waste of money and I find it completely offensive. Not to mention the months and months of time it will take to remove them, causing MORE TRAFFIC. I don't understand where the government's head is at in proposing this legislation. It doesn't make any sense once you actually look at the cost, and the implications.\nOnce these key bike lanes - Bloor, Yonge and University - are removed (leading to gridlock, massive waste of taxpayer money, and unnecessary deaths), cities will need to get Ministerial approval to ever build a bike lane again. I think the Minister has better things to do then to personally remove and reject or approve bike lanes. It is unacceptable to me that this would be the only way to approve new bike lanes - what this will do is effectively ban bike lanes. Again, people will die. More people will drive, causing more and more gridlock. Where is the logic?\nMoving on from bike lanes, this omnibus bill would exempt the Highway 413 project from environmental approvals. How is this allowed??! This is embarassing and will lead to so much destruction of valuable and important natural heritage. We are in a climate crisis, and destroying natural spaces drastically reduces our ability to be resilient to the impacts of climate change. I don't understand how this highway project can be exempt from our own laws. We are not in a \"highway emergency\" and yet the governnment is treating the highway like emergency measures (i.e. exempting it from respecting the law) are needed. I will be so deeply disappointed if this legislation passes as is. Please ensure the highway project is required to go through environmental assessments. This is just another way to erode our Greenbelt and it is unacceptable.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"Hello, I am a grade 10 student in the City of Toronto, and I believe that bike lanes are not slowing traffic whatsoever, but they are helping protect myself and other cyclists' lives. In addition to this I strongly disagree with the proposition of another highway (Highway 413) in the GTA as there are better solutions to traffic than paving over the supposedly protected Greenbelt, and ripping out the very infastructure that is in fact helping to reduce gridlock.\nAs a young cyclist myself, in the near 50 trips I have made to commute to and from my school, I have been run off the road once, wrongly yelled at well over 20 for \"not being allowed to be on the road\" [see first link], and nearly hit by aggressive drivers (especially on left turns) 7 times on my school commute alone. This didn't used to be such a problem because the road I mostly cycle on, Pharmacy Ave, had designated bike lanes that were ripped out under the Rob Ford municipal government. Since then, with wider lanes and faster and more aggressive drivers, the safety of pedestrians and cyclists has greatly declined. This is just my reasoning for personally wanting more and better bike lanes, but when researching this topic I came up on an article from the University of Toronto Faculty of Law [see second link] that explains that the removal of bike lanes will in fact increase gridlock in the City of Toronto, as it will encourage using cars as the main method of transportation which not only causes more low-occupancy vehicles on the streets, but it also causes more greenhouse-gas emissions from the extra cars on our streets which, I assume, is not what our Premier wants for the City. As I hope I have shown, this proposition in bill 212 does not help resolve gridlock whatsoever, and instead creates more unsafe conditions for the citizens of our city.\nTo help solve this issue of gridlock and safety, I propose that bike lanes are more encouraged, with more maintained trails off the road, and safer bike lanes on the road. Including these bike lanes in many City roads will not be a problem because the standard lane in the City of Toronto is approximately 10.5 feet wide, and the average Canadian car is only 5.75 feet wide. This means that cars have over 2 feet of clearance on each side, so if lane size was reduced it would leave plenty enough room for bike lanes, and it would encourage safer driving as drivers would be more cautious of clearance, causing naturally lowered speeds. The second part of my proposition is to enhance public transit in the City, because even though the current transit system is impressive compared to most Canadian cities, many other countries have much more advanced transit systems that don't have all the issues of the TTC. By fixing transit in Toronto, more people will be willing to take public transportation that efficiently moves people to their destination, causing even less cars to take up space on our roads. The final part of my solution to gridlock is creating a more coordinated construction, helping with better notice of road construction, and reasonable detours, to provide a simpler, and less chaotic driving experience for the citizens of Toronto.\nMy final issue with Bill 212 is the proposition of creating another highway to supposedly help reduce traffic on the 401. This issue should not even be a problem as we already have 2 400-series highways going through the city, and many other main arteries to increase what is supposed to be high-speed transportation. However one of our 2 biggest highways was for some reason privatized like Doug Ford wants to do with healthcare. This was arguably the biggest transportation mistake in the history of the City of Toronto because it caused a very large and useful road to become practically unused as drivers try to avoid the tolls going to a private company. This is the first main reason why traffic is so bad on the 401, but if the government manages to reclaim the highway or we wait until 2097, then traffic will be lessened by drivers who can now bypass the City instead of adding to traffic going through it. Unfortunately this can't be undone, but by building another highway in the greenbelt outside of the City, it provides more opportunity for urban sprawl to continue, just like it did with the 407, as developers create more large, expensive, single-family housing that is ruining farmland, and creating a higher market for housing. Overall I think the 407 will be another useless waste of taxpayer money, and  instead that large amount of money could be used for actually helpful solutions to not only solve gridlock, but also other major issues not only in the City, but also province wide.\nI hope you have understood the point I am trying to make, and hopefully this helps change your mind on the unnecessary bill that Doug Ford wants to pass as the unofficial mayor of the City of Toronto.\nThanks!\n",

        "comment":"Like many others, I disapprove of the proposed legislation. Overall, these changes are not based on empirical evidence, expert opinion, or justifiable rationale. The bike lane regulations will only inhibit municipalities in implementing safe transportation infrastructure and the public announcements on these changes have not used any research or study to warrant this consideration. As a civil engineer in transportation engineering and a certified road safety professional, I find this proposition by the government extremely disappointing, even disrespectful as it shows how little the government listens to experts.  The bike lane regulation is extremely vague in detail (example: \u2018diminish orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\u2019 could mean anything) and even suggests the province will get involved in a project case-by-case. This is extremely inefficient and will not help \u2018build highways faster\u2019. The poorly written bike lane legislation leads many, including myself, to determine that its addition is simply a distraction. The sweeping changes for the Highway 413, including its exemption from the EA act, is being done to force it through without due diligence and the proper checks and measures.  Highway 413 is another item without technical justification - it has already been proven it will not notably save travel time. Like the Greenbelt scandal, the only people to benefit from Bill 212 and Highway 413 are the developers\/big businesses along the corridor. Once again, the government are moving to benefit a group of developers to the detriment of the average Ontario resident.\n",

We need to do everything we can to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and this bill does exactly the opposite, by speeding up building new highways and removing bike lanes.\nBuilding new highways is such a massive waste of money and resources, and locks Ontario further into a car-dependent future. My spouse uses a car for work, and he cannot rely on public transit (he moves large amounts of equipment all over the province in order to do his job). My dad is physically disabled and often uses a car to get around (although he also bikes where there are safe routes). I am under no false illusions that we can do away with highways entirely. However building new highways will NOT make travel faster and easier - because of induced demand, it will have the opposite effect. We need to get more people out of cars and off highways, by investing in public transit, so that those who NEED to drive can do so.\nThe portion of this bill that deals with removing bike lanes is such a disgustingly transparent PR move. It has no basis in evidence, and will not accomplish the goals of reducing congestion or improving travel times. Instead it will only serve to put the lives of cyclists at risk - including my daughter who is 1 year old and travels in our cargo bike. I feel much more confident biking with her when we are in a protected bike lane, because of the amount of aggressive and distracted drivers in Toronto. But I'm not going to stop biking if this bill passes - without my own car, this is our main mode of transportation. Instead I will be forced to put our lives at risk, to do things like grocery shopping and visiting grandparents.\nThis bill also represents a massive overreach into municipal governance. Why does Premier Ford think that \"Queen's Park doesn't know best\" when it comes to accelerating building new housing in Ontario (https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/opinion\/contributors\/cities-cant-be-trusted-to-\u2026), but suddenly he's the expert on bike lanes and traffic congestion?\nI urge you to reject making my safety (along with my 1-year old daughter's safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, SIX people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community. Maybe someone can explain to the Premier about the difference between his uninformed opinions, and actual evidence!\n\"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe. You\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was.\"\u00a0That was the Premier back in 2017 on TVO's Political Blind Date.\nI'm deeply sad although not at all surprised to find out this was just hot air, and that in fact the Premier is completely willing to gamble with the lives of cyclists to score a few cheap points.\nUGH!\n",

This will only temporary relieve gridlock, until demand increases and traffic returns to its current state. The only way to really alleviate traffic congestion is to get people out of cars. I would like to see the Government invest in alternate forms of transportation, so that people can access convenient and affordable modes of transit beyond cars. The more people that can reliably and conveniently use transit and bike lanes, the fewer people will need to use a car to get around - especially in a city as big as Toronto.\nThe explicit inclusion of the plan to rip out existing bike infrastructure in Toronto is especially painful to see. I am a bike rider in Toronto and I use the protected bike lanes daily. Every time I get on my bike I wonder whether that will be the day I get hit by a car. At least the protected bike lane on Bloor provides me some more relief for part of my journey. Without these lanes I will be forced to decide whether getting somewhere quickly and afforadbly was more important than my safety.

It's good to enhance existing road arteries however let us not disturb the environmental balnce by building new ones that will mainly benefit the builders and contractors , all financed out from our tax dollars.

Bill 212 disregards the safety of these individuals, which is not only unacceptable; but dangerous.\nLimiting bike lanes undermines efforts to make our roads safer for all users. By encouraging more cycling and creating designated lanes, we protect cyclists, reduce traffic congestion, and make the streets safer for everyone \u2014 drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists alike.\nNot only that, but this Bill is completely anti evidence and anti best practice. No self respecting engineer or professional would every put their name on it. The government is skewing data, not consulting municipalities, and creating a culture war around fake facts. It's disheartening that the Premier is putting kids biking to school with parents or students finding an affordable way to get around at incredible risk to win an election and take attention away from the horrid environment destruction of hwy 413.\nOne of the biggest concerns with the proposed legislation is that it would limit municipalities\u2019 ability to make decisions based on their communities\u2019 specific needs. I highly doubt that highway designers with no local context from MTO or the Minister's office have the expertise to determine what's best on local roads.\nI urge the Government of Ontario to reconsider the proposed legislation and adopt a more forward-thinking and EVIDENCE BASED approach to transportation. Rather than reverting to outdated, car-centric policies THAT ARE PROVEN TO FAIL MISERABLY, we must invest in a diverse range of public transportation options, including cycling infrastructure, to make our roads safer and our cities more sustainable.\n",

This bill is an unfortunate overreach that will massively expand the power of Queen's Park beyond reasonable limits and unnecessarily encroaches on the proper realm of municipal governments.\nAs a resident of Ontario all my life, I have watched the provincial government endlessly interfere in the proper matters of municipal governments. This bill would strip over 400 municipalities of the ability to design their own streets, enshrining local values in the infrastructure they pay for. Going back to the forced amalgamation of Toronto and other large municipalities like Hamilton and Ottawa, the province has constantly disregarded local concerns. This bill is another step along that unfortunate path. If the province expects cities to thrive, cities must be allowed to make decisions about their design unimpeded by centralizing tendencies in Queen's Park.\nFurthermore, the rejection of impact assessments and environmental criteria leaves our local communities under protected and vulnerable to abuse. Without verifying that a project is feasible and balances concerns, grave impacts will be forced upon the most vulnerable.\nI ask that this law be rejected or amended such that local control and environmental protections are restored.\n",

        "comment":"They want to skip the environmental assesment and plow through the greenbelt (once again), they want to tear up bikes lanes, they want to make this proposed highway a toll road like the 407 which will ensure that no one uses it, it'll cost each taxpayer roughly an extra $1000 per year while likely only reducing average travel times by 30-60 seconds. Opposition parties and environmental defence estimate that the construction will cost roughly 10 billion. I feel that it is likely Ford will attempt to appropriate the federal contingency funds that he has been hoarding since the pandemic for the highway instead of putting it to use in his rapidly failing healthcare system which was their intended purpose.\nThis cost to the taxpayers would be ridiculous and frankly unconscionable when there are many cheaper options such as directing logistics\/transport trips to the 407 and subsidizing the tolls which would cost ~4 billion per year. If the premier was truly interested in reducing gridlock in a significant way then he would invest in infrastructure that gets people out of cars and off the road, improving our commuter train system by upgrading the fleet to electric engines, expanding the GO train network, subsidizing the TTC to allow them to improve their service quality, and obviously building MORE bike lanes! It would even make more sense to initiate a buy back of the minority stake of the 407 which I believe is something the Ford government has already considered. These options I mentioned have the added benefit of a much sooner possible start time as the construction of hwy 413 wouldn't be complete for at least a decade and we all know those proposal timelines are never accurate.\nOutside of that, it is a blatant publicity stunt by Ford to further secure the rural vote and it specifically contradicts his own words where he said in 2017 that \"we have to do everything we can to make sure there's never a death in the city. One death is too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\" If they force the removal of bike lanes in the province traffic deaths will rise undeniably. It is also just another way for him to put money in the pockets of his cronies that were involved with the greenbelt scandal.\nI think it's clear how terrible this decision will be if it goes through and how widespread the ramifications are. It will significantly impact the environment and do irreparable harm that we absolutely cannot afford to let happen. When it comes to the environment we are already fighting a losing battle and with the recent US election results and the inevitable damage they will wreak, it only becomes more clear that we cannot afford to give up any ground in this fight.\nOntarians say no to bill 212!\n",

        "comment":"The proposed act will do nothing to address the problems it seeks to solve.  The only way to reduce gridlock is to divert as many journeys as practical from private cars that are largely single occupancy to public and active transportation.  Removing cycle lanes from main roads detracts from this as it discourages individuals from taking a bike instead of driving if the only \"safe route\" is a circulatorous route that doesn't take them near where they are going or being forced to break the law and endanger pedestrians by riding on the sidewalk.  the argument that no one uses bikes in the winter is nonsense because toronto just set an new record for days above 7 Celsius disproving the notion that our winters are too harsh by people who are clearly only used to thinking of cycling as a recreational activity instead of a viable method of transport year round.  Premier Ford would be served better by dealing with broken promises he made in healthcare and allowing the midscale development that is needed to solve the housing crisis properly or getting the Finch and Eglington lines open instead of pocket mayoring with new impossible to fulfil promises.\n",

        "comment":"This proposal is not only going to cause danger to cyclists and all road users, it will also waste taxpayer dollars by not achieving its intended purpose of reducing traffic congestion. Nobody likes sitting in traffic - we can all agree on that. And cars are a necessary part of our modern life. However, if the government truly wanted to lessen driving times, the only proven way to do that is to get more people out of their cars. The proven way to do this is to make it more convenient and safer to ride a bike, walk, or take transit. There will always be some people who need to drive to get around, whether because of disabilities or their line of work, or multitudes of other reasons. But how nice would it be for those people if they didn't have to share the road with cars filled with every single other person in Ontario, who might rather get around another way, if it were safe to do so? Please let us remain having the freedom of choice to safely bike to our destinations, making the commute faster for drivers.\nIf you don't care that this bill will result in more people being killed while riding bikes, you can at least care that it will actually do the opposite of it's intended purpose, and actually increase traffic. Studies show time and time again that adding car lanes leads to an increase in car traffic, and an increase in commute time.\nBut if you do care about people's lives, the evidence is clear that this will increase the number of road deaths. This is not only devastating for the people who will be killed and their families and friends, but also for the people who will accidentally kill them (drivers) due to poor road safety design. If you hit someone while driving, that would weigh on most people's conscience for the rest of their lives. The loss of life is always devastating, and impacts everyone who uses the roads. However, accidents happen. And they will happen more because of this bill, which does not consider the safety of everyone who uses the roads.\n",

        "comment":"My comments below refer to Schedule 4 Part XII - Municipal By-laws and Bicycle Lanes.\nTwo years ago, my city installed new infrastructure on my main route to my child's daycare. Originally four lanes of car traffic, the new configuration allows for completely separated pedestrian sidewalks, protected bike lanes on each side, and three lanes of car traffic (a center turning lane and two one-way lanes for each direction).\nThese protected bike lanes have enabled me to safely and conveniently take my child on the four kilometre trip to our daycare using my bicycle year round. I have also been able to use my bike along this route to easily access shops, get groceries, and run errands. Moreover, driving on this route is now far more convenient as if I'm required to turn left I can use a dedicated left turn lane. It's also easier to avoid conflict with vulnerable road users as now everybody has properly allocated space.\nIn addition to the quality of life improvements, these bike lanes have saved our family money. We used to be a two car household, but now we only need one. This saves on gas, maintenance, insurance, monthly car payments, interest, and all of the other costs associated with car ownership. The annual savings is likely in the $6000-$12000 range, which is massive for us as we're just starting our family. We would not have been able to do go down to one car if our city had not installed this protected cycling infrastructure.\nThough bike lane connectivity is improving in our city, there is still much work to be done. There are many places that are currently don't have safe cycling infrastructure. Earlier this year, somebody was struck cycling and killed. There was no bike lane, but there were four lanes of car traffic. The person killed was legally riding on the right side of the road, and the person who hit her was at fault. This incident would not have occurred if there was proper cycling lanes in this area.\nI'm deeply concerned about the legislation being proposed that would greatly hinder progress being made in our city and throughout Ontario. I don't believe this will help people in Ontario, but will likely make things worse. It will make commuting more difficult and life more expensive for everybody. More people will be maimed or die on our streets by motorists. The proposed legislation risks reinforcing a car-centric approach to urban planning, prioritizing private vehicles over all other modes of transport.\nThe threat of removing existing cycling lanes is also very worrying. There really are not any practical side street options for our my commute without the current infrastructure. We would likely be forced into buying another car (which we really cannot afford as we're barely making ends-meet).\nI hope this government will take into careful consideration these comments and the comments of everybody else who will be affected by this legislation.\n",

There is significant evidence that car lane expansion in both cities and highways result in more congestion due to induced demand. The expansion of highways and the resulting increase of private motor vehicle ownership will inevitably speed up climate change, worsen traffic and  increase Ontario's dependence on fossil fuels. By expanding car infrastructure, the government fails to solve the main problem of transporting goods and people efficiently and discriminates against those who cannot afford or chose not to own a private motor vehicle. The act fundamentally worsens the issues it proposes to fix.\nThere are certain proposals that are concerning from a democratic point of view.

As Architects working in the sustainability sector we are in a highly competitive field for skilled talent.\nWe recently looked for a new office and our choice was based in large part on the ease of getting to work for our staff, who being predominately under 40 years old and living in the GTA tend not to drive private cars. We chose our new office because it IS on a major street (Danforth AVe) with dedicated bike lanes, public transit - the subway - and also decent parking options nearby.\nCongestion on the roads impacts our business everyday as we conduct a lot of site visits during construction as well as off-site meetings.

        "comment":"As a concerned citizen, one who drives and commutes to my office using the TTC, i respect those who choose to cycle and i am very concerned about their safety.\nWe are bringing more people into the city, they have to commute, our transportation system is not adequate, there are not room for more cars, bikes are necessary, we need to accommodate them and keep the cyclists and drivers safe - bike lanes is the best way to do so.  - Their impact on traffic is overstated. What is actually causing our congestion is too many people driving relative to our road capacity. We need more alternatives to driving. The more we encourage people to drive, the worse our congestion is going to get. The congestion on the 401, the Gardiner, on Kingston Road in Scarborough, Hurontario Street in Mississauga, or Queen Street in Brampton, are not because of bike lanes. This is a regional issue that is far more complex than three bike lanes.\n- Removing these lanes will not improve traffic. This is because of induced demand which shows us that as road capacity is increased for cars, more people drive, eating up that added capacity. This is something that has been proven all over the world, including here in Toronto.\n- One of the oft-repeated reasons against these bike lanes is that they negatively impact emergency response times. This is false. The deputy fire chief has said so himself. The hospitals on University Avenue are very supportive of the bike lanes given the high number of hospital workers who cycle to work. If emergency response times were being impacted, these institutions would not be so supportive. Why would this government ignore what these hospitals and medical professionals have said about these bike lanes?\n- Bike lanes are great for local businesses! This has been noted all over the world, including in Toronto where the Bloor Annex BIA recently came out in support of the lanes noting that it has increased their customer base and revenues. I would think that this would be something important to the current government. While I understand that some businesses have come out against the lanes in the areas where they are relatively new, this is a typical response when these lanes get built - initial response is negative with fear that they will hurt businesses, but once the lane has become established after a few years these businesses generally see their benefit.\n- There has been some talk of moving these bike lanes to 'secondary streets' as a compromise. I believe they need to be on main streets because that is where people's destinations are! Main corridors are where people work, shop, dine, and live. There are also few streets that run parallel to major corridors for long distances. Moving them to other streets will either lead to zig-zagging routes or will put them on corridors that do not have destinations that people need to get to. Either way, cyclists will still use the main corridors. This means that drivers will have to share a lane with the cyclist rather than being separated from them. This is frustrating from a driver's perspective, and it also increases the chances for conflicts or collisions.\n- Cycling is in its infancy in Toronto but is increasingly becoming a popular transportation option, particularly in central locations. By the end of 2024, the number of Bike Share trips will surpass 6 million rides if it hasn't already, almost 10x the number in 2015! And Bike Share only accounts for 12% of bike trips in Toronto - we're talking well over 100,000 bike trips per day on average in Toronto and potentially 50,000,000+ per year at this point. As the Downtown and areas like Midtown Toronto continue to intensify, the number of cyclists is only going to increase - these new buildings often have very few car parking spaces, but do have a significant number of bike parking spaces, often at a ratio of more than 1 per unit. We need to expand our bike infrastructure, not contract it - cycling is going to keep growing in Toronto.\n- The data that has been quoted by the Premier, Minister Sarkaria and others in this government is incredibly misleading. Using a Toronto CMA commute mode data point from 2011 is not a serious approach to data analysis. Regional data and commute patterns in other municipalities should not impact how streets are planned in Downtown Toronto. Instead, decision-making should consider local modal splits. Commuting data for areas served by bike lanes show many locations with 10%+ bike commuters. But even then, the number of cyclists is far higher than this. The commuting data only captures primary mode of commute - so someone who bikes 2 days a week and drives 3 days is captured as a driver not a cyclist, someone who commutes by bike to school is not captured in the data, someone who cycles for reasons other than commuting like going to the grocery store or visiting friends and family is not captured. To boil this down to the fact that 1.2% of people in the Toronto CMA cycled as their primary mode of commuting in 2011 is incredibly misleading.\n- Cycling can be the fastest and cheapest way to travel in central areas. While I totally understand that cycling from Etobicoke or Brampton to Queen's Park may not be feasible, there are thousands of people for which it does potentially make sense. For myself personally, it takes me 25 minutes to bike to work and costs me about $100-$200 per year. If I chose to take transit it would take me 45-75 minutes and cost me about $1,000 annually. If I drive, it would take me 25 to 45 minutes depending on traffic, and cost me $4,000 or $5,000 annually. Which of these options provides me with the most time with my family? Which one is best for my cost of living? If you remove safe cycling infrastructure though, I am far more likely to get in my car given the unreliability of my transit options. That will give me less time with my family, less money in my pocket, and only add to our congestion challenges.\n- Lastly, bike lanes make our roads safer - for all road users, including drivers. This is something that has been proven to be true. You, This change will make my lives less safe.  Is that worth it in the hopes that a small number of drivers on these routes MIGHT save what, 2 minutes?\nThis decision about bike lanes does a number of things - it adds red tape, it reduces choice, it hurts small businesses, it reduces public safety, ignores evidence, prioritizes inefficiency, and wastes money. My understanding is that this government is against all of these things, however, this move seems to show otherwise.\nIf the government has evidence that these bike lanes are harmful to the community or that the above is false, I would strongly encourage you to release this data to be scrutinized. If it is strong evidence, it will hold up to that scrutiny.\nThe solution to our congestion problems is to get more people out of cars by giving them reliable and convenient alternatives to driving. We need to move away from the idea that we should be able to drive quickly anywhere anytime, particularly in central areas. We also need to stop thinking of bicycles as a niche recreational activity and start recognizing that they are an important part of urban transportation systems. Designing cities with more choice in how to get around works better for everyone, including drivers. Car dependency has always been the biggest single contributor to car congestion.\nPlease remove the bike lane portion of Bill 212. There is no evidence that removing bike lanes will ease congestion in Toronto - but removing them will negatively impact a lot of people's lives and safety.\n",

Requiring municipalities to seek ministerial approval adds an additional layer of study and arbitrary approvals prior the installation of crucial infrastructure. I also find this change to be contrary to the strong mayors initiative that seeks to empower municipalities. Is the intent of this administration to empower municipalities to build more and faster or to add additional red tape that entrenched the idea that Ontario is a car dominant place? Finally, as a person who cannot drive for health reasons, having a reliable network of bike lanes across Toronto and Southern Ontario has broadened my exploration of the region.

This overreach actively discourages the development of safe, sustainable transportation options that reduce congestion and benefit everyone, including non-drivers.\nIn Toronto alone, 39 people have died as a result of traffic collisions this year.  25 of them were pedestrians or cyclists.\nCalling for Sustainable Alternatives\nInstead of doubling down on car-centric infrastructure like Highway 413, I urge the government to focus on projects that benefit all Ontarians:\nSupport active transportation by empowering municipalities to build bike lanes and improve mass public transit.\nPrioritize public transit expansion to address congestion and connectivity without harming communities or the environment.\nRespect municipal decision-making and ensure infrastructure projects enhance, rather than disrupt, the communities they serve.\nBill 212, as it stands, prioritizes short-term expediency on projects driven by government discretion, often favoring connected interests, over long-term sustainability and equity. I urge you to reconsider this approach and focus on infrastructure that genuinely benefits all Ontarians.\n",

While traffic and gridlock are indeed a nuisance to drivers, they shouldn't be the only entity being considered when deciding to make life altering decisions. Highway 413 for example is proposed to cut through the greenbelt, which are the lungs of Southern Ontario and home to many vulnerable species. We should be giving the construction of such a a highway as much careful consideration as possible and scrutinizing its potential impact. We shouldn't be expediting its construction and the destruction of swaths of the Greenbelt while simultaneously expediting habitat loss, especially not in the name of economics and putting more drivers on the road. 29 at risk species stand to lose their home and millions of Ontarians will be placed at risk from the additional pollution and fewer forests to filter that same pollution. This bill recklessly proposes to remove the rights of municipalities to protect its citizens, the rights of individuals and organisations to take a stand, and the right of homeowners to protect their homes. Whatever this bill proposes, we should be moving in the opposite direction and creating walkable cities, trying to reduce the number of vehicles on the road, seriously considering the voices of local municipalities and organizations because they know their communities better, and applauding individuals who take a stand for their homes and the environment. We can't magic the Greenbelt back when we realize the damage cutting down acres of this precious resource has, so let's take as much consideration as we need, let's not expedite reckless destruction.\n",

By spending millions of dollars to tear up bicycle lanes, the Minister of Transportation will make a liar of the Premier.  This waste of our money would be akin to flushing it down the toilet. Millions of our dollars wasted.  A terrible mistake and disrespectful of taxpayers.\nInstead, the Minister needs to show leadership by taking one of his other responsibilities, GO Transit, from Brampton to Union Station and then the TTC (or walk) to Queen's Park, as thousand of responsible Brampton and area citizens do every work day.\nHis misguided view that creating more lanes for traffic will reduce gridlock is simply not accurate.  I suggest he view the photos circa 1960 of the then recently-created Gardiner Expressway already jammed with traffic as people abandoned transit for the \"ease\" of driving themselves from suburbs to downtown.\nThe same goes for poor ideas like Highway 413, which will only increase traffic.  The Minister said this highway will help people to get into the city, in fact its proposed route would angle traffic around the city.  His statement is not logical.  It does not stand up to scrutiny when viewed on a map.\nA far better idea is to increase use of the existing Hwy 407 which many, many people have proposed.  Now that is a smart idea, which this Minister and Premier need to embrace.  Not the poor ideas proposed in this legislation which will set Ontario on a downward spiral.\nMunicipalities have rightly denounced the overreach of the province in trying to force their poor planning ideas on municipalities.  Municipalities know their communities much better than the province can.  It's okay for you to admit this and stop meddling.  Instead focus on provincial responsibilities like improving our health care, housing and education systems which are priorities.  This legislation is a poor deflection from the province carrying out its urgent responsibilities.\n",

Providing more opportunities for car travel will only encourage car travel - more cars purchased and more cars on the road. If there\u2019s more highways, people will certainly take them, but it\u2019s not going to even out the road travellers and ease traffic.  The traffic will just continue, adding another backed up highway to the ones we already have. Ford Government is leading us into perpetually clogged system of travel. Is this Fords weird scheme to increase car purchasing and production in Canada? Perhaps to support a buddy of his in the automobile industry?\nIf you really wanted to reduce traffic in the city, the obvious choice would be limiting the amount of vehicles entering its roadways. Why don\u2019t we look at making non-residents of Toronto getting a permit to drive in the city? This would entourage folks to explore the amazing go train and ttc system and reduce cards on the road. I\u2019m sure \u2018Rick\u2019 from Oshawa doesn\u2019t really need to drive his Chevrolet Silverado into Toronto every Leaf Game.\nThe environment impact of added highways and car travel is obvious. Why does Ford want a smellier polluted world? All this money we could save in highways could go towards more advanced sustainable travel options. We have a great thing started with GO, why not invest in that?\nUnfortunately, I cannot support this bill because I have lost faith in the Ford Government to make the just decisions. Municipalities have been doing a fantastic job modernizing their roadways and Fords ideas are out of touch with reality.

        "comment":"As a resident of Etobicoke, Ontario, I wish to express my opposition to Bill 212: Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. As a motorist, I oppose the inadequacy of the proposed actions as a solution to municipal gridlock. As a cyclist, I oppose the inadequacy of this Bill in ensuring safe and equitable access for all vehicles. Furthermore, as a concerned citizen, I oppose the proposed construction of roadways, specifically Highway 413 without comprehensive planning. Altogether, I strongly believe that these measures represent, at best, a short-term, band-aid solution to gridlock that will only push greater problems onto Ontarians in the future.\nI live with my husband and small children in Etobicoke, less than 500m north of Bloor Street, and work in the downtown core, near Union Station. I am a frequent motorist, cyclist and pedestrian, and therefore have a great deal of personal experience with the infrastructure affected by Bill 212.\nTraffic congestion in Toronto is a complex and long-standing issue which significantly predates the installation of bicycle lanes on arterial roadways into the city centre. With continuing population growth within the city and surrounding area, particularly in light of imminent development in the Kipling-Bloor area, simply reallocating an additional pre-existing lane of car traffic on these roads is woefully inadequate and shortsighted. Rather, this issue calls for innovative solutions that enable and encourage alternate modes of transport, including transit use, walking and cycling.\nThis is particularly true on mixed-use main streets such Bloor Street and Yonge Street, which support a large number of local residential, commercial and institutional destinations. The greatest benefit to both residents and local businesses requires access by a multitude of users, including motorists, pedestrians, cyclists, mobility device users, transit users, delivery services and emergency services. Unlike roadways such as the Gardiner Expressway, the primary function of these mixed-use roads is not to funnel the greatest possible number of vehicles to and from the city centre. As long as such local functions exist on these streets, they will be poorly suited to serve as the quickest and most reliable access to downtown by car.\nThe Bloor Street cycling lanes have particular personal relevance to me, I have used them to cycle downtown to work and to take my daughter to and from nursery school about 3km away along Bloor St. Without the stretch of bicycle lanes from Kipling Ave. to Islington Ave., in particular, there are no viable alternative routes that avoid major roads. I also cycle my son to daycare further north on Kipling Ave. I do not feel safe cycling alongside high-speed traffic on Kipling Ave., especially with a toddler in tow, and therefore I use side roads and trails. This increases my travel time by at least 60%, and also requires me to cross four major roads at uncontrolled intersections. Not only is this slow and dangerous, but it also frequently delays motorists behind me as I wait for a gap in 2-4 lanes of traffic. Despite this, cycling remains the most practical method to reach these destinations. Purchasing and operating a second vehicle simply to get our children to school is financially absurd.\nWhile the Ministry of Transportation defines bicycles as vehicles and has broad responsibility for ensuring their safe and appropriate use, it has traditionally been left to local municipalities to decide on the most appropriate way to ensure equitable access by motor vehicles and bicycles. To adequately perform this function, municipalities have developed a great deal of resources, knowledge and infrastructure, including local consultation with residents and businesses, urban planning experts, computer modelling, and traffic studies. As such, these municipalities are currently best placed to decide if and where cycling infrastructure should be installed. The use of side roads or trails for cycling is not objectionable in and of itself, provided these side roads provide a similarly efficient route to destinations across the city, including appropriate measures to allow timely and safe crossings at any major roads. Until such time as the MTO builds out the appropriate capacity to provision the alternate routes, it is evident that it does not have sufficient capability and expertise to ensure safe and equitable access to local roads, especially as the scope of this bill does not include the responsibility to ensure the suitability and adequacy of alternate cycling infrastructure. Local mixed-use roads are funded by taxes paid by residents and businesses within the municipality, and municipal governments are most familiar with local needs and most answerable to local taxpayers. Oversight over the particulars of these local roads must therefore continue to rest with local governments.\nFinally, I must also oppose Bill 212 with respect to accelerated construction on the proposed Highway 413. In addition to significant impacts on local residents and the environment, expressways constitute a significant component of provincial transportation. As such, it is absolutely vital that these projects are thoughtfully and thoroughly considered to ensure that they serve their intended function while minimizing negative consequences. Poor planning will only increase the likelihood of greater costs to taxpayers in the future.\nI was born in Ontario, and I am greatly appreciative of my home province and have deep roots here. I grew up mainly in small towns in the Golden Horseshoe. Some of my happiest childhood memories were at my grandparents' orchard in Niagara-on-the-Lake and my other grandparents' home and cottage near Georgian Bay. As an adult, I still visit relatives and travel around the province with my own family, whenever I can. As a resident of Etobicoke, I love my local neighborhood and neighbours. I appreciate the thriving, bustling city of Toronto that provides vital employment and cultural opportunities. I take pride in the bounty of produce that comes from highly fertile Ontario agricultural land and the beauty and inherent environmental value of our pristine wilderness. It is clear to me that if Ontario is to remain \"A Place to Grow\" for existing and future residents, thoughtful, thorough planning and good faith integration of all road users must be maintained and encouraged.\n",

The government needs to understand that the needs of the core are different than the needs of Etobicoke. I can appreciate there has been a lot of upper about the bike lanes on Bloor in Etobicoke, but that certainly does not mean that they should be holistically removed. There is absolutely no way it is going to improve traffic as Doug Ford claims to\u2014 it will make it significantly worse, in addition to causing more fatalities.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 212 is an unnecessarily harmful proposal to the wellbeing people living in Ontario, as well as being especially harmful to people who live in Toronto, and should be opposed. I am concerned that this bill will have the effect of chilling bike lane development across Ontario. On top of that, this bill proposes to remove existing bike lanes! What should be supported is the current status quo where municipalities have the opportunity to decide for themselves where bike lanes should be located within their jurisdiction, and the bike lanes on Bloor St, Yonge St, and University Avenue should be allowed to remain as they currently are in the city of Toronto.\nBill 212 undermines Vision Zero and will contribute to increased car-cyclist conflicts, cyclist-pedestrian conflicts, and cyclist injuries and deaths.\nThis bill is also based on the untrue premise that bike lanes are unnecessary because there is little demand for them. Data shows that demand for cycling infrastructure can be induced through the construction of bike lanes. People cycle more when they know their route will be safe from potential collisions with cars. This effect is amplified when there is a broad network of bike lanes; every bike lane is thus crucial since it contributes to this network. Deliberately offering infrastructure that induces biking trips supports the City of Toronto's goal that \"75% of school\/work trips under 5km are walked, biked, or by transit.\" However, Bill 212 would create an unnecessary obstacle to that policy target by reducing biking demand.\nHaving bike lanes also benefits car drivers. When more people are using bike lanes and thus out of cars, it decreases the amount of downtown car traffic, making travelling easier for car drivers as well. This is especially true in densely developed areas like downtown Toronto, but is a pattern that exists in all urban areas within Ontario.\nInducing cycling demand also helps the province meet its climate target. Over a third of Toronto's emissions come from burning gasoline in cars. Not enough people own EV's to make that a viable solution to the climate crisis, but facilitating the use of carbon-zero trips on a bicycle is. Bill 212 is likely to result in stalling development of cycling infrastructure. This will reduce cycling demand and increase demand for personal cars. This accelerates the climate crisis, resulting in harmful environmental conditions for Ontarians.\nBill 212 is damaging because it is an overreach by the provincial government into municipal affairs. Municipalities are the government most close to the issues that their taxpayers are concerned with. Thus, they should continue to be able to develop the infrastructure projects that they believe will benefit their constituency. The province is too far removed from these incredibly local issues to be able to make accurate, informed decisions about the trade offs of a particular bike lane proposal.\nBill 212 also unnecessarily wastes public money, and unnecessarily damages public trust in provincial and municipal government. The City of Toronto spent taxpayer dollars creating bike lanes on its streets. And, the majority of public opinion in the city is in favor of their continuation and timely expansion. Tearing them out will waste these taxpayers' money, undoing a project that they believe benefits them. Proposing to tear out these bike lanes so soon after their creation also damages public trust in municipal and provincial government. It makes it appear that the province goes one step forwards and one step back with respect to providing necessary services for its constituency. Also, like mentioned earlier, it makes it seem like the Government of Ontario is not concerned with the wellbeing of people who live in the province.\n",

Wetlands serve as a critical geographical and ecological feature that not only benefit wildlife, but the humans around it by acting as a natural reservoir to reduce flood risk. Investing in cheaper public transit fares would be a better use of time than engaging in the \"just one more lane\" stance, which ultimately has been proven to be futile and appeals to the \"induced demand\" theory.\n",

        "comment":"Hello, I absolutely do not support the proposals of Bill 212 such as the removal of EA requirements for major highway projects, and the removal of bike lanes in particular. The city of Toronto has done a wonderful job in expanding and connecting it's cycling infrastructure downtown, as any world class city that cares about sustainability and public health would. I personally use the University and Bloor bike lanes, a truly wonderful and commendable addition to the urban fabric and transportation options in the city. Bike lanes are not the reason why this city is experiencing gridlock, and are actually part of the solution to the problem. The fewer safe, reliable alternative mode options there are, is the more people will drive and the worse gridlock will be. These are simple principles which are well documented and proven, and that I can attest to as a Registered Professional Planner in Ontario. It's evident that the wealthy and privileged MPPs and Premier (who have never made choices to be more sustainable or had choose the cheaper transportation mode) should not be the ones telling the City of Toronto what to do with its transportation network. Municipalities must not be required to get provincial approval for bike infrastructure. Do not remove the bike lanes, do not move the city backwards, and do not waste money that should be spent on improving the transit and transportation network in other ways.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 212 must be opposed because it prioritizes car-centric infrastructure at the cost of the province's climate goals, without any meaningful reduction in traffic. This bill proposes to force through Highway 413 through the Ontario greenbelt. The Greenbelt is an area of protected land of crucial ecological significance, which also helps support human life in Ontario. The Greenbelt protects particularly key forests that sequester carbon, farmland that provides food to Ontarians and economic revenue to the province, and wetlands that sequester carbon and filter drinking water that the province uses. Highway 413 would destroy this ecologically and socially crucial land. It would also cause great harm to the endangered red-side dace, a fish that is federally recognized as endangered under the Species at Risk Act. This highway will also induce greater demand for car usage, meaning that it likely will not have a significant impact on traffic or travel times within the province as more car drivers pour into this space. Ontarians will not gain a reduction of travel times under this act. However, Ontarians have much to lose from the continued loss of the greenbelt. Since there is very little benefit provided for the likely costs, this bill will be a net loss to Ontario residents and therefore should be opposed.\nInstead, of prioritizing highways, regional rapid transit should be prioritized.\n",

        "comment":"Key question: What if we\u2019re doing the math wrong\u2026not thinking through potentially grave, unintended consequences for this province.  (With apology for the very hasty writing.  I learned of this opportunity too late. Also for the lack of clear structure. All formatting of numbering and bulleting of points was stripped away in pasting this into the submission form.)\nThis proposed bill takes as its starting point that the easy flow of the automobile is the number one criteria to be optimized in infrastructure planning.  Opposition to this proposal often centres on environmental concerns (in the case of highways) and personal safety and preference in terms of built urban environments\nFor the purposes of this submission, I am focusing exclusively on the government\u2019s plans to reduce bike lanes in the GTA, and would like to briefly raise three separate questions, that focus on potentially unintended but significant consequences of this decision, quite apart from the environmental impact, or the safety of riders.\nCONTRIBUTING to future congestion, rather than diminishing it.\nWill removing bike lanes actually work to deliver against intended goals: i.e.  alleviate congestion -- or ultimately aggravate instead?\nLet's say, to begin, that our only concern is the average commute time in and out of downtown Toronto, for those who live outside of the city.  Congestion is high\nCommuters are spending some between 1.5 and 4.4 minutes more commuting\nThe thinking is that If we remove bike lanes and add an additional lane for cars, traffic will move more quickly.\nThis is\/would be true only if the volume of cars stays constant -- or at a minimum increases less than the new road capacity gained.\nBUT the volume of cars will almost certainly increase owing to two effects\nINDUCED DEMAND: If the relative convenience of cars is increased vs other modes of transport, car volume will increase\nSUBSTITUTION EFFECT: At least some portion of existing bicycle traffic if forced to start driving more.\nA huge customer of bike lanes at this point is deliver\nCommuters\nAs a result, FEWER bike lanes is ultimately like to result in MORE cars on the roads, and MORE congestion, not less. And in surprisingly short order.\nIf we turn back the clock now on the impressive progress that the city has made in \u201cinducing demand\u201d for cycling as a mode of transport -- how will we accommodate the transportation needs of the anticipated growth in population of the GTA\nThe population growth of the next 25 years (3.5 million) is expected to be more than the last 25 years.\nYet, our capacity to build new roads within the GTA is severely constrained by a lack of vacant space -- esp in the downtown core.\nWe simply cannot rely on cars to connect us to work, play and each other: Cars\nDesigning a car-centric transportation strategy for Toronto risks big implications for other critical areas of public policy priorities in Ontario\nCONTRIBUTING TO THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS\nIf residents own cars, new housing must accommodate them.  Adding parking to new construction adds $100K+ to building costs which must then be added to purchase price.\nParking lots consumes an enormous amount of space that could and needs to be made available for housing and recreation.\nIn the highly sought after residential Danforth neighbourhood, for example, the G&M reported 1parking lots within a 1.5-kilometre stretch.\nSiphoning limited household funds to car ownership, rather than allowing households to focus savings on housing.\nThe average Canadian who owns a car, spends $1387 MONTHLY on all car related expenses.  This compares to $1759.  Many of the people who are struggling most\nProviding Ontarian with meaningful alternatives to a car can almost double the disposable income that a household is able to maintain\nCONTRIBUTING TO OUT OF UNSUSTAINABLE HEALTHCARE SPENDING GROWTH\nTwo of the most significant sociological drivers of our escalating healthcare costs -- are drivers that have strong correlation with daily exercise (even just walking to, and taking transit) -- and NEGATIVE correlations with time spent in car commuting.\n1. Obesity:\n\u201cEach additional hour spent in a car per day was associated with a 6% increase in the likelihood of obesity. Conversely, each additional kilometer walked per day was associated with a 4.8% reduction in the likelihood of obesity.\nhttps:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15261894\/\u201d\n2. Addictions and Mental Health\nPhysical exercise -- basic daily movement -- is broadly acknowledged to be one of the most effective, and least costly tools to affect mental health outcomes.\nAs well: Direct system costs of car accidents -- to drivers, passengers, cyclists and pedestrians.\nHealthcare costs in Ontario attributable to car-related accidents are estimated at $1.6 billion.\nLess congestion = more speed. Speed kills (and injures\nBy focusing on a transportation and infrastructure that is balanced against all modes of transport: walking, cycling, transit and cars -- we can reduce these direct costs, and perhaps most importantly, the tremendous societal cost to individuals and families of these automobile related accidents.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, in particular Schedules 2, 3, and 4 relating to highway construction, provincial approval of bicycle lanes, and removal of bicycle lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto.\nI strongly agree with the submissions provided by various organizations in opposition to the provincial upload of bicycle lane approvals and the proposed removal of bicycle lanes in Toronto, including the City of Toronto, Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, Ontario Professional Planners Institute, and Ontario Traffic Council. Bill 212 proposes needless and harmful provincial intrusion into municipal planning and engineering authorities. It will create red tape that will delay and increase costs for bikeway and other road construction projects. The fact that so many transportation and planning experts oppose this legislation demonstrates the lack of evidence supporting the proposed legislation.\nRoads should be designed and built with consideration of its use over all times of day, not just peak periods. Roads designed to accommodate peak hour demand are overbuilt for much of the rest of the day, encouraging higher speeds which increase the frequency and severity of collisions. Roads that are overbuilt are also more expensive to build and maintain. This legislation will be an obstacle to projects that reallocate road space on roadways for bicycle lanes, driving up costs of future municipal and provincial infrastructure projects due to the need for larger roadways, longer or wider structures, and more relocation of curbs, drainage, and utilities to implement bikeways in the boulevard.\nReallocation of motor vehicle capacity to other modes improves road safety for all road users, not just people cycling. Road diets are a proven countermeasure to reduce collisions, as researched by the US Federal Highway Administration. In addition to pedestrians and people cycling, it's likely that more motor vehicle drivers and passengers will be seriously injured or killed as a result of this bill. Instead of getting home a few minutes quicker, a higher number of motor vehicle users will end up going to the hospital instead, or never make it home at all.\nIf the Province wants to spend money supporting congestion relief in Toronto, there are many other projects that would be more effective than removing existing bicycle lanes. Any funding should instead be used for more productive projects to relieve congestion, such as targeted modifications to address operational needs on these corridors (including for accessibility), more adaptive \"smart\" signals on these and other corridors, more frequent GO bus and rail service, and measures to reduce duration of vehicle lane, bicycle lane, and sidewalk closures on Provincial projects.\nThe proposed creation of an entirely new and dedicated approval process for bicycle lanes is even more red tape. In the past, certain bicycle lane projects - particularly those involving lane removals - were subject to the Municipal Class Environmental Assessment process. This process is a frequently used process with which professionals in government and the private sector are well acquainted. If Bill 212 is passed, the regulation should adopt existing approval processes for which there is an established and familiar process, preferably the Municipal Class EA or its proposed successor.\nI am also opposed to the Highway 413 Act, exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act, the Highway 413 project as a whole, and other proposed measures to accelerate highway construction, such as those related to property acquisition and overriding of municipal by-laws that may limit work.\n",

I\u2019m not worried I\u2019m going to hit them.  And of course I feel more safe cycling in a protected lane than in a lane with cars.

The removing of bike lanes will likely not speed up traffic, there is plenty of research that supports this.\n- [ ] a conservative government should not be promoting adding red tape and bureaucracy to the development of transport networks in cities.\n- [ ]  We should be building towards a carbon-neutral future. And building bike infrastructure is a very cost effective way of doing so.\n- [ ] There is no feasible east-west route on side streets to replace the Bloor lane. The major arteries are the only roads that cut uninterrupted through the city of Toronto\n- [ ] The exemption of the planned highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act would allow for significant damage to natural heritage, hydrological features and to the Greenbelt system, robbing us of ecosystems that keep us healthy\nThe idea of removing bike lanes to speed up traffic is nonsense.  I suspect the bike lane issue is just a distraction from the easing of environmental protections to get the 413 built.\nThis bill is rooted in ignorance and corruption.  The corruption of the premiere himself in seeking to open up our greenbelt to wealthy developers.\nThis destructive bill will only serve to keep us trapped in the age of car-dependent development, and really just reflects an antiquated view of the world.\n",
