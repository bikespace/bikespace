While process is ongoing lease, pilt and fees need to remain consititent or lowered considering the situation.
This is impacting investment values and lives.
Cottagers options will be limited again, lease values questionable and causing much uncertainty.
All aspects of this need to be considered.
Some cottagers have been there since cottage built, in fact urged by government to build there to begin with.

36180,/comment/36180,"For decades the leaseholders knew that their lease was up in 2017.  Most of us follow provincial policy and accept government decisions are made for the common good.  There is no way anyone can say they were surprised, nor that they weren't consulted on the approved park plan.
In today's world, provincial parks are for all, for the public, not for a select few.  So many cottages have no place in an area with so many species-at-risk in an area that is supposed to be protected.  Times change, people are moving on from old white men having all the advantages in the name of culture and heritage (that likely usurped others' culture and heritage that they did not care about over 100 years ago).  There are a lot of other nice places to own cottages these days. An area of Ontario with such small amounts of Crown land, most of it in provincial parks: this is not the right place.
It's time that these leaseholders accept the decision that was approved decades ago: their leases should end.  If another extension or sale does occur, they should be made to pay fair market value for their leases retroactively some years as well as for the remainder of their lease/sale, as not only have they had great privilege of the park being ""theirs"", but they have been paying next to nothing for their cottages.  Neither of these is a fair and equitable use of Crown land, nor is it a fair return for Ontario's taxpayers.
Having said that about sale of land, I seriously doubt that potential new lots would meet many of the provincial requirements for new lots/subdivisions.  That, in itself, should say something.
Please think about the purpose of the land, and about who your decision is for.

36183,/comment/36183,"I support the proposal of a short-term extension to the cottage lots at Rondeau.
However the significant delays in this process are unconscionable. These discussions have been ongoing for over 10 years with little progress. As a cottage owner since 1996 I was pleased to see the last round of ""conditions"" that required a commitment from cottage owners to commit to their cottage ownership or give up their lease, and for the septic system inspection process to occur. However many cottages are in need of maintenance repairs, which have been put off for several years due to the uncertainty, (with a lease renewal date decision being expected at some point in 2017 or 2018) and now  it is becoming  crucial that these maintenance projects be done (i.e. new roofs, windows, etc.) but committing thousands of dollars into these repairs with no certainty of the outcome is putting many cottage owners in a very untenable position.
The cottage community at Rondeau has been there for the past 100 years and is part of the ""cultural fabric"" of the Park. The cottagers provide not only significant financial contributions to the operation of the Park, but contribute to the vitality of the ""Rondeau Park community"", bringing visitors in and providing for many of the recreational opportunities for kids and families to enjoy our great Ontario outdoors, and participate in the Ministry-sponsored environmental education programs as well. This unique partnership has enabled Rondeau to remain a viable part of the Chatham-Kent/Southwestern Ontario community experience for generations. We sincerely hope this can continue well into the future, and that the financial and recreational contributions of the cottagers be recognized through their long-term continued presence in the Park.

36200,/comment/36200,"I reached out to the Ministry for general perspective on the need to extend the Rondeau Park assessment process and while I didn't learn anything new, it was encouraging to hear that the file is being worked on toward a constructive outcome.
That said, this extension serves to exacerbate the uncertainty of the current situation for all leaseholders, especially for the many families who have known Rondeau Park as their summer home for five generations going back almost one hundred years.
Its interesting that when Gros Morne became a National Park in 2005, they had a problem to solve because there were several communities with many generations of people living in the geography the Park took in. The early reaction at the federal level was that National Parks were for preservation of wildlife and indigenous species.....and so the humans would have to vacate. But after further investigation and consideration it was determined that people living there were actually a part of the established eco-systems and therefore, they were indigenous too. Forcing everyone to leave would negatively impact nature's balance. And so the progressive decision was brought down, that they should stay.
I will acknowledge that Rondeau Park is a very different situation. It is a smaller geography and likely a more fragile natural environment.
That said, on many levels, the cottagers have become the custodians of Rondeau because they have the most to lose if it is compromised in any way. If people are a bad thing for ""Parks"" why are there virtually as many campsites as there are cottages in the Park?
Please consider the upside that accompanies a seasonal community with a vested stake in the preservation of Rondeau Park on every level! Positioned properly, the Park Superintendent could deputize every cottage owner with a duty to respect and protect Rondeau and to report anything that might bring harm to it.
Thank you

I just recently discovered Rondeau and love spending time in this hidden gem of Canada. We bought a cottage knowing the lease would be decided soon. So I hope the people come to reasonable solution before 3 years . I have attended many events in Rondeau and noticed how everyone talks about how great things used to be. It seems to me that nowadays we are losing the ability to enjoy and share things that seemed natural to do when we were young. A few bad apples ruin the fun for everyone else right? Well since becoming a cottage owner I feel that we are the protectors of the land and animals here. We clean up after the visitors that don't care. We watch out for destructive and dangerous activities. All while supporting the local community and businesses. If the cottages were to be removed it would destroy many habitats as well as the local towns. If we work together we can make things better even if we can't go back to the good old days . Why are they called that anyways?

I  implore the ministry to APPROVE the 3 year extension for cottagers at Rondeau Park. The ministry should also provide the cottagers a permanent lease or even consider selling them the lots they are on.
The cottagers at Rondeau are not only an part of the history of Ontario, they are part of the original vision and have demonstrated themselves as an integral part of the protection of the environment of the park. The cottagers have demonstrated leadership and stewardship in educating others as to how people can co-mingle with the environment (with a minimal impact footprint) should be used as a model for communities everywhere.  Rondeau cottagers have generations of families, friends, citizens of Ontario and even from around the world that continue to demonstrate how nature and mankind can work in service and protection of each other. Interestingly enough, the one constant for protection of the park has been the cottager families who have been there for generations regardless of changes in government or park leadership.  Rondeau Park Cottagers are proud as protectors and often find themselves acting as ambassadors for the park. Any consideration regarding the removal of this important legacy would be a major step backward in stewardship and protection for the long term.

They are ambassadors to the park and I feel that they are more eco responsible than the short term visitors to the campground. it is a pleasure to ride around the park on out bicycles and see the vibrant and friendly personalities who are quick to wave and say hello. It is for this reason I feel the 3 year extension would be valuable with an eye to allowing these cottages to stay on forever

36598,/comment/36598,"I feel that a 3 year extension to the cottage leases could be an acceptable compromise while working on ways to extend the lifetime of leases. Thia will allow the Ministry the ability to set in place the goals for long term sustainability of the park while also allowing the cottagers the ability to have input into what they feel need to be worked on from their side of things. I do feel that at the end of this a long term agreement could be of great benefit to all parties as cottagers could then make long awaited repairs and replacement of items that would be economically sensitive while also allowing the beauty and nature of Rondeau to be front and centre.

We have been there for 5 generations, and want to be there for another 5, ......without all the drama.  My hope is it doesn’t take another 3 years to achieve that. if This government doesn’t act quickly, out future will there, once again, be at risk.

36752,/comment/36752,"My family has been a cottager in Rondeau since the late 1970s and we very much support the continuation of the cottage leases in Rondeau Provincial Park.  If we need 3 years to finalize the lease agreement, then I am in favour of taking the time to get it right.
Rondeau was my second home growing up and is now a second home for my three children and has been a welcoming community to us, our extended family and countless friends over the years.  We believe that as cottagers, we are stewards of the park and ensure that everyone that visits is aware of the sensitive balance between the humans, animals and vegetation that call Rondeau home.
We believe that a permanent solution should be the objective as the Rondeau leaseholders have, and will continue to be, stewards of the park and will work to maintain and improve the park for all of its inhabitants and visitors.
For over 125 years, Rondeau has been an example of how cottagers and the natural environment can live and thrive together...we look forward to continuing this excellent relationship.

In 1894 the government established Rondeau as a place where local residents and people from Michigan could build cottages on leased lots with the full blessing and support of the Ontario government.

the cottages have been in the park just as long as many of the trees deeply rooted in the rich soil.  The cottagers are great for the local trades, and shops.  The cohabitation enjoyed by cottagers with nature and wild life is a rare form of beauty to be a part of.
My family has been a part of Rondeau Park for over 70 years.  We, along with the other cottagers have formed a unique community that includes people from both sides of the boarder.... a vast span of ages.... and multiple religious and political  view points.
As a community we look after each other like family... doing odd jobs for our elderly neighbors... learning how to take tips to care for the natural surroundings from the cottage veterans.
Each family that visits the Chatham-Kent area for cottaging,   shops at local stores , gets oil changes and car repairs at local garages, has repairs or upgrades done on  the cottages by local trades peoples.  We support and are supported by the local population.
I hope to be able to continue to be a part of this community long into the future.

37091,/comment/37091,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on this proposal. As a fifth-generation cottager I have seen first-hand the many benefits of having cottages in Rondeau. We are devoted stewards of the environment. We are active volunteers in the community. And we generate substantial economic benefit to the surrounding area, especially in south Chatham-Kent, which has faced significant economic challenges over the last two decades.
Therefore, our household supports the three-year extension as listed in proposal 019-0907. We believe this extension should apply immediately to all current leaseholders. I believe this interim measure should allow cottagers and the MOE to reach a permanent solution. We support a permanent solution that allows for our cottage community to remain in Rondeau in perpetuity. Ideally, if a permanent solution is reached by the cottagers and MOE before the three-year interim agreement is finished, we whole-heartedly support the permanent arrangement being implemented immediately.
Again, thank you for your time and consideration of this message.

I support the permanent continuation of the Rondeau cottage community.  With some reservations (ie: as per my reasons below) I support the three-year lease extension as described in ERO Policy Proposal 019-0907.
•	As you know the current two-year extension is close to expiration.
•	This causes significant stress for all of the Rondeau Cottage community.
•	I am concerned that the three years stretches past this current government’s term (ie: The 43rd    Ontario general election will be held on or before June 2, 2022.) and wondering why the three years and not within the current government’s term of office.
•	 This lease extension should be granted automatically to all existing leaseholders.
 This time should (we hope) be used to reach a more permanent solution that will ensure the cottage community remains forever.  If a permanent solution is reached prior to the three-year deadline, I support it being implemented as soon as possible.
Hopefully we get a resolution soon!

A 3 years extension is a Start and a new Deal should not Take 3 years to complete and should be completed Faster Rather than leaving these people hanging for another 3 years .
Something Permanent needs to be done Sell the land Get it done! its less than 1% of the park
This will create revenue and investment in the Park which are Both needed
The Rating of this Park needs to change Back to recreational from Natural .There is Clear Creek Provincial Park less than 15 Kilometres away which is defiantly a Natural Park and should carry that Rating .Most people in the Ares Don't even know Clear Creek  is a Provincial Park

In that we, the cottage owners, have been left in limbo for several years now, I would like to see the matter of the lease extensions resolved in the very near future.
That said, I will support your proposed three year lease extension as laid out in ERO Policy Proposal 019-0907. However, i would strongly recommend that every effort be made to reach a solution in a much shorter time frame.  With lease extensions up in the air for so long, there are many cottages that are in need of repair and the owners, myself included, don't want to spend the necessary money if the leases are not going to be extended for a period of more than three years.
I would strongly encourage the Province to extend all the existing leases for a significant period that will allow and encourage leaseholders to take pride in and want to improve their properties.
Further, please re-visit some of the regulations imposed by the previous government that restrict the use of the park by responsible leaseholders such as pets on the beach, etc.
Thank you for dealing with this in a timely manner.

This has been the pattern for a number of years which has resulted in uncertainty and frustration on the part of the cottage community. Given we have already been operating under a 2 year interim extension since 2017, I hope and trust that this is a good faith effort to finally resolve this matter. The cottages have been part of the fabric of the park for over 100 years - the ecological integrity of the park is an example of how cottages and the environment have and can continue co-exist. A permanent tenure solution would demonstrate the ability to achieve a balance between the economy and the environment and truly be a win-win for the province, Chatham-Kent and cottagers.

37330,/comment/37330,"Our family has been owners of a cottage in Rondeau Provincial Park since 2006 and have family that have had cottage(s) inside Rondeau for multiple generations.  We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to have a cottage that has been in existence since the early days of the park and to understand our responsibility to continue the stewardship of the park that has been passed on to us by all the former owners dating back to the early 1900's.
We view Rondeau as a unique place.  A place that has had cottages and nature living in harmony since its inception.  One that survives because of this symbiotic relationship.  The large amounts of lizards living under our deck or the Fowler toads we see in nooks and crannies around the cottage is a testament to how we cottagers help nature while nature gives us what it has, beauty and tranquility.  Neither side imposes on the other and in fact we help and enhance each other.  Provincial parks (in my opinion) are created for the people of Ontario to enjoy in all manners, be it Rondeau with cottages, Yacht Clubs and Big Docks, Quetico where we flew in on a vintage float plane to start our canoe trip or Algonquin where we took part in a wolf howl.  They are all designed in one way or another for the people of Ontario to enjoy.  Allowing cottages in Rondeau is no more harmful or negatively impactful than flying into Quetico and camping for a week or parking our car on HWY 69 along with hundreds of others on a peaceful night in August to communicate with the wolf packs.
Thank you for for allowing me to say my piece and with that I want to formally register my support for the continuation of the Rondeau cottage community for the long term future.
I wholeheartedly support the three-year lease extension as described in ERO Policy Proposal 019-0907 and in my opinion, the lease extension should be granted automatically to all existing cottage leaseholders. I also strongly believe that the best solution for the local business community, the day visitors and the campers of Rondeau is to reach a permanent solution in place of government leases that will ensure the cottage community remains in Rondeau forever.  Lastly, given the years of uncertainty with government leases, I support that if permanent solution is found before the end of the three year deadline, the government should enact it immediately to lessen the chance of future government manipulation.

37376,/comment/37376,"I fully support extending the leases on Rondeau cottages, now and in perpetuity. I've had the privilege of being a regular guest at a cottage in Rondeau, and it's made it possible to have weekend visits to this incredible park year round. The cottage owners are vocal advocates for the value and beauty of Rondeau. I would never have gone cross-country skiing, biking, birdwatching around this park if I hadn't been invited by a cottager. I love Rondeau now and want to be able to keep coming back and supporting this park year after year. The cottages make it accessible year round and to those of us who are farther away.

I am a cottager and am happy to see a 3 year extension on the current lease. Hopefully this will allow a permanent solution to be found for the cottagers (that we can afford and that will satisfy all steakholders involved). We love our cottage and the atmosphere at Rondeau and would like to continue to stay and enjoy our natural oasis.

37434,/comment/37434,"To Whom it may concern:						Date: November 28th 2019
I support the permanent continuation of the Rondeau cottage community.  With some reservations (ie: as per my reasons below) I support the three-year lease extension as described in ERO Policy Proposal 019-0907.
•	As you know the current two-year extension is close to expiration.
•	This causes significant stress for all of the Rondeau Cottage community.
•	I am concerned that the three years stretches past this current government’s term (ie: The 43rd Ontario general election will be held on or before June 2, 2022.) and wondering why the three years and not within the current government’s term of office.
•	 This lease extension should be granted automatically to all existing leaseholders.
 This time should (we hope) be used to reach a more permanent solution that will ensure the cottage community remains forever.  If a permanent solution is reached prior to the three-year deadline, I support it being implemented as soon as possible.
Hopefully we get a resolution soon!

Cottagers have been at Rondeau for nearly one hundred years without substantially altering the environment, and have been instrumental in implementing most of the environmental management policies of the government in the past. The community is highly in favor of keeping cottages, because they contribute significantly to the local economy, not only during holiday periods, but with long-term investment and lasting contributions. It makes no sense environmentally, economically, or emotionally to divest the lands of these historic, financially sound, and low impact cottages.

I am aware that some 'comments' are going to be factual, backed by hard evidence and collected data. However, I believe as humans we have the obligation to look past facts and rely on our moral compass for guidance when it comes to tough decisions, like this. As Canadians, we should practice our individual social responsibility, and try to understand the impacts that the final decision will have, not only based on economic factors, but how this will effect the lives of the hundreds of families and friends alike that rely on this community as a source of happiness and stability.
I have being going to my families cottage that resides in Rondeau Provincial Park since I was born. I attended lessons the Rondeau Yacht Club for 12 years, and I was an instructor there for three years. My time in Rondeau has taught three very important lessons other than knowing how to sail, swim, and fish. Rondeau has taught me the importance of family, nature, and community.
Life has changed for most of us in the modern world, I am almost certain that who ever is reading this has at least once in their life felt the overwhelming pressures of school, work, bills, or any other stressful demand. Through this, it can be easy to disregard the importance of family. Family dinners are often forgotten, and the traditional family life style is barley present in our current society. Thankfully my relationship with my family is very strong, and I can thank the time spent in Rondeau for this. I am very lucky that I have been able to spend my summers cooking and eating with my family in our cottage, swimming and fishing with them at the beach, and biking and walking along the many trails Rondeau park has to offer. By spending time in Rondeau, I have been able to understand the significance of family and I hope that one day I will be able to raise my family, the same way my parents have with me, bringing them to Rondeau, escaping the pressures of the outside world, and creating life long memories.
Coming from a big city, I know first hand, it is easy to lose touch with nature. Growing up in Rondeau, each summer I was able to learn about and enjoy nature with first hand experience. Some of my most vivid memories come from watching monarch butterflies hatch from their chrysalis, making sure turtle eggs were not eaten by raccoons, and searching for blue-tailed skinks in the dunes. I am confident that any growing child who has ever had the opportunity to spend a summer in Rondeau has developed a deep respect for nature. Most of my childhood friends would spend the summer in the city, sitting inside watching T.V or playing video games. Like most cottages in Rondeau,  where my cottage is located we have absolutely zero cell service, meaning all iPhones and technology is put down once we enter the cottage. This alone allowed myself, along with my siblings and summer friends to enjoy summer as it was in the past. If you wanted to catch your friend up on the latest gossip, you had to ride your bike down to their cottage. Online chat rooms were abandoned and traded for beach-glass hunting and bonfires. As a millenial myself, I see the disconnect that my generation has with the environment, i've been fortunate enough to now be able to appreciate what the earth has to offer and that would not have been possible without my summer cottage.  One of Rondeau's greatest gifts to its residents is the connection with nature that it provides, for many young and old a relationship with the outdoors has been formed.
Finally, I would like to discuss the community in Rondeau. 'Rondonians' as some like to say, are the heart of Rondeau Park. Rondeau in itself is a family, no matter the season a Rondonian is a friendly face that you are able to have a good time with. Even when spending 10 months away from your cottage pals, the second you meet again its like noting ever changed. What I also find very unique about  the Rondeau community is the way the young and the old interact, at any party you will find an age range from new borns to whatever the age of the oldest Rondonian might be, yet there is never a lack of conversation or fun. Each cottager is welcoming, no matter who you are, what you look like, or how you got there, there is always a place set for you at the table. My best friends come from Rondeau, and I am confident they are the people that will be there by my side no matter the circumstance. Through my time teaching at the Yacht Club I have seen many new families welcomed with open arms, finding a place within the community and then inviting their friends into the growing Rondeau family.
Therefore, Rondeau has not only been a crucial part of my development but I truly believe it touches the lives of anyone that steps foot into the park. More than a decade ago I was made aware that my summer home may be forced to close it's doors forever. It's hard to believe but even when I was that young I used to imagine what I would do to prevent such a tragedy. Although never sent, I would write letters to the 'government' and plead my case as to why Rondeau is so important to me. It's scary to think that such a time has come, and I am currently pleading my case once again. I realize it's difficult to understand if you haven't actually had the opportunity to experience what these cottagers have, and even this letter does not do Rondeau justice, but by ending the lease, or raising taxes to the planned amount, you are forcing the displacement of a family. You are separating loved ones. You are destroying the opportunity of future generations to experience what I have been so lucky too. Rondeau has become its own entity, loved and cared for by its hundreds of cottagers. If you wouldn't separate a mother from its child, you would not force these cottagers to leave, or push outrageous taxes that most are unable to afford. There comes a time that the Canadian government should stop focusing on regulations, obligations, and finances. This is that time. There is a chance to preserve a community, unlike any-other, one that has escaped the outside world and able to live in harmony without distractions from technology or corporate life. We as Canadians should realize the importance of such a magic place, and use are moral compass.
I will end with one last thought to the reader. Last year, I had the opportunity to live in Switzerland, I traveled to more than 10 countries, and visited over 50 cities/villages.  I assure you that I saw the most amazing places. I was able to hike up the Swiss alps, walk the streets of Belgium, dine in the heart of Italy, sail along the coast of Spain and watch the sunset on a greek islands, but I never missed home. The harsh truth is that I did not miss my home town once, and I barely missed anyone from my old school, job, and community.  However, anytime that I got a slight glimpse of a lake, a forest, or even a monarch butterfly, I couldn't wait to be back in Rondeau. Although I've been lucky to travel across the world, visiting many beautiful landscapes, nothing has been able to compare the sunset over the Rondeau bay, no air felt as fresh, and no community has been as welcoming. No matter where I go in the world Rondeau will always be my true home.

37680,/comment/37680,"As a long time cottage owner and multi-generational cottager for Northern Muskoka, I am saddened to hear the proposed cottagers of Rondeau park to vacate their property.
Many cottagers have a long standing reputation of correct environmental practices and respect for the land in which they live on. In addition to being large contributors to the community they live part time in and supporters of provincial and local initiatives. Removing this community in the park will have large scale and long term negative impacts.

The cottagers not only support local business owners and community groups.  The amount of money the lease/taxes and additional fees the park charges certainly are good for the parks over all management and helps the ability to upgrade facilities and fund programming.    I know we would not be buying 5 annual park passes each and every year if there was no longer a cottage to visit. Not to mention all the additional entry permits purchased by guests who I should add have also come back to use the camping facilities.
The community in Rondeau has always been strong, and these structures have been a part of Rondeau's history longer than I have been alive.  Encourage the residents to be more environmentally sustainable and get involved in the programming the park has to offer.
There is a lot of potential if your willing to explore it and work together to make the cottaging community one the park can be proud of.

37719,/comment/37719,"I am a full supporter of ERO 019-090- a lease extension for the cottage lots within the park. This is for three reasons.
First, while there are 287 cottage lots in the park, the number of priceless memories formed or will be formed in the park because of these cottage is exponentially higher. My family, and hundred of others who either own or have rented cottages in Rondeau, have built years and years of memories that are associated with Rondeau.
Second, within an area (Chatham-Kent) that has seen some decline over the past 30 years, tourism represents a potential industry of growth and the cottagers are an important part of that. My family has spent countless dollars supporting small businesses in the Ridgetown and Blenheim area over the past 20 years and we are proud to do so.
Third, and most importantly, I am convinced that there is no better way to conserve the nature of the park than to have a large, permanent constituency that annually benefits from it. Should the leases not be renewed, I fear that the only people who will care about the park are a handful of environmental advocacy groups and the Ministry of Environment. The conservation efforts within the park are strongest when there is a strong group of people who firmly believe in the importance of maintaining the park's natural beauty. The cottagers have been a part of this group and will continue to be in the future.
Thank you for your consideration.

37720,/comment/37720,"There is an extreme lack of on-line detail about the proposal to extend leases in the park. The only on-line supporting material is the 2010 ERO posting and its 2017 update. To force those who wish to comment substantively to call the office to find out if more info is available, and to then have to request a copy, is a process of obfuscation.
Notwithstanding the above, I am opposed to any extension of leases in Rondeau Prov Park. I strongly recommend that the ministry exercise its right to buy back leases, and not to renew any lease at its expiry or before.
I strongly oppose the long-term occupation of cottage lots in Rondeau Provincial Park. Whether the government plans to provide long-term lease extensions or, worse, to sell the lots to cottagers, either option is inappropriate, and contrary to provincial law and policy.
Rondeau provides refuge for more than 80 species at risk (the highest found in any Ontario Provincial Park) and more than 300 significant plant species. The cottages and associated activities are harming the park’s rare and endangered wildlife and vulnerable forest, wetland, dune and savannah ecosystems.
The need to put nature first in this small and extremely biodiverse Provincial Park could not be more obvious. Private cottages are demonstrably incompatible with this goal. We have far too little left of our natural habitats and ecosystems.

37803,/comment/37803,"Re: ERO Notice 019-0907 Rondeau Provincial Park
I am very disappointed to learn that the Government of Ontario is again considering an extension to the leases of private cottages in Rondeau Provincial Park. The Government of Ontario has previously acknowledged the need to phase out private cottages in provincial protected areas.
Ontario’s Provincial Parks should be accessible to ordinary citizens for their recreational enjoyment and not be reserved for privileged cottagers. Demand for natural spaces has grown significantly in the last 15 years and extending leases is counter productive.
Most of Rondeau’s 282 private cottage lots occupying about 67% of the park’s Lake Erie shoreline are within its nationally rare freshwater dune ecosystems. Government assessments indicate the private cottages are causing harm to species at risk and vegetation communities. Assessments also indicate elevated concentrations of phosphorous and nitrates in groundwater, the release of contaminants in soils and sediments, and erosion, all caused because of the cottages, and their owners, along the sensitive shoreline.
Rondeau is renowned for its exceptional biodiversity because of its significant habitats that provide sanctuary for over 80 species at risk, the highest of any Ontario Provincial Park.
The proposed three-year extension of the leases while the government contemplates “an alternative option for the long-term occupation of cottage lots in Rondeau Provincial Park.” is extremely worrisome. This sounds like “long-term occupation” by cottagers is being contemplated. Long term extensions should not be made to any leases. Cottage owners have known for many years that their time in the park was limited. Now is the time to make it very clear that leases will not be extended further and that the land upon which they sit will remain park property and be naturalized as soon as current leases expire. This is property that belongs to the citizens of the province and should remain property for the people of the province!
A proposal for long term cottage occupation of the park is contrary to Ontario’s Provincial Parks management principle of maintaining ecological integrity and leaving habitats unimpaired for future generations. Private cottages in the park do not support this goal but instead are diametrically opposed to it. This unique landscape with its extraordinary biodiversity including over 80 species at risk and over 300 nationally, provincially or locally significant plant species must be protected.
I urge this government to act upon its own management principle and move forward in a manner which supports the goal of maintaining ecological integrity. Support nature and the citizens of Ontario, not just cottagers.

37813,/comment/37813,"Forgive me for my cynicism, but if the leases were terminated in 2017, and not complied with or enforced - why on earth would anyone believe an extension would also be complied with and enforced? The government of the day clearly has no plan to enforce a termination of a contract and rather than manage that, aims to extend and extend again until they do. Until 2038, who knows, by then the whole Park may be submerged?
NO EXTENSION> TIME IS UP>
Let all Ontarians return to enjoy these precious Parks while we still have them, and their biodiversity. With climate change they will all face their challenges, but allowing humans to continue their often ""suburban"" lifestyles in such a place is counter productive, UNFAIR and unjustly subsidizing a small sector of society. Never mind all the effects on wildlife facing so many challenges in survival.
No more cottages in Provincial Parks. Period.

37815,/comment/37815,"I support the current ERO 091-0907 proposal to extend the Rondeau Provincial Park Cottage leases for an additional 3 years for the purposes of consulting on an option for a long term occupation of those cottage lots. I support that this 3 year extension be automatically granted to all cottages owners/leaseholders in the Park. Further, I would support any long term option that provides for 1) leases in perpetuity, subject only to future lease cost adjustments and future adjustments as may be necessary to comply with future building code requirements, 2) that any future cost adjustments to these perpetual leases be limited to a reasonable escalator tied to the cost of living, 3) that the leases be transferable to ANY person who may purchase any cottage from an existing owner, 4) that leaseholders be required to maintain their lots and cottages in compliance with any reasonable restrictions imposed by the Ministry, but that the Ministry also be required to keep such restrictions reasonable, and not simply be able to use such restrictions to force cottagers out.
The Park and the cottages have co-existed (as such) since the inception of the Park - over 120 years, and there is no reason to think they cannot continue to co-exist, and mutually care for the Park.

It seems that there has been a series of short term extensions for cottagers at Rondeau Provincial Park.

The enviromental impact of these cottages is minimal to say the least. And in my opinon our Enviromental Agencies have gone way past the acceptable limit of their scope and powers. Canada is an enormous country with lots of room for everyone to share without putting so much as a dent into any ecological systems. Everyone needs to start using their vote to repeal the powers of our over zealous Enviromental Agencies. The owners of cottages in Rondeau have gone through enough stess dealing with these stubborn policies.

37967,/comment/37967,"I do not support the extension of cottage leases in Rondeau Provincial Park. The leases should be terminated to permit people to move on to new cottage developments outside the park (new development activity for the Province), and allow the park to fulfill its mandated function as an ecological protection area for the potential enjoyment of all Ontarians and visitors (implementation of Provincial Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry mandate).
The Chatham-Kent area where the Park is situated needs to be re-balanced in its overall human development-environment protected features equation. Currently, less than 10% of the land area is comprised of natural features (see community's Official Plan natural heritage policy section). According to Environment Canada's ""How much Habitat is Enough"" 2013 publication, a minimum threshold of 30% of protected natural areas is necessary to maintain a healthy and resilient land base. Furthermore, in a 2013 publication by the University of Guelph (School of Environmental Design and Rural Development author's Wayne Caldwell and Kelsey Lang) entitled ""Chatham-Kent Trees, Forests and Woodlots A Literature Review"" reported that forest cover was less than 4% in the overall area.  Every effort should be made now to help increase natural cover in the Chatham-Kent area, and this would include removing private development within Rondeau Provincial Park.

There is absolutely NO PROOF that cottages have harmed this environment.  If some group thinks that a road kill is hurting a species in the Park, they need to be informed that cottages have created habitat for that same species for the entire time of cottages in that Park. If these people like to protect all nature, then they had better all become Vegetarins and walk very carefully to work, and not be riding in any vehicle that creates any road kill.  There has to be a balance with this, and the Cottages have always done more than their fair share in protecting these species.
The truth be known, was there any of these species at risk ever in Rondeau before Cottages came on the scene.
Take this 3 year extension period to get a long term or permanent commitment to cottaging in Rondeau.

38018,/comment/38018,"My families Cottage in Rondeau Park has been thoroughly enjoyed by three generations of family members.  Recently a 4th generation has begun experiencing the joys of cottaging in Rondeau Park.
Fundamentally we wish to continue to utilize our family cottage as we have done so for the last 40+ years.  As a hub during the summer for bringing family together from all over South-West Ontario.
Logically, I see no reason for the Provincial government to violate Rondeau's Charter which established Rondeau as location for cottaging all the way back in 1894.
The Cottagers support the local Chatham Kent community by shopping in their stores and hiring contractors for repairs.  Many cottagers have been putting off repairs to their property do to the Provincial Governments lack of commitment to a long and established community.
The Cottages also support the Ontario Parks department and Provincial government through their leases, buying park passes and now paying property tax on leased land.  My family buys at least 3 Park passes every year to support the coming and going to the cottages.
Independent environmental impact studies have concluded the cottages pose no significant risk to the many unique and endangered animals that also call Rondeau home.  The cottages make up less then 1% of all the land in the Rondeau Provincial park.   Many cottagers view the unique environment of Rondeau as something that should be protected and actively participate in the stewardship of this environment.
Ultimately, the Ontario Provincial Government should be attempting to establish a permanent solution in regards to Rondeau Provincial Park.  I think ultimately the Provincial Government should recognize the historic contribution the cottagers have played in Rodeau Park and the stewardship they have engaged in.  The Ontario Government should recognize the interests of Chatham Kent Government which has attempted to back and protect the Rondeau Cottages from continued dismantlement.
Ultimately I would like see the Ontario Provincial Government for once back the little guy.  The cottages of Rondeau are modest sometimes century old cottages.  They are often collectively owned/shared among family members from relatively modest backgrounds out of cities such as Windsor, Chatham and London.  Failure to support the continuation of Cottages in Rondeau is throwing away over 100 years of South Western Ontario history.

Dear Senior Project Coordinator,
Re: ERO # 019-0907 Proposed amendments to the Rondeau Provincial Park Management Plan
On behalf of the under-signed organizations, we would like to express our opposition to the extension of cottage leases in Rondeau Provincial Park for the purpose of consulting on “the long-term occupation of cottage lots in Rondeau Provincial Park.” For over 60 years the Government of Ontario has acknowledged the need to phase out private cottages in provincial protected areas, such as Rondeau Provincial Park. To now contemplate “long-term occupation” is unacceptable given Rondeau’s exceptional biodiversity values and the known harm caused by the cottages and associated activities.
Abandoning commitment to phase out Rondeau cottages
In 1954, when the Government of Ontario passed the Provincial Parks Act, it reversed its policy of supporting private cottaging in provincial parks. Accordingly, in 1960, it announced that existing cottage leases in Rondeau, once they expired, would not be extended beyond 21 years. There were several subsequent extensions of the expiry dates, however, including most recently to December 31, 2019. The purpose of the current proposal, which is to provide three years to consult on “the long-term occupation of cottage lots in Rondeau Provincial Park,” suggests that the government intends to step away from its long-standing commitment to phase out the cottages and is targeting long-term occupation instead. Yet the ERO posting provides no rationale or evidence to support this dramatic reversal in policy direction.
Nor has the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) provided any information on the long-term options it is considering. Sale of the cottages is one of the rumoured options, another being the granting of 99-year leases. Senior Program Coordinator of the Cottage Lot Program, Sandy Dobbyn, was “not at liberty” to confirm or deny these rumours or to discuss the options for long-term occupation being considered by MECP, when contacted by Ontario Nature on December 3, 2019. Regardless, long-term occupation in any form is bad news for Rondeau and the people of Ontario for the reasons outlined below.
Jeopardizing Rondeau’s exceptional biodiversity values
Rondeau is renowned for its exceptional biodiversity which includes rare dune, prairie and savannah ecosystems (12 of which are critically imperiled and seven of which are provincially significant), a provincially significant wetland, and the largest remaining tract of deciduous forest in Carolinian Canada. These ecosystems provide habitat for over 80 species at risk, the highest of any Ontario Provincial Park, including prothonotary warbler, Fowler’s toad, five-lined skink, spotted gar and nodding pogonia (one of only two locations in Canada for this endangered wildflower). Over 300 nationally, provincially or locally significant plant species, and over 1,700 insect species – many of which are found in only a few places in Ontario – are also among its inhabitants.
Rondeau is located on a cuspate sand spit, a provincially significant earth science feature found nowhere else in Canada. The park is also a globally and nationally significant Important Bird Area and a provincially significant life and earth science Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI). It is situated in Chatham-Kent, which has only about four percent natural cover remaining - less than any other upper tier municipality in Ontario. The need to put nature first in this small, unique and extremely biodiverse Provincial Park could not be more obvious.
Contravening dedication of Provincial Parks to the people of Ontario
Ontario’s provincial parks are dedicated to the public:
Parks dedicated to the public
6. Ontario’s provincial parks and conservation reserves are dedicated to the people of Ontario and visitors for their inspiration, education, health, recreational enjoyment and other benefits with the intention that these areas shall be managed to maintain their ecological integrity and to leave them unimpaired for future generations.  (Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act, 2005, sec. 6)
Everyone should have equal access to the many benefits they provide, not just privileged cottagers. Yet the cottages occupy 67 percent of the park’s Lake Erie shoreline. Long-term occupation means long-term denial of public access to and enjoyment of these areas.
More importantly, long-term occupation will mean continued negative impacts to the park’s wildlife and ecosystems. According to a 2017 environmental assessment (Category B project under A Class Environmental Assessment for Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves) the private cottages are not only causing harm to species at risk and rare vegetation communities, but are also leading to elevated concentrations of phosphorous and nitrates in groundwater, the release of contaminants in soils and sediments, and erosion. These negative impacts are the result of cottage structures, vegetation removal and mowing, foot paths, road mortality, invasive species introduction, pets (dogs and cats) and more. Long-term occupation thus contravenes the legal duty to manage the park so as to leave it unimpaired for future generations.
Conclusion
The need to put nature first in this small and extremely biodiverse protected area could not be more obvious. The proposal for long-term occupation of the park runs contrary to the guiding management principle for Ontario’s Provincial Parks, which is to maintain ecological integrity.
3. The following principles shall guide all aspects of the planning and management of Ontario’s system of provincial parks and conservation reserves:
1. Maintenance of ecological integrity shall be the first priority and the restoration of ecological integrity shall be considered.
(Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act, 2005, sec. 3)
We do not support the three-year extension of the cottage leases, especially for the purpose of consulting on long-term occupation. Government consultations on this issue have been going on for almost 10 years, and it is time the government honoured its long-standing commitment to bring the leases to an end and turned its attention to restoring and maintaining ecological integrity in Rondeau Provincial Park.

38140,/comment/38140,"Dear sirs,
On behalf of my wife and myself, I wish to express our strong support for the proposed three year extension of the cottage leases at Rondeau Provincial Park ( ""Rondeau""),  as well as our strong support for extending them on a long- term basis.
The cottagers at Rondeau bring a sense of community to the park, which very much enhances the experience. This sense of community has a long history at Rondeau, spanning many generations. People, like ourselves, who are cottagers,  have grown up enjoying the park. We understand the importance of maintaining special places like Rondeau and all that it has to offer. We see ourselves as custodians of this special place and strive to enhance it and protect it while, at the same time,. sharing the experience with those who camp or use the park for day trips to the beach or for picnics ,etc. The park is large enough to accommodate all who wish to use it without difficulty.
The cottagers also provide a substantial economic boast each year to the nearby communities of Blenheim, Ridgetown , Chatham and all of Chatham-Kent , with their purchases food, gas and other supplies which, unlike those camping in the park, continues throughout the summer season.
We very much hope that the decision is made to extend the leases both on a three year basis and on a long term basis so this can continue for generations to come.
Respectfully,
D.B. and L.B.

Please extend the lease for this cottage community.  It is so very important to the families that enjoy their cottages.

We have been visited the park many times, and believe the combination of cottages, campers and day visitors is ideal.  It is unfortunate that the cottage owners have no stability, as I know they add a lot of stability  to the local community.  But just as important to our family and friends is the uniqueness of the Park, and teaching our kids about the Caroliniana Forests and birdwatching , and having them love and appreciate nature.
I am in support of this proposal to allow the cottagers to have long term stability by at a minimum extending the 3 year lease.  I believe and support a long term solution so this tradition and access can be enjoyed by all for a long long time to come, and a win win for all!

I know some people who have a cottage there, and they have understood for many years that this day would come.  They understand that the land needs to be returned to natural habitat.
It's in the provincial interest to get the land back for all of us to enjoy and provide much needed space for the plants and animals that live there.

I have experienced first hand the long lasting, generational positive effects this cottage community provides family and friends. This community brings family members together.....grandparents,
parents, siblings, children and grandchildren . This community provides a place for elders to teach children to respect and be responsible for the local environment.  Please allow this to continue.

RE: Proposed amendments to the Rondeau Provincial Park Management Plan, ERO number: 019-0907
Dear Senior Project Coordinator,
Birds Canada (formerly “Bird Studies Canada”) is pleased to provide comments on the proposed amendments to the Rondeau Provincial Park Management Plan, and we thank Ontario Parks for the opportunity to provide input. Birds Canada strongly opposes the proposal to extend cottage leases at Rondeau Provincial Park for the reasons outlined below.
Birds Canada is the country’s leading non-governmental organization dedicated to the understanding, appreciation, and conservation of wild birds. A registered charity, Birds Canada’s mission is to conserve wild birds of Canada through sound science, on-the-ground actions, innovative partnerships, public engagement, and science-based advocacy. The organization is science based with dozens of research, conservation, and outreach programs operating across Canada. To advance its mission, Birds Canada is proud to collaborate with tens of thousands of volunteer Citizen Scientists, scores of conservation partners, and numerous governmental organizations and agencies. Given Birds Canada’s mandate, history, and programs, the Rondeau Provincial Park Management Plan is of great interest to the organization.
Rondeau Provincial Park (RPP) is one of the last remaining strongholds of Canadian Carolinian forests, rare and globally endangered tallgrass prairie, and oak savanna (1). RPP is part of the dynamic Lake Erie shoreline dune habitat and includes important wetlands which can be damaged by human activity. RPP acts as an important stopover habitat for migrating birds and insects, and is a prominent site along the north shore of Lake Erie that draws in large numbers of birds representing hundreds of species during migration (2). Additionally, the RPP webpage highlights the fact that the park provides habitat for more Species at Risk than any other Provincial Park, including the Five-lined Skink, Fowler’s Toad, Spotted Gar, and Prothonotary Warbler. RPP provides vital breeding habitat for some of the last remaining Prothonotary Warblers in Ontario. This endangered and declining species is threatened by habitat loss and parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbird (3), which increase in areas of human development.
Birds Canada believes that the amendments, as proposed, are a missed opportunity to advance Ontario’s commitments to the 2006 Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act, meant to “permanently protect representative ecosystems, biodiversity and provincially significant elements of Ontario’s natural and cultural heritage and to manage these areas to ensure that ecological integrity is maintained (4).” The continued presence of cottages at RPP reflects a missed opportunity to advance protections of the park’s ecologically significant areas, which includes an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area, a Provincially Significant Wetland, and an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. The recurring extensions of cottage leases threaten the ecological integrity of the park ecosystem, contrary to the commitments and intentions of the Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act. This is particularly concerning considering Ontario’s commitment to expand the Protected Areas Network, specifically in the Mixedwood Plains ecozone, where RPP is located (5). Such an action would also run contrary to efforts to expand protected areas nationally and internationally as part of Canada’s commitment to the Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, meant to conserve 17% of terrestrial and 10% of coastal and marine “areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services” by 2020 (6).
Birds Canada opposes the proposal to extend the current cottage leases at Rondeau Provincial Park. We encourage Ontario Parks and the Government of Ontario not to renew the private cottage leases in Rondeau Provincial Park, and to seek opportunities to uphold and strengthen measures which put ecological integrity at the forefront of management decisions at RPP – and all of Ontario’s protected areas. We understand the complexity of balancing natural resource protection with human enjoyment of public spaces, however, in Provincial Parks and Conserved Areas, we support the principle that “maintenance of ecological integrity shall be the first priority (4).”
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed changes to the Rondeau Provincial Park Management Plan. We would be pleased to provide additional input or to answer any questions you may have regarding our submission.
Yours sincerely,
Senior Conservation Advisor and Ontario Director at Birds Canada

Senior Project Coordinator
Ontario Parks - Issues Management, Coordination and Planning Section
Regarding the proposed 3 year extension to the 285 private leases in Rondeau Provincial Park, it is time for this government to stop waffling and take firm action!  This has been going on for more than 50 years.   Rondeau is a precious gem of Carolinian diversity and unique land forms, private holdings have no place in the park!  We are in an era of unprecedented species loss--and unacceptable weakening of legislative protection!--this site must be protected from private encroachment!
I am asking you to:
--not extend the current leases in Rondeau (this has been a Government Policy since 1960--time for decisive action!)
--prioritize ecological integrity through a revised Park Management Plan.
--remove existing buildings, unnatural nutrient-rich soils and exotic plantings and restore the sites to natural conditions of the park.
Rondeau is Ontario's irreplaceable Carolinian biodiversity gem!  If the Ontario government needs guidance for phasing out cottages and restoring natural parks, Parks Canada has a good example at Point Pelee National Park where cottages were phased out and sites restored more than 40 years ago.  Ontario Parks also has many knowledgeable staff, talk with them!  Read the many reports that have been produced documenting the damage that the cottages have done to the park.

38393,/comment/38393,"Rondeau Provincial Park is a precious resource for endangered species. Since 1060, the governments have planned on ending private leases on land inside the park. NOW IS NOT THE TIME to renege on this promise to protect the park from human damage. Instead the only sensible action to take is to restore these lots to their natural condition asap.  This is NOT an expensive operation. (see RARE, Blair, ON)
It is mandatory to retain these small areas of protected lands in order to maintain healthy ecosystems for our children's future.
Thank you for your sensible consideration.

38397,/comment/38397,"Extending private leases and their harm to imperiled species and ecosystems during an extinction crisis is unacceptable. Provincial Parks are meant to protect wildlife, natural environments, and be available to all citizens for light, temporary recreation. Several hundred private and privileged elite do not have more rights than do wildlife or the majority of Canadian/Ontario citizens. There have been enough extensions, delays and stalling. Please end these leases now and return the land to a natural state.

38398,/comment/38398,"A short-term extension of the Rondeau cottage leases is necessary and inevitable given the government’s lack of action on a long-term solution since the last extension. The cottage community has existed for a century and was in fact one of the pillars supporting the creation of the park. Cottagers have proven to be responsible stewards of the park, much more than so many in the transient community of campers who use the park as a party destination or a trailer park. As cottagers who live near the campground, we have seen many first-hand examples of campers who do not treat the ecosystem of the park with nearly as much respect as the cottagers. It would be an illusion to say that the removal of the cottages, which occupy such a small percentage of the Rondeau lands, would be a positive step for the environment. The environmental impact of all of the deconstruction and waste that removal would require would be significant, and would far outweigh the environmental impact of keeping the cottages with their responsible caretakers. Ontario Parks has been excellent at ensuring that the cottagers act in ways that promote the delicate ecosystem, and they will continue to do that until the long-term solution is found.

38468,/comment/38468,"I believe the Ministry has had since December 2017 to ""come up"" with a long term proposal for cottagers at Rondeau Provincial Park.  It is hard to understand why an additional 3 years is required to find this solution considering that Algonquin has received their extension in December 2017.  It is also hard to understand why the Ministry may be questioning if cottages should remain in the park and why the extension will not be granted on December 31, 2019 as expected two years ago.
It is a known fact that the affect on our region will be financially dismal for many companies and service organizations should cottages be removed.  Real estate will remain stagnant for 3 more years and existing cottage owners will be left in the ""gray"" area for 3 more years not knowing what to do or where their future lays in Rondeau.  One wonders if this extension is a strategy for the 1% to buy some cheap lake front real estate over the next 3 years from vulnerable cottage owners not knowing the fate of their property that has been owned by their families for generations.  Time will tell.
In my opinion, a 3 year extension is so unfair for so many.  I promote making the decision for a long term solution now.

Over the years I have spent countless weeks with my wife and her family at their cottage and couldn’t imagine life without it. Everyone is respectful of the wildlife and the cottagers add a lot to the economic life of the surrounding area. Thanks for the opportunity to have my say.

Private cottages occupy just a tiny portion of the park and contribute significant funds into the provincial park system that allows smaller parks to spend more money than they bring in.  I hope that the cottages can remain in Rondeau forever so future generations of families can enjoy growing-up with nature.  Provincial parks should not be the exclusive domain of environmentalists and government employees.

I am a US resident and citizen. My family has had a summer cottage in Rondeau since they built it in 1924. We have supported Chatham/Kent economically for almost 100 years with a unique revenue stream that would not have been available without Rondeau cottages. We share a deep love and commitment to the Park and the north shore of Lake Erie and are committed to continuing that support. In order to do so, we need the Rondeau cottage community.

In addition, I believe that the campground activities should also be scaled back (not eliminated).  Action is needed to help preserve biodiversity.  My understanding is that Rondeau has the greatest number of species at risk for any park in Ontario.  Human activity in the area must be reduced to aid in their preservation.

Dear Minister Yurek,
I strongly agree for the long-term occupation of cottage lots in Rondeau Provincial Park. Whether the government plans to provide long-term lease extensions or to sell the lots to cottagers, either option is appropriate, and supports provincial law and policy.
Rondeau cottage structures provides refuge for more than 80 species at risk (the highest found in any Ontario Provincial Park  . The cottages and associated activities protect the park’s rare and endangered wildlife.
Private cottages are compatible with this goal.

The cottages have been an integral part of the Park's history and represent the cultural history of the Park. The cottages only take up a tiny fraction of the land within the Park and I believe cottage owners are committed to protecting the ecology of the Park.  Having cottages in the park does not equate to a negative impact on the ecology of the Park. Park's are meant for the enjoyment of all visitors - and Rondeau has supported this vision since the Park's inception through carefully managed cottage use and programs for day visitors.

Why can't you get your act together?  You should be embarrassed that it has taken this long to make a decision that should have been made years ago!!! Without our tax dollars the park would surely suffer and most likely fold. If the Cottagers leave so does the income to the surrounding towns and the traffic inside the park will dwindle. Think of all those summer passes that won't get bought! Why the park can't even afford to fix the Government Dock that many have come to visit over the years.
In the beginning the Government was the one that offered to lease the land in order to fund the park, so all can enjoy what it has to offer. Seems to me that you have forgotten who is the real backbone at Rondeau. Do what you must, just remember what's at stake, this decision is a heavy one.

39185,/comment/39185,"I am writing in support of the 3 yr lease extension, ERO 019-0907 policy proposal, in order allow time for the creation of a long-term solution that allows Rondeau cottagers to remain in Rondeau in perpetuity.
I'm an American, but my great grandfather, whose name I share, built a cabin on Rondeau peninsula 100 years ago. Since then it has been an important part of my culture and upbringing to engage with Canada through its provincial parks and the Chatham-Kent area. I hope someday to take my own kids there as a way to stay in touch with our Canadian family.
Rondeau hosts not only historical homes built over 100 years ago, but also acts as a revenue stream for the parks themselves. Cottagers don't engage in heavy landscaping or beachfront vegetation removal, and help to provide financial support for the programs in the parks that help to defend the ecological conditions of the parks throughout the province. We also provide a unique stream of revenue to the surrounding communities, whose small businesses would suffer from a sudden withdrawal of customers.
If there are behaviors that need to change, or ways that we could benefit the wetlands, I'm sure that the cottagers would be all for them. The entire reason that our family home is valuable (to me at least) IS the park and the wildlife.

39220,/comment/39220,"On behalf of the Wilderness Committee and our thousands of supporters across Ontario, I am writing to express opposition to the extension of cottage leases in Rondeau Provincial Park for the purpose of consulting on “the long-term occupation of cottage lots in Rondeau Provincial Park.” For over 60 years the Government of Ontario has acknowledged the need to phase out private cottages in provincial protected areas, such as Rondeau Provincial Park. To now contemplate “long-term occupation” is unacceptable given Rondeau’s exceptional biodiversity values and the known harm caused by the cottages and associated activities.
Abandoning commitment to phase out Rondeau cottages
In 1954, when the Government of Ontario passed the Provincial Parks Act, it reversed its policy of supporting private cottaging in provincial parks. Accordingly, in 1960, it announced that existing cottage leases in Rondeau, once they expired, would not be extended beyond 21 years. There were several subsequent extensions of the expiry dates, however, including most recently to December 31, 2019. The purpose of the current proposal, which is to provide three years to consult on “the long-term occupation of cottage lots in Rondeau Provincial Park,” suggests that the government intends to step away from its long-standing commitment to phase out the cottages and is targeting long-term occupation instead. Yet the ERO posting provides no rationale or evidence to support this dramatic reversal in policy direction.
Nor has the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) provided any information on the long-term options it is considering. Sale of the cottages is one of the rumoured options, another being the granting of 99-year leases. Regardless, long-term occupation in any form is bad news for Rondeau and the people of Ontario for the reasons outlined below.
Jeopardizing Rondeau’s exceptional biodiversity values
Rondeau is renowned for its exceptional biodiversity which includes rare dune, prairie and savannah ecosystems (12 of which are critically imperiled and seven of which are provincially significant), a provincially significant wetland, and the largest remaining tract of deciduous forest in Carolinian Canada. These ecosystems provide habitat for over 80 species at risk, the highest of any Ontario Provincial Park, including prothonotary warbler, Fowler’s toad, five-lined skink, spotted gar and nodding pogonia (one of only two locations in Canada for this endangered wildflower). Over 300 nationally, provincially or locally significant plant species, and over 1,700 insect species – many of which are found in only a few places in Ontario – are also among its inhabitants.
Rondeau is located on a cuspate sand spit, a provincially significant earth science feature found nowhere else in Canada. The park is also a globally and nationally significant Important Bird Area and a provincially significant life and earth science Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI). It is situated in Chatham-Kent, which has only about four percent natural cover remaining - less than any other upper tier municipality in Ontario. The need to put nature first in this small, unique and extremely biodiverse Provincial Park could not be more obvious.
Contravening dedication of Provincial Parks to the people of Ontario
Ontario’s provincial parks are dedicated to the public:
Parks dedicated to the public
6. Ontario’s provincial parks and conservation reserves are dedicated to the people of Ontario and visitors for their inspiration, education, health, recreational enjoyment and other benefits with the intention that these areas shall be managed to maintain their ecological integrity and to leave them unimpaired for future generations.  (Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act, 2005, sec. 6)
Everyone should have equal access to the many benefits they provide, not just privileged cottagers. Yet the cottages occupy 67 percent of the park’s Lake Erie shoreline. Long-term occupation means long-term denial of public access to and enjoyment of these areas.
Negative Impacts of cottages:
More importantly, long-term occupation will mean continued negative impacts to the park’s wildlife and ecosystems. According to a 2017 environmental assessment (Category B project under A Class Environmental Assessment for Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves) the private cottages are not only causing harm to species at risk and rare vegetation communities, but are also leading to elevated concentrations of phosphorous and nitrates in groundwater, the release of contaminants in soils and sediments, and erosion. These negative impacts are the result of cottage structures, vegetation removal and mowing, foot paths, road mortality, invasive species introduction, pets (dogs and cats) and more. Long-term occupation thus contravenes the legal duty to manage the park so as to leave it unimpaired for future generations.
Conclusion
The need to put nature first in this small and extremely biodiverse protected area could not be more obvious. The proposal for long-term occupation of the park runs contrary to the guiding management principle for Ontario’s Provincial Parks, which is to maintain ecological integrity.
3. The following principles shall guide all aspects of the planning and management of Ontario’s system of provincial parks and conservation reserves:
1. Maintenance of ecological integrity shall be the first priority and the restoration of ecological integrity shall be considered.
(Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act, 2005, sec. 3)
We do not support the three-year extension of the cottage leases, especially for the purpose of consulting on long-term occupation. Government consultations on this issue have been going on for almost 10 years, and it is time the government honoured its long-standing commitment to bring the leases to an end and turned its attention to restoring and maintaining ecological integrity in Rondeau Provincial Park.

The reasons to extend the leases to the cottagers are plenty but from my personal experience at Rondeau, I can say that it is access to the park through the cottages is what instilled my love and passion for Ontario parks. The cottagers are very aware of their role in maintaining the natural state of the park and are very engaged its preservation. Rondeau is a great park for many reason but one of the greatest is the relationship between the park and its cottagers. This relationship must endure.

39334,/comment/39334,"I oppose the proposed extension of cottage leases in Rondeau Provincial Park.  For more than 40 years, I have been a regular visitor to Rondeau Provincial Park.  I value the park for its many important natural features.
The existence of private cottages in Rondeau Park is contrary to the purpose and objectives of the Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act.
Reports prepared for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry have documented important natural features including the following:
•	Rondeau has the highest recorded diversity of species at risk of any provincial park in Ontario
•	Over 300 species of plants in Rondeau are considered to be nationally, provincially, or locally significant
•	Rondeau Provincial Park is well known as an important area for reptile diversity and most of these are protected under the Endangered Species Act (Eastern Foxsnake, Eastern Hog-nosed Snake, Eastern Ribbonsnake, Milksnake, Five-lined Skink, Blanding’s Turtle, Map Turtle, Snapping Turtle, Fowler’s Toad).
There is no justification for extension of leases for private cottages in Rondeau Park.  It is significant to note that the cottages are located in the most threatened habitat types within the park, dune, prairie and savannah.
The termination of cottage leases in 2017 was explicitly identified in the Management Plan (1991) and remains within provincial regulations.  Leaseholders have had more than 25 years to prepare themselves for the reality that their leases will end.
The future management of Rondeau Park must focus on the permanent protection of the representative ecosystems, biodiversity and provincially significant elements of the park.  Cottage leases must be terminated, and funds must be allocated to support the removal and restoration work that must be undertaken.

I believe the 3 year extension that is being proposed is a good idea......it will give the MNR more time to realize the historical, present and future value of the cottage system to the ecological sustainability of the park....the end game being  a ""fair and objective"" outcome for the cottagers and MNR.

From my experience, the leaseholders are as sensitive as any environmentalists about Rondeau Park. We/they respect what is at stake, to enjoying & protecting the unique “Carolinian Forest” that exists at Rondeau.  I can’t comment on other parks, but having worked as a summer student at Rondeau and based on recent visits, I can assure you that “day use” visits, is a shadow of what used to be.  I have no idea how much revenue is generated by the leaseholders, to the local economy, but I can tell you how much they would contribute in their absence. As I understand, the recommendations/conditions of the proposed extension, this would be a win/win for preserving the environmental integrity of Rondeau, and even a bigger win/win for the local economy.  By extending the leases, the ministry & province have an opportunity to do what’s in the best mutual interest of all stakeholders.  I hope that you, the ministry, make the right decision.

I emphatically support the proposed three-year lease extension for all existing cottage leased lots in Rondeau Provincial Park, as described in ERO Policy Proposal 019-0907.
This new lease extension should be granted automatically to all existing leaseholders. This three year time period should be used to reach a permanent solution that will ensure the cottage community remains forever within Rondeau Park. When a permanent solution is reached prior to the three-year deadline, I support it being implemented as soon as possible.
Rondeau Park's founding charter included the presence of cottages.
The Rondeau cottage community has co-existed within the Park's ecosystem for over a century. Members of Rondeau's cottage community share an equal sense of stewardship and responsibility for preserving its unique environmental, historic and cultural treasures as any other Friend of Rondeau.
Rondeau has proven to be a model of how a Provincial Park of national significance can thrive, while balancing conservation, preservation and recreation.
Thank you.

39471,/comment/39471,"I just want to write in that I have spent many summers visiting Rondeau Provincial Park and enjoying the beach, campground, nature centre and riding bikes along the road. We always enjoy seeing the cottages and the beautiful Heritage community there and have found the cottagers very friendly and helpful.
Ontario parks should represent the diverse communities that make up our province, including heritage architecture and communities of people.
When we travel in Europe this is one of the things we most enjoy is seeing heritage communities and interacting with the people.
We are very much in favour of the cottagers staying for a  long term lease for 100 more years  at Rondeau as they have been there for a century at least and make Rondeau what it is today.
A three year extension is a good start and we are in favour of any extension preferably longer
Quoting ERO 019-0907
thanks

39500,/comment/39500,"For Consideration.
I emphatically support the proposed three-year lease extension for all existing cottage leased lots in Rondeau Provincial Park, as described in ERO Policy Proposal 019-0907.
This new lease extension should be granted automatically to all existing leaseholders. This three year time period should be used to reach a permanent solution that will ensure the cottage community remains forever within Rondeau Park. When a permanent solution is reached prior to the three-year deadline, I support it being implemented as soon as possible.
Rondeau Park's founding charter included the presence of cottages.
The Rondeau cottage community has co-existed within the Park's ecosystem for over a century. Members of Rondeau's cottage community share an equal sense of stewardship and responsibility for preserving its unique environmental, historic and cultural treasures as any other Friend of Rondeau.
Rondeau has proven to be a model of how a Provincial Park of national significance can thrive, while balancing conservation, preservation and recreation.
Thank you.

39505,/comment/39505,"In support of ERO 019-0907.
Please proceed with temporary lease extension in order to arrive at a long term permanent solution for the occupation of cottage lots within Rondeau Provincial Park.
When considering the number of Ontario provincial parks and conservation areas, and the occupation rates overall it is quite apparent that the original decision made in the 1950's to eliminate cottages from Rondeau Park is no longer applicable. In reality, that decision has not made any sense for the past 25 years.
In addition, the fact that the 'footprint' of cottage lots represents less than 2% of the overall area of Rondeau Park, the environmental impact of cottages is immeasurable particularly when compared to the overall negative impact of campers and day users on the Park.

I very much support the long term tenure of the Rondeau Cottage Community. I support the 3-year lease extension as described in ERO Policy Proposal 019-0907, but hope that a permanent solution is reached before then. This lease extension should be granted automatically to all existing leaseholders who are excellent stewards of Rondeau Provincial Park.

Since 1894, when lots were first surveyed, cottaging has been a part of the Rondeau Park community. The cottagers take great pride in the park, actively promoting the betterment of the park, protecting, preserving and promoting Rondeau’s natural and historical environment. I support the continuation of the Rondeau Cottage Community, they are excellent stewards of the park.

I emphatically support the proposed three-year lease extension for all existing cottage leased lots in Rondeau Provincial Park, as described in ERO Policy Proposal 019-0907.
This new lease extension should be granted automatically to all existing leaseholders. This three year time period should be used to reach a permanent solution that will ensure the cottage community remains forever within Rondeau Park. When a permanent solution is reached prior to the three-year deadline, I support it being implemented as soon as possible.
Rondeau Park's founding charter included the presence of cottages.
The Rondeau cottage community has co-existed within the Park's ecosystem for over a century. Members of Rondeau's cottage community share an equal sense of stewardship and responsibility for preserving its unique environmental, historic and cultural treasures as any other Friend of Rondeau.
Rondeau has proven to be a model of how a Provincial Park of national significance can thrive, while balancing conservation, preservation and recreation.

39818,/comment/39818,"I am in favour of the ERO 019-907 policiy proposal which gives both parties, the government of Ontario and the cottagers time to work out their differences – as it stands currently the due diligence necesssary on the part of MNRF to achieve a reasonable, measured outcome is yet to be completed. Hence a second extension.
The early history of Rondeau Provincial Park is one that aimed at welcoming people: cottagers, campers, daytrippers, etc. to use and enjoy this special parcel of land, marsh and forest. I am of the opinion that their presence in the park is on the decline. The rising fees for all users. The loss of boating access. The destruction of the public dock. The decline of the observation tower on the Marsh Road. The inadequate recyclling program available in the park. None of these measures are indicative of a Ministry that is invested in encouraging people to make use of what Rondeau has to offer in terms of opportunities for recreatiion, education, and encouraging environmental awarness, biodiversity, and respect for the world we live in. The future of the cottagers is part and parcel of the challenge facing the people of Ontarion to assure a way of life that is in harmony with the natural world. Why can living permanently in Rondeau not be part of a plan to promote a viable, dynamic, use of the natural resources available?
Let us give this proposal a fair shake!

39830,/comment/39830,"We support ERO 019-0907.
We look forward to the opportunity for long term/permanent occupation of our cottage lot in Rondeau Provincial Park.
As children we (wife and I) camped with our families in many campgrounds at Provincial Parks throughout Ontario and thoroughly enjoyed our time learning about nature (trees, flowers, birds, other critters,...), walking the trails, swimming where available, and generally enjoying ourselves as most kids do.
As girlfriend/boyfriend we often shared/compared experiences exploring the various Parks and their unique characteristics.
As newlyweds we continued to camp and visit many Parks throughout Ontario and ultimately came across Rondeau Provincial Park and the cottage community in the 1970's. At that time we vowed that someday we too would become cottagers, if at all possible.
It turned out, that just prior to retiring from our respective jobs, we came across an available cottage
in Rondeau that we had seen and fell in love with in the 1970's. We took all of our retirement savings and borrowed money from other family members and proceeded to make our dream come true.
Aside from periods of contentiousness with Ontario Parks over the past 15 years, and the misconceptions that we are ""elites"" (far from it - just regular working folks that scrimped and saved),
and misunderstandings from distant environmentalists about our treatment of the Park and its natural features. (we love the Park, and spend everyday caring for it when we are there) we truly do want to protect and preserve the Park - including the cottage community.
Who knows - maybe a young family has already spotted our cottage as their retirement dream spot - so  we want to be sure that they too have the opportunity to spend their golden years enjoying cottage life with nature  as we have.
We have faith that a long term solution can be developed for the occupation of cottage lots in Rondeau Provincial Park !!

Since 1894, when lots were first surveyed, cottaging has been a part of the Rondeau Park community. The cottagers take great pride in the park, actively promoting the betterment of the park, protecting, preserving and promoting Rondeau’s natural and historical environment. I support the continuation of the Rondeau Cottage Community, they are excellent stewards of the park.
Thank you

I was less than a week old for my first visit to my Rondeau cottage. My parents wanted all their children to experience the magic of Rondeau as soon as possible. From that moment, Rondeau has been the one place my family and I can enjoy more than anywhere else in the world. We have travelled to many places around the world and nothing compares to a sunset over Rondeau Bay, a family bbq on our patio, a walk along the lake shore and passing along the beauty and everything that only Rondeau can give from generation to generation (we are 4 generations deep).
Rondeau has gave me my parents (they met at RCY), a place to remind me nothing is more important than family after loss of family members, and a more family dinners than anyone can count.
From the moment I drive into the park see the smiling faces of everyone biking/walking/roller blading by, the drive down Lakeshore Drive watching as the forest grows over the summer, and not even unloading our car until a swim in Lake Erie first. Rondeau is the best place to be!!!
There is no other place I rather be to celebrate my birthday, Father's Day, and Thanksgiving. I cant imagine a season without lessons at RCY, endless days on the beach, trips the visitor centre,  trick or treating at the campgrounds and sharing my love for Rondeau to our next generation.
I cant imagine a summer without Rondeau!

Local Chatham-Kent businesses benefit significantly from the cottage community within Rondeau Provincial Park. Many current cottagers continue to defer expenditure for maintenance, repair, and improvements to their cottages while uncertainty continues regarding occupation of cottage lots in Rondeau Provincial Park. This uncertainty must be resolved once and for all. In addition, cottagers contribute to the maintenance expenses of the Park, as well as providing annual Lease Fees to Ontario govt., and Property Taxes to Chatham-Kent.

40039,/comment/40039,"The Rondeau Cottagers Association (“RCA”) was formed as the Rondeau Park Leaseholders Association in 1928 and represents more than 90% of all cottage owners inside Rondeau Provincial Park. We are recognized by the Province of Ontario as one of three stakeholders in Rondeau, along with Ontario Parks and the Municipality of Chatham-Kent.
The RCA enthusiastically supports ERO 019-0907.  This three-year lease extension should be granted automatically to all leaseholders.  This time period should be used to mutually negotiate a permanent tenure solution that will ensure the cottage community remains forever.  If a permanent solution is reached prior to the three-year deadline, we support it being implemented as soon as possible.
Rondeau Provincial Park was created in May 1894 by the “Rondeau Provincial Park Act”. Under the Act, the park was chartered for the purpose of providing cottaging opportunities for residents of Chatham & Kent County. Sadly the original cottages have all been demolished; the oldest cottages still standing were built around 1900. However their owners keep them in excellent repair and their families continue to enjoy them every summer. Our community has been here since the very beginning; many Rondeau families trace their roots here back many generations.
The Rondeau cottage community has been integrated into the park’s natural environment for over a century. The province has long considered Rondeau as the “Crown Jewel” of diversity in the Ontario Parks system, and it could not be this way if cottages were harming the ecology for the past 125 years. None of the available evidence on our community’s impact on the larger park environment has been any worse than neutral, and several studies have pointed-out a net benefit provided by human habitation structures to shelter species at risk. We believe the permanent continuation of our community offers the least-possible harm to the park’s ecosystem.
We are pleased that Rondeau supports one of the largest concentrations of rare species within a protected area in Ontario, and is home to 132 provincially-significant Species at Risk. We consider them to be our neighbours and our friends, and we believe that such a varied, thriving population can only be indicative of a healthy balance being achieved.  Any claim of long-term environment harm caused by cottagers is simply unsupported by factual data.
The definition of Ecological Integrity leaves-out a significant and arguably relevant line from the Provincial Parks & Conservation Reserves Act (2006) which recognizes the need for “recreational enjoyment” within the definition of Ecological Integrity.  We love this place, and we believe that parks are for people, too.

Chatham-Kent is one of Ontario's economically-depressed areas and it is largely ignored by Queen's Park.  The cottage community in Rondeau Provincial Park is one of the few bright spots in Chatham-Kent, despite the economic instability forced upon the community by the perpetually-expiring cottage leases.  Extending the leases to allow an opportunity for meaningful negotiation on a longer-term solution is a responsible approach that will benefit all parties concerned.
Further, it is not fair to the current leaseholders to drop a (literal) last-minute panic to sign yet another short-term lease extension on New Year's Eve.  All current leaseholders should be granted the extension automatically.  If discussions result in a potential long-term or permanent solution, it should be brought forward for implementation as soon as possible and not delayed until this three-year lease runs out in 2022.
I look forward to a renewed spirit of cooperation in Rondeau in the future.

I also support finding a long-term solution to ensure the cottage community remains a viable part of the Chatham Kent community.  Any long-term solution should be on fair and reasonable financial terms to the cottagers.

40055,/comment/40055,"RE: 019-0907 the supporting documents offered online were out of date reflecting changes from a decade ago and not the current amendments. That said, the emailed summary of Nov 18, 2019 inviting comments, suggests the proposal is a for a short term 3 year extension of leases so that the ministry may consult on an alternative option for long term occupation of cottage lots.
What is needed is a clear, timely decision that allows for long term planning by all people using and managing movements inside the park. I encourage there to be focused energy, attention and commitment to swiftly resolve the details around lease extension for at least the next 20 years.
I understand that the Ministry seeks the right balance to serve all the communities which migrate to Rondeau on a seasonal and annual basis--whether human, animal, or plant. What I wish for is to be able to erase the enmity that uncertainty and polarization have created. I want turn our energies to constructive, positive interactions that support the needs of all the indigenous and visiting populations to the park.
It's hard to be invested in building or even maintaining properties and relationships when the future is uncertain.
Let's put the delays behind us and put our energies into crafting a future in which all entities touched by the park may collaborate and flourish.

I also support a long-term renewable lease with financial terms tied to a comparable term government of Ontario bond plus a reasonable spread.
