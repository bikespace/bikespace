The water sale industry is a major source of plastic container pollution here and worldwide.\nOntario's water is a precious resource now and for the future and not to be taken cheaply. Water companies need to be made to pay commensurate with the amounts of profit and required to match volumes taken with equal value programs improving the natural water presence and wildlife. Definite legal restrictions on the amounts allowed with provisos enforcing reduced taking levels due to low rainfall and water tables.\nIn summary, it is preferred not to approve any more water industry but if it were authorized it should be made to pay fair value and be part of maintaining the resource.\nSincerely,\n",

The 24\/7 heavy trucks on the roads shipping water across the country emit and damage roads and bridges.  Thus the taxpayer pays for this industry by paying tax dollars to mitigate the damage and harms to the environment.\nThat much plastic is a nightmare as recycling is not an effective alternative.  It ends up in our landfills, waterways, and lakes on its way to the ocean.  Humans are eating, drinking and now breathing in microplastics constantly.  This is an industry that must be held accountable for the destruction it causes and creates.  Please deny further depletion of groundwater and the proliferation of plastic pollution by denying this permit.\n",

In addition both Guelph and Cambridge are approaching with their Source Water Protection Areas. The priorities set in the new regulations place municipal drinking water, agriculture and the environment above commercial water bottling.  This is the clear example of these competing interests.  This very short comment period does not allow for proper responses from any of these competing interests.\nThere are also too many uncertainties to proceed with a renewal at this point.  This is a new owner with new expectations.  It is also groundwater we know too little about like rate of recharge, effects of climate change, population growth in the surrounding area, and sustainability.\nIt would be irresponsible to grant a permit quickly without a fulsome investigation into the repercussions.\n",

We can then anticipate layoffs as Metropoulous has done with other companies, leveraging loans, pumping up profit no matter what the results, and a quick sale.  This is not who we would want managing and taking Ontario groundwater. Their motivation is a quick profit only. The ten year permit cannot be granted to this \"Greed is Good\" group.\n2. Ontarions need better protections for food and water security. No studies anticipate the availabilty or needs for water 10 years into the future at these sites.  Both are in rural, agricultural areas. There are many competing uses for water at each site and water bottling is the lowest of priorities.  The water leaves the watershed never to return.  It is a bad precedent and practice.\n3. Another unknown is the long term effect of the presence of microplastics in plastic water bottles, our drinking water, and our bodies and the bodies of living creatures.  Research indicates that all of us have plastics in our bodies. No one knows the critical amounts for health issues.\nThe term in the application is far too long, it is a low water use priority, the company has no experience or track record, no stated environmental standards, no loyalty to the employees or consumers, and continue to use virgin plastic with its terrible environmental impact.

As a Puslinch resident, I have seen first hand the work that Nestle does in our community.  Countless donations to the community do not go un noticed.  When I lived near their water plant they were very good with informing local residents about if they had any well problems or water problems, they had a team on call to rectify any problems, (and we never had any problems with our water or well).  Nestle has always been committed to the environment, as much as possible.  Since taking over from Aberfoyle Springs, they have streamlined the manufacturing process, eliminated a large percentage of packaging from day to day operations, and are good environmental stewards to the land around that they use.

My various roles within the community have afforded me the opportunity to work very closely with Blue Triton (formerly Nestle Waters Canada).  I was a 15 year Municipal Councillor in the Township of Puslinch, a long time board member of Hamilton\/Halton Source Protection Committee and currently serve on the Board of Directors of Hamilton Conservation Authority.  During my years on Council, I have collaborated with many local businesses.  Without exception, I can say that as far as contributing to the well being of the community, Blue Triton stood head and shoulders above the rest.  They were the first in line when it came to donating to the local school playground, the soccer club and so many other local initiatives.  You could always count on them for support.  As you are aware, we have many water takers in Puslinch.  Compared to the water taking in other permits, Blue Triton could be seen as modest.  However, the data and science, led by Dr. Andreanne Simard, which was always shared with local governments and the public, was outstanding and always peer reviewed.  The government's own findings supported that the water taking by water bottlers in the province has no impact on the quantity or quality of water in the province.  I would also support that the permits expiry period be for 10 years.  This would put Blue Triton on a level playing field with other local water takers and help ensure that this outstanding corporate citizen continues to be a vital part of the community, providing employment, enhancing the corporate tax base, and continues provide healthy beverage choices.

Please, do not make the same mistakes with this new company. Communities are struggling to have water. Do not add to their problems by giving it away.\nSpeaking of giving, the price they pay is practically nothing, then they turn around and jack up the price, inflated in an obscene amount and sell it back to us or to export it to other areas.

This in turn may help the environment where these folks don\u2019t have to rely on the purchase of plastic bottled water. We can also add a value tax to bottled water so that it will help to pay for well sufficiency in areas that do not have a safe water supply. You can also tax a bottling company of how much they siphon and use those funds to help offset costs to build wells. There are ways to help all Canadians!  This is 2021.

It is now time for our water rights and those of the indigenous peoples to be recognised and protected.\nAccording to the Low Flow Table of GRCA, Marsville which is within 10 Kms of Hillsburgh, has \"Extremely LOw water\" right now. What will be the response to these conditions when a large part of the Low Flow Response Committee is made up of golf courses, water bottlers and aggregate companies. Who is going to mandate that they stop drawing water when they all get to to vote? Who is monitoring their assessment of water levels. When cigarette companies were in charge of monitoring the impact of their products, could they be trusted? Asking private citizens to water their lawns less is obviously not going to deal with this. We the citizens and water users have to be protected from these self-interested companies.\nProtect our water sources from these industrial groups. These are our water rights, they should not be sold off and controlled by companies like Blue Triton. They are a public good, they belong to the people.\nNow is the time for our governments to show that they can see the dangers in the future and protect this vital asset.\n",

As caretakers of some of the biggest reserves of fresh water in the world, it falls to us to behave thoughtfully with this task. There are two primary issues:\n1. Sustainability. Water being removed from a watershed or ground water reserves should not exceed the natural cycle that replenishes it. If the levels of ground water fall, then there should be a moratorium on removing any for packaging and shipping out until it recovers.\n2. Carbon pollution. Packaging water in small plastic disposable containers for sale, and then transporting it elsewhere for consumption is extremely inefficient, and uses a lot of energy. If water is needed elsewhere - for humanitarian reasons - and we can spare it (see point #1 above), then it should be shipped in bulk, and provided in re-usable containers.\nAs a Canadian citizen, and a resident of Ontario, I feel we need to be intelligent and thoughtful about how we manage our resources.\n",

We do not need to consider this permit, and with what we know now, how our plastics waste problem is huge - it should not be considered for one moment.\n2.

Groundwater resources are finite and vulnerable. Droughts, climate change, and over-extraction continue to impact our limited water sources.\nWater is a human need, a commons, and a public trust \u2014 to be shared, protected, and carefully managed by all who live around it.\nWater must not be treated as a commodity and sold to the highest bidders.\nIt is time to stop handing out permits that allow the extraction and sale of vulnerable groundwater.\nSince 2016, there has been a 25% decline in water taken from the Puslinch well under permit 1381-95ATPY. It is time to phase out bottled water permits in Ontario and it should start with a five-year phaseout of the permit for Triton\u2019s Puslinch well.\nThere is no reason whatsoever to renew permit No.\u202f3716-8UZMCU for Triton\u2019s Erin well, which only used 6% of the permit capacity last year. This application should be rejected entirely. It would be especially irresponsible to renew the permit for an unprecedented ten years.\nSincerely,\nFiona\n",

It's important that we not risk limiting our ability to provide fresh, potable water to our growing population by licensing firms to draw water and effectively export it to other areas.

Also Nestles permit was issued decades ago and is problematic. At a minimum, Triton must comply with the new regulations.\nIt is my impression, Nestles basically sold these assets to a private equity firm due to the push back from the community on a number of issues and the backlash against profitting from bottled water.

For ANY government to issue \"licenses\" for cents on the gallon,to a private company, to the detriment of human life, is a CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY! For the government to be complicit in the absolute THEFT of First Nations water is an even GREATER CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY, an ABSOLUTE travesty!\nIn 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirmed the right of everyone to adequate food. However, access to adequate food in the rural areas of many developing countries depends heavily on access to natural resources, including water, that are necessary to produce food. The UN General Assembly declared access to clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right on 28 July 2010. But the right to water in the context of the right to food is a complex question. While drinking and cooking water would be protected, water for food production would probably not be covered under the minimum needs in arid areas.\nA case in point to water being a necessity of life; the Bolivian Water War; whereby an international consortium \u201cAguas del Tunari\u201d bought licenses to control the water of Cochabamba.\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cochabamba_Water_War\nhttps:\/\/www.gwp.org\/en\/learn\/KNOWLEDGE_RESOURCES\/Case_Studies\/Americas-\u2026-\nhttps:\/\/www.un.org\/waterforlifedecade\/human_right_to_water.shtml\nhttps:\/\/www.ukessays.com\/essays\/human-rights\/is-water-a-human-right-or-\u2026.\nhttps:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/essay\/Drinking-Water-Human-Right-Or-Commodity-\u2026.\n",

BlueTriton proposes to donate a bottle for every bottle recycled. Guess what, that's still producing single-use plastic. They may be donating but they are still creating more of it!

        "comment":"Re. Triton's PTTW.  The question of who owns Canadian water is as murky as the water on many First Nations lands. In theory, the provinces have owned the water since 1930, when the federal government delegated ownership with the Natural Resources Transfer Act. According to that act, the provinces have the right to sell their water to whomever they want, including companies like Triton, or their predecessor, Nestl\u00e9.\nOn the other hand, water could also be considered to be regulated by the federal government, which is responsible for the natural environment and Canada\u2019s waterways. In addition, according to the Canadian constitution, the federal government has a \u201cduty to accommodate and consult\u201d First Nations and to make sure other parties do the same when extracting any natural resource, including water, from indigenous land.\nThis legal ambiguity has allowed certain companies to move in and extract precious water for next to nothing. Meantime, local First Nations and their neighbours suffer with substandard water supplies, which competing water extraction industries can only make worse.  I don't support a PTTW in any area where the local community does not have a safe and adequate drinking water supply, except for a PTTW which serves that community as well.\n",

A low risk, high profit investment vehicle for a tiny minority of the population, who privately lobby our parliamentary representatives with disingenuous claims and assurances. The plain and extensively documented facts are clear - that this 'industry' has created a mountain of plastic waste, that has polluted our oceans and urban centres, poisoned millions of animals, and entered the food chain so that our children are now born with microplastic waste in their bodies. It has also added to the long and sordid history of the abuse of indigenous people, at the hands of successive governments, by taking billions of litres of potable water from their treaty lands, while they remain in many cases without a supply of drinking water in their communities.\nThis is an abusive industry, that has made no reparation for the devastation it continues to contribute to, and which encourages some Canadians to purchase its products in ignorance of the consequences. It should be incumbent on the Environmental Registry of Ontario to educate all citizens about environmental pollution, and require them to take responsibility for their choices.\nTime is growing very short, to reverse the damage already caused by these types of investment schemes, that use our natural resources for short term profit, and disregard the consequences. If our provincial and federal governments are going to continue to abuse our First Nations, as they have done for well over a century, and pay lip service to environmental protection while issuing MZO's in response to private lobbying from developers, then I - and many others - will hold them accountable at the next election.\nWe DO NOT WANT 'economic growth' that destroys watersheds, pollutes our air, water and food sources, and continues to burn or sell fossil fuels in a blind, ignorant, profit-driven rush to provide investment opportunities for private lobbyists.\nAnd we do not wish to see a continuation of the abuse, racism, theft and genocide that is the sickening legacy of Canadian colonialism.\nDo not grant this permit - or any other permit that ignores the devastation and abuse that results from it.\n",

That it is one of the most dangerous outcomes that can come from continuing to allow corporations to bottle and sell water around the world.\nWhat is even more frustrating and frightening is that the corporations and now private equity companies taking and profiting from all our Canadian water resources are foreign owned.\nIt takes courage to stand up and say NO when harm is being done. However, we have seen many leaders in the past do the right thing.  Leaders in Nova Scotia had the courage to close down a Pulp industry that was destroying their lands and water.  Leaders in the USA said no to an oil pipeline crossing their country because they knew that there were more sustainable energy sources in our future. Leaders in Bolivia said no to multiple exploitative corporations on behalf of their citizens.  None of these territories fell into ruin. No they were empowered and are leaders looked up to. The corporations suffered only a little financial loss and that was mainly felt in the size of their CEOs bonuses.\nIt is time for our Canadian leaders to use our tax dollars to say NO to bottled water and water taking for profit by Canadian and foreign owned corporations and and equity companies through\n1) immediately developing and implementing tough policies and regulations to\na) protect our natural resources for the whole and future Canadian generations\nb) enable the sovereignty of local communities trying to protect their natural resources, especially those first nations communities.\n2)  enforcement of these policies and regulations with immediate termination of any licensing that is in place with no possibility of renewal.\n3) ensuring that the entire population of our country has access to safe drinking water from their taps\n4)  installation of water fountains in all the public places (downtown squares, museums, parks, schools, recreation centres, art galleries, etc) and ensure these fountains all have spouts that allow for reusable water bottles to be filled.\n5) education with the public of their access to potable water from their taps, fountains etc.  This is especially important for our new Canadians - many of whom come from countries that did not have potable water. Make it drinking tap water the thing to do! It's all marketing.\nHow did we get here?\nGenerations before had gone through wars and needed to work together to survive. As economies recovered, they were able to make money, and common sense decisions that were for the good of the whole.  They saw the benefits of universal health care, social nets for those struggling.\nAs the population grew, so did the ability to be able to ignore those lesser advantaged, and the nature that sustains all of us. Now there is a greater lack of personal relationships; accountability to neighbours, and future generations.  It is enhanced by the narrow focus on capitalism with no long term or, greater care for the full impact of these decisions.\nBottling water is one of the greatest crimes to humanity that is only able to happen because, of antiquated government policies that have allowed a loop hole to be exploited.  Think of the history of the water letting policy. It was to allow movement of water for agricultural use (feeding people and animals). It is now used to create one of the greatest wastes of all time all in the name of convenience. Waste that drains local taxes in it's recovery and disposal. Waste that has lost it's value as a recyclable commodity, and instead is unnecessarily filling landfill sites.\nThis was not a surprise for many of us. We watched as public water fountains were removed from educational institutions, parks, and public sports and art venues. They were replaced by vending machines who promised a share of the profit to these public organizations and the vendors in the vicinity of public places. There was then some push back to all the sugary snacks and drinks in these vending machines.  Bottled water is touted as a great alternative to the sugary drinks.\nCombined with intense marketing of the convenience and \"better quality\" of bottled water, people are now paying more for water in a bottle, than they do for gasoline for their car. And then when their thirst is quenched, they throw away the bulk of that water in a capped plastic bottle. That precious water is trapped in a polluting capsule of plastic for how long? Plastic that is leading to mountains of unwanted waste.\nOne Rock Capital Partners LLC and Metropoulos & Co. on Wednesday announced the completion of the $4.3 billion deal to buy Nestle Waters North America. The acquisition was announced Feb. 16. It came about eight months after Swiss food and beverage giant Nestle S.A. said it would conduct a strategic review of its North American waters division, as it sought to sharpen the focus of its global water portfolio. 31 March 2021\nAre you going to let this continue?\n",

        "comment":"I cannot imagine any reason why Ontario should be selling groundwater for bottling (and exporting) purposes. And selling our groundwater for less than its real value to us is insulting and reckless. Pricing water to reflect it's real value, including managing the risks of depleting it in some areas and depriving local communities access to it, would raise the cost considerable and maybe slow consumer demand for an unnecessary product. Our appetite for bottled water is based on marketing and falsely low pricing. We do not need bottled water in most of this province. Our indigenous communities do need safe drinking water - in quantity - from their taps. I am appalled that this is even an issue as the only ones who truly benefit on the corporations selling bottled water.\n",

        "comment":"I fail to understand why the Ministry is treating this request as a renewal of an existing permit. Nestle Waters North America has sold its spring water holdings to an equity company that has created a totally new entity named Triton Waters Canada Inc. This company has no previous experience in the business of bottled water. Surely, if the permit system (PTTW) to extract groundwater is to have any appearance of legitimacy the new company should be treated as such and be made to apply for a completely new permit and assessed accordingly.\nWhen Nestle Waters Canada had the PTTW for the Puslinch well the permit duration was 5 years.\nYet, Triton Waters Canada is seeking a permit duration of 10 years. This is an outrageous request considering the lack of experience and knowledge this equity company has concerning the extraction of groundwater within Ontario. It is an even more outrageous action on the part of this company when you consider that it is unlikely this company will still own this company in 10 years. One only has to examine the history of this company to see that it generally \"flips\" its holdings within a span of 3 to 7 years.\nThe Puslinch permit to take water should be denied because in 2020 Nestle Waters Canada extracted only 44% of the water permitted under its permit to take water (PTTW).\nI also oppose this permit for the same reasons I opposed bottling by Nestl\u00e9 Waters Canada. First, water is a public good and should be held in public stewardship, not be for sale as a commodity. Second, water is taken without the consent of First Nations and despite a cease-and-desist order issued two years ago (June 7, 2019) by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Council, the traditional leadership of Six Nations on the Grand, Nestl\u00e9\/BlueTriton continue to ignore Indigenous sovereignty.\nThe bottling plant in Aberfoyle will continue to package water in single use plastic bottles -- millions of them every day \u2013 half of which result in litter or end up in a landfill. Single use plastic has a heavy carbon footprint in its life-cycle from production to distribution, and breaks down into microplastics, a growing threat to wildlife and human health.\nIt is more important that the water remain in the ground, to support all forms of life in the local ecosystem and to be conserved for future generations.\nThe climate crisis is making groundwater supplies less certain. Experts say groundwater is effectively a non-renewable resource, when measured on a human timescale, and should be considered a \u201cfinite\u201d resource because of its slow recharge rates. In southern Ontario, the rate of recharge is highly variable and ranges from 10 years to upward of 10,000 years, depending on the source of the aquifer Only six percent of groundwater is replenished within a fifty-year span.\n",

This would hold true whether it is a new extractor or a company or organization that purchases an existing company. Permits to extract water should not transfer with company ownership.\nIt is critical that all communities in a watershed from which water will be extracted must have a say on whether permission should be granted. If a community will be harmed through decreased availability of water, then permits should be denied. Charges for commercially extracted water should be increased significantly to represent the true value of water. Non commercial drinking water and private use wells would not be covered by the rules, unless an individual was drawing so much water it begins to affect others.\nCommunities within a watershed must be permitted to review and potentially deny permit renewals as circumstances change, and water availability may not be what it was prior.\n",

It would hardly be a surprise if the same group of wealthy shareholder and their corporate lawyers were behind this permit application as well.\nDozens of First Nations communities across Canada have not had access to safe drinking water for at least a year, and yet BlueTriton wants to pump clean water from Indigenous lands and bottle it for profit?\nEven if this weren't the case, and indigenous communities had reliable access to clean drinking water, it is still short sighted to provide this permit. Bottled water companies create massive amounts of waste particularly in the form of various kinds of plastics, be they in landfill from ineffectual recycling programs or microplastics that have invaded every aspect of our environment. Bottled water companies also consume an unacceptable amount of energy during production, and produce an unnecessary amount of greenhouse gasses in every step including transportation and distribution.\nIn 2002, the United Nations officially adopted water as a human right. General Comment 15, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states the following: \u201cThe human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.\u201d This means that the 145 countries who have endorsed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have to ensure fair and equal access to safe drinking water.\nThe government is obliged to ensure that people can enjoy their basic human rights. Part of the government\u2019s duty is to protect this right, by preventing third party interference. For drinking water, this may involve the establishment of legislation that prohibits manufacturing companies from privatizing the supply. Even developed countries have not had good results when a company privatizes the water. In the 1980s, the British water system was privatized. In the first five years, 18,636 households had their water supply cut off because they could not afford the price of water, which had increased by more than 50 percent.\nIn short, I request that you not only deny this permit but create legislation that would severely limit if not entirely eliminate the number of permits granted to bottled water companies from now on.\nPeople over Profits.\nWater is Sacred.\nDeny The Permit.\n",

        "comment":"Water - A Nonrenewable Resource.  There is an unfortunate history of Nestl\u00e9 abusing Ontario watersheds and communities by overtaxing an aquifer beyond its sustainable use. Due to public pressure and abuse of permits, they sold their bottled water service to Blue Triton. By virtue of the fact that now Blue Triton are going to disadvantaged communities in Ontario as Nestl\u00e9 had been doing to get their water, that seems like Blue Triton intend on following the same concepts as Nestl\u00e9.\nThere are countless examples in the news, studies, and literature demonstrating that the world is running out of freshwater. [The term freshwater includes both surface water and groundwater].  Groundwater tables are declining, sinkholes are occurring, ponds and even lakes are drying up, the ground elevation is subsiding, the flow of rivers and streams are becoming less, wetlands (the surface storage of freshwater) are drying up or being filled in, droughts are increasing in part because there is less surface water exposed to evaporation and transpiration from vegetation to make rain, rivers and streams are being dyked and flows are being streamlined to get rid of precipitation quickly instead of slowing surface drainage to increase the recharge of groundwater, etc.  Our use and protection of freshwater must change. This can occur jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction by enacting laws and regulations to protect our water resources and by charging realistic fees for their consumption to encourage conservation of water.  Landowners must realize that they do not own the water on and under their land since the value that water has benefit to a much greater area.  However, they are nonetheless stewards of that water.\nEvery \"Large Freshwater Consumer) must have a current permit.  Prior to awarding any permit to a Large Freshwater Consumer, Ontario must conduct a watershed study by qualified independent authorities to determine the sustainable seasonal limits of water use for not only the proposed permit but also for other smaller uses such as individual freshwater wells and village water systems, projected impact of climate change, etc. Then, the quantity of water, both surface water and groundwater, must be monitored by measuring stream flows, groundwater table elevations, CABIN (Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network), etc, by independent qualified personnel for the watershed to ensure that water consumption is not exceeding sustainable use and negatively impacting water quality in the watershed.  Use of fresh water by a Large Freshwater Consumer, without a current permit must result in barring the use of the freshwater.  (However, note that Ontario has not been enforcing the need of current permits in the past.)  The permit and permit renewal must include a standard \"environmental clause\".\nThe term Large Freshwater Consumer is to be defined as those who exceed a threshold quantity of fresh water measured by month and by year. There must be one common total freshwater quantity threshold applicable to all users. The clause must apply to any agency, business, farm, municipality, individual, etc, that consumes or processes freshwater from the environment exceeding either of the defined threshold. The standard environmental clause must be adhered to regardless how they use the water (e.g, process water, irrigation, potable water production, street washing, bottling, fracking, thermal, etc).  records of water taken and how used must be required of them, be made publicly available,and be subject to audit by an independent, qualified agency awarded a Standing Offer Agreement by public tender.\nThe Environmental Clause in a permit should require the following.  The following data must be made available publicly, and subject to independent third-party audit.\n1) Water consumption\/use is to be measured by certified meters.\n2) Records are required of water taken and how used.\n3) Specific and time-based goals are to be set by the users for improved quality and quantity of freshwater.\n4) Stewardship for freshwater conservation is to be promoted and financially supported from the permit fees by Ontario (e.g, naturalization of stream flows, shading of water bodies to reduce water temperature, promotion of freshwater plant and animal life (benthic, aquatic, etc), water reuse (e.g, grey water, reverse osmosis of brackish water), etc.\n5) Regulations must be put in place that allow a jurisdiction to limit and enforce freshwater usage with fines and stoppages of service, despite permits, treaties, and allowed practices, if records indicate that freshwater usage in a watershed is exceeding permitted quantities, or if water consumption in a watershed is not sustainable, e.g, during a drought or new information on determining the available freshwater in a watershed.\n",

You know what an enormous burden you are leaving for the next generation to clean up for a short term pay off- and not even a good pay off! It's not even remotely worth what Ontario has been selling our water for. This paired with our Premiers eagerness to use MZOs to earmark our watersheds for commercial development and building unnecessary highways spells disaster.\nPeople involved in this decision clearly don't care about the citizens that live here, I have no faith you can even grasp the concept that the governments of Canada and Ontario have no right to sell our resources to Nestle, but if you could at least consider your own family's future needs for clean drinking water maybe you can make the right decision.

(Triton Water Canada) should reduce pumping during declared droughts based on the average weekly rate rather than a monthly rate.  There will be a greater reduction in actual water use if Triton Water Canada reduces pumping based on average water taking rates rather than permitted maximum rates that are barely reached during non-drought periods.\n\u2022\tAs monitoring data are reviewed by the province, the MECP should ensure that discharges to watercourses that support cold water species are not affected by this water taking and that the hydrologic function of nearby provincially significant wetlands is maintained.\n\u2022\tThere are a large number of permitted and private domestic water takings in the vicinity of the permitted taking.  The GRCA encourages the MECP to consider the cumulative impacts of all water takings in the local subwatershed when reviewing this permit application.\nDetailed Comments\nSource Water Protection\nThe water taking on the subject property at 101 Brock Rd South, Puslinch, Ontario is located within a Wellhead Protection Area Q (WHPA-Q) designated with a significant risk level for protecting the sources of municipal drinking water.\nThe completed Tier 3 Water Budget and Risk Assessment study (Tier 3 Study) for the Guelph\/Guelph-Eramosa area, undertaken as part of the required work under the Clean Water Act, 2006, identifies consumptive water takings, which includes water taking from Well TW3-80, as significant drinking water threats.\nSignificant drinking water threats mandate the development of water quantity policies to be included in the Grand River Source Protection Plan. Water quantity policy development addressing consumptive water takings and recharge reduction activities is currently in process.\nThe results of this Tier 3 Study have been accepted by the Lake Erie Region Source Protection Committee and the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks.  However, with policy development still in process, the Tier 3 Study results and policies have not yet been included in the Grand River Source Protection Plan and are not in legal effect.\nIn addition to the Tier 3 Study, a Risk Management Measures Evaluation Process (RMMEP) has been completed. The RMMEP identifies and updates significant threats, and ranks them to determine those that impact the municipal water supplies the greatest. The results of the RMMEP reveal that the majority of the highest ranked threats were City of Guelph municipal wells that impact themselves given increased future water demand and the relative close proximity to each other. The water taking from Triton Water well TW3-80 was ranked 20th within the RMMEP with a 1% impact on the closest municipal well (Burke Well). The complete Tier 3 Study and RMMEP reports are publicly available at http:\/\/www.sourcewater.ca\/GGET-Tier3.\nIn response to the Interim Guidance Document released by the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks in 2017 outlining requirements for the renewal of Permits to Take Water for water bottling purposes, Nestle Waters Canada (now Triton Water Canada ) arranged for the numerical groundwater flow model developed for the Guelph-Guelph\/Eramosa Tier 3 Study (Tier 3 Model) to be updated in the areas of the Aberfoyle and Erin operations and applied the model to assess the potential for cumulative effects, under both current conditions and various climate change and drought scenarios.\nTo apply the Tier 3 Model to the TW3-80 Permit to Take Water renewal, consultants from Nestle Waters Canada and the City of Guelph collaborated; this included sharing data between parties and consultations during data analysis, model refinement, and calibration, and leveraging the experience and local knowledge of these consultants gained through multiple years of data collection and analysis. The modelling report is included as a supporting document for the application to renew the Permit to Take Water for TW3-80.\nWhere numerical models developed through the Source Protection Program can be reasonably modified or updated such that they meet the technical expectations and requirements, the GRCA continues to encourage and support the use of these models for assessing Permit to Take Water applications.\nLow Water\nThe Mill Creek watershed is affected by drought periodically.  Because the watercourses in this watershed are dependent on groundwater for baseflow, it is important that all water takings, including deep groundwater takings, reduce pumping rates during drought periods.  Triton Waters is encouraged to continue the commitment to drought management shown by Nestle Waters by continuing their participation on the Grand River Low Water Response Team.\n\u202f\nThe permit renewal application states that Triton Water Canada will commit to voluntarily reducing monthly maximum permitted water use during times of declared low water conditions by 10, 20 and 30 percent, respectively.  Based on past water pumping information provided in the application, these reduction targets on a monthly basis will not result in an actual reduction in water use during a drought period.  At a minimum, Triton Water Canada should reduce pumping during declared droughts based on the average weekly rate rather than a monthly maximum rate.  There will be a greater reduction in actual water use if Triton Water Canada reduces pumping based on average water taking rates rather than permitted maximum rates that they barely reach during non-drought periods.\nNatural Heritage\nThe water taking is located adjacent to the Provincially Significant Mill Creek Wetland Complex, which has both recharge and discharge areas.  Changes to water levels can greatly affect the hydrologic function of the wetland complex. GRCA recommends that Triton Water Canada review the monitoring data collected over the period of the current permit and take any necessary action to ensure the hydrologic function of the wetland is not impacted.\nWatercourses in the Mill Creek watershed support cold water fisheries, including Mill Creek which supports a self-sustaining population of brook trout and brown trout.  Both species are sensitive to and reliant on groundwater discharge with brook trout heavily keying in on discharge areas for their spawning activities. As monitoring data are reviewed by the province, the MECP should ensure that discharges to watercourses that support cold water species are not affected by this water taking.\nCumulative Impacts\nThe GRCA encourages the MECP to consider the cumulative impacts of all water takings in local subwatershed when reviewing this permit application.  There are a large number of permitted and private domestic water takings in the vicinity of TW3-80.  It is important to consider all of the groundwater takings in this area when reviewing any individual permit application.\nMonitoring Program\nThe proposed changes to the monitoring program would benefit from additional supporting information made readily available. This could include the original intent of the monitoring locations that are proposed to be removed, well logs, and hydrographs such that the proposed changes can be fully reviewed.\n",

The fact that so many First Nations communities across the country lack access to safe drinking water makes BlueTriton's plan to pump clean water from their lands all the more egregious. We can do better than to allow such a critical resource to be taken and sold for profit. DO BETTER.\n",

Taking water from lands held by Indigenous Peoples is denying them their human right to clean drinking water while also ignoring Indigenous Sovereinty.\n2. Plastic used as containers for water are a large contributer to environmental pollution.\nI am asking you to deny Blue Triton the permit they are requesting to take our lake water for the purposes of profit\n",

        "comment":"The Morwick G360 Institute at the University of Guelph would like to provide a letter in support of Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. (formerly Nestl\u00e9 Waters Canada) permits to take water.\nThe Morwick G360 Institute is a part of the University of Guelph that specializes in groundwater research. We have been actively pursuing research in the Guelph area and surrounding townships since 2003 with a focus on understanding flow systems and the properties of the aquifers and aquitards in the area. These studies and collaborating with different private and public parties interested in groundwater resources have allowed us to stay up-to-date on many activities in the area. We feel that decisions surrounding water management should be data-driven and the collection of high quality groundwater data is fundamental in this process.  With regard to the two specific permits of Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. we feel that:\n- Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. has taken voluntary efforts to monitor the subsurface in a high resolution depth-discrete manner, beyond standard practice,  to examine system responses both underground and at the earth\u2019s surface;\n- Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. has demonstrated transparency in sharing data through the public dissemination of annual reports;\n- Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. has established an effective  multi-faceted groundwater monitoring program that includes the local ecosystem and surface water.\n- Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. has attempted to minimize cross-connection between hydrogeologic units by employing relatively short screen pumping intervals;\n- The regulations around permits to take water should be based on scientific understanding and should be applied universally and consistently across all permitted parties;\n- The permits to take water are based on the previous permits, effective monitoring data supporting no adverse impacts and do not suggest an increase in water takings.\nGiven the above, we believe that Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. has demonstrated a better than average commitment to the sustainable use of groundwater resources in Guelph and surrounding areas.\nSincerely,\nProfessor Beth Parker, PhD, FCAE, BCEEM, LEL\n(Director, of the Morwick G360 Groundwater Research Institute)\nUniversity of Guelph\n",

Be content with reasonable, rather than monster, profit. Teach your shareholders to value responsibility. Consumers may behave like sheep to your advantage, but your greed is risking the planet. Aquifers are the planet's arterial system. Which artery are you willing to do without yourself?\nSad to say, the character of Nestle is now so obvious that I expected this devious action.\nBack to boycotting the few remaining Nestle products I still used.\n",

Water resources must remain a public resource to serve the general population. Companies should not be able to continue to draw water while at the same time the communities that rely on these water supplies are struggling with water shortages. Only surplus water should be allowed to be taken, and only if the companies pay much higher rates for the water. We should not be giving away this resource for such a pittance so that any company can reap large profits from it.\n",
