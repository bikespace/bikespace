One would think that it should be to be fair including updated terms and conditions to better protect the park environment and updated lease fees to reflect fair market value lease rates for allowing a privileged few (including approximately 30% non-residents) to recreate and dwell in a provincial park...

100501,/comment/100501,"We are in favour of this decision of a 14 year extension. Of course, we wish we did not have go through these extensions all of the time (this has happened too many times throughout my 60 years on this planet) and wish that this issue would be settled once and for all. The cottagers have proven since the 1890's that they love the location, the land and wildlife. Cottagers have always been very respectful of the environment. They have a right to have and maintain their cottages. Many have been here 2, 3, 4 generations, residing beside all of the campers that come from both Canada and the United States. Most years, the campgrounds cannot even be filled, so no sense in expanding that area. Ecology and wildlife have thrived (hence, the culls most years). Birdwatchers come to experience the wonder of Rondeau Park. If that weren't the case, we would have no visitors. These 2 factors show that the environment is not being hurt by cottages existing in the park. Cottagers put out nuts for the wildlife, hummingbird feeders, water pedestals for the birds. If anything, we are adding to the existence of wildlife and not hindering it. This is done for free and out of love. We are tired of having to fight government after government to keep our cottages. It costs so much money to fight for what is ours. My father was raised at Rondeau beginning in the 1930's, as was I, my children and now the family's grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It's not just about cottages, it's about family history and ancestral dwellings. So, we are in favour of this extension. Thank you.

1. No further cottages should be allowed in Provincial Parks.
2. Strict environmental rules must be mandated, advised and compliance shown prior to leasing continuance.
3. REASONABLE lease increases should be initiated.
4. Transparency in all political considerations as regard Provincial Park cottages MUST occur with cottager leaseholders and their associations.
Most cottagers are valuable stewards for their particular Provincial Parks, particularly if they are Ontario residents and tax payers.

100514,/comment/100514,"Hi there,
I think it was a mistake to not end the leases in 2017 as per the original agreement.  However, although it was a long extension, I liked the proposal here https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/011-1300  better than this one.  At least it was a reasonable length of time, and it was final.  This one is just postponing the problem to 2038 with no finality at all.
One three-year and two two-year extensions... now it's not as high profile anymore.  Your proposals are getting softer and softer... what happens in 14 years?  The same darn thing. This is costing the taxpayers a lot of money with all the work going on behind the scenes on this file.
Make a final decision and stick with it, and with the consequences.  For example, many honorable cottagers left because they kept to the original lease agreement!!  Be like that.
If you terminate the leases, you are keeping with the government's mandate there to put ecological integrity as a priority. If you don't, then you are serving the interests of a few hundred well-off people with really cheap cottages (who throw fits when they have to meet their agreements), instead of the people of Ontario as a whole and the natural habitat that could exist there if these leases ended.  You should at least start charging more for the leases (at least fair market value for rental of the land!)... I should think that these people can afford it if they really want to stay badly enough.
I looked for the plan amendment wording attachment to the posting but didn't find it. What's online is about the 2022 amendment.  As such, I assume the plan amendment is ONLY changing ""2024"" to ""2038"", but it would be good to have that clarification in the posting itself.
In summary, if you must do this, please have a final and binding decision in 2038 associated with the lease extension.  As well, get an appraiser and start charging fair market value rent for each leaseholder based on each parcel's land value.
Thanks.

100533,/comment/100533,"I have no issue with the extension of the leases until 2038 . However , I think it would be advisable to extend the previous lease extension offer of several years ago that does not allow transfer of the lease to anyone but the leasee,s  spouse . As well , any lease should be considered to expire on the death of the leasee and/or their spouse  and the property on the leased land removed and environmental remediation to take place . The purpose of this is , obviously , to avoid real estate speculation and the potential windfall profits that may ensue .

100535,/comment/100535,"Previously , the plan , before recent short term extensions , had been that , on the death of the leasee , no one but their spouse could continue the lease until the end . That should still be the case if the 2038 extension is approved . In short , if the extension is granted , there should be no room for real estate speculation and the attendant financial windfall that would occur . Any sales of property on leased land should involve the removal of said property from the park . Buy a house from a leaseholder and all you get is the house , not the lease . Is this the status of the current proposal or will sales of property allow the buyer to assume the lease until 2038 ?

100551,/comment/100551,"Though the previous lease only expired in 2017, it's fair to say that successive governments have left Rondeau's cottagers in limbo for decades. For as long as I can remember, cottagers have asked for greater transparency regarding the government's intentions. Does the government want cottages at Rondeau or not? If they do want cottages, then cottagers deserve real proof in the form of an extended lease. 14 years is a step in the right direction, but it's less than half as long as it should be. Cottagers deserve to know why 14 years was chosen. Why not 30 years? What is the motivation behind this direction?
I am happy to tell my children, the 4th generation of my family at Rondeau, that we'll be able to remain at Rondeau for 14 years. But the question remains, ""What then?"" It's incumbent upon the government to explain its long-term strategy, even if this current lease is only a medium-term solution.

100746,/comment/100746,"I would like to see the lease extended to 2038. I am in favour of it. I think their people within the Ministry that refuse to look at facts and push for their own agenda and not reality. Cottages HAVE  NOT harmed this park, but made it. They seem to think a degree is more knowledge that lifetime experiences of local people. Just think, over 125 years of cottages, and the dune beach is more than 300 feet wider now than when cottages were first encouraged to be built. And none of that area is built upon. Cottages are not taking up any of the lakeshore beach. NOT ANY. And the fact is there are only 5 cottages that have water frontage, and they are all on Rondeau Bay, NOT Lake Erie. Plus these 5 lots take up 250 feet in total of a 8 mile Rondeau Bay shoreline. The benefits that these cottage lots provide far surpasses any negative idea that one may suggest.
Over 125 years of cottages and the ecology is still thriving and going strong.
Yes - extend the leases.

The cottages and its community have formed a long standing symbiotic relationship. This symbiotic relationship has been documented time and time again by the Minstry.

This will provide time while sustainable, environmentally friendly, and economically positive solution to the cottage lease situation can be finally worked out as promised in ERO011-1300 prior to the epidemic.
I would expect that the future fees and taxes levied by the Province will be fair, reasonable and equitable.  The charges should not be punitive and just another effort to drive the cottagers out of Rondeau.
Rondeau was founded as a place where the unique environment could be preserved and as a place where cottagers could enjoy everything the Lake and the Bay have to offer.

The new leases or extensions need to have reasonable terms and conditions and in order for cottagers as well as the government to all benefit. It financially makes no sense to move towards ending the cottage community in the park. The cottages are great stewards of the park, and generate income for the government as well as the local businesses in Chatham Kent.

2) That said, renewal lease terms must be at market rates and not create a situation whereby increased land rent is used to effectively evict cottagers.
3) The Ministry should not be allowed to stall its decision as a way to ""wait out"" the cottagers as decisions related to refinancing and capital improvements are required.

100816,/comment/100816,"I support the management plan to allow cottages to remain in Rondeau Provincial Park.
It is important to ensure that cottage owners have  some security that a longer term lease provides.
Cottagers are committed to the integrity of the park - that is - maintaining their heritage properties to high standards, respecting the limitations imposed by the park authorities, adhering to high environmental standards etc.
Many Cottagers, over the past few years,
carried out  major renovations and, among other things, have upgraded septic systems to protect the land and water resources.
If there is a need for higher environmental standards to be imposed, as a cottage owner, I  am willing to meet them, so that that all aspects of the environment of the park can be protected.

Lastly, I totally think that Rondeau cottages add and greatly enrich the park’s history & heritage. Please remember the cottages were there before the park was a park. Although campers certainly are necessary and add short term value to the park, they are not invested in a long term commitment as a lease holder is.

I hope this amendment to the management plan is the answer to actually selling the existing lots to the cottage owner. I hope it doesn't take till 2038 to achieve that. The sale of the lots is the VERY BEST solution for the management plan and the future health and benefit for all of Ontario including the MNR.
It is very unrealistic to think that going back to total nature is progressive. If that is the MNR's thoughts, they are totally out of step with reality.. Since cottages were first allowed in this park, the ACTUAL LAKE SHORE BEACH has INCREASED dramatically. Cottages are not and have never been built close to the shore line. The sale of the  lots would not change that. Lots would remain the same size. The beach would still remain Crown property.
I could go on and on about how cottagers have co existed with nature.
In conclusion, extend the leases with intent to selling the lots as promised by previous Ministers.

I’m not sure why the park management plan needs to be any kind of constraint on the process. It seems you could remove such time constraints from the management plan altogether since it is already regulated by the Provincial Parks act.
All terms of the extended tenure of the cottages should be fair and reasonable and based on clear formulas similar to what is allowed in the tenants act for other leaseholders in the province.  I’ve heard of the chaos created by the silly formulas for the Algonquin cottages and don’t think the government should be involved in any such nonsense as that going forward.

I have a few conditions
- the extension should be longer than 14 years, or, at the very least, there should be some proposal to renew.  This keeps the cottages in good condition.
- all cottage owners must agree that they are users of the cottage - they must not be part of any VRBO, rental, B&B, etc
- if the cottage owner wants to dispose of the property, then it must to sold to a family member first, if none are available it can go to a new owner so long as they a)do not already own a cottage in the park and b)agree to the above terms that this is not a rental property.  All new owners must agree that they will not resell the property for a minimum of 10 years save and except acts of God, death, etc.
I also think that the park should allow for the infilling of cottages in the north of the park.  i.e. whereever there was an existing or historical cottage, in the past, a new cottage should be allowed to built, so long as there are limitations on the size of the cottage (i.e. under 1200sq feet of ground floor, no more than 2 stories, etc).

We have been enjoying Rondeau cottages for many years through our friends and were so impressed by the unique combination of nature and conservation and the co-existence of a cottage community that we bought a cottage in 2019.
One of the attractive parts of our current lease arrangement is that it is a reasonable cost in relation to what we receive as cottage owners.  e.g. we don't owns the lots, but we pay a reasonable cost by way of PILT and Lease Payment.  Any extensions or new lease agreements must have reasonable terms and costs so as to not make cottage ownership unaffordable and something that would only be available to the rich.  As such, I feel the Rondeau Cottagers Association must be collaborators in consultation process with the ERO.

Rondeau Provincial Park is one of the last remaining parcels of land protecting the precious Carolinian ecosystem as much of this ecosystem has been lost and fragmented due to land use development.
Rondeau hosts many rare species that cannot be found elsewhere in Canada as well as sensitive habitats that the cottages encroach on, most notably the dune habitat next to the lake.
Driving through the park one can observe items on cottages that pollute the environment and disrupt the natural processes of the park and place a large ecological footprint on the surrounding habitat.

The park was originaly created with leaseholders in mind to promote tourism, and cottages have formed an important part of the heritage of the park for over 100 years in some cases.
With cottages and their occupants present for close to a century, the park has managed to flourish as a safe haven promoting biodiversity to the point where new species, not indigenous to the area, like the Fowler Toad, have managed to find a habitat that suits them.
The lease terms and conditions need to be sufficiently long duration and reasonable monetary outlay, to ensure cottage maintenance is financially viable. No one wants cottage owners to have to pay punitive rates, and then let their cottages degrade.
A long term plan (>50 years) would help cottage owners to plan and budget for the upkeep of their structures and sewage. Cottage owners have been awaiting more clarity regarding the future of the leases for a long time. It has been extremely stressful not knowing whether to fix a roof, repair a leak, or replace a broken window without assurance that the cottage would exist one or two years into the future.

100994,/comment/100994,"Ecological Costs Associated with Cottage Tenure in Rondeau Provincial Park
Included are two sources that identify several ecological opportunity costs associated with allowing private cottage leases to continue in Rondeau Provincial Park, particularly the effects on various species and habitats. The most prominent issues highlighted are:
• Invasive species: Cottage lots and the activities of cottagers can contribute to the spread of invasive plant species, impacting natural ecosystems. The report suggests that the introduction of non-native species may occur through garden escape, planting, and disturbance associated with cottage activities.
• Water quality: Septic systems from cottages can negatively affect natural nutrient cycles, potentially leading to increased costs for the Crown to manage nitrogen and phosphorus leaching into ground and surface water.
• Erosion and Habitat Fragmentation: The sources note that footpaths created by cottagers accessing the beach, along with the presence of roads and cottage lots, contribute to erosion and habitat fragmentation. These disturbances can lead to blowouts, disrupt natural habitat connections, and limit the park's ability to implement restoration programs like prescribed burning.
• Impacts on Species at Risk: Cottage lots and associated access roads negatively impact various species at risk in the park. Road mortality is a significant concern, particularly for species like the Eastern Hognose Snake, Eastern Foxsnake, Five-lined Skink, and Fowler's Toad. The report also notes that activities like dragging recreational equipment on the beach pose a risk to the endangered Fowler’s Toad. Additionally, the report observes that the presence of bird boxes on cottage lots may be subsidizing House Wren populations, potentially leading to competition with the endangered Prothonotary Warbler for nest cavities.
The report emphasizes that the cottage lots occupy land within provincially rare ecosystems, including beach/dune, tallgrass, and savannah communities. Restoring these areas to their natural state is presented as a way to quantify the ecological opportunity costs. The report suggests that removing the cottages would enhance the protection of endangered species and their habitats, improve the provision of ecosystem services, and allow for more natural ecological processes.
One study found that the area of dune habitat disturbed by human activity in Rondeau decreased by almost 50% between 1955 and 2006, primarily due to the cessation of bulldozing activities in the dunes. However, despite this recovery, the study concluded that the largest source of disturbance to sand dunes in the park remains the private cottages. In 2006, disturbance attributed to cottage leaseholder access accounted for 82% of the total disturbed area in the dunes, a significantly disproportionate amount compared to the disturbance caused by the much larger number of campers and other park visitors.
The report suggests that while it's difficult to quantify the full extent of the ecological damage caused by the cottages, the costs of restoring and naturalizing the cottage areas could be used as an approximate measure of the ecological opportunity cost. However, it also acknowledges the challenge of accurately valuing the non-market benefits of a healthier ecosystem, which are borne by society rather than the Crown.
The sources highlight the ecological trade-offs inherent in allowing private cottage leases to continue in Rondeau Provincial Park. They suggest that while there have been improvements in managing the impact of the cottages, their presence continues to pose a significant challenge to the park's ecological integrity.
In summary due to habitat disturbance, invasive species introduction and ongoing mortality of species at risk, Society is bearing the cost of these losses for the benefit of a few cottagers.
 In good conscience this practice cannot continue and plans must be made to end the occupation of Rondeau Provincial Park.

In my view, the cost of removing to the surrounding Chatham Kent community, both economically and as a community, is not commensurate with the benefits of expanding ecosystems in the park. The cottages represent a only small portion of the land of the park, so the incremental gains to the natural environment are likely not greater than the costs to the overall community.
There does not seem to be a strategy involved about how the park should be used long-term. Is it for people or is it for ecosystems? With a long-term lease, both the Park and the cottagers can adequately plan for what they want that future to be.

101167,/comment/101167,"I oppose any extension for cottagers. This is a provincial park and should be used only for day use and camping. The world, Canada, and Ontario needs more green space and the footprint left by cottagers is detrimental to the natural environment.  The campsite portion of the park covers a very small amount of the total area but the cottagers take up a very significant amount of the park and interfere and hurt the environment.  Cars, noise, septic tanks, and other human activity and pollution all have an impact and reducing any amount of these would leave the park and nature in much better shape.
People are not allowed to live in the park during the winter I would assume because it is hard on the eco-system so why is it that having people live there in the summer is somehow acceptable?
Why extend it for an additional 14 years if the end game is to eventually have the cottagers leave then why not address that now and have them removed? Presumably at some point the cottagers will be asked to leave so it should be now.  Years ago when individual leases expired those cottages were removed and left for nature to take over and to my mind that worked out very well so the same should happen now.
This specific park has many uses and functions all of which would be markedly improved if the cottagers were removed.
A provincial park is just that a park, not an exclusive playground for wealthy people who can afford to have a second residence, especially now when so many Ontarians are struggling.
If having people reside in provincial parks is such a good idea why isn't the province proposing opening all of the provincial parks to cottagers? My guess is that the backlash and outcry against any government foolish enough to do this would be enormous.  Rondeau therefore should be no different. It is way past the time these cottagers should be removed. Rather than extend their leases it is time for them to be out.

Yes, renew the lease to a long term lease of 25 year renewable for another 25 years or 50 year lease renewable for another 50 year lease. The cottages are a viable economic part of the regional economy. Many cottage owners are also owners operators of large industrial businesses that employ thousands of people in the area. Without the cottages, we risk losing the large employers b/c the cottage owners may move their business to a location where they can have a long lease or own the land and cottage. End the short term lease in favor of long term lease. End this short term thinking on this issue.

101206,/comment/101206,"I fully support extending Rondeau cottage lot leases for 14 years and beyond. The cottagers are stewards of the park and drive hundreds, if not thousands, of the parks’s visitors each year- providing valuable revenue to the park to keep it functioning and well maintained for all who wish to enjoy it. I think it would be irresponsible to close down such a valuable revenue source for something that so many people can benefit from beyond the cottage owners themselves.  I see no valid reason to prevent a long term solution to keeping cottages and their income stream - ( whether through their lease fees or via the many visitors that the cottages bring to be park each year) - in the park. The Rondeau cottage community has existed for over 100 years and the park is thriving. It is thriving so much so that an annual deer cull is required. Please consider a long term solution to keeping Rondeau cottages in Rondeau. The cottagers are a kind and friendly community who respect,  care for and honour Rondeau as the beautiful haven that it is. Propaganda that has been distributed to  the contrary has been misinformed, false  and defamatory and needs to be addressed and corrected.
Rondeau cottages need to stay in Rondeau as originally intended and therefore a long term solution needs to be made to ensure that happens. Thank you for your time.

101273,/comment/101273,"I agree with this proposal. Keep the existing cottage land leases but, I think that the lease structure should consider inflation.
The lease rates should increase with inflation. ie: raise the lease costs annually with the rate of inflation, or at minimum, 3% per year. It only makes sense!  Everywhere else, rental rates, property values, mortgages, increase significantly each year. The lease rate should increase as well.
The Park absolutely needs the increases to the lease costs, to maintain the services that it provides for the cottagers. (Road maintenance, snow removal, tree maintenance/removal, “policing”,etc.)  And also, the added revenue could be used towards rebuilding the large dock on the bay. The dock used to draw a lot of people. It was great for the kids and families to spend time swimming and fishing.
Raise the lease costs!

101321,/comment/101321,"Yes. Approve the extension. It is very hard to understand that with 87 % of Ontario being CrownLand, that this very very very small piece of land, that was encouraged by the Crown for construction of Cottages, remains a problem for the MNR to let go. Cottages have NOT harmed this area. In fact, the MNR by not allowing a whitetail dear herd reduction for years, caused more harm to the natural vegetation than cottages ever could. That seems to left out of any conversations the MNR has ever had with the public. It is because of the damage caused by the OVER population of the whitetail deer, that the vegetation of the park was badly destroyed, and  NOT by the presents of the cottages.
Extend the term of the management plan, but approve the sale of the lots to cottagers. It would be a Win Win Win for everybody. MNR - Cottagers - Chatham Kent , and even the Province of Ontario.

101349,/comment/101349,"Subject: Proposal for Extension of Cottage Leases at Rondeau Provincial Park
I am writing in support of the proposed extension of cottage leases in Rondeau Provincial Park for an additional 14 years. This extension not only supports the interests of the cottage owners but also aligns with the broader objectives of the park and the community.
Many cottage owners have invested significant time and resources into their properties, creating a sense of stability and belonging within the park. An extension would provide these families with the assurance and predictability they need to continue maintaining and improving their cottages, which helps preserve the unique character of the Rondeau Community.
Long-term residents contribute to the local economy and park activities, fostering a vibrant community that benefits both visitors and conservation efforts. This extension would encourage the continuation of community traditions, such as the sailing club that enrich the park experience for all.
From an ecological standpoint, stable cottage occupancy is beneficial. Long-term leaseholders are more invested in the sustainability of their surroundings, promoting stewardship and responsible usage of the park’s resources.
Importantly, a 14-year lease extension can provide the provincial administration with a predictable framework for planning and resource allocation while ensuring that recreational use of the park continues to flourish in a sustainable manner.

I completely support this initiative provided a plan exists for implementation that provides for a continuance of leaseholds in Rondeau Park after December 31, 2038. Any changes should reflect a serious, cooperative, realistic and fair plan for cottagers and not be outrageously onerous financially and with respect to general expectations be reasonable. I'd suggest that cottagers are very much an asset within the park and should be viewed as partners in any restructuring.

101465,/comment/101465,"I fully support proposal ERO 019-8289 and amendments to the Rondeau Park plan for continuation of the vibrant, sustainable and financially supportive community of the cottages within the park.
The cottages occupy a very small percentage of the total park land - and have been a caring community providing stewardship to the lands in collaboration with park management over the years. In fact the original charter fully embraces and lists cottages within the park land as one of the core justifications for creating the park itself.
Decisions regarding cottage properties and proposals supportive of long term cottage occupancies have been outstanding since 2019 and again promised in early 2020. Cottages and visitors expect and deserve to have decisions made that provides clarity and process in support of continued and long term cottage leases within Rondeau as part of original concept and as sustainable and responsible stewardship in the future.
Cottage leases must be negotiated with due consideration of tenure and historical legacy integral with the park history and future and must be of reasonable terms, operational conditions and costs. Families deserve the right to continue enjoyment of this park as originally intended and be economically feasible to do so. It must be considered the significant value, awareness and monies cottage lease holders, guests and friends bring to Rondeau and the greater  Chatham Kent area overall.

101471,/comment/101471,"I endorse the extension to the cottage leases. I do however, think the extension is not long enough. Any extension needs to provide sufficient certainty for investments to upgrade or even maintain the existing cottages. I would suggest a minimum of 20 years extension is required. The cottages need to be maintained- but without a substantial period of time to have a “return” on those investments I am concerned there will be insufficient investments made. By “return” I mean getting value from investing in the properties both from a financial perspective and from having the time to enjoy the benefits through use.
As health and safety in building standards continue to improve and evolve I would hope there would be sufficient incentive for cottagers to continue to invest. Insufficient certainty for the future does not provide such incentive, nor does the current 14 year proposed extension provide such.
The cottagers provide a good balance for Rondeau Provincial Park. They are responsible stewards within the park year round as well as contributing to economy inside and outside the park. Invariably they are a net positive impact in my opinion.
While I endorse the extension, I believe more needs to be done.

102800,/comment/102800,"I am not in favour of the lease extension. However it might be the lesser of two evils, if the government holds the cottagers to accountability.
-the current lease that leaseholders signed and agreed to, does not allow cottagers to have their Rondeau cottage as their sole place of residence, yet there are probably at least a dozen cottagers who make it their sole/primary residence. If this lease extension goes forward, there will likely be more and more who make it their primary/sole residence, and will eventually demand or expect increasing services such as municipal water supply. Increased services will ultimately cause greater negative impacts on the fragile natural environment of this nationally significant provincial park;
-cottagers should not intrude in any way on the area beyond their official cottage lot. For example they should not be dumping anything across the Lakeshore Road into the forest. This has happened too much in the past, and there is some junk, but even worse, are the non-native plants that have been deposited, allowing them to propagate and negatively impact the forest; also they should not expand/store equipment onto adjacent vacant lots, or towards the beach area at all;
-cottagers should not be planting any species of plant not native to the park on their lots, as some will eventually end up beyond the lot and negatively impact the natural environment; they should be encouraged to remove the non-native plants that are already on their lot;
-eventual removal of cottages has been in the existing park management plan, yet the government continues to capitulate to the interests of them, rather than doing what is right to protect this nationally significant natural area. However in the few cases where cottages have been removed, the government does not attempt to restore the newly vacant lot, resulting in many non-native plants to take over, some species which are quite aggressively invasive, which will expand beyond. If the government was committed to protecting this natural environment, there must be an approved restoration plan for any and all lots as they are vacated.
-Any violation of the current or future lease conditions should result in a warning to them. Three violations, and their existing lease should be terminated;
-the park budget should be expanded to ensure there are adequate staff all year round to monitor and deal with any violations of the existing or future leases.
Please do what is right for Rondeau as the nationally significant natural area that it is, and not give in yet again to the favoured few cottagers!

The cottagers have been here for 100 years and it has been proven that they are wonderful stewards of the park. If you walk on the beach you will see people picking up garbage. They are usually cottagers. If there are bottles or waste left by the ""tourists"" it will be a cottager who stops to pick it up. If there is a snake or turtle on the road that could be hurt...again it would be a cottager who helps it out if harms way. We love this park and want to see it remain unchanged and pristine.
There is also the economic impact that we bring to the area. Personally, since we bought our cottage three years ago we have spent over one hundred thousand dollars in renovations and improvements to it. All of that has gone to local contractors and building supply businesses. As well since we are retired we have spent most of April to November at the park and we shop local businesses in the area. If you were to force the cottagers out it would be a huge blow to the local economy. We are just one cottage, if you multiply that by 275 cottages the economic effect that we have is undeniable!
However, we don't live in a bubble. We know that there is an individual in Shrewsbury who has made it a personal crusade to get rid of us (the same Shrewsbury that allows untreated waste to leach into the bay!). He has tried to enlist the help of folks who have never been to the park and know nothing of what the cottagers do for this place. We ask you to consider his input into this decision with weight it deserves. He has a personal vendetta against some of the cottagers and he is trying to punish all of us.
There are many, many reasons why the cottagers are good for the park and should be allowed to remain indefinitely. We are a vibrant village of caring owners. A long term solution not only makes sense but it is the right thing to do.

I am writing to express my support for this amendment.  I see this as a positive initiative that will provide a significant economic benefit to the Chatham-Kent area.  By providing 14 more years of occupancy to over 200 cottages ensures there are hundreds of people using amenity and services in the area.
Additionally, the continued attendance of the park by the cottagers continues a long tradition of one of the original proposed purposes of Rondeau Park, a place of recreation.  The use of the park by the hundreds of campers and cottagers is a positive use of outdoors space in the summer and winter months.
	As a final note, I encourage the government to look back at the original decision in ERO 011-1300 stating there is a desire to have a long term occupation of the cottage lots.  While a 14 year lease is welcome, it does not address the long term stability of the cottages.  The economic activity that would be brought forth by the cottagers in the event of a permanent occupancy due to renovations would be a boon to the Chatham Kent area.

Provincial parks should be for the use of everyone and no one small sub-set of the population should be given the privilege to enjoy the park land for their exclusive right. I do not support the lease extension. Rondeau's management plan indicated that the Rondeau leases should not be extended following their expiry, however here we are. I understand there is a history of cottagers in Rondeau but it is time to end this private use of our public parks. Not everyone has the opportunity to have a lease so why perpetuate leases of the wealthy few? Some of the leaseholder are not even Canadian citizens, they are international citizens that vacation here. I do not support the continuation of cottagers in Rondeau, I do not support the continuation of cottagers in Algonquin and I do not support giving perpetual lease extensions. It is time to kick the cottagers out of our provincial parks and removal all infrastructure from the park land and rehabilitate it. Humans have enough land outside the park. Habitat for valuable and at risk species is shrinking across this country. Reclaim some of the developed lease land and restore it and give it back to native flora and fauna, within park that will protected into perpetuity.
The Doug Ford government changed the funding structure of Ontario Parks, so that Ontario Parks no longer receives provincial funding and must run entirely on the revenue they receive from operations including lease fees. So I understand this is a revenue stream for Ontario Parks. Historically the Rondeau lease fees have been too low, remaining the same decades. Raising lease fees to match current day value is not good enough to justify continuing the lease program. Remove the cottagers from Rondeau! If the cottagers are upset, that is on them. The leases always had an expiry date. The policy intention of not extending the lease was in the Rondeau management plan for years. This government has to stop making decision based on a few loud people. The general public does not want cottagers in their provincial parks.  The Indigenous communities with treaty rights at Rondeau do not want the cottage leases to continue - they want them out!

106181,/comment/106181,"Hello,
I am writing my comment to express my concerns with the proposal to extend the cottage leases at Rondeau Provincial Park.
As a long time visitor of the park, I have noticed how many developments have been occurring to the cottages. Many of them are no longer cottages, however, they have become full 4 season “cottages” and homes. I do not support private occupation of provincial parks, Rondeau is ever becoming a subdivision for an elite group and not a place for the average park visitor to enjoy.
I believe that these cottages should be taken down as they are out up for sale. I can understand family cottages being passed through generations, however, I DO NOT agree with people making upwards of half a million dollars selling their cottages as they would their private homes. Provincial parks SHOULD be for the public to enjoy, and again, not benefit the select few. I have noticed that some of the cottages have been torn down over the years, but why have they stopped? This should be happening at a much quicker rate.
Ontario Parks is supposed to be “protecting important natural and cultural features while providing opportunities compatable ecologically sustainable recreation”. I have a hard time understanding how all these developments are happening to the cottages and can still be protecting our environment. There are so many rare and important species that call Rondeau home, and all of this development cannot be compatible with protection. Recreation opportunities are provided for who? Again, not the general public but the cottagers. If that land was used by the park, there are so many options for uses for the public to enjoy. Instead, all of these beaches are essentially for exclusive use by a select group.
Thank you for the opportunity to express my concerns.

In addition, the cottage community has been awaiting follow-up on the decision made in December 2019 (ERO 011-1300), which promised further consultation on long-term occupancy solutions. We urge timely action to engage with the cottage community on this proposal.

I’m writing because I support the proposal in ERO 019-8289 to amend the Rondeau Park Management Plan to allow cottages to stay until at least 2038. My family, along with so many others, has been part of the park’s cottage community for generations, and it’s become a vital part of what makes Rondeau special. The original park charter from 1894 even included the cottage community as a core part of the park’s creation, which shows just how central it is to Rondeau’s identity.
For this proposal to work, though, I believe lease agreements need to be fair, without heavy fees that might force people out. The Rondeau Cottagers Association should definitely be part of creating these terms to make sure they’re reasonable and respectful of the community’s needs.

Outside the park many cottage owners are paying property taxes greater than $10,000 per year. Not all these cottages are 4 seasons either.
I am opposed to the proposal to kick the can down the road and not resolve the issue, recognizing that their lease is way past due.
I would suggest that we change the park boudaries and let the cottages North east of the camping sites to be sold to the highest bidders. A smaller percentage of the sale proceeds could then be given back to the present owners of these cottages to enable them to buy the properties if desired. The funds can be used to enhance the park and its trails.
The other cottages in my perspective need to be discouraged from staying. This can be done by charging an aggresive lease costs and letting the leases go up double the rate of inflation. This would allow those who wish to stay to stay and the ones that feel the lease fee is too high to let their cottages come down. Overtime the cottages will be reduced and there would be no ultimatum to vacate and fight over this in 14 years. At the same time it is critical that we discourage present cottage lease holders in making major changes/expansion to their cottages.

A long term cottage tenure solution must be reached to insure the myriad benefits for everyone involved, especially the citizens of the geographic and environmental area and the neighboring towns which depend on the park for their economic diversity and vibrancy.
many, many thanks for your kind consideration!

We would rather have a 21 year extension, as it would show good faith, given the roller coaster of missed expectations we have been on for the last many years.  That would require colouring within the lines, but using a slightly brighter colour and perspective.  We have been  powerless to negotiate so  we take what we can get.  So yes, this extension is better than broken promises, but not as good as going back to the good old days when we got 21 years on repeat.

In 1894 individuals were invited to make Rondeau a location for their summer home, and so many families have enjoyed the wonders of rondeau and CK since then.
The new agreement however must have reasonable terms and not become punitive should changes and tweaks occur.  Agreements have been successful when working w all parties including the Rondeau Cottagers Association.

As an Association we support this 14-year lease extension proposal with the understanding that discussions to make our cottage community PERMANENT will begin in a timely manner. As you know Rondeau Park was chartered for the purpose of cottaging in 1894 making us Ontario's original cottage community.
As per former Minister of the Environment, Conservation & Parks Jeff Yurek the province's preferred solution is to sell the existing cottage lots to the Municipality of Chatham-Kent as a single transaction.  The lots would then be sold to the individual leaseholders. Although this plan was initiated it appears that certain persons within Ontario Parks ignored the Minister's directive and now we are back to yet another lease extension. Please see the attached email from Minister Yurek confirming same. As per Minister Yurek at the end of his term as Minister this policy has never been withdrawn or changed and still remains Ontario's official policy on Rondeau.
The Rondeau Cottagers Association looks forward to restarting discussions towards the goal of a lot sale to ensure the permanence of our unique-in-Ontario Heritage Cottage Community and fulfilling the Minister's now five-years unfulfilled promise to our members. In the meantime we support the proposed change to the Park Management Plan to facilitate the community remaining intact while these discussions are initiated.

106526,/comment/106526,"1)  I support the proposal in ERO 019-8289 to amend the Rondeau Park Management Plan to allow cottages to remain in Rondeau Park until at least 2038. The history of the Park has always included cottages, and continue to be an attraction to the park for many of the local visitors.  They cottages are understated, charming, and cottagers are respectful of their community as the leases allow them to take custodial stewardship of the land.
2)  To ensure that the exisitng leaseholders are able to continue to care for their cottages in the manner that makes them an attractive element of the park, and in keeping with the main reason for founding the Park, all lease extensions must be reasonable and not punitive in nature.  Imposing too much of a financial burden to leaseholders will diminish their ability to maintain the structures in a way that is positive for the Park.  Punitive leases will certainly cause our Heritage community owners to have to sell properties to the wealthy, a result that nobody wants.

106535,/comment/106535,"I am in favour of extending the terms. I am a cottage owner. I am totally in favour of the tentative agreement for us to buy our lots. It is in the best interest of all. The reasoning backing this is as follows:
1. Cottages have been there since they were in encouraged to do so by the Province.
2. They have not harmed the ecological integrity of the park.
3. There is no evidence that any species has declined in numbers since cottages were erected, and just maybe the numbers have Increased. If it weren't for the cottages providing habitat  cover, the species may have been at risk.
4. The cottages Do Not occupy ANY of the lake shore. In fact, the lake shore beach and sand dunes is 300 to 400 feet wider now in most places than when cottages were first allowed. It is just taken place naturally. That is the way the world evolves.
5. The only cottages with shore line are the first 5 cottages inside the park and on Rondeau Bay. These lots take up 250 feet in total of a 8 mile shore line of park boundary  ( roughly 42,240 feet ).
6.It is not fair to have in the lease that cottages must be kept in good repair, or the Ministry shall enter the property and make the repairs and charge the cottage owner for such repairs, and then could cancel or not renew the leases.
7. Cottages have been and are good stewards of the land. It is time to make the sale to cottage owners as has been  negotiated by Previous Ministers.
8. LESS than 1% of the park is occupied by these cottages, and that % is able to be sold.
Extend the lease, but get the sale of the lots done soon, so everyone can move on and make this park the Crown Jewell it once was again.

106542,/comment/106542,"Thank you for this opportunity to share my opinion with respect to this important revision to the Rondeau Park Management Plan.
I strongly support the proposal in ERO 019 8289 to amend the Management Plan to allow cottages to remain in the Park until 2038. The cottage community has been a part of the Park’s fabric since its charter in 1894 and there is no objectively demonstrated rationale for the removal of the Park’s cottages.
New lease conditions and fees should be reasonable, balancing fiscal obligation to the Province, yet not resulting in financial eviction of the cottage community brought about by uncertainty around uncontrolled lease fee increases.
The Rondeau Cottagers Association must be included in fair and transparent discussions around future terms and conditions. All parties want honest, constructive dialogue, protecting the Park for all to enjoy.
Ultimately, a solution for long term tenure of Rondeau’s cottage community must be pursued, as approved by ERO 011-1300, posted on December 20, 2019.
The current ERO proposal provides time and opportunity to address long term tenure of the historic and culturally significant cottage community.
Let’s ensure another 130 years of co-existence for all to enjoy.

106549,/comment/106549,"For over 100 years, and a part of the original plan for Rondeau, cottages and their owners have been a fixture of Rondeau Park.  The cottages were required to be substantial when the leases were granted, and over the years the owners, many of whom now are in thier 5th generation, have soulfully maintained their cottages AND the common grounds of the Park.  Generations have learned about the migratory birds that would not have done so if not for the cottages.  Traditions have been passed down, sailing vessels have been a mainstay (as opposed to noisy jet skis and power boats) and , should the leases be reasonably and affordably renewd through at least 2038, will continue to be so.  Because of this, and many other reasons,
1)  I support the proposal in ERO 019-8289 to amend the Rondeau Park Management Plan to allow cottages to remain in Rondeau Park until at least 2038, and hopefully beyond so that many more generations can benefit from the beauty that our ancestors did.
2)  It is further imperative that new leases or extensions as part of this initiative  have reasonable terms and conditions not those with economically unfeasible terms.   New lease agreements must be developed in consultation with the Rondeau Cottagers Association.
3)  We have waited at least over 5 years, patiently, for something to be done to secure our leases on a long enough and feasible enough basis to continue to maintain the cottages in a fashion complimentary to the Park, and we look forward to honest and sincere efforts on the Government's part to allow the leaseholders to remain the Heritage of the Park, as was the original intent of Rondeau over 100 years ago

Heritage, Diversity, Community Values, Economic Impact and Welcome Variance in Ontario's Provincial Park Features
- Ontario is a diverse environment where recreational values founded in Rondeau's original charter still have value today - and should be enhanced
- Ontario's Provincial Parks have the capacity given their location and connection with environment, culture, history and values - including long standing communities to be diverse.  Part of this diversity includes heritage features like cottages at Rondeau
- Rondeau's cottages enhance the cultural values of the region, existing in harmony with other recreational features, enhancing visitor experiences and providing a vital peak into Ontario's unique past
- Rondeau's cottage community economic impact is well known and documented - given Ontario's commitment to prosperous, thriving remote and rural communities, maintaining, enhancing and securing the environmentally compatible Cottage Community at Rondeau ensures and assists local businesses, services and economies to grow across Chatham-Kent
- Cottages enhance, support and reflect the heritage, cultural and recreational values embedded within Ontario's Parks features and aspirations, maintaining and ensuring this community demonstrates a commitment and ability to value what Ontario residents and visitors have loved for generations
Be reasonable, consider Red Tape Reduction and ensure a positive experience for Cottage Lease Clients
-  We want to emphasize and ensure that new leases or extensions as part of this initiative must have reasonable terms and conditions and not be driven to achieve eviction by punitive economic terms.
- Ontario's commitment to reducing the cost of living for Ontario residents must be carried over into this new phase with the Rondeau - and given Ontario's commitment to Red Tape Reduction - must be created in good faith, with a commitment to keeping costs reasonable and the process straightforward
- New lease agreements must be developed in consultation with the Rondeau Cottagers Association.
- I encourage you to consider a longer term lease extension for all the reasons listed above and a request to further consider the administrative burden lease extensions impose on cottage lease holders and the wider community

106660,/comment/106660,"Jason Travers and members of the Ontario Parks Operations Branch:
The problem with extending the Rondeau Park cottage leases is that the current cottagers already don’t respect or follow the terms of their leases, are constantly pushing the boundaries, and nothing seems to be done about it.
Extending the leases by another 14 years is the easy thing to do, but it just kicks the can down the road, all the while enabling these cottagers to do increased damage to this important Carolinian forest land and Great Lakes shoreline, seemingly without repercussions.
Is Park Superintendent Brad Connor or anyone else doing regular checks of these cottage lots, and either fining or removing cottagers who violate the rules?
On just a cursory drive around the park North of Bennett the other day, and just at a glance, I saw these issues* (listed below).
Mr. Connor has the ability (and responsibility) to do more thorough checks all around the lots to prevent these cottagers from continuing to destroy the natural areas.
Please note that while the issue of invasive plants might seem like a gentle one, Rondeau is one of the last homes of the endangered Red Mulberry, (just one example), so having plants like White Mulberries on their lots directly prevents the Red Mulberry from regenerating (as the White is more aggressive).
I also find it concerning that the Rondeau Cottagers Association, who say on their own website that their primary goal is to lobby to privately buy & own their lots, is continued to be given a foothold. They now have at least one member on the Chatham City Council (Alyson Storey) to petition for their private and greedy remit, which would directly take from Ontario residents and more importantly, from the (sometimes endangered) flora & fauna that call Rondeau Park home.
Ideally, these leases would finally be discontinued, the land returned to nature, and a more robust plan of species protection/ invasive plant removal put in place for the future.
With the constant encroachment of global warming and destruction of natural habitats, is this not the obvious and inevitable thing to do for future planning?
But as it’s now October and it’s likely too late to make a u-turn by the December lease end, please at least commit to a more rigorous policy of checking lease violations and damage to nature, and be decisive and proactive about removing cottages that don’t comply.
Being complacent towards these cottagers’ behaviour is doing a disservice to the rest of Ontarians, and to the nature in the park itself.
(Also, please tell me you’re discounting the assured 278 “letters of approval” you’ll get to this proposal from the cottagers themselves. Of course they want their own leases to continue, and will call themselves “Stewards of the land” - ha! - to convince you. The question is whether the other 14 million citizens of Ontario actually think this is the way forward for the park.)
And instead of saying “The ministry is not considering sale of the cottage lots at this time”, please assure Ontarians that their provincial park lands will NEVER be for sale to private (and in this case, largely American,) owners.

*Cursory/ incomplete list of issues I observed recently, and only North of Bennett. I give these as a small sample - the park needs to be doing more to observe and weed these out - literally!
Has invasive plants growing on property:
18 cases, as follows:
• vinca growing profusely in front lawns
• huge invasive honeysuckle bushes in front lawn (5 cases)
• large white mulberry in front lawn, English Ivy growing up front of cottage (2 cases)
• lily of the valley growing along cottage / in a front flower bed (2 cases)
• residential side of beach access #4 filled with euphorbia
• barberry hedge* along beach access #6 property boundary
• what looks like a barberry hedge* surrounding cottage
• big Asian meadowsweet bushes along street side property line
• Privet hedge lining front of cottage
(*also worsens tick populations)
Mowing into the designated wild areas adjoining their lots:
• 3 cases
Invasives in adjacent natural areas. Note that these are almost assuredly from cottages dumping garden waste, as going down Rondeau Road (no cottages) is fairly native, while the parallel lakeshore Road with cottages on one side is full of invasives including Japanese Honeysuckle, Dog Strangling Vine, etc.
• Vinca thick along either side of beach access #2)
• Lots of burning bush at front of beach access #3)
• Thick vinca in forest south side of one cottage, driveway lined with barberry shrubs
Renovations expanding the original building footprint:
3 cases:
• One added north side extension, doubling their  footprint
• One with Tyvek wrapping currently up around a frame that exceeds the interior original cottage
• One built a new screened in front porch in the past few years that exceeds the original cottage footprint. (Can they later just reinforce those walls, and that is a loophole to expand their building?)
There are also several instances of cottagers occupying their properties as full time residences/ not using them only as recreationally, as intended.

I do not consider The environmental impact of cottages for at least another 14 years to be of any negative significance. As the Park remains open to the Public - that footprint by camping, day users, hunters, boaters, hikers, birders, fishing,  etc, and supporting infrastructure would be considered more of a negative impact on the Park environment.

Cottages should continue to exist in Rondeau Park through 2038, as they have since the beginning . I feel the Park Plan should reflect cottages/cottagers as a permanent element , for as long as the Park exists. Don’t bother with 1 and 2 year lease extensions, or even 21 year leases, but 99 years with automatic renewals.

My preferred revision would be the long term permanent solution of lot sale to cottagers that was agreed to by Chatham Kent mayor and Minister of Environment in 2019. Implementation was put on hold during “COVID 2020-2021’”. No explanation has been provided by Ministers of Environment since then as to why they have yet to complete implementation of the agreement made.

106759,/comment/106759,"Cottages belong in Rondeau.  The Park was chartered for cottages in 1894 ...Rondeau is Ontario's Original Cottage Community!  The heritage cottages are in balance with the environment and the cottagers are good stewards. All of the cottage lots take up 0.6% of the park and block none of the Lake Erie shoreline. The proposal to amend the Park Plan in ERO 019-8289 should be supported. A plan should be developed in accordance with ERO 011-1300 to make the cottages a permanent fixture of Rondeau.  It's the right thing to do.

---
I support the proposal outlined in ERO 019-8289 to amend the Rondeau Park Management Plan, ensuring the cottages remain in the park at least until 2038. The 1894 Park charter identifies the cottage community as one of the two founding purposes of the Park, and the Heritage Cottage Community has been a vital part of its identity from the very beginning.
Any new or extended leases under this initiative must include fair and reasonable terms, avoiding the use of punitive economic conditions to force eviction. Lease agreements should be developed in collaboration with the Rondeau Cottagers Association to ensure transparency and fairness.
The decision on ERO 011-1300, posted on December 20, 2019, stated: “Our final policy decision respecting this proposal will allow us to consult on a proposal for a new option for the long-term occupation of cottage lots. We expect to post a new proposal on the Environmental Registry of Ontario early in 2020.” The cottage community eagerly awaits this proposal and the opportunity to engage in discussions to develop a sustainable long-term solution for cottage tenure.

Any new or extended leases should have fair terms, not unfair ones designed to force people out. The new agreements should be created with input from the Rondeau Cottagers Association to make sure they are reasonable.
The decision for ERO 011-1300, posted on December 20, 2019, said a new proposal for long-term cottage use would be shared in early 2020. The cottage community is still waiting for this proposal and looks forward to working on a lasting solution.
