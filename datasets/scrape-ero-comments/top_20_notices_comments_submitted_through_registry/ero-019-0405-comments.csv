You cannot hunt any animal without paying some sort of fee. We need to continue to produce revenue, and if someone isn’t willing to pay the small fee for the Tag Allocation they should not be able to hunt, they did not put in their part.

32890,/comment/32890,"It would be great if:
- hunters could see how many points they have online.
- for each WMU, a list was published with the minimum number of points for a guaranteed tag similar to how group size vs draw results is published today.
- hunters could earn points by doing conservation work but NOT by donating $ to a conservation org
I see there being a problem if hunters were allowed to transfer points to another hunter. Could lead to a black market on moose points for $.

32891,/comment/32891,"While I support the vast majority of the proposed changes I am extremely unsupportive of the proposal to limit party hunting to a maximum of 10 hunters per tag. I belong to a hunting camp with 18 members. If we only manage to draw one tag almost half of the members will not be able to participate in the hunt. If the tags are allocated based on science I believe it completely unfair to limit the number of people able to hunt for that animal. If the intent is to reduce harvest reduce the number of tags given out not the number of people able to hunt in the party.

32893,/comment/32893,"The moose point system would be a huge improvement for populations and outdoorsmen.
Adding more bow hunts will only continue to add pressure to animals. These animals are already under pressure, why do we add more hunting time?
Much like deer, pressured from the start of fall until the end of December. No time to rest easy before the hard winters.
One week bow or gun your choice, everyone wears orange. Make it simple, and better for the animals in the long run. A small percentage bow hunt only , why do they sway the majority ? A hunter is a hunter whether you choose a rifle or bow.
Improve predatory mitigation. We need to be Abel to shoot coyotes/wolves and spring bear hunt. Coyotes or the hy-brid version is devastating areas and out of control.
We could also look into Aboriginal hunting practices but they would be an entirely whole other ball game. I witnessed the waste on a fly in trip up near Landsdowne House. If my phone had batteries I would have posted it on CTV news it was disgraceful. Not to forget all the trucks and tractors in the lake we could see when flying in for landing.

32897,/comment/32897,"The game is simple !! First and foremost MNR needs to get rid of calf tags!! Period! Second we are all human and if your hunting with a cow tag and you harvest a calf it should be determined an antlerless tag instead of a cow tag for those  Misshaps  that can happen! Third there needs to be a minimum bull size like other provinces and territories and States have in their regulations! There’s no point in shooting all the 1.5 year old moose if you want the numbers to grow! 3 points on the fronts of the antler because judging the bulls rack width just isn’t accurate enough! You can put more tags in circulation for the draw and with new refs on bull size it will just help manage everything better!  And lastly poaching is poaching no matter your indigenous status the wasteful shooting and not recovering animals is sickening we are all in this together and with proper management from everyone the moose will thrive and I bet the numbers will increase a lot inside of a decade !!

32900,/comment/32900,"I have read the proposal on changes to the Moose Hunt for 2020 and 2021. I agree with the majority of the suggestions for tag allocation and archery opportunities. My only concern is limiting the size of party hunting to 10. We have a long standing camp with 14 to 16 hunters annually. It would be hard to only allow 10 to hunt if we were only allotted one tag. We have not had a tag in 6 years so we have been party hunting for Calves . .
If we have Bull, Cow/calf and calf tag allocations in 2021 I'm assuming that if we had  two of any type of tag we could have 10 people per tag maximum party hunt that tag?  Just wondering how that part would work.

Perhaps consider eliminating the ""group hunt"" and impliment a policy that states that only hunters actually accompanying (arms lenght)  of the tag holder may actively hunt under  said tag.  Limit the number of accompanying hunters to two.
Under the proposed changes, putting up to 10 hunters in an area to harvest only 1 moose seems only to be asking for problems, legally as well as hunting ethics- why should a group of up to 10 hunters be able to stake out an area or areas when only only hunter has a valid harvest tag or 20 hunters if there happens to be 2 valid tags......

32913,/comment/32913,"I like the point system proposed for the moose tags. I'm not sure about the cost associated for bull, cow or calf. Since cows raise calves for a year after birth, seems to me they should cost more. This relationship is important to the survival of the species. At any rate, regardless of the cost and point system, I hope the population numbers will still be monitored with great care.
I do not think calves or cows with calves should be hunted especially in areas where populations are down.
I still believe that it is the hunters (and people) that need to be managed - not the moose. The moose can take care of themselves! In that vein, I think hunters should be able to have an opportunity to earn points by doing conservation work. HOWEVER, I don't believe hunters should be able to pay for extra points. (That would open up the doors to fraud or a two-tiered system with preference for the privileged.)

Success rates for bow hunting are notoriously low. Given this I would suggest that instead of taking any away from the rifle hunt that adding 10-15 tags to the bow hunt would have a limited impact on moose numbers.
Secondly not even being able to get a calf tag means that hunters who have to book vacation time months or a year in advance of the draw results are left in limbo. There should be some system in place where 10 or more unsuccessful hunters could at least get one calf tag.
The economic impact that some of these changes will have will be profound. Literally thousands of hunters that currently hunt every year will be sitting at home. Not to mention the impact thus will have on the mnrf budget. No license money no budget.

32932,/comment/32932,"I would like to take the time to address a certain number of items recommended. I do believe there are some positive steps taken in this recommendation, however I feel it may be swayed to harm established Organized Hunting Camps in favour of single applicants.
I am a member of a moose hunting camp that has been in WMU 50 since 1946, we currently have 15 members and typically hunt with 17 hunters, we have been hunting with these sorts of numbers for the past 73 years. I think limiting us to 10 hunters per tag is discriminatory against a well established successful hunting camp that has the unfortunate luck of only receiving a single tag. There have been many previous years where we have only drawn a single adult tag and have considered ourselves lucky at that and have gone on to have a great week of hunting whether or not we are successful at filling our tag. I do not believe there should be a mandatory maximum number of hunters per tag unless there is a provision for providing a calf tag to large established camps that pay taxes and land use permit fees to the MNRF for the sole purpose of having a moose hunting camp.
I do not believe you should lose all your earned points if you are successful in a calf tag application. I believe there could be a prorated system where a calf is not worth the same number of points as a bull would be. By limiting calf tags to a specific number in all WMU's the ability for residents to enjoy moose hunting is going to be drastically reduced as many people rely on a calf tag to allow them to participate in the annual moose hunt when they are unable to draw an adult tag.

During logging moose are drawn into areas with easy access to food (logged areas).  Efforts should be made to spread out the logging to disperse the population of moose and clear cut areas (small areas) that are close to selectively cut areas.  This allows alot of small growth to up very dense.  Logging companies should be more closely monitored with regards to the condition of their harvest areas.

32940,/comment/32940,"What are the Proposed Fee Costs going to actually look like if the proposed changes go through?
If Moose hunters in Ontario have to submit a fee to apply. How much is this going to cost in relation to just purchasing a moose licence and applying at the same time??
And if the lucky moose hunter individual in Ontario receives a tag in the area they applied, How much more money is that going to cost the Moose Hunter?  Costs should reflect the current 2019 licence fees to hunt Moose. If the costs to apply for a moose tag, and actually pay to accept and receive the Moose tag drawn go Up-compared to just buying a Moose licence , it would seem to me the Costs to Hunt moose are going up before one even enters the bush.

32948,/comment/32948,"I have been a moose hunter for almost 20 years and the tag allocation is/was obviously not working since I've ever only received 1 tag in a group. I hunt mostly in WMU 42 and some years in WMU 21/22. My main issue is for WMU 42 where my family has a hunt camp. When the tags changed a few years ago I decide to quit moose hunting for reason that the draw was unfair and the amount of tags was just not worth the money I keep paying every year. I'm sure the ministry has noticed a decline in moose hunters in all of Ontario never mind just in WMU 42, and let me guess the moose population hasn't went up? Not sure why the ministry thinks its moose hunters that are the cause for the moose population decline. Bears kill more moose per year than hunters. The good part is that the ministry kind of realized that and re-opened the spring bear hunt. Although I don't hunt bears in the spring and I only hunt in the fall I try to manage the moose population in my little hunting area that way. With the sudden drop of moose hunters that must have been a lot of money that the ministry hasn't got from the hunters. Now your proposing a fee to apply and then another fee for an actual license. I guess this is kind of like the Elk draw but again it's more money out of hunters pockets.
Mandatory surveys. I've been filling these surveys out for years and still not sure why. It asks me how many moose i've seen and from what I can tell the population isnt going down and see at least double digit moose in a week long hunt. Does anyone actually look at these and do they take it into consideration in the population of moose?
Printing of tags: The ministry no longer prints out the tags and I don't necessarily disagree with that. I like the forward thinking of less pollution and saving cost which should be important for any business but the license fees should also go down since that cost is no longer associated with printing of tags.
Now don't get me wrong some of these suggestions are positive. Maximizing groups helps the hunters who don't hunt or know that many people who hunt, cutting down on ghost hunters is HUGE and a major problem that people have finally noticed. Like ""getting my wife to take the course and applying and then transferring  the tag and never setting foot ever in the bush"" was obviously happening all over the place. The idea of split cow/calf tag is interesting but may be problematic as I see the problem with the later calf season that is happening now. If you have a cow tag and fill it now you have a calf on its own with a higher risk of not surviving and thus bringing down the population for no reason.
I'm not sure why the Province of Quebec moose population is staying strong and they have the most simple system of all, 2 hunters equals 1 tag. Plain and simple. The rules your going to impose seem very complicated and someone has to keep track of this point system. Would it be fisable to just make it the same for Ontario? maybe not with 2 hunters but lets say 4 hunters for a bull and 3 for a cow and no calf hunting for a few years till the population goes up and if you see the population go down for cows for example then bring the quota up to 5 or 6 hunters for that year. That way 6 people have used their tag and cant even shoot a calf which keeps the population up.
Limiting people out of province and making them pay is a great idea. I know their are a lot of people that buy property in Ontario for that reason. Yes a small part of the moose hunters will be mad but now they will just have to pay a little more to hunt just like I do if I want to hunt out of province.
I don't think bringing the km down is really going to do much other than make hunters more mad than they already are. With everyone having cell phones now days and or walkies talkies with ranges of 25km plus their is no need to bring that down.
I guess with a point system I will be guaranteed a tag eventually which the old system didn't have that. Not sure how many years I will have to wait or how many points I'll need and how much money I'll need to spend but I guess that will be up to me and all the other hunters to decide.
I probably won't hear from anyone cause their will be thousands of responses but I'm ok with that since I had my chance to say something.

32952,/comment/32952,"I completely agree with making changes to the calf hunt in (WMUs) 37, 40, 41, 42 and 47, but I believe the issue lies with the few number of adult moose tags in this area. The hunters are fed up and have no choice but to hunt calf. I am a firm believer that most hunting groups would not kill as many calfs if they actually received an adult moose tag. Hopefully this change will increase their chance for an adult moose tag.
Not sure I agree with limiting the number of hunters who can hunt under a tag to 10. We have been applying and hunting with a group of 15 for as far as I can remember. All we want is 1 moose tag. We probably wouldn't elect to purchase a tag if we had multiple people who were successful. If we are forced to limit the number of hunters that can hunter a tag, then we would be forced to buy the extra tag, just so that we could all hunt together on more than 1 tag. My suggestion is to leave the number at 15, thus not affecting the groups that have been hunting together for many years.

32957,/comment/32957,"Overall, I am satisfied with the changes. It shows hunters that the ministry has been listening and is reacting accordingly.
My only concerns are that moose hunting becomes a rich man's hunt if the final price to acquire a bull tag is substantial. Already, it is nearly out of reach for many who must travel long distances from southern Ontario. Jacking the cost of a tag would put those people on the sidelines altogether and the revenue would be lost completely. The difference should be made up by increasing the cost for non resident tags.
Many hunters would like to know the total number of outfitter tags allocated per WMU as well, if the option of eliminating them altogether is not going to happen, though it should. Let them hunt black bears. Transparency goes a long way in restoring hunter confidence in the ministry, which most would agree is at an all time low. Annual aerial surveys are a must if proper scientific decisions are going to made to manage the population. Estimates based on voluntary surveys isnt working. I work in an airport tower with a fire base and we see mnrf aircraft flying all types of ""training"" exercises yet they cant manage to survey the moose populations on a regular basis, which is shameful and a misuse of taxpayer funds.
Lastly, though it may be impossible due to outdated and obsolete treaties, the ministry should continue to urge the indigenous hunters to report their harvests to better manage hunting opportunities going forward.
All in all, kudos to whoever made the decision to finally go ahead with the long awaited overhaul to the system.

32965,/comment/32965,"The efforts underway to improve upon the moose hunting application process is a positive step. Amending the application/draw process as proposed should theoretically provide greater moose hunting opportunities than those provided under the current system. However, the frustration felt by hunters about the moose hunting tag allocation system has primarily been brought about by the substantial tag reductions that appear to have been arbitrarily imposed. The credibility of this reduction is suspect, in that either insufficient scientific data to support these extreme reductions exist or the MNR has dismally failed to communicate sufficient scientific data to support their dramatic reductions in tag allocations. Furthermore, either insufficient scientific data is being gathered or it is not being adequately communicated to reflect the success/failure of their tag reduction initiative in increasing moose populations. The consensus of many avid outdoorsman is that the MNR’s management of the moose population has been deplorable and continues to lack a credible scientific basis. In addition, the management of the moose population appears to be singularly focused upon licensed hunters with a failure to address indigenous harvesting activities, logging activities (habitat), over population of predators (bears and wolves) precipitated by poor management strategies (cancellation of spring bear hunt and implementation of wolf tag system). In conclusion, I concur that a new system needs to be implemented for a fair and equitable tag allocation system to ensure a continued and sustainable moose population. However, this is only one small facet of a constellation of failures by the MNR in effectively managing our natural resources. A collective approach is required to truly ensure the success of the species for future generations and to allow all of our children the opportunity to experience this part of their heritage.

Most importantly cut out the calf license, big animals come from some where. I lived in Alberta for years and they have a nice system on applying for game hunting, maybe take some pointers from that or some of the other provinces, were don’t mind paying admin fees for applying for different animal hunts, as long as you get an adult license every few years. We do well as group in Ontario, but other do not do as well, Alberta also offers a partner license you can team up with another person so you can have a chance and pay a fee for a partner license as well. There are a lot of changes that can be done but the big one in my eyes is cut out the calf license and the big application fee.

32969,/comment/32969,"After reading the proposed changes and reviewing the proposals in the moose management review. I have one grave concern that the use of ATV's was not restricted to the retrieval of game.  I have personally witnessed hunters running calf moose on forestry roads and thereby increasing their success rates. I have also witnessed hunters who do nothing but drive on forestry roads and shoot moose who happen to cross in front of them. This seems contrary to how hunting is taught during the licencing program for new hunters.  It also favours these road hunters who put on far more miles than a person who stalks or ambushes a moose. I suggest that the BGMAC submit a supplement to their review that includes a restriction on the use of ATV.

32974,/comment/32974,"please do not put a points based system into effect. If you think moose hunters are dismayed at the present system, well they will be baffled at a points based system. Leave the group tag system we have now in place, and eliminate the individual hunter, minimum group application required for an adult moose. The frustrated hunters today, are those that want to get their own tag. Nobody should hunt moose alone, require 2 licences minimum for adult tag. If every body would apply as a group in today's' system, there would be very few dissatisfied moose hunters.
Also you must get the indigenous community on board to some limit of kill. In the report it stated that no obligation can be put on the indigenous community, based on court rulings, but in fact the Supreme court did state that limits can be imposed in the name of conservation. It could be deemed a conservation issue , to submit mandatory harvest reports, now that the rest of the population is required to submit them.
Again, do not start the points based system, because in ten years, points creep, will be a thing, and most hunters will be objecting to not being able to get enough points to get an adult tag.

32976,/comment/32976,"It is time for change. But I have some concerns.
I am part of a large camp that is located on private property. I have been a member for 30 years. I do not understand comments about large party hunting conflicts.
Individual applications- It has been disturbing to see multiple tags issued individually to members in one camp and none to group applications because of a flawed draw system. The proposed change will not change this.  I can see how one camp gets many tags and dozens of other camps get nothing. I believe some people apply and do not have property to hunt but use the tag as a negotiating tool to get access to land.
What has the greater positive impact on hunters and community one person& one tag or one tag and fifteen people?  I respectfully submit that the largest legitimate groups should get one tag. During the past several years our large group has only drawn two tags. We do not always fill the tags. We set rules and manage ourselves such as with the deer season despite our successful antlerless tags draws. We do not fill all our tags in any year. There is more to the sport than just filling tags. But having a tag brings opportunity for the full experience.
An additional week of bow hunting in area 61 will further reduce opportunity for party hunting.
Limiting party hunting numbers. I am struggling with this. Our camp could have two groups. How would the rules apply to a party of ten and six individual hunters on the same property living in the same accommodations? Or two parties?  The proposal would Have a significant negative defect on established groups like ours. There are many established camp in our area. We are part of the Limerick Lake Hunting Association which has many similarity established camps. I would ask that you reconsider the maximum number of party hunters.
A system should take into consideration maximizing opportunities for the greatest number of hunters while taking into consideration managing the species and legitimate hunters with legitimate land to hunt before they get a tag.
Also opportunity should only go to Ontario residents as they live here and pay taxes that support the programs that control and monitor the wildlife. Otherwise we risk becoming like other locations like some states that auction off tags to the highest bidder and the residents do not get the opportunity. It becomes the sport of the rich funded by the residents.
Our camp has passed the heritage down through several generations and will continue to do so as long as we are able. I respectfully ask that you reconsider some of the changes as there must be common ground between party hunters and individuals interests.
But it is time for changes to the current system just maybe not everything proposed.

32981,/comment/32981,"My thoughts are if you want to help increase the moose population than you must cancel the hunt of Cow moose.
Reasons are as follows:
#1- One bull moose can impregnate more than 1 Cow moose but a Cow moose can only get pregnant once. Therefore killing a cow moose equals no calf at all. And the bull moose could have already impregnated another which means the possibility of calf moose
#2- Calf hunt should be only aloud for a couple weeks as is in some WMU's. A cow could have 2 calves so it is possible that one still survived.
#3- If you kill a Cow moose and she has a calf/calves, the chance of survival is very minimal for the calf without its ""mom"" so that means even though you shot a cow and not the calf, in the long run you just killed the calf because chance of survival with out the Cow is very slim.

32982,/comment/32982,"There doesn't seem to be an emphasis on the geographic location of hunting within WMUs in the report.
Forest managers would like to see an inter WMU zone approach where certain areas of WMUs are restricted to hunting of all moose for a period of time to allow for forest management activities to harvest and regenerate browse and cover (habitat) opportunities for Moose across the landscape. As it stands right now, the MNRF is requiring Forest Industry to manage road infrastructure at a cost, with no assistance from the moose hunting program to partner in the recovery of these key habitat features such as food and cover.
We feel the current forest management approach is one dimensional and that with additional and enforced control of an area to hunters through law a real benefit to the moose population could be achieved. The Forest Industry is able to assist through its road use management strategies in these areas of population growth opportunities.

32983,/comment/32983,"When moving to the point system everyone should start at zero and not from when they first started applying. You will have the same problem with people waiting several years for a tag because their points are so low. The proposed method may discourage young hunters from applying given they are less likely to still get a tag and less likely to invest in hunting/hunt camp gear etc (money into economy).
Also, cancel non resident tags or limit them to tag draws every 2 year so Ontario hunters (tax payers) and hunt camp/property owners have a better chance of drawing a tag.
Also, look at expanding guaranteed group size tags in more wildlife management units.
I think the expansion of moose bow tags and bow seasons is a great idea.

32985,/comment/32985,"I have a number of concerns regarding the rule changes.
1. You suggest that there will be economic gains to the southern regions that will be having an early bow season. With the tags allotted to the bow season coming out of the gun season quota for that WMU will this potential economic gain be just a wash as you will most likely have fewer hunters in the gun season due to the lack of tags allocated. Additionally this could hurt the economic gains currently enjoyed in the north as bowhunters will be moving their hunts to the southern WMU’s if successful in the tag allocation system.
2. I am a member of a registered hunt camp with the MNRF. We have more than 10 members. Does this mean if we are successful in the tag allocation system we have to tell 2 members that they cannot hunt moose. Further to this we have members that have (sons, daughters, grand children) that are up and coming hunters and normally come up for a day or 2 during the hunt. If we have a maximum of 10 hunters in a party, the inclusion of our next generation hunters could be in jeopardy.
3. As a member of a registered hunt camp, if all members are unsuccessful in the tag allocation system then the hunt is canceled. We have no interest in applying for or hunting in a region different from the WMU our camp is in. At least today we would have the option to hunt for a calf. Again an impact to the economic growth for the region
4. If a group only has a cow/calf tag in the new tag allocation system and a cow and calf come out to hunter and the cow is shot the calf has to be left alone. I question the survival rate of calves in their first year without a cow. Under the new rules we are shooting one moose but are we leaving the other to the wolves or other without the cow.
Under today’s system we would have the opportunity to harvest both if we have a cow tag and have other hunters in the group with calf tags.
5. I don't see why (other than a slight difference in cost) anyone would apply for just a calf tag and loose all their accumulated points on just calf hunting.
I can see a major increase in cows taken under the Cow/Calf tags which would negatively impact the moose population.

32986,/comment/32986,"I’ve had the privilege of hunting moose in Northeastern Ontario for 30 years now. Across the years many positive changes have occurred for big game hunters; better technology, better moose knowledge, better forest roads, etc. As a result, our hunt group has improved each year. And each fall, our outlook is positive and enthusiastic.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of today’s MNR, a shadow of its former self. Gone are its glory days of the ‘50s and ‘60s. For all of my 30 years, Ontario has had a moose management strategy. It was a contentious issue then and it still is today. On paper, their plans seem good but in reality their outcomes, not so good. (E. g. The lottery has not increased the herd size as planned.)
In their 1999-2000 annual report to the legislature, the MNR states in regards to increased fees for angling and hunting licences: “These increased revenues will help to address many of the long-standing financial concerns regarding the fish and wildlife program.”1 Twenty years later, the MNR is still plagued with financial concerns and too many unhappy customers (E. g. moose hunters).
In their 2001-2002 Expenditure Estimates, the Ministry of Natural Resources had an estimated annual budget of $385,651,440.2 This translates to $528,188,212 in 2019 dollars.3 The planned budget for 2019-2020 is 602.4 million.4 In 18 years, the MNR’s budget increased 14%. Undoubtedly, higher administration costs are gulping much of that increase leaving little for expanding moose aerial surveys, for example.
Enough with consulting angry and cynical moose hunters each time a new government takes power. It’s time for Ontario to spend its own money researching population declines instead of waiting (& free-loading) on others such as Minnesota and Wisconsin to find answers. Also, good plans are hatched on solid data. Therefore, a greater commitment is needed to increase land coverage of moose aerial surveys ― hence greater helicopter rental costs. You can’t conduct research on the cheap and expect meaningful data.
The bottom line is, until the premier of Ontario makes Fish and Wildlife a higher priority and allocates more funds, MNR staff and advocate groups are fighting a losing battle on behalf of anglers and hunters. The private sector has a track record of planning and delivering goods and services their clients want (E. g. Apple, Sony, Google). Maybe now is the time to consider privatizing Moose Management?

32987,/comment/32987,"Understanding fully that there will never be full agreement on how to manage this resource i fail to understand why for 35 years this management system of calf harvest was not fully implemented. When this system was first implemented in Ontario it was following the european system that worked extremely well. One of the key factors of the system in Europe is that predators were also managed but we did not adopt that here in Ontario. Furthermore the political bumble of giving in to the lobbying to cancel the spring bear hunt also contributed to our management issues. Good science should dictate management. If i am reading everything properly we will be losing the opportunity to ensure that every one will be able to hunt each year which i feel is important. Applying for a calf tag only is not something people will do. People who support the change to calf hunting in my opinion do not understand that half of the calves do not make the winter. I also feel that the MNRF do not have accurate population numbers.
Reducing the distance from 5 to 3 km is nothing that will affect population and will only serve to create problems for hunters/CO interactions. and also creates safety issues with large groups of hunters.

32999,/comment/32999,"I don't like the idea of a point based system.  I live in unit 28, the which has a larger influx of Torontonians for the moose hunt.  This is because it is because it is easy to get to for the moose hunt.  The proposed system will result in a loss of tags for the local people, even with the +1 point for the northern residents.  With the present applicants for our district, it will be a 1 tag every 10 years scenario.  This means a hunter like myself will ever only have the chance at one tag in my lifetime.  Also new hunters a will be in their late 20's before they have a chance at tag allocations.  This is unfair.
The way to fix this inconsistency is have a hybrid system.  Maintain the points based on unsuccessful years but include the lottery.  Therefore, John has not had a tag in 5 years he should have 5 tickets in the lottery.  Jim had at tag last year so he only gets 1 ticket + 1 ticket for being from unit 28, in the lottery.  This would weigh the opportunities to those who have been unsuccessful in the past but still give the opportunities to those who are new or were successful in the past.
The proposed point system is not a viable or fair system as it alienates hunters.   A hybrid system would at least encourage and not discourage the next generation.

I was also concerned to see the way no mention of the unregulated hunt by indigenous Peoples or the spraying of glyphosphate by forestry industry in the new moose management plan as i believe these to have a far greater impact on our moose populations. Over all I think the proposed changes are positive but would like to see a system where the tags allocated based on the number of moose and allow the hunter to choose his method of choice rifle bow or muzzle loader.

Strong consideration should be given to eliminating the calf hunt altogether. The success of the calf’s is critical in determining future populations of the moose. As an avid hunter, who has hunted many different areas have had many opportunities to harvest a calf however choose not to. It is not as difficult as many assume.

33017,/comment/33017,"Good day,
First and foremost I believe that just like with the fisheries,  we cannot allow a group of people to follow a different set of rules.  I'm sure you are all very tired of hearing this but first nations people should not be allowed to hunt longer seasons and without sanction to shooting adult moose.  I've been hunting moose for 11 years now and have been very lucky.  The group of 9, I hunt with, hunt hard and are successful almost every year harvesting a calf and we have been very lucky over the last 11 years to get 2 bull tags which we also filled.
The problem isn't with a group of 9 people harvesting 1 adult moose or calf.   The problem is  with 2 maybe 3 sometimes more some times just 1 first nations person harvesting 2 maybe 3 moose in the fall with almost no fall back.   I know quite a few people that hunt and fish and they all have the same stories.  They know first nations people that go out and shoot 1,2 - 3 adult moose in one fall and they're all giving meat away, this really burns me up.   I work as an automotive mechanic and you have no idea how many times people of which a write about that harvest many moose under a indigenous card will bring entire roasts to give because they're clearly harvesting more meat then they could ever eat.
In my opinion if you do nothing, about first nations people not following our same rules you'll never get the moos population in order.  Just like lake nippissing.  The lake was netted by first nations people for years and years and the ministry tried everything to sustain the walleye population slot sizes, limit reduction.  Now we are only aloud I think 1 walleye as a limit.  It took the chief to say we are ruining our lake we need to stop.   And just from this you can see the walleye coming back around.
So if you are to make any changes that worth wild.  In my honest opinion, something needs to be done about this or you may as well hang up the gloves as they say.   Quit while you're ahead its not going to change.
And this is not a bash on aboriginal people.  I have nothing against them.  I know many indigenous  people that do only harvest 1 moose a year and it's not because they cant harvest more but because how much meat can you eat.   And maybe if I was born first nation and had a card and didn't have the right people to teach me I would be doing the same.  But looking in from the outside I do see a problem.  And sure allowing less adult tags and shortening the calf hunt will help but not for the long run.   It'll only sustain low numbers longer, if even that.

My point here is if you want to hunt as your native ancestors with no regulations use the same tools as they did. Not using modern conveniences plus your ancestral rights. Fair is fair. The native harvest should be mandatory reporting as ours is. The point of these revisions is to keep a healthier population for future so why not cover all the bases?

33022,/comment/33022,"There seem to be valid changes proposed,my concerns are large group applications getting preferred treatment as this would be the largest contributor of ""ghost  hunters"". Simply granting a tag to large groups is a money grab unless the entire group must participate in the actual hunt to validate said tag. The shorter season for a separate calf hunt is also a sham. I understand  the lower success rate for bow hunters but disagree with an earlier season during prime rut to facilitate their success-bow hunting is an elitist choice, not to be catered to, archers can apply for tags like other sportsmen and choose to hunt  in whatever legal method. Ambushing baited prey or calling  mating bulls or even circling an area to drive a fleeing animal into a trap or waiting shooter seems unethecal to me however successful. The MNR must cease catering to lobbyists and special interest groups, exceptions to the rules cause confusion and frustration. In closing , I applaud the introduction of a point system to compliment the pool system, I may renew my hunting passion in light of fairness being implemented.

33027,/comment/33027,"I do not agree with the proposed changes to the moose draw. It seems to penalize groups that apply in areas where tags are readily available to get and are willing to travel for the opportunity to hunt. Hunters that are unwilling to travel and want to use there ""deer"" camp for moose and complain about no tags also apply where there is little to no chance of success. I have a moose season at home but realized the chance of getting a tag is hard so we travel to where tags are available on our group size.
The transfer of tags needs to be open as for a young hunting group like ours ( everyone under 30 ) we don't know if we can go due to births and child health up till the day we leave. Also students won't know if they can leave till school year has started. Some years this is the unfortunate truth. There are some that have the need for transfer. This transfer is   penalizes younger generation from hunting and lost opportunities to hunt. This was over looked due to the fact most moose hunters are 40+ years of age.

I know they don't have the predators like Ontario, but that being said if you adding hundreds or thousands of tags (For Calf only) that someone can just go buy one, you adding a lot more hunter to kill the new generation coming up. Nfld has bull only, either sex and I think cow or calf, but you have to be successful in the draw to shoot anything.  Buying a tag is just a money grab and decimates new generations, the animal doesn't have time to populate the area.

For once try to have a realistic approach to hunting. Restrict numbers of cow tags since they are far more vital to population than bulls. Restrict the calf tags since it’s too hard to identify gender. Have more bull tags and let however many hunters party hunt for that same tag. Stop relying on unfilled tags for population control. Allow as many bull tags as the population will withstand which we would know if we actually had the research!!
Point system? What is this a game? Are the points starting from scratch or are they backlogged from god knows when. Does this mean the older hunters are getting tags next year and the younger guys will have to wait ANOTHER 20 years to get a tag? I stopped applying because it was useless!
Now that I’ve commented on the useless rules that will directly affect me, let’s focus on the real issue. We can make all kinds of rules and regulations but they are all MEANINGLESS until something is done about Native American hunting. I have Native friends that I love but this has given me a direct view of the atrocities we allow because of some stupid papers signed hundreds of years ago. The quantity of animals the Natives harvest is obscene. The means of hunting is unethical. The spoilage is criminal. I’m sorry but boating up to a swimming moose, throwing a towel over it’s head to blind it, allowing it to get up on shore and then blasting it away from a couple feet should be enough to make anybody sick. THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL HUNTING METHODS. There is nothing traditional about Native hunting anymore so why are we allowing traditional law? If the general population was made aware of the reality of native hunting I think things would finally change for the better. Too bad our politicians will not only never address this, but will continue to apologize and subsidize it.

As of yesterday, receiving a surplus Moose tag did not impact my pool status.
I had a list of my top 10 WMU choices ready prior to calling, based on the MNRF publicized Surplus tag list.
This top 10 started with #1 being most desirable to me and 10 being the least.
By the time my call was connected I was able to achieve #7 on my list.  (Cow in 18B).  This is a very undesirable WMU due to limited access.  I have never hunted this wmu before and am still not sure if I will hunt it this year (due to the limited access and hunter saturation).  I took the tag because it made no impact to my pool status and gave me the option of deciding after receipt if I would hunt due to receipt of it or not.  It would be unfair if the receipt of that tag was to impact my “points” tally when the new proposal is implemented.  (If implemented).  I agree that going forward the receipt of a surplus tag will effect your “points”.  BUT should not be reflected when looking at a hunters past as the decision to take the surplus tag was done without knowledge of the proposed points based system.  Please let me know your thoughts on this as there will be numerous hunters in a similar position.

Since that time, our camp has been very unsuccessful in obtaining an adult moose tag. This has always been a concern for our camp. We are ethical hunters and are concerned that one of us may mistake a cow for a calf especially if a calf and cow are not together to enhance calf recognition. Therefore, many of us including myself, have stopped hunting the moose season all together. In the area which I hunt, I see more moose every year. Moose sign and tree rubs are plentiful. It is not uncommon to be conducting a ""drive"" that results in flushing out adult moose. There is an increase in wolf population as well. So, it would seem as though our deer population is slowly diminishing due to the fact there is nothing for them to eat because moose have eaten all the low lying food which a deer cannot reach. in addition, the wolves are killing or frightening off the deer. In conclusion, I believe that the proposals seem reasonable and maybe even beneficial to our camp.

33036,/comment/33036,"I commend the province and Mr. Yakabusky on trying to find solution to improve Moose hunting opportunities and increase Moose populations in Ontario.
Unfortunately the new system proposed is overly complicated and will do little to improve Moose hunting opportunities for Ontario Residents.
In my opinion it's the tag allocation system that is the wrong approach. I've hunted Moose in Ontario for 40 years but had to hunt out of province in the last 4 years in order to be able to enjoy a true hunting experience. Hunting calves for myself and many others is not fun or an option and although stats say that a large majority of calves will not survive the first winter, I don't believe hunters that harvest a calf are helping the Moose population grow, so your efforts to limit calf hunting are commendable but they still fall short of the target.
The proposed changes will only increase the administration of the system and won't help the situation. Other provinces like Quebec have a very simple system and their Moose population even on the Qc/On border is quite healthy. I would hope that someone has looked at their system before trying to re-invent the wheel yet again. A simple amount of licences per animal harvested based on population for each WMU where cows hunting is closed every two years and bull are always open and a calf can only be harvested if the cow is harvested would provide equal opportunity for all hunters. Two, four, six licenses or more per animal depending on WMU with mandatory reporting and fees for registration of animal would provide the necessary information to manage the population while providing extra income to the ministry. Cow hunting in WMU where Moose populations are not high enough could be closed for extended periods of time to allow the ecosystem to fix itself. This has proven to be a very simple system that has worked in Quebec to maintain and increase the Moose population in most parts of the province. This would help to limit the mass exodus of Moose hunters leaving the province to experience better Moose hunting opportunities and possibly bring some back.

Why add a bow season to harvest/cripple animals when the herd is in steady decline in S. Ontario?
Why not instead close the season temporarily or allow hunting under the current system every other year or 1 in 3, etc. as the herd recovers.?
Why not prohibit the use of ATV's in active hunting in the S to reduce hunting success rates?
Why not provide an equivalent to the ""deer farmer's license"" to allow landowners (>100 ac) to solely hunt their own property in recognition of their contribution to providing habitat?
Why not include natives' rights in MNR's ""herd recovery strategy""?
The proposed system favors large hunting groups (of 10) w/o any consideration for landowners who provide habitat on private land and take interest in managing the local herd. Small groups/individual hunters under the new system will be able to obtain a tag in S. Ontario about once every 10-20 years, provided they buy a license every year to accumulate points w/o losing them, regardless of whether or not they own property and provide habitat.
It is all about MNR ""harvesting"" fees from lots of ""wannabe hunters"" with total disregard to the animals and no consideration for folks who keep paying into the system to maintain the possibility to be allocated a tag once every 10/20 yrs ( depending on age ~1-3 tags in an average hunter's lifetime) S of the French River.

33044,/comment/33044,"I do think this is a great step in making a better and more fair distribution and allocation of moose tags but I do have a few concerns with the new proposed rules.
First of all, how you determine the hunters initial point amount.
“A hunter would receive a point for each year they have applied and been unsuccessful in the draw going back to when they first started applying or the last time they received/accepted a tag (such as were successful in the draw, received a tag through a transfer or through the surplus tag allocation)”
I do not believe receiving a tag through the surplus should count against a persons point count because when you get a tag through the surplus it is nearly never your first or second choice it was just something you tried to get so you could be out in the bush that year. (Eg. a person in preferred pool applies first choice gun bull in a given WMU, second choice gun cow in a given WMU and is unsuccessful but then the person gets an archery cow tag in the surplus for that WMU.) I don’t think that should count against your initial point total as it was even one of your choices you applied for it was just something so you could be out hunting that year.
Next, the transferring the tag restrictions. I understand the concern of “ghost” hunters, but there are groups out there who hunt in groups  who merely transfer their tag to the person who is most available that season to give the group a better opportunity to hunt. Although the attempts are going to being made to get the information about tags out to the public sooner to give people more time to plan a lot of people pick their holidays for the following year in Nov/ Dec of the previous year so it’s still not a enough time. Therefore, I like the idea of people being able to transfer their tag to their most available group member.

33063,/comment/33063,"first off thanks for looking at the current moose tag allocation system as it is flawed.
1. No one person needs a full moose to themselves, so the proposal of not having groups and everyone being a single is not a good idea. that one person who draws the tag could decide to go alone.
2. There needs to be a restriction on calf hunting. there is way to many predators that already take a huge percentage of the calf's.
3. I feel after talking to a couple different wardens and ministry staff about how the tags have declined in 18A for bow hunting in the last 5 years. they say it is because bowhunters are more successful in harvesting and that we are taking to many moose?? well I don not agree.
2013-bow 118 bull----gun 149 bull
2015-bow 57 bull----gun 176 bull
2018-bow 35 bull----gun 140 bull
so if you are trying to get the population up why do you give more tags to the gun hunters or not decrease at the same rate? well because you want the money for tags!. but I have seen way more moose lost and wasted  with gun hunters then ever. 20 yards VS 200,300 yards is not ethical to me and it happens every year and it makes me sick to see that meat waste in the bush!
4. the point system just makes no sense what so ever. you think people are frustrated and confused now? to me it will be a disaster.It makes more sense to have no calf hunting at all up a few adult tags and you have to hunt in a min group size.
5. changing the distance from 5km to 3km is ridiculous! if the group is not capable of staying in contact and knowing the rules for moose down and you top priority is to find other hunters and stop the hunt. they should not be out hunting. it is hard enough to there is no way to measure the distance in a remote location.
I am sorry but these proposals really seem to make not much sense in the way of increasing the tag quota and increasing the population?? just seems like it is going to make things more complicated. possibly jumping from the frying pan into the fire?
And why do we never seem to open up the conversation on the elephantin the room??? our Native community??? I bow hunt 60km above a native reserve, every night the drive the roads at dark with lights hunting moose! why is this so hard to get a grip off we have called our ministry and they will do nothing!!!! why one road leads in that area and same road out why not stop them? ridiculous!!!!!

However the 10 hunters limit on one moose tag I disagree with. A large bull is almost too much meat for that many hunters in some cases.
Also the reducing the distance from the tag holder to 3km. Is going to jam up hunters who party hunt in large pieces of land in northern Ontario. I think 5km is reasonable but really I don’t see the need for it. As long as they’re in communication, and hunting in the same wmu it shouldn’t matter.
My biggest suggestion that I didn’t see in here would be dividing WMU 47 into a 47 A and B. Or A, B and C. The moose population is not evenly distributed in this WMU and it is such a massive land area that it’s not even like the moose would travel the entire WMU. For instance my property has too many moose. They’re destroying everything on our property. We counted 14 different moose in a week of deer hunting. While people closer to Parry Sound hardly know what they look like. I hunt near trout creek and there’s an inordinate amount of moose there.
Another suggestion would be to increase tags for landowners of a certain acreage. We own nearly a thousand acres and haven’t been able to even hunt the moose on our property and our now just watching mature bulls die.

I believe the extra point for someone living in northern Ontario is not fair.  Why should some one be giving special/extra treatment for where they live?

33072,/comment/33072,"The current system works fine for the most part. It recognizes WMU quotas  and gives hunters fair access to licenses based on such. Ghost hunters need to be addressed as indicated. The elimination of group applications is going the wrong direction, Such will eliminate many hunters from applying for adult animals. If hunters in a group are awarded tags individually such can jeopardize their ability for success in subsequent years--when more than one or two members are successful in a current year. A group of 4-5 hunters can enjoy a hunt with a single tag but if 2 members receive tags in the same year their probability of success in the subsequent year is almost non-existent. Result would be that hunters would drop out and revenues from licenses and tourism would decline.
Requiring calf tags to be combined with adult animal tags likewise will eliminate opportunities for many hunt groups in areas where there are lower quotas. Many groups today hunt on calf abilities  when unsuccessful for an adult tag. This proposal eliminates this opportunity for their annual hunt.
Suggestions:-- Reduce the seasons to a shorter time period. Reduce the quotas to yield desired herd levels where necessary.
The reduction to 3 km for party hunting might create dangerous conditions for larger hunting parties. 5 kms is the shortest reasonable distance considering that many groups have 6 to 8 hunters.
Outfitters tend to favour non-residents due to the lucrative fees they can charge. Issue ""resident tags"" and ""non-resident"" tags to outfitters to make opportunities for Ontario hunters to afford outfitting camps--especially since proposals will be reducing the reliability of getting an adult tag. The cost difference for a non-resident tag must be significantly higher-- or a resident discounted tag price-- in order for Ontario hunters to afford these hunts in the remoter areas.
Removal or making tag transfers more difficult is a good idea to eliminate ghost hunters. The mechanics of tag transfers for legitimate reasons-- employment crisis,health, emergencies, etc. need to be publicized so I can comment. I believe the impact of tag transfers in any event is minimal overall since the actual average issuance of adult tags is probably less than 20%.
Surplus tags should not be available until all original applications have been satisfied. I have seen members of successful groups receive surplus tags when other groups in the same WMU have been unsuccessful in the original draw. It is hard to understand how surplus tags are available when any ""unsuccessful"" Pool1 applicant exists  after the original draw. This should be a simple adjustment in the draw programming.
Do not change from the current group application system. It ain't broke--just needs a tune-up.

33078,/comment/33078,"Good Morning,
First off I give huge credit to the MNRF and the big game advisory committee for there efforts and understanding that there must be changes to the moose hunt in Ontario.
I had read and reviewed the moose recommendations and while I consider myself no expert I have been moose hunting with a gang of 10-15 guys up north in zone 26 for 12 years and most recently changed to zone 48/55B for the last 5 years.  While up north we watched the moose population slowly decline while southern zones flourished.  We have a very good understanding of the current group application process and believe that if people played by the rules and applied as a ""group"" there wouldn't be a huge cry for change as there is now.
My suggestions-
1- going to a individual points system credits the people that have been applying alone, all the while still hunting as a group.  This gives no credit and actually penalizes the gangs/groups that have been applying as a group, only wanting there 1 adult tag, not being greedy looking for 2-3 tags etc since the group system started.
Solution - keep the group applicants but divvy the tags by giving the larger groups a better odd, example - give 50% of the adults tags to groups of 10+, 25% to groups of 5+, 25% to groups of 1-5 including the individual applicants.  This will encourage people to apply with there group.
2- I like the idea of spreading out the applicants and the southern zones with moose.  There has to be a typo not including zone 58 where there is a calf season but no adult tags?  I personally know gangs that if are unsuccessful for the normal adult zone (48) will simple hunt calves and are usually successful in WMU 58.  WHY IS THERE NO ADULT TAGS FOR 58!  Offering adult tags for the southern zones will 100% pull applicants from other zone thus spreading out the moose hunters and better yet spread out the applicants.
3- bow and muzzle loading seasons in the southern zones.  Cut the general rifle season to 5 days.  Offer a 5 day bow and 5 day late muzzleloader hunt when deer muzzleloader season is on (first week of Dec)  this will take some pressure again off the general rifle season and take some pressure off the deer during this late season hunt.
4- eliminate calf hunting all together, why are we killing next years adults when they have such a low survival rate already due to predation.
5- I was very disappointed to see that the antis got a foot in on the wolf and bear topic.  Wolves in northern zone need to be kept in check and are becoming a real problem in some southern zones as well.  Living in zone 59 we kill 5-10 coyotes a year simply by chance, they are way over populated and need to be kept in check.  The spring bear hunt is a huge success and Iam sure will continue.
Again suggestions but Iam sure the right decision will be made.
Thanks again!

they could have set up max sizes for groups which would lower fill rate and allow more tags to be distributed, large groups are more successful which reduces tag allocations across the province. As well they do not say how much of a percentage of total allocation for new bow season will be given to each unit. It needs to be 15-20% minimum if we want to spread people out. Very little will do nothing especially if a point system is used and again there will only be a few people eligible defeating the purpose.
Group applications make more sense and having 75% of tags going to groups starting with largest and going down the groups until tags are gone would distribute better. Smaller groups left over could go into the draw with the the remainder 25% which would be set up for individuals which would still give them a chance for a tag in the unit of preference.

33082,/comment/33082,"I strongly disagree  with changing the party hunting tag holders distance from 5km to 3km.
This would affect hunters who hunt in remote locations with no roads or clear cuts.
This type of hunting requires hunters to be on different water bodies/creek systems or swamp and sometimes must be further than 3km from the tag holder.

There is no mention of the indigenous impact on harvest , the over killing of animals during both spring and winter yard hunting . Twice as a group we have been offered moose for sale by indigenous hunters.  Are the Chiefs going to be involved and  control some of the abuses?
Are lodges going to have controls on tags at outrages prices for resale or is this going to be altered and monitored?

33094,/comment/33094,"Hi
It is interesting that the way I found out about these changes is through someone who is on Facebook.
Even then I had to perform a major search on the Ontario government website to find these proposed changes.
There is no link online on the MNRF website nor the hunting regulations summary.
Why is this located on the environmental registry website? Hunting would normally not look at this site for moose info.
If the MNRF are sincere about public input, they should have links on the MNRF website or the regulations.
Social media should not be the primary source public notification.
I was on the MNRF website several times in May 2019 and there was no information about public input to moose management.
I did find 'moose harvest management guidelines' updated July 2019. It had no reference to the environmental registry. The link is below
Having said this, the proposed changes should be delayed until proper public notification is given.
I believe that the government will spend a lot of money changing the tag allocation system with little result.
Moose quotas should be based on 100% fill rate. Lowering quotas based on this will impact moose populations. We can then make tag transfers within a group more flexible up to season opening. It will encourage more group applicants. Group leader could be the one getting the tag and everyone else in the group is dropped from the draw.
As far as 'ghost hunters', people apply but do not hunt for several reasons: 1) Aug 1 is too late to submit holidays at their place of employment if they receive a tag 2) they keep applying because some year they may hunt with that group.
This proposed new tag allocation system creates more uncertainty for the traditional groups.
Restricting the calf harvest in some way will ensure more calves become adults.
There is no mention of outfitter tags and the impact on the moose harvest.
How are tags allocated to outfitters? How does the outfitter 'share system' work?
This outfitter system gives an unfair advantage to hunters will to pay the high price for a tag. It also gives an advantage to non-residents with money.
If these outfitter tags are eliminated and/or given to residents only, the revenue brought to the economy will be neutral.
Thank you

If this is how it is working out you are taking away the main reason a lot of us hunt. It is the family coming together to join in an age old tradition of hunt for a moose.  A single individual should not shoot an animal the size of a full grown cow or bull.  One person cannot take care of retrevale of this size of animal alone. It is not safe or ethical.   Hunting alone is not as safe as party hunting.   Each hunter in a group has a radio and can reach help when and if needed fast.   This system will support the indivdual hunting striking off into the woods alone.  Not always the best idea hunting for big game.   The point system I can understand.   But why not have a point system for camps.  One tag for the gang or camp all hunting for one moose.

At the same time I 100% do not support moose calf hunting of any kind. I would like to see all calf hunting eliminated. There's no way we can grow the population while killing calves.
I would also suggest rules similar to the spring beat hunt, where a cow could not be harvested if she has a calf(s) with her.
Finally, something needs to be done about aboriginal harvesting. At the very least there should be reporting of tjeir harvest. In my opinion the same rules should apply to all hunters, no matter their heritage.

33101,/comment/33101,"Hello,
I am an avid moose and deer hunter and I strongly agree with the majority of the suggestions.
However, I strongly disagree with the reduction in distance for group hunters from 5km to 3km. If the group size for party hunting is to be capped at 10 hunters it would create issues related to hunter safety with the potential to have 10 individuals hunting in close proximity using  high powered rifles. Many areas in logging roads that are hunted are small and separated down separate roads. Very few logged areas could accommodate more than 5 hunters safely which would result in additional hunters moving to the next logged area on a given road. While I appreciate some individuals struggle to communicate over this distance, many others do not. Use of quality two way radios or other methods ( ie: signal shots, text/phone in limited areas) are very effective for those who choose to hunt responsibility. The reduction in distance may well lead to further challenges with hunting in an individuals preferred area. Forcing many hunters into a smaller area may well lead to accident or injury.

For example I belong to a camp that has Been going for sixty years. My grandfather was one of the founders. There are ten of us in the camp and with this new tag system if one of us does not draw a tag that means the whole camp can’t go hunting. That is exactly the case this year. Yet we are still able to go because of our calf tag/ moose licence. If not for this the area we have hunted for so many years would be left open for someone else to come in to. I know most is crown land but, when your family has hunted it for sixty year you feel astablished there. Not to mention we have had trouble with unethical hunters that do not belong to camps crowding us at unsafe distances. I feel that not being afforded the opportunity to continue to be able to hunt each year there is a season could cause problems. I personally would be more for going back to a moose hunt every other year. This would allow the moose to have a year off to repopulate and continue to allow everyone to go hunting when there is a moose season.

33107,/comment/33107,"For many years now I have had great disappointment in not receiving adult moose tags.I think I have only had 2 in the last 14 years.I looked very forward to the day I could go moose hunting with my son and family members.A few years ago I was more disappointed when the ministry decided to shorten the calf season to just 2 weeks.That allows me Saturday and part of Sunday to go moose hunting with my son over 2 weekends.Approximately 4 days to hunt with a great cost for the price of the tag gas and supplies.I understand things need to be done to bring back the moose population but there are other options.Years ago where I live to the east of Thunderbay there was lots of moose.I never had to venture far to get one.Once the spring bear hunt was closed it was very noticeable there were no calves.Then due to extremely mild winters the deer population exploded.When that happened the wolf population rose greatly.There are a very high number of bears in my area and lots of wolves.I think reducing the number of bears and wolves would help a lot.growing up here in the Dorion Pearl area only every once in awhile you would see a wolf now they are in my yard in the winter and I see them all the time and hear them howling.Also the Greenwich road area was a great spot for moose and they were plenty.Once the windmills were put up the moose moved out.I also think that first nation groups would help to regulate what there communities take I have spoke to many people from local reserves and they would participate in helping to have the population rebound by only allowing so many moose to be taken by first nations members.I love moose hunting I grew up in a land of many and can only hope the proper decisions are made to allow me to take my son hunting with me.I would like to see other options explored to allow more opportunity for myself and others to enjoy this great outdoor experience with there sons and daughters.One more thing i would like to mention is the use of ATV.I think there should be stricter laws on how they are used.Maybe something like only allowed to travel to and from hunting area with guns cased and trigger locked.Since ATV have come around moose hunters got lazy and moose don't stand a chance for how fast a person can cover ground on one.Make fines stiffer if caught hunting off one when gun is not in a case and trigger locked.Party hunting should be reduced to 2 km.Allow a person to purchase 2 buck tags in areas that were once prime moose habitat.I have been finding deer sign and actually seeing them in remote areas on the islands of Lake Nipigon.Just recently I seen deer on an islands on the outside of Black Bay peninsula and to me this is not a good thing.I also hope the new tag system if implemented is going to help Northern residents in the Thunder bay area get adult moose tags more often I am not the only one who has gone many years without receiving tags.My son is getting older and time is passing by quickly so I hope the changes will be good in helping me do what we love to do.

33110,/comment/33110,"The points system I don’t think will be a fair way for hunters to draw a tag. You could go 10 or more years between drawing a tag again.
If guys apply as individuals and hunt alone one moose is a lot of food for that said person.
Have a separate draw for left over tags after all groups that have applied for individual tags after all groups receive a tag or set 5% aside like the northern residence draw for individual applications in each unit.
We hunt in 18 a bow season and back in 2013 there was roughly 140 adult tags available. This year there is 61 adult tags available. What reason would you take bow tags away from bow hunters and give them too gun hunters who’s success rate is that much higher. If anything bow hunters should have more tags available as it’s much harder to harvest a moose with a bow.
There is no calf tags for bow hunting period if there is none for us there should none for gun hunters either.
Why not do a calf hunt every 3 years where you apply for a tag in each unit so this helps get the population up and success rates up while building the herd.
Natives drive the roads all night long every year we are on our hunt. We have yet to have a year where we don’t hear a rifle discharged in the middle of the night. This has to stop. It wouldn’t matter if they had to do a mandatory report it would be false anyway. More COs on patrol will help cut this down and put them in jail for poaching at night.
There are more and more people get into bow hunting and your taking tags and giving to the gun hunters. Why ??
No calf hunt will allow for more adult tags in the future if it’s cancelled for 3-5 years and then re introduce after you see the numbers increase.
If for example there are 10000 tags available 5000 for bow and 5000 for gun. Do a draw so all groups get tags. If there are any left after the draw have a second draw instead of a surplus call in for any tags in those areas individual applications can then draw a tag.
All bow hunt groups with 4 plus should be able to draw a tag. Like I said earlier it’s not easy to get a moose into under 40 yards and harvest.
Gun hunters are dropping moose at 300 no problem big difference in getting that animal.

  I hear many groups over the last year's getting multiple cow tags.  Our group had 3 cow tags for 5 hunters last year.  If we make all groups apply as a group and limit the number of tags a group can hunt with would spread out the allocated tags.  Example.  A group of 5 can't pocess more then 1 tag.

33115,/comment/33115,"In addition to allocating for a bow only season could there be a late season muzzleloader hunt? This would create more opportunity for hunters and an economic boost to outdoors stores that carry muzzle loading equipment.
The preference point system seems to solve some issues with the previous group draw system, but as a reference model I believe that the MNR should look at the problems a preference point system has already created in the American west.  I believe that the draw should be a random individual draw, this will prevent point creep and keep everyone on a level playing field while maintaining hunter interest and recruitment. Maintain the separate applications for bulls, cow/calf and calf tags.
In closing I would like to reiterate that I would like to see the MNR move to a 3-season moose hunt (early archery, rifle, and late season muzzleloader) and remove the preference point system in lieu of a random individual draw. Successful individuals should be able to allow whom ever to accompany them on the hunt to aid in packing out an animal.

33116,/comment/33116,"The proposal (point system), and very restricted tag transfers, certainly seems like it will be a fairer approach in tag allocation.
I'm not clear what the difference is for those units with a restricted calf allocation (like WMU 37) vs all other units where calf tags are allocated through identified applications in the draw?   I would suggest calves are managed like bull and cow tags in all units - where a sustainable number of calf tags are allowed for each WMU individually and hunters apply for those in the draw if they choose.   That way there would be no different treatment amongst the units.   Each unit calf tag numbers are determined through the science now down by MNRF.  In such a case, for example WMU 37 would have very few calf tags and other WMU's may also have few or many calf tags depending on what the science/surveys show it can support.
The cow/calf tag combination is good in that it will result in fewer errors (ie a large calf being shot mistakenly for cow).   However - you will need to estimate the number of calves shot with these tags to ensure the calf tag allocation is appropriate (if you decide to restrict calf tags by WMU as suggested above).
It is important to increase the survival rate of calves to rebuild and sustain a reasonable moose population - to do that I believe calf tag numbers need be limited in all WMU's (as noted above)
With regards to predator control, particularly wolves in the case of moose, I don't know why you would limit the harvest to just 2 wolves (except to limit the outcry from animal right groups).  Wolves are rarely seen by moose hunters, but their ""sign"" is certainly obviously and increasing everywhere I have hunted.   I don't believe there are many hunters that hunt wolves specifically.  As such I would suggest if you limit the wolf harvest number - I would increase that to at least 5, as there are few serious wolf hunters

33117,/comment/33117,"I'm generally supportive of the recommendations outlined here except when it comes to 8b - Group Applications and proposed elimination of them.
I feel this recommendation fails to take into consideration the online survey preferences indicated by hunters (70%) or the statistical relevance of group applications and how such applications actually result in a better and fairer distribution of tags among all hunters.
•	The current list of hunters who’ve gone the longest without at tag are those who have failed to understand the current draw system and how it was designed to encourage group applications which statistically have a much higher probability of drawing a tag (Step 1 & Step 2) and result in a better distribution of tags among all. The current proposal will mainly benefit those who were ignorant of how to properly apply in the first place and likely significantly reduce opportunities for hunters who hunt and apply as long-established groups.
•	A stand in line point system sounds great, but there is a high probability of longer periods between tags on average between hunters.  For the first couple of years especially, there are likely to be large numbers of applicants with the same number of points, requiring a random draw. A draw that likely will have insufficient tags to address all the ties. Hi potential for increasing wait times between tags for hunters.
•	Eliminating Individual applications and implementing group only applications will decrease wait times between tags and distribute tags more fairly among all hunters, among all MWUs and hunt types.
•	The proposed recommendation of treating all individuals equally, the draw will likely diminish the distribution of tags among the greatest number of hunters. This is unfair to those who understood the current draw system and hunt/applied accordingly to maximize chances of receiving a tag.
•	The current proposal will also do nothing to prevent multiple tags being issued to individual hunters who link up to party hunt. My experience has been that even with the proposed ability to not accept a tag, most groups will likely accept multiple tags, thereby further reducing the distribution of tags among hunting parties.
•	Receiving a tag as an individual should be irrelevant, as the vast majority of moose hunters hunt in groups even if they choose to apply as an individual. The current system allocates the tag to the person who has gone the longest without.  If the proposal only allowed group applications, these hunters who have gone without a tag would be the first to get a tag if their group is successful, while ensuring only 1 tag per moose hunting group.
•	Getting a tag in the current system is predictable if applying in a group. Tag gets allocated to hunter who has gone the longest without a tag. Same would occur if system only accepted group applications.
•	In the proposal of treating all applicants as individuals, the draw pool only shrinks by one (1) each time a tag is allocated. Comparatively, if only group applications were allowed, the draw pool would shrink by the entire group size each time a tag is allocated, thereby statistically increasing the odds of remaining groups in the draw pool as the draw is run.
•	I have annual copies of each Moose Draw Statistical Report for each WMU and it clearly illustrates that group applications have better probability for drawing a single tag, resulting in a better and fair distribution of tags among all than that of individual applicants, who for the most part hunt in groups anyway.
•	Alternatively, allocating a certain percentage of tags for specific group sizes (groups 2-5, 6-10, 11-15) would also provide a fair distribution among hunters and allow them the ability to choose their preferred group size.
•	Another Alternative option would be only allow party hunting for hunters that apply as a group (same as elk group hunting regs). No more lenient Party Hunting rules that allows hunters to hunt with multiple groups, which increase fill and harvest rates.
•	Another Alternative would be to only allow individual applicants to apply for calf tags (if the unit can support such harvest) and not adult tags.  Individuals who prefer to hunt alone are generally targeting calves. Adults tags allocated to groups share the resource around more people.
Recommendation 4 – Early bow specific seasons
•	I fully support the recommendation for creating bow seasons similar to WMUs 48, 55A&B and 57.
o	Increasing archery opportunities with specific tag quotas for each hunt type will spread out applicant pressure and help increase distribution of tags among hunters. Current units around Algonquin Park are the most heavily subscribed WMU’s in the province, partly due to increased costs to travel to NE & NW and reduced tags.

Their are times the tag holder will be unable to attend a hunt whether it's work,family,health or any other issue related and its unfair for the other hunters in the group to do without the tag since they applied as a group.
The current tag transfer rules should remain as is.
We should not institute the new narrative of  ""reduce tag fill rates"" impeding hunters abilities to be successful; we should be promoting and celebrating hunter success.

33153,/comment/33153,"Most of these ‘initiatives’ related to moose hunting seem to ignore the existing population ‘dynamics’ of moose.
How many moose are out on Ontario’s landscape?  If the government is going to sell hunting tags, then it is essential to ensure the populations are very healthy.
At the moment, there is a large and growing human presence on the landscape in Ontario, currently estimated to be approximately 14.5-million people.
Hunting tags will be issued by Wildlife Management Units (WMU), recognizing “habitat suitability could not support a population objective that aimed to increase the population. Some large areas in Ontario do not have productive moose habitat.”, according to the provincial MOOSE POPULATION OBJECTIVE GUIDELINES (MPOGs)
.
MPOGs recognize that it is essential to map “the role of moose in ecosystem sustainability. It is important to consider how many moose are necessary to maintain their natural function in the ecosystem across a broader landscape. This is particularly critical for harmonizing the management of moose with other cervids and associated predators.”
AND
“Human use of moose: In some WMUs, the original population target was not achievable over the long term because of high socio-economic demands relative to landscape productivity. In other WMUs, the target could have been higher to support the quality of moose related activities. A sustainable mix of socio-economic benefits should be considered across the broader landscape.”   Socio-economic, as in money for hunting tags, hunting gear (add HST!), outfitters and guides, cabin rentals ... maybe alcohol sales. Well, what has that GOT TO DO with moose, their long-term survival, and their ecosystem?
Keeping these MPOG guidelines in mind, let’s review the previous ‘management plans’ put in place re: moose hunting for 2016.
There was an uproar about the shortened moose hunting season described in the Toronto Sun on February 10, 2015 because the CALF MOOSE HUNTING SEASON was reduced to TWO weeks from THIRTEEN weeks!  If there is ‘hunting glory’ in killing a calf, there is also near certainty that government-sanctioned hunting is working to eliminate the moose population.  Otherwise, the 2016 hunting season was reduced to twelve (from thirteen) weeks for bulls and cows (a number of whom likely had young to care for, if those calves escaped calf-hunting season).  This seemed like a sure-fire recipe for wiping out the moose population, and this sad ‘prescription’ is now being re-written to allow hunting of CALVES for thirteen weeks. AGAIN.
Back in 2015, the Toronto Sun reported: “Mark Ryckman, senior wildlife biologist for the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) said proposed changes would impact northern Ontario hunters as well as the thousands of residents from the GTA and southern Ontario who head north to hunt moose. The moose hunt is probably the province’s premier hunt.”
Mr. Ryckman failed to note the impact on the hunted animals themselves. While moose exist in a limited northern area and depend upon that same limited area for their entire NATURAL food supply (no grocery stores for moose), THOUSANDS of hunters from all over Ontario (many living comfortably in huge houses in the Greater Golden Horseshoe) converge on the moose’s limited home range with their weapons, intent on killing moose.  Obviously, the moose hunt is completely unsustainable due to human behaviour. Also unsustainable due to government, specifically MNRF, behaviour.
In mid-October 2015, the CBC reported the nature of the moose-hunting predicament. Specifically, Mark Ryckman was quoted again, saying “There are about 80.000 to 100.000 moose in the province, but there are more than 100,000 hunters.  He also said, “Obviously, wolves and coyotes are not the culprits” ... when it comes to a declining moose population because humans outnumber, therefore over-hunt, moose.
I also note that moose (or deer) hunting occurs during their vulnerable breeding season when these creatures are focused on finding mates, and breeding instead of eating. If one really wants to test one’s skill, wit, and “trigger finger’, wouldn’t a hunter seek out an equally cunning ‘quarry’ who is similarly skilled and armed? Where is the skill in blasting away the life of an adult moose who is involved in breeding season and preparing for the onslaught of winter accompanied by scarcer, unpredictable food sources?  What if a hunter shoots a moose cow who is caring for young born in the springtime?
If Ontario is intent on making revenue from moose tags, then it better set aside more areas where moose can survive.  Ontario could even consider a moose immigration program and advertise this opportunity in Newfoundland which claims to have too many moose. Then, critical natural habitat areas would need to increase in size to support a growing moose population -- and such areas would have to be declared off-limits to encroachment by expanding human developments, such as subdivisions and resorts
.
Moose Management … really?  The ONLY population that needs to be MANAGED is the human population because the impact of growing human activities affects all other forms of non-voting apolitical natural life that neither wears money belts, nor lobbies government regarding its particular preferences.
How many moose are there?  How many hunters can be 'served' by a dwindling moose population beset by loss of habitat?

33156,/comment/33156,"Long overdue and a geat approach. Many U.S. states use the points system and it has been working well for them. Using points at least rewards hunters that r dedicated enough to apply regularly each season. If u r serious about moose hunting u will keep applying and be rewarded with a tag after accumulating so many points. Not sure about the licence fees varying in price tho. Its good that u only need to pay for an applicatiin fee to apply rather than a full blown fee for a license but Im concerned that the excitement over being successful in getting a tag will allow ridiculously high tag prices (especially for bulls) to be charged. Hunting should be something all can afford not only the rich. Ive never been a proponent of calf hunting and not sure why that continues to be left as an available option.  In thd U.S u cant target calf elk. Why would we target our calf moose?
Good work tho to all that sat on the committee!

33159,/comment/33159,"to grow the population you need to reduce the number of calves and cows taken, so every 4 - 5 years the number of tags handed out should be reduced for that year by half so it gives the population a better chance to grow in numbers. take some of the gun tags and put towards bow tags as it is harder to take a moose with a bow than with a gun again helping population to increase and it splits up the number of hunters and problems that happen over the season.

33163,/comment/33163,"I think that the changes proposed are prudent and reasonable, however I do take exception to the elimination of the Northern resident tag allocation process.
The policy of adding a single, non-accumulating extra point for Northern residents is better than nothing - I do acknowledge that.
My concern is that with the drastic population differences between Northern and Southern Ontario, having 1 extra point may not be enough to ""level the playing field"" so to speak, and the majority of tags will wind up being allocated to Southern Ontario residents. The elimination of the tag transfer loopholes will to some extent mitigate this, however I do not have access to the detailed statistics to say if this will do ""enough"".
Perhaps an equitable way would be to, instead of adding a single non-accumulating point for Northern Residents, to maintain a 2nd (separate) points bank for people who live in Northern WMU's and use that to allocate the same 5% of remaining tags as currently exists after the 95% of tags have been allocated. In my opinion this would allow for the best aspects of both the new and the old system.
For a lot of people in the North moose hunting is a lot more than just a 1 week vacation.

33173,/comment/33173,"I have some ideas that I believe can help with the struggling moose population:
1. You can use your Bull or Cow tag on a calf. Identifying a calf at 300 yards at dusk or dawn through grass or shrub is going to lead to accidental killings. In fear of the law, hunters may walk away from the accidental kill and still use their tag on an adult animal at a later date.
2. Until the population increases, there is no calf tags or calf season. Only accidental kills for which the hunter must use their Cow tag.
3. Fewer cow tags given out and more Bulls. A bull can impregnate several cows which will allow the continuation of a moose population.  I see in many draws there are more cow tags allotted then bulls.
4. Dig up old bush roads so hunters can’t hunt from their vehicles or drive right into heavily populated moose areas. There are people that hunt from their vehicle and by headlight. This is a sad truth. If it’s not or can’t be enforced, then make it more difficult to do.
5. Make it illegal for ALL people to hunt out of season. Killing a cow that’s pregnant isn’t going to help the moose population.  Also, no one should be allowed to enter moose sanctuaries to hunt.
6. Something has to be done about the wolves. Wolves kill moose and the wolf population is exploding.
7. Make it illegal for all people to sell moose meat. This is becoming a more common practice that people sell moose meat for ceremonies and PowWows. Allowing people to profit on killing moose will only lead to more kills so the hunter can make a profit. I know this is a touchy subject, and sometimes the meat is donated or gifted. From my experience, most of the time the hunter is given an “honorarium”.
8. Aerial spraying - not sure what effects it has on the population, but from my experience, the moose move on and leave the area.
9. Drones should be illegal - period! Anyone caught in the bush with a drone, their group will automatically forfeit their tags and be fined.
10. The illegal practice of killing moose for their tongues (or any body parts) for “medicinal purposes” - make ridiculous fines and/or jail time for anyone caught doing this or anyone caught in possession or transporting moose tongue. This must be stopped but sadly it is happening more and more in the North as the demand grows on the market.
11.  Steeper fines for illegal moose hunting.
12. Lastly, rather than limiting the length of the hunting season, I would push it further back. It is more difficult to find moose outside or the rut and when the waterways are frozen. However a good hunter will still find them. Reducing the season will impact tourism and jobs.
I’m not saying to implement all these ideas, but they are my thoughts/ideas to help preserve and increase the moose population until it is healthy once more.

I’m hoping though that the mnrf will find a better system for the actual tags that are placed on harvests. This current scheme of printed licenses and not having to affix anything to the actual animal is utterly ridiculous and ripe for abuse. Let’s go back to stick on tags or plastic tags that are punched out immediately and stay on animal until processing. Mandatory reporting should be within a short period of time(48hrs-7days etc) or better yet do as they do south of the border. Animals must be checked into game reporting stations which are normally gas stations or ticket issuers. Data can than be gained from the animal such as teeth/age/etc for scientific purposes.
Another big issue regarding moose populations is access on new logging roads. Dig these new roads up once logging operations cease and post them as no motorized vehicles. I’m a member of ofah and cringe when they are fighting for access to these areas where roads were never intended to be there except for logging industry.  Again great job mnrf and keep up the good work, we are headed in a great direction!

33185,/comment/33185,"In review of the change anyone that established hunt groups that was the recommended in the regulations for as long as I have moose hunted (since 2000 ish) are now being put at a disadvantage and I am trying to understand why.
The way I see it -- party hunt groups sizes reduced from 15 to 10 , area of hunt reduced from 5KM to 3KM and going to a point allocation is all putting anyone who hunted in a group at a disadvantage.  We have established a group for over 15 years and in most years we were successful (and happy to have a moose tag to share between the 15 ish of us)   thus none of our group members  would have a  >15+ year period of not having a tag.  Compare that to guys that have put in single and really should not have had a good chance at tags given our group of 15 pool 1 guys have been unsuccessful 3 out the last 4 years in WMU 28.  Given the purposed changes I understand why we as an organized group have been screwed as someone decided to treat groups differently over the last couple years.     I am still trying to understand the methodology of that.   It seems someone has decided groups are now bad and a couple guys getting tags is better than getting larger groups involved in the hunt and investing money in the communities they are hunting in.
Our group are a mix of family and long time friends who own property and have an established hunt camp.  We pooled our resources and invested in the area we hunt which when I read the regulations is what was suggested and why group hunting was established but again it does feel like these changes would put us doing what the regulations suggested at a disadvantage for getting a tag in the future.
I am not sure why a cow tag would not come with a calf tag.  Make the calf tag valid for 3 hours within the cow being shot to avoid being used outside of cow and calf kill.    Given the purposed allocation if I am understanding correctly to take a cow calf would require two hunters to give up points.   We all know the calf will die if the cow is taken so I question this and feel there is a better way to accomplish.
Why have we not done anything with getting draw results out earlier than Aug 1?

If this is not the case it puts the hunters who have applied in the 4 WMU's at a disadvantage to hunters that choose now to apply in the 4 WMU's. The statement "" hunters have got better at hunting calves"" is based on what evidence? If it based on fill rates there are many reason's for that, more calves on the landscape less adult tags being given out. The large groups are also a big contributing factor to fill rates of all tags I'm happy to see that as being addressed. If you compare the Calf to Cow ratio of of the 4 WMU's with a calf lottery and adjacent WMU's 60,61 for example I don't think you find much difference. So to say the calf lottery worked is misleading. The other concern I have is there is no data on what the carrying capacity is of a WMU. So just because harvest is restricted doesn't mean we can grow a heard to infinity. I think the 4 WMU's with a calf lottery could and should be looked at to see if the herd has plateaued because it will. It needs to be determined as to why.

The number of moose harvested by First Nations has to be reported just like those hunting who applied for a tag/purchased a licence. How can we make any sound decisions for moose management if there is a whole dataset not being accounted for.  How can we say that 39 adult tags should be allocated for example WMU 13 if First Nations are harvesting a hundred. Maybe no tags should be allocated in 13.

I hunt in 13. Guaranteed group size use to be low with most groups of two or more getting tags. That was 5 years ago. Now we are down to 39 tags from 1100 . No guaranteed group size.  To me that seems like there is a crisis in that unit.

The reason there are less tags available is directly proportionate to the number of moose estimated in surveys.

I suggest to close the moose season instead where required and only reopen it when the herd has recovered and maybe then only have  a moose season every other year or so depending on what hunting pressure the WMU can sustain.
I also suggest not to issue a single cow tag in WMUs with low or declining population!
I will not buy a license to enter a draw for a tag only with nothing to hunt - this proposed point system will not work for small groups/camps.

33265,/comment/33265,"1.) A hunter would receive a point for each year they have applied and been unsuccessful in the draw going back to when they first started applying or the last time they received/accepted a tag (such as were successful in the draw, received a tag through a transfer or through the surplus tag allocation)
Comment: I believe that this proposed point system would not really benefit all hunters and still would not be a fair process. It may accomodate some of the hunters that have not received an adult validation tag for decades like myself but it is really unknown how long it will take to address this issue via a point system. I forsee that the time between receiving val tags could be very long. Would it be possible to start from scratch and zero all applicants irregardless of the number of years in the draw? This would occur just at the start of the new process and could allow for points to accumulate (for pool one hunters) so that they are not left out for decades again. I think we need to stick with the random draw system for the early years to keep the system fair and depending on population/harvest estimates (now with mandatory reporting) the Ministry can  allocate val tags (bull/antlerless only) to groups that meet the number of points that the Ministry deems appropriate based on the biological factors/science for each WMU. The Minsitry would have the ability to modify how many points it takes to be successful in the draw based on the science.  Groups only applications should be madatory and group sizes should also be set by the Ministry. Individual applicant opportunities should be elliminated completely. If a group is successful in drawing an tag than the group memeber are done hunting moose for any reamining season (s) and the group goes back to zero points and start fresh from zero the following year. Groups can collect points over time and allocation of tags/number of points is based on population estimates for the specific WMU. This would also completely elliminate the ""ghost hunter's"" from the draw system.
Hunting/harvest opportunity should be taking a back seat to species management at this point in Ontario. I think the remaining moose hunters have gone long enough without appropriate action and are willing to do what it takes to manage the species with hopes of seeing a population increase to a sustainable level that can support a fair allocation process.
Revenue collection and hunting opportunity always appear to trump species management and our current moose population status provincially reflects this. I know there are other issues but I think its time for the Ministry to make change for the moose population of Ontario.
I am all for the complete removal of calf only allocation/season.  Any calf harvest would only occur with the allocation of an antlerless val tag allowing the harvest of a cow or calf (possibly a shed bull). Protecting the recruitment will certainly allow for population growth given the current pressures on calves (hunter harvest/predation/environmental etc...). this should open up the potantial for extra adult allocation opportunites in all management units given the science allows for it.
Archery hunting practices historically does not take as many moose as rifle hunting mainly because the rifle hunting fraternity is substantially larger and the rifle seasons are frankly way to long especially in the NW of Ontario. Time to reduce season lengths across the province for all weapon types, allocate a number of bull/antlerless tags specifically for archery only seasons within all WMU's that have a moose season thereby providing some potential additional hunting opportunity to accomodate shortened seasons and the removal of calf seasons.
I do believe that the current recommendations put forward by the BGAC is verymuch based on public input and does somewhat address the management of the species. Its time for the governement to make sound management descisions.

Marie and the fall moose hunt has always been the highlight of mine and my hunting buddies year. The proposed point system would shut us out of our hunt on some years. Most of us have made significant financial investments in time and equipment. Also, we hadn’t heard of the information meetings nor the BGMAC group that has been proposing these changes. Who is this group, how do they get assigned, what qualifications do they have and are any from Northern Ontario? It appears from the changes that have been made over the years that policy makers are slowly trying to eliminate moose hunting in Ontario. With the cutbacks to the MNR’s annual budgets even their data is erroneous. Moose counts are sketchy with bad weather or lack of snow on the ground. This is a sad state and appears to only be getting worse.

33299,/comment/33299,"We have been hunting in Northern Ontario WMU 41 for the past 10 years and have seen an abundance of moose - cow, calf and bulls. We do believe that the calf hunting should be cut back so that they can grow to become adults but believe that the adult moose tags should be increased.
What we have seen and heard often in this area unfortunately is the abuse of taking out moose during night hunts - (all genders)  by the indigenous people. ( I mean no disrespect here as I have indigenous family members myself) We have no problem with them getting the tags they are allotted  (as is their right) but at night time when other hunters are in their camps relaxing or sleeping,  shots are going off at all hours of night, four wheelers and trucks with big lights  racing around to the hours of the early morning. Then we see moose taken out when we are going in for our hunts at sunrise. A number of the camps in the area have witnessed this and reported it also.
The ministry has been called in many times to this area, people have had shots fired over their trucks for attempting to stop the moose harrassment at night and trying to keep fellow hunt camps in the area safe.
The ministry should be addressing this problem more seriously - before their is an unintentional fatality(or fatalities) by moose being close to camps and being shot at in direction of camps. Someone is going to get seriously hurt someday.
Is one moose really worth letting the indigenous people hunt at night as is their right(as many of us out here in this area have been told)
This practice should be stopped and also would help in the management of moose being taken out or left behind because people can't find them in the dark.
This is another predator of the moose population.
We have hunted in other WMU's before this and never seen such behaviour as we have witnessed here.
Thank you for letting us comment.

How is these recommended changes making it fairer for Northern residents other than giving out 1 extra point which does not carry over year to year.  This needs to be changed so that the extra point does carry over each year and accumulates.  The amount of hunters that live in northern WMU's is a mirco fraction to the hunters in the south which will end up getting all the tags each year in these Northern WMU's.  There is also talk in the report that is vary vague on shortening season, closing seasons in the middle or even splitting moose season.  This will effect local hunters in these Northern WMU's (which are the longest seasons) these local like to wait until the hunting traffic is all gone (usually at the end of the season).  If the goal is to do this they SHOULD make a local resident only season to make it fairer (resident address should match surrounding WMU to be eligible).

33310,/comment/33310,"I represent a group of 9 hunters that hunt and maintain a camp in WMU29.  Our camp has been hunting moose since 1965 and we have a range of ages in our hunting group from 17 to 74.  An annual hunt is an important part of our heritage and our social fabric - it brings extended family together once a year.
We have made every effort to build an inclusive group in order to increase our odds in the current draw allocation system, where we have had fair success in the draw when tag numbers reflected a moose population that was within the MNR's stated population objectives.  We see the current system as a fair system, where the rules were available and communicated to hunters, and that all applicants had a chance to draw a tag on an annual basis.  We recognize that there were certain policy objectives that tilted the odds against individual hunters, such as the Northern Resident Draw, the Guaranteed Group allocation, and the Hunter/Tag Ratio Allocation (where applicable).  We believe that those mechanisms did not support a level playing field for draw applicants.  However, we also see the positive policy objectives of increasing access to tags by using the a Group system, and recognize that it was a benefit to all applicants that hunters that applied to the draw in groups, and that when hunters in groups were assigned tags, it resulted in the rest of the group being removed from the draw.  It is our impression that a lot of hunters do not understand and have not made an effort to understand the benefits of the current system.
We are sympathetic with those that have been unlucky in the current system, or that have been unable to develop cooperative hunting groups to increase their odds.  But we believe that rules are rules and the result was going to be that over time some hunters were going to be less lucky than others.
We support the 2020 proposed changes in this current proposal and believe in sustainability.
However, we are vehemently opposed to any changes to the tag allocation system that seeks to retroactively ""correct"" some perceived wrong or put hunters in a situation where there is an uneven starting point in a new system.  As a matter of public policy, this is wrong, regardless of whether this is a hunting related policy or not.  Not only is it wrong, it has the potential to create a much larger level of dissatisfaction and polarization within the hunting community, and towards the MNR.
The proposed preference points system, if retroactive, has the potential to eliminate tag opportunities for years for whole groups of hunters that have invested in building relationships to increase their odds of drawing tags, never mind the level of investments in hunting camps and economic benefits to communities where we hunt.  Specifically, it is our belief that a retroactive system has the potential to eliminate any chance of drawing tags for older hunters (depending on the demand in WMUs), and will create long wait times for new hunters, which will discourage a significant number of hunters from participating in hunting (particularly in Northern WMUs where there is no deer season).
We are unclear on the policy objectives of a retroactive points preference system.  Is the government changing its policy from increasing hunting opportunities and maximizing tag access in order to guarantee the right of every individual to a moose tag if they are willing to pay into a new system and wait long enough (while moving current system detractors to the front of the line)?
Further, we have no analysis from the MNR regarding these proposed changes.  Where is the policy research and analysis? Has the MNR been in contact with counterparts in the US that have implemented a preference points system?  The government and the MNR needs to be transparent with hunters before implementing this radical a change.  Do most hunters realize that that going forward, that they will no chance of drawing tags for years at a time in many WMUs?
Our perception is that there is a cross section of hunters, many who do not share the same policy objectives of hunting in groups and sharing tag opportunities in the past, that have now had their opportunity to voice their displeasure over a short two-month period, and that they are in the minority.
We question whether expediency and politics is becoming a higher priority than sound public policy in resource management.  As a result, we are of the opinion that much broader public discussion with hunters and other stakeholders is required on the merits of preference points system, never mind a system that allocates points retroactively.
To conclude, we recognize that there are many recommendations and potential tools in the report issued by the Big Game Management Committee to make positive changes for the benefit of all hunters.  But a retroactive preference point system is not one of them.  We believe it will be popular in the near-term for a certain cross-section of hunters, but would be extremely damaging to the long-term interests of the Ontario hunting community, and result in a system that would be even more difficult to rectify.

33324,/comment/33324,"Synchronizing of multiple WMU seasons and having separate Archery versus Firearm seasons, those changes are smart and overdue.
Calf Harvest should be restricted and or simply eliminated if the goal is to increase the moose population.  I suspect that is not the actual goal in many WMU, especially those anticipating a recovery of Woodland Caribou, whether likely or not.
If and only if this proposed system is adopted, I believe any person who receives a Bull or a Cow tag should legally be allowed to harvest a calf with that tag in any WMU.  But your tag is used, no matter what animal is harvested.  That would simplify things and still allow for a somewhat higher chance of a successful hunt for some parties that would be satisfied with a calf.
Party Hunting is fine the way it is, restricting distances and or limiting the number of guys or kids in a party is just another way to restrict hunter participation.  Limit the tags, to the numbers of Moose that can be safely harvested.  Don't further restrict hunter participation.  Hunting is dying as a sport.  We need to make sure that its simple, and fun.  Not a complicated, expensive sport, just a fun and simple sport.  I can only imagine the fines coming from people being found to be 100 meters beyond the allowable distance from the person with the ""tag"".
I think the current and proposed systems are too complicated.  I suggest a simple Bull Moose only season, minimum antler width of 48"" to be legal, and that's all.  Issue tags based on that, with a 10 person party hunting limit if that is what is desired.
The preference point and tag system may work just fine, as long as the price of the combined tag and licence are reasonable.  Currently the cost of the license is high enough that many people I know choose not to hunt moose any more, simply because they haven't received a tag in so long they are discouraged, and don't want to waste the money.  Almost no one I know or associate with bothers to hunt moose with only a calf tag.  They just simply don't participate any more.

33327,/comment/33327,"I have not hunted moose in Ontario but I did in BC when I lived there. The season as I recall was long enough in the fall so that one could travel out to an area and camp and enjoy the outdoors and scout around and just enjoy a 7-10 day experience. The season was a month or more I think and it was enjoyable. If you managed to bag a moose it was a bonus. I think here the season is so short a hunter cannot get to enjoy the outdoor experience of getting away from a high stress ""rat race."" One would have to do scouting before the season and know exactly where you were going and know what you were doing well beforehand in order to have a limited window to bag an animal. This puts pressure on the hunting experience and takes away from the enjoyment of just getting away.
In these days of increasing socialist left leaning behaviour (facts don't matter) together with emotional anti-hunting/anti-firearm activism, it would be reassuring for normal, regular, decent tax paying citizens to know that those that make the rules are guided by cool headed logic and decency for ""we the people"" and not ""activists.""

I wish the MNR would publish draw results on number of southern and northern applicants and their success rates. If the draw was truly random then the results should bare that out. Somehow I feel it was never random as it should have been.

Only thing I would not like to see is the reduction of distance from tag holder from 5 km to 3 km. In this day and age I still believe 5 kms from tag holder is fair.

Does that make any sense at all?
1. Coyotes would be a big rarity in any moose kills. Anyone who studies ungulates probably has advised this already.
2. You know who is the number one predator and problem when it comes to Moose? People! Our own continued interference and destruction of habitat and/ or further fragmentation of habitat. It makes zero sense to say on one hand that there are dwindling numbers. Then on the other that we need to be able to hunt them still. Less than 1% of hunter(s) being imperatively reliant on this as a food source. Why not just close moose season for a decade or so and then ban habitat destruction/ fragmentation for the same period of time? I guarantee that would be a much better long-term solution.
3. Are wolves also not an equally important piece of the natural balance and food chain in those habitats? Hint the answer from every unbiased scientist is yes. Also every one of those scientists knows their basic predator/ prey relationship models will have this intertwined over time in response to each other (ie if moose goes down so do predator populations that rely on that as a food source).
Therefore lets please leave these kind of decisions up to professionals only and not committees of sad and deranged people who for some reason feel entertained by killing things as a hobby.

I am now 63 yrs of age -while I support a points based system a very expedited system is needed to ensure that older hunters who have not had an adult moose tag for many years  be provided with this opportunity before they are physically unable to enjoy a last opportunity to hunt an adult moose.
In order for the proposed changes to be successful there needs to be some regulation or changes to the unregulated hunters. in many northern WMU aboriginal hunters begin hunting in early September. Refrigerator trucks are used and large numbers of moose are taken. Many of the bull moose are shot at night answering moose calls from aboriginal hunters during the peak of the moose rut. The numbers of moose harvested in these WMU far exceed the number of moose tags allocated.

It appears as though the Ministry has taken a lot of feedback from the public and has come up with some very good recommendations for the future.  I am also a big fan of eliminating calf harvesting altogether as I have heard of people out partridge hunting that come across a calf and shoot it because they have a tag in their possession when they were never even out moose hunting.  If we want to herd to increase lets keep the calf harvest to an absolute minimum as bears and wolves already reduce the calve population dramatically.

33359,/comment/33359,"Group Hunting:  Since the changes in group applications began the onus of the ""MNR"" was to satisfy as many moose hunters as possible.  In 2018, 53% of group hunters were successful whereby individuals were only successful 11% of the time.
As a strong advocate of the group application, groups such as ours (14) in 2019 are being targeted and yes, we have 14 on a cow tag in 2019. (14 very happy hunters) and we have had an adult tag every year since 2007 (with up to 14 on each tag/each year).  On average, every 10 years one member our our group is successful in obtaining an adult validation tag.  In 2018 the number of P1C1 applicants was ""612"" and 62 bull tags allotted.  In 2019 the number of bull tags has been reduced to ""10"".  With limited math, it may appear that for everyone to receive a bull moose tag in this unit it may take 60 years to get my next tag and even if it is 20 years ( with your proposed changes) WAY TOO LONG. THIS IS JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT AS THE PREMISE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ""SATISFY AS MANY HUNTERS AS POSSIBLE"".  Now you are telling me that our group of 14 can no longer be a group of 14 and must be (10 or 8)?  Where is the rationale to satisfy as many hunters as possible with this proposal?
-Secondly, nothing in your proposal addresses the fact that when a cow moose is harvested, calves involved that are left to fend for themselves and to ""learn the ropes"" without the assistance of their mom, for the most part will not survive.  If you are going to be allowed to harvest a cow and it has a calf or two, you might as well be allowed to harvest the calf at the same time.
Thirdly, the Indigenous Harvest and yes I understand that ""ALL INDEGINEOUS PEOPLE"" are above the law.  Hunting at night, no orange, give me a break.  Enforce Limit ( 1 moose per household).  Weill again if my math is correct, the herd will be wiped out in the next 1-2 years.  Good work on this!
Fourthly, I recently picked up my 2019 license for a calf moose. Did you know that as a ""law abiding citizen"", I can just photo-copy my current license"" and harvest as many calf moose as I wish.  Do you really think, people are that stupid to think that this will not be happening and you are opening the door for a ""mass kill"" with groups harvesting many more adult moose than are allotted.  I think someone has sure dropped the ball on this one.
Am I concerned with how the herd is being managed, yes, but I am most concerned that I or any member of our group will ever have a tag again after the 590 other hunters are satisfied. first.  We don't abuse the ""ghost hunter"" ideology and ""ghost hunters"" have only one chance and they must accept the tag.
I could ramble on but I do understand that it is a delicate process and that many hunters are frustrated, but our group of 14 hunters have well over ($250,000) invested in equipment, trucks, trailers, bikes, argos, boats, motors, etc. and for the most part, we won't be able to hunt together any more as you plan to reduce our group size to 8-10.
I had an adult bull moose tag last year and don't think I will be around in 2060 for my next one if I have read the 37 page report correct.

33363,/comment/33363,"I agree with most of the recommendations and offer the following comments:
> Hunters should be required to apply for a bull, cow/calf, calf tag.  Bull tags and cow/calf tags should be awarded on a points-based system as described in the recommendations.  Calf tags should NOT be awarded on a points based basis but awarded randomly in a draw to any hunters to choose to apply. This will allow hunters  the chance  to obtain a calf tag while still accumulating points for an adult moose without penalty.
>Mandating that hunters must identify  the hunters in their party  on the licence summary and limiting hunters to 3 groups will be problematic.  In northern Ontario, where seasons are longer, it's common for groups of hunters to form almost on a daily basis.  The recommendation as proposed is too rigid.  The current system is more flexible and is preferable.
>The recommendations suggest that changes to the season could happen due to tag fill rates.  I suggest that the possibility for separate draws for split seasons be explored.  Depending on hunter success rates, this may allow for the issuance of more tags.  Consideration should be given to protecting bulls in the early season while protecting pregnant cows later in the season.
> I support a reasonably priced application fee which if added to the cost of an adult tag would price out to the same cost of a current moose licence.  I support a graduated licence price system for bulls (most expensive), cows, and calves (least expensive).  The overall cost of the application and moose licence should be reasonable for an INDIVIDUAL to purchase.  Do not base the cost of a moose licence presuming that the cost will be shared by a group.
>Hunters who have more points than what are required for a tag should not loose the extra points if awarded a tag.  Hunters should be able to keep these points because they earned them!
> Hunters should be able to obtain recent and historical information about the status of the moose herd in a particular WMU, including a commentary that describes the challenges and successes.  Hunters should also be able to obtain statistical information on any given WMU e.g. hunter draw info, harvest info, hunter effort, etc.
>BGMAC should be tasked to review forest management plans and reports to monitor the state of the forest and make recommendations to improve moose habitat.
>Wildfires and prescribed burns should be utilized to manage and enhance moose habitat.
>  Remove the 2-wolf bag limit in northern Ontario.  There are no shortages of wolves in northern Ontario and allowances are required to encourage hunters to harvest more.

We need these experienced hunters in the outdoors, they bring so much knowledge as well as a passion for the conservation of our big game population. We need this new system in Ontario, please get this done so we can end the years of suffering under the current broken system.

Now wanna cut group size to 10 when we have 18 members in camp. This year 15 Pool 1 hunters on a cow tag, 2 pool 1 hunters on a bull tag and 1 pool 2 hunter.

33368,/comment/33368,"I don't think that removing the calf hunting season is the solution.  Very few calves alone are killed during the moose hunting season.  Most calves that do end up being killed were with their mother which was also killed.
With the calf season opening two weeks later in zone 24, we have witnessed killing a cow then less than a day later hearing wolves howling because they had caught the calf.  Very little calves will make it through a winter season without it's mother, why make it suffer?
Also, up north, in our area, some natives make a lot MORE damage to the moose population by hunting during the night and killing everything that they see with a powered riffle during the RUT season.  When they were first allowed to hunt all year round in the past, it was with bow and arrows which weren't as affective as the 7MM which they use today.  No-one seems to want to tackle this problem!  In our hunting area, were are sometimes scared because some natives hunt in the middle of the night.  Come on people, let's tackle the REAL problem here.

The hunters pay for a camp, taxes for fuel licenses etc. and may not be able to hunt. The hunters can hunt now because they can at least hunt a calf.

The proposed point system eliminates the control that a hunting group had to mitigate getting ""too many"" tags in one hunting seasons and ""non"" in others. It levelled the allocation of tags over the years.
The point system could result in many tags being awarded to a group in one year and then many years before another tag is allocated.
This system is slanted to benefit individual hunters and is a step backwards.
It would be far more beneficial to fix the group allocation system.

33379,/comment/33379,"I believe changes are certainly overdue to the tag allocation system in Ontario. However please consider tag allocation a priority to group hunters and not individual hunters. Moose hunting in this province was and should always be a group or family activity, but with the new proposals it seems the new allocation system prioritizes individuals, and not groups. Also with no tags being issued with the purchase of a license it may be possible for a group of people to not be able to hunt in a given year. Everyone should be able to hunt regardless of their success in the draw. If an area shows lack of moose population shut the area down for a specified time, and allow the moose population to stabilize. I have been in pool 1 for over 20 years, and have never received a tag. During that time I have seen single individuals be awarded more than 4 tags in the same time. This is simply not fair. Consider having groups register as a hunting camp (minimum membership of 10), and those camps having priority over tags as compared to individuals. I love moose hunting in this province, and as a hunter my primary concern is to protect the moose population for future generations to enjoy. Having separate prices for tags seems to be more of a cash grab than actual conservation.

33382,/comment/33382,"Comments related to both the report and tag allocation process:
1. Glyphosate Effects on Wildlife:
 A wealth of scientific information exits on the potential effects of glyphosate on a wide variety of species including birds, small and large mammals amphibians, insects, microbial organisms and others. many scientific and regulatory reviews have examined available data on the effects of glyphosate on wildlife. All of these consistently conclude that the use of glyphosate products in accordance with product labels does not pose a significant risk to wildlife species in terms of either direct acute or chronic toxicity or through various sub-chronic or indirect effects. Numerous field studies on this topic have been undertaken in Canadian forest ecosystems and in general indicate that typical uses of glyphosate products in forestry do not: generate plant monocultures; result in direct acute toxicity to birds, fish, aquatic invertebrates, small & large mammals or amphibians; or  cause a reduction in soil microbial populations or significantly impair their function.
Short term reduction in numbers of some wildlife species are known to occur as an indirect result of changes in their optimal vegetative habitat. Such changes are typically quite transient, with numbers returning to normal levels within 2-3 years as vegetation and preferred habitat of food re-establishes on treated sites.
In the case with moose, they may avoid treated sites for a few years post-treatment while the supply of their favoured browse species is reduced, but then seek out those site preferentially in later years when their browse species re-establishes on the sites.
Forest management activities from harvest to silviculture, creates a variety of habitat types that at different seral stages  should support healthy moose populations. Habitat is not the limiting factor in the decline of the moose populations.  Uncontrolled hunting from poachers, first Nations & Metis, associated with winter ticks, bear and wolf predation all play a role in contributing to the issue.
2. Tag Allocation
At a minimum the protection of the moose heard should be driving force behind the allocation system and not maximizing revenues to provincial SPA.
Eliminate the calf hunt through out the entire province.
Establish a points system that allocates adult tags to long term hunters fairly.

The two points I feel very strongly about if we are to preserve the population of Moose and the opportunities that come with it as hunters and conservationists, is in regards to Calf hunting and Coyote/Wolf hunting.
The combination of restricting the wolf/coyote hunting around Algonquin park and at the same time allowing Calf's to be harvested (which are already under constant threat from Predator's) just makes little sense to me. Help protect the most vulnerable (less calf hunting) and allow us hunters to help keep the predators in check. We are the only control mechanism that exists for that.

I have gone over 10 years without receiving a tag in the draw but have received a surplus tag (after a long delay getting through on the phone lines) only to abort going on the hunt due to very limited road access (northern wmu). Accepted the tag only because that was all that was available (available tags for the wmu we wanted were already gone). Upon looking further into the wmu after receiving the tag came to conclusion the wmu was very limited by road and more a fly in zone.

33398,/comment/33398,"Thank You for the opportunity to express my thoughts:
-There was a good effort put forth communication the actions for the new Moose plan, and to have stake holders involved.
  However it was quite surprising, Southern  Ontario got 2 locations, and Northern Ontario got 5 locations for public meeting.
   Why-If it is known , about 50% of Ontario moose hunters are from South?
This is now behind us-can not offer solution, however many were not given opportunities to go to these meetings.
-There is no clear rationale to allocate one extra point to Northern Ontario hunters!
    Why all the others from Ontario are treated differently? Southerners spend lot more money into Tourist industry while going up moose hunting(one of the goals of hunting as such is-to contribute to the Economy).It is well known, very few, if any Northern Licensed hunter needs to hunt for other then a great pastime!
    No difference then the Southern hunters do!
So-why preference?
     Just because they are there, and the moose is there too?
     Just because    Southerners have deer-they do not?(some still have deer too). Travel down, it is easy, and easy to get deer tags too-after all ,Southerners do opposite for moose hunt?
    Solution-TREAT all Ontarians EQUALLY for points.
-Allowing long term points to be carried over to the unsuccessful hunters is very unfair!
 It does penalize all other hunters willing to take ""worst"" opportunities in remote locations, or where moose is hard to get by, in order to get tag and moose hunt. The ones waiting for good luck, and not willing to move now will have ALL the perks from the new system-likely condemning the past successful ones to keep sucking up bad locations or not go hunting altogether?
    Not getting moose tag for 5-10 years is not just sheer bad luck or bad system , it is also huge unwillingness  from their part!
  Most unsuccessful hunters knew what they were getting into when applying into hard to get tag areas-why prefer them over the contributors ?
   Solution-have a CLEAN slate, start with 2021-so EVERYONE knows the rules , and EVERYONE can play EQUALLY by them. Random draw for few years in the HIGH  DEMAND WMU-s, then everything will settle where trends will go.
-Why penalize successful hunters WHOM got a tag in surplus tag system(by  eliminating their points)?This is a new approach, has no past precedent in Ontario moose hunt, and again penalizes the willing and contributing.
   Solution-disregard surplus tags from preference point removal process. They will be eliminated anyway soon.
There are still other unknown or hard to understand implications of the new proposal, but this is what my comments are as of now.

This will not decrease the likelihood of hunters being successful and will only create more issues of non-compliance. The further restriction of hunting distance from 5km to 3km will ensure that a group of hunters is indeed hunting as a group of hunters . Whether the group size is set at 10 individuals or 20 individuals the hunters will be restricted to their historic hunting areas. This will only create more unnecessary legislation for hunters to follow and make planning for an upcoming moose hunt unnecessarily difficult. Any restrictions on moose harvest numbers should be done through the allocation of tags.
There should be no calf moose hunt. Most of the issues associated with compliance in moose hunts is associated with the incorrect identification of a calf moose. A hunter can never be sure if a calf moose is indeed a calf moose or simply a small yearling cow. If tags were restricted to bull and cow/calf tags these issues of incorrect identification would be eliminated. This would increase the sustainability of the moose population and reduce stress on MNRF conservation officers so that they could focus on more serious offences in comparison to incorrect identification of calf moose.

33426,/comment/33426,"To whom it may concern,
In regards to the proposed changes much of what has been proposed I am in agreement with.  My main area of concern lies in the changes that negatively effect group draws and party hunting.  I fundamentally disagree with eliminating the group draw.  In fact it is my belief that hunters should have to apply as a group to receive a tag.  Applying as a large member group should be rewarded with higher percentage of success and smaller groups with lower percentage.  It takes time, effort and organization as well as a knowledge that perhaps 10 hunting members will knowingly share at most 1 adult moose between them.  Group members are aware of this and happy with the chance to harvest that 1 animal every year.  Most moose harvested are accompanied by other moose at the time of harvest having only 1 tag between a group allows those other moose to walk free.   Thus keeping harvest levels low and population high.
My second concern lies with your proposed point system.  This again rewards individual hunters who will automatically have higher point levels then any of those who have been applying as a group member.  Hunters who have been applying in groups have and rightfully so been rewarded with tags over the years thus we will be entering the new system with far less points then individual applicants.  Yet again limiting draw success of those hunters who have worked to organize groups.
To finalize the proposed changes are directed towards improving hunting opportunities for individual hunters who have either not tried hard enough or have no interest in working with other hunters to obtain tags and harvest moose and will punish those who have been members of groups. My proposed system would be-
Cap the group numbers at 10 applicants
Have a lottery system where maximum group applications have 10 balls in the lottery groups at 7 have 7 balls and so on down the line.  Some years those large groups will get unlucky and some years smaller groups will get more lucky. Those who apply as groups and are willing to split 1 adult moose between them should have a better opportunity to be rewarded!
If my opinion is not shared amongst the majority of hunters and these changes go through I hope at a minimum you will provide hunters who have been applying as members of groups additional points initially so that they are not all starting at the lower end of the point system.
Hunting has and hopefully always will be something that is enjoyed by groups of friends and family that work together.  Any changes to the drawing system should be designed to reward these groups not punish them!

I've had them come to my campsite threatening me if I didn't give them booze. They hunt at nite and so drugged they could barely speek.
    From what i experienced and observed in the last 54 years moose hunting  will  be over in less then ten years expect for outfitters and first nation . I was lucky to have hunted moose for 53 years.
     If you really want to save the moose all hunting has to be controlled. My mean all nations.
Twenty years ago at stopped at the MNR office in Geraldton Ontario,  unit 19 ,and was talking to an officer . When i told him i was bow moose hunting he told me to wear a red vest because first nation were doing their harvesting . Funny, three days after i was shot at . I laid on the ground ,was able to remove my vest and waved it like a flag . They were shooting at about 800 yards across a cut . I could go on all day about bad experiences , my kids told me i should write a book ,but i don't want to get shot again because this time they might hit the target . If you really want to same the moose population  all hunters have  to participate. It's over ,because nobody has the power to stop first nation.

I also agree with the elimination of group applications and restricting the sizes of groups.
Overall, I agree with all the proposed changes.

Once an Area with the highest moose count in the province to one where you are lucky if you see a track let alone a Moose. This unit, and there maybe others, need specific management straegies in order for the herd to reestablish itself while still allowing a limited amount of hunting. A couple of suggestions would be reduced the number of Cow tags issued to 1 and delay the season opening date until after the rut is over.

33437,/comment/33437,"A nominal fee to enter the moose tag draw will prohibit some people from entering the draw.  License fees have substantially increased over the years.  An alternative might be that the moose tag holder tags the moose immediately after the kill with their tag and license.  A member of the gang must tag the moose as well with their hunting license.  Both hunters would no longer be allowed to hunt moose for that season thus the gang party hunting size would be reduced by two.  This would potentially reduce the gang's success rate which, could have a positive impact on the increase of the moose herd.
Alternating what type of moose that can be taken in a wildlife management unit annually would also be bennificial.  Bulls only one year, Bulls and calves only the next, and bulls, cows and calves in the third year.  The fourth year the cycle would start over again with bulls only.  This would preserve cows and increase herd population.

By pricing the tag based on the animal being applied for, with the highest price for a bull, you may be excluding people who work at a minimum wage job from being able to afford a tag that they may otherwise be entitled to, if they have the points they need. If left as proposed, more tags will end up only in the hands of the rich and exclude regular hunters who deserve their chance as well, but would be excluded by the ""modest fee"".

33440,/comment/33440,"Obviously the MNR has infused exactly what they want with restricting Moose Hunting opportunities. The Forest Roads and Water Crossings Initiative kept the hunters out of prime hunting areas and the moose numbers had nothing to do with it. The distance between tag holders as recommened will now  make it unsafe for a larger groups made to hunt closer. I sat on the OFWAB when the MNR Enforcement wanted to change the distance to 5 Km at that time and we recommended unanimously on a better distance of more than that. Then they went to 5 km a lesser distance anyway and ignored our recommendation. Now again restrictive measures are being presented by the MNR.  A predetermined outcome presented properly can and does influence the outcome of any issue, and the MNR does just that. You folks have made up your mind before and after any EBR's. I have seen it in action at the Hunting Symposium. The system in place is working and well so why change it all? If you want to truly increase the size of the herd to a more sustainable number, and who knows what that really is, then start using the tools you have. Cancel the Wolf moratorium around Algonquin Park prescribed by fictitious unfounded activists studies. The so called Eastern Gray wolf is genetically found as far south as Maine  We all know the Spring Bear Hunt cancellation was really the demise of the Moose numbers and yes it's back sort of, but too late. Over 14,000 Male Bears per year not harvested since it was cancelled eat a hell of lot of Calves and Cows. Provincial statistics of other provinces regarding Moose to Bear populations show we have more Bears then Moose, go figure.
Bring back when we could shoot a Bear or Wolf on Deer and Moose Licences no charge, or tack on $10 but correct the problem at the source. The undetermined early Aboriginal Harvest needs to be part of our tool kit as well as any conservation related fish and wildlife program. Commercial harvest of any fish and wild life needs to be zero.

We have hunted many, many years and in the past 3 years, our group has only got one tag. There are other groups that we know that have gotten multiple tags for their group.  This year we entered as individuals and there are 8 people in our group. No one received a tag. In previous years we would put in for the draw in a group of 8-10 people.

33465,/comment/33465,"I support most of the changes proposed to moose tag allocations. Several concerns that I have are listed below
First of all I dont believe that the acceptance of surplus tags in past years should influence the number of points you begin with. The acceptance of surplus tags have always been advertised as not effecting your pool status and hunters may accept tags they would not have otherwise. For example I accepted a cow tag in a unit much farther north than I would ever apply. I chose to go north knowing that it doesnt change anything going forward. To further that, these proposed changes came out the same day as the surplus tags were issues, resulting in people accepting tags this year before knowing proposed changes for next year. This simple consideration for me would be the difference between 6 and 2 points.
The second consideration I hope to have heard is the limited group size. I do support the restriction of 10 hunters per tag but I question the way this will be monitored. I would rather see 10 hunters listed on a specific licence than allowing 10 people at any one time and 10 different people the next day. Apply solo, then after drawn and before issuing tags list the people designated to hunt with you.
Thank you for your consideration and hopefully see some positive change to moose populations in ontario.

33466,/comment/33466,"I agree with the overall structure of the changes proposed.
However, I would like to see a small percentage of the tags still given out by random draw.  That way a new hunter could still have a chance (albeit small) of drawing a tag.  If 80% of the tags in a WMU were preference points and 20% were random draw it would both reward hunters who have been waiting a long time for a tag and give new hunters a chance of getting a tag.
The downside to a pure preference point system is that it basically ensures that a new hunter will not draw a moose tag for many years.  Having some tags through random draw will keep these new hunters more interested in hunting moose in Ontario.

33468,/comment/33468,"I cannot enter this section using my account as I would like these concerns to be on my file!
I have reviewed these proposed changes and feel:
1) There are too many moving parts to properly administer!
2) Most hunters understand the current group system. Yes, it is not perfect but I consider it fair. Given the reduction of Moose in the province (which I blame the MNR for closing the Bear season allowing many of bears to remove the calf population). Our hunt area is infected with Bears and it will take many years for a balance of Moose/Bear ratio again.
3) We generally qualify for the large group or guarantee group size each year allowing a group of upward of 10 to be removed from the pool and giving the remainder chances to draw a tag. We are satisfied with 1 adult tag whereas we could draw multiple tags in one year.
4) I feel concern for the Lodge owners of Northern Ontario. They count on us each year. At least with a calf tag we can still hunt. There will be years we will not be going due to the lack of a tag, therefore, jeopardizing our position in this lodge.
5) On social media there has been lots of opertunity for hunters whom have not drawn this year to join groups, whom have drawn a tag. This proves the current system works.
6) These proposed changes are based on an individual draw and yes you may hunt alone but who can tell me they can handle a Moose alone when it is down, let alone look after this amount of meat.

33479,/comment/33479,"Certainly an extensive amount of work and information presented.  Goal to make tag allocations simpler and fairer is over due and where changes can be made to support declining moose populations is welcomed.  Some thoughts concerning these guidelines/policies/regulations and other moose population concerns are as follows:
1. To implement across the province may be difficult all at once - so monitoring, analysis and reporting (MAR) results will be key to see if impacts are what is expected both to meet hunter expectations and moose population concerns.  Implementing these regulations on a smaller scale as a first step might help?  MNRF needs to have a plan to MAR;
2. Without strong enforcement, policies may only be as deep as the paper they are printed on.  MNRF has to be on the ground or via remote methods to ensure policies/regulations are being enforced as well as to report if they are working;
3. Past studies have stated that predator control doesn't work!  If done it is difficult to monitor and report if the effects are positive on moose populations; animals tend to move - so if predators are removed immigration from the surrounding area would naturally occur.  Maybe this tactic is to just provide more hunting opportunities?  Not sure it will impact positively on moose populations;
4. Government needs to come to grips with climate change (CC) that probably is the biggest threat to moose and how CC is impacting moose, white-tailed deer, disease, etc. all having negative impacts on moose as well as man made habitat loss (ie. fracturing the boreal forest with roads and large clear cuts and cumulative impacts!).  This is a start but government needs to report on how climate change is impacting moose and as a start that takes some extensive studies over long periods of time.  We need study as well as action on CC - I don't see this happening and was probably outside the scope of the Big Game focus group and these regulations?  Regulations might improve relations with hunters but not sure much impact on declining moose populations.  Hopefully the tag allocation is also not a distraction from our declining moose populations which should be of a greater concern and more difficult to solve.

33483,/comment/33483,"I hunt in WMU 42. Hunted there before any roads and still walk the bush. I hunt for a week and still see about 10 moose per year. Hardly anyone walks the bush any more. The problem in my area is the clear cuts. The moose get slaughtered there. I see mostly natives hunting in the area now where in the past hardly any. I told my son as soon as the bush grows up they will be gone. The natives take mostly adults, I don't recall ever seeing them with a calf.
Deer population is way down from where it was a few years ago. Not sure why but I just don't see the tracks I used to.
Every single balsam is dead and gone in the last 5 years. Some areas are completely void of trees for a 100 feet or so. Not sure to what extent moose browse on them so can't say if that has anything to do with it. New ones 2-3 feet high are coming up.
New way of cutting the trees doesn't leave the food source it used to. They snip the tree off at the bottom and put it in a pile. Then a skidder picks up the pile and drags it to the road where a machine rips off all the branches and creates a pile which they burn. Little trees start to grow and they spray them. Beaver dams are broken to build the roads,  np water.  No water, no food...no moose.
Area 42 is already 2-3 adult moose tags. Basically closed to non natives. I still enjoy spending the time with my extended family and being outdoors but I expect you will be taking that away soon too.

33490,/comment/33490,"Over harvest of calves is a fallacy. I have hunted moose since grade 8. I am now 65 yrs and although I have lived in central and southern Ont most of my life I lived in NW Ontario 12 years as well. In all those years I only harvested 3 calves! Even though I hunted hard most weekends and 2 to 2 1/2 weeks at a time when living in S Ont. Having a calf licence when not selected for an adult tag gave myself and others  hunt with the opportunity to still hunt moose. I see that WMU 63 isn't mentioned for calf tag during the 1 week hunt.
With these new proposed changes, there leaves a lot of chance for unlawful moose hunting to occur. In all the years i have hunted, I have only been checked by a CO in the field only 3 times! There are too few enforcement officers in the field to make this effective. Many people I have hunted with over the years have either given up the sport or are now hunting in Quebec or Nfld. because they can purchase a NR moose licence over the counter and still enjoy their sport. Ontario is loosing many sportsmen and the revenues to other provinces because of the way Ontario manages their big game.
As big game mangers you must seriously consider a few other things that fall into the equation. 1. Adult Bears take many calves in the spring. With the elimination of the spring bear season for so many years, the bear population increased exponentially for all those years, therefore the number of calves eaten by bears increased likewise each year. If you wish to increase moose, allow more than one bear per hunter per season to get them back in check. This will have an immediate effect on moose recruitment. 2. Forest and timber cutting practices. Most mills in the north have been shut down for a lot of years. If there is no or little timber cutting, there is less ultimate moose habitat. The regen that cutting produces is really good habitat for moose for many years afterwards! if mills open up and cutting resumes, moose will also bounce back. Softwood sales needs to be looked at from both a provincial and federal level. Its political. they must see this to help out with the efforts to increase Ont moose populations! 3. Where logging operations do occur, the regen management is to seed or to plant, along with aerial spraying herbicide to knock down broad leaf aspen, birch, willow, and alder. All which moose love as browse during all seasons after a cut. Stop aerial herbicide spraying to release the conifer species. 4. Fire suppression. In recent years - 20 - 30 years - fire suppression management is to get on it asap when they see smoke. Bomb it and get the crews on it right away. Let more fires burn in natural succession to create moose habitat. Especially in remote areas or in areas where cutting has occurred but planting hasn't been done yet. As we all know, you need fire to release jack pine seeds from cones. That's natural and the seedlings that come in are as thick as hair on a dogs back. No money expended for regen. And it creates good moose habitat for many years!
By cutting out the calf season in S Ont other than by lottery, you will also eliminate many hunters who now hunt the southern WMU where calves can be hunted w/o a special tag!
This new point system will mean that you might get an adult tag every 10 or 20 years! There still will only be a defined lesser number of tags available for each WMU. There will be a lot of hunt camps going up for sale in the coming years, unless there is deer in the same unit. You will be driving out the long time moose hunters into other provinces and also giving up the moose hunt.
It will become what many countries and states now have: very limited tags, and only the white collar people will be able to hunt moose. PLUS you will have many more illegally harvested moose and moose hunters out there! More moose surveys are needed to get a more accurate estimate of moose numbers in each WMU! Plus mandatory reporting of road kills, railway kills, and first nations harvests.
Above all this, there is more pressure placed on the small number of CO's we have out there, who now are swamped with desk work and office work, and less field work, for which they are needed.
A commitment of more field CO's (not office personnel with CO badges) is needed for the province.  Not more regulations!
The cancellation of the spring bear hunt created a new type of hunter, which we all know, but mention it only in silence and whispers, the ""Shoot, shovel and shut up"" hunter, that hunts bears for sport, ""defense"" and for farmers. And it continues today even thought he bear hunt was reinstated.
Some of your planned changes are in line with moose numbers in central Ontario and NE Ontario. But does not make any sense in NW Ontario and some of the southern WMUs!
More moose surveys are needed to get a more accurate estimate of moose numbers in each WMU! Plus mandatory reporting of all road kills, railway kills, and first nations harvests to get moose numbers correct.
Open houses should be in more locations than the few that were offered last year. i.e. Kemptville, Kingston, North Bay, Ptbo., Dryden, Kenora, Owen Sound, SS Marie, Timmins, Nipigon. Have a traveling road team to do this to get more input.

Environmental Registry of Ontario
Proposed changes to moose management as part of the Moose Management Review
Please accept this document as part of the public consultation process which is to be submitted before September 26, 2019 to the Environmental Registry of Ontario regarding the Proposed Changes to moose management as part of the moose management review.
I submit this as a concerned moose hunter and also as a member of the Bruton and Clyde Hunters Association (BCHA). The BCHA is an organization made up of 65 regulated hunt camps within the geographic boundaries of Algonquin Provincial Park in Bruton and Clyde Township.
Background:
Prior to 1960 many of the current hunting camps in Bruton and Clyde Townships were on Crown Land leases and hunting had taken place there for generations. When the government of the day passed legislation to add these two townships to Algonquin Park assurances were accepted into law that hunting, logging, and trapping would be permitted in perpetuity under some stringent guidelines. Permanent camps were destroyed and camp zones were released on a first come first serve basis at the Department of Lands and Forest Branch Office in Lindsay Ontario on a selected day. Hunters lined up to claim zones and at the time about seventy-five camp zones were distributed to primarily the camps who previously hunted in the respective areas. Strict reporting of hunting success and camp membership was worded into the legislation and failing to report resulted in the loss of your zone and the privilege of hunting that zone.  As a result, we currently have 65 camps active in Bruton (40) and Clyde (25) losing about 10 over the past 58 years. Our association was organized in the 1970’s by several key leaders who saw the benefit of joining together as one voice to work with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Ontario Parks to ensure a positive hunting experience while maintaining park values in this multi-use provincial park. Some of these leaders still sit on our executive board and others hunt their zones each year and along with the other members of our association take pride in being stewards of the Park. Legislation has changed with the times and the Game and Fish Act evolved into the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act and the Algonquin Park Extension Act has been rescinded into the a Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act. Section 15. (2) of this act replaces wording in the previous act and legislates our hunting activities in Algonquin Park.
In the past 50 years, being a part of Algonquin, our membership has provided valuable information to the MNR and with over a half century of data this is immensely valuable. In light of the fact that the state of the natural resources we enjoy is a major interest to our members, it is a testimony to how sensible resource management works. As a group we have strived to work with the Ministry to deal with changes in the eco-system and social needs and on the whole this is working well.
Question and Concerns:
With the proposed changes published by the MNRF and the BGMAC several questions or concerns have been raised on the effect of these changes on our operations as they pertain to moose hunting activities in the future. We are very aware that we operate under different rules than other hunters and camps in the province but would like clarification on what the proposed changes will have on our current status. I will try to list these questions and concerns in point form to make it a simple as possible.
1/	How would the proposed expanded bow season be implemented on the first week of October when we have restricted access to our regulated hunt camp zones until the 7 days prior to the opening of the gun season for moose?
2/ 	Expanding the bow tag opportunities would reduce the gun tag opportunities and if camps are not allowed access our organization would be disadvantaged
3/	Our camp rosters must be submitted with our annual application and we are permitted 12 members per camp. By reducing groups permitted to hunt for individual tags down to 10 or even 8 this would limit our camp members from hunting even if we were fortunate enough to draw a tag.
4/	By instituting a bull tag, a cow/calf tag and a calf tag draw this could see many of our established camps be eliminated from any moose hunting opportunities from their camps as the guaranteed draw and calf hunt system now in place would not exist.
5/	The proposed system of waiting to see who receives a tag then joining that group to party hunt would be very difficult with the rules and regulations we currently operate under. Currently we must hunt from our approved camp site so if a member of an adjacent camp received a tag and members of our camp was chosen to join the hunt for that tag the current rules could not be followed.
6/ 	Would the application for three different choices be based on different tag types (bull, cow/calf and calf) in the same WMU or specifically different WMU’s?

33511,/comment/33511,"I am glad that some of the proposed changes aim to protect moose populations in Ontario and grow moose numbers. especially the management of the Calf populations as required. I'm wondering why more isn't done to focus on the breeding cow population which in my estimation would be the greatest factor in ensuring the health and population growth of moose in Ontario. However, I am disappointed in the proposed new ""point"" allocation system for the distribution of adult and or calf moose tags. For years my group (made up of family and friends in the GTA and Hamilton) and I have participated in the moose draw and abide by the current system which gives preference to larger hunting parties (guaranteed group sizes). With the new point system, no one in our group will have more than 3 or 4 points. The new system seems designed to favor moose tag  applicants who never applied as a group previously (likely northern residents who choose not to hunt in parties and want a moose to themselves every year) who will have high point totals and take all of the available tags, leaving the traditional ""party"" moose hunter with diminished moose hunting opportunities. It looks like my moose hunting days (and those of my group member's) will be over unfortunately if this proposal goes through. Us in addition to the 1000's of other urban residents who get together and plan trips every year for a pilgrimage north and invest heavily in northern communities during their moose hunts (lodging, food, fuel, etc.) In turn, I also see this as being a huge hit on these northern economies. It's really a shame. I was hoping that one day I would be able to introduce my son and daughter to moose hunting when they come of age. I guess they never will have this opportunity as I will not have the ability to pass on this beloved tradition to them. Great Work!

33515,/comment/33515,"To: Whom it May Concern, MNRF Moose Policy Committee
Re: Comments regarding revision of Moose Draw& Tag Allocation
For the most part I will refer to the numbers for WMU 60 as it is where our hunt camp LUP is located.
In the immediate area surrounding us there are 6 hunt camps with an approximate total number of hunters equal to 5% of the Bull Tag Applicants for WMU 60 in the year 2018. Some of these camps/groups apply as a large group but most do not, and as such the ratio of group applicants vs individual applicants may not be consistent with the published number of 49.7% of applicants applied in groups for 2018.
In this case, and as I would expect elsewhere in the province, the percentage of applicants who hunt in a group is much higher then the numbers reflected in the 2018 draw applications. In the camps surrounding us geographically, this has happened for a number of reasons, but mostly because people felt there was no advantage to apply as a group, particularly when in an area without a guaranteed group size and the hunter to tag ratio is higher then the maximum group size of 15.
For arguments sake going forward in this problem and solution comment, I will make my examples using a straight 50/50 ratio of past group to individual applications.
Additionally in WMU 60 for year 2018 there were 1524 applicants for 52 Bull Tags. For simplicity in my examples I will use an approximation of 50 tags and 1500 applicants.
Problem 1: No Preference Given to Groups, Large or Small.
The proposal of no group applications will be a SERIOUS DETRIMENT TO REVENUE.
In our group of 16 for example, the current approximate revenue from licenses is $944 annually. Although we don’t know what the ‘modest fee’ will be for applying under the new proposal, I can tell you that in years that we do not have an adult tag our numbers are usually 6 hunters in the field instead of 16, however in past years we have already spent the entire license fee before the draw.
In talking with our group members and explaining that a calf tag could make you surrender your accumulated points under this new proposal, the overwhelming response was “I just won’t hunt that year” As a result I would expect the number of active hunters to be lower then the previous scenario of 6 because there wouldn’t be any perceived value of 1 calf tag for the group/camp. As a result and using a fictitious amount of $29 as an application fee, the effective revenue for our group would decline by 50% for application fee only.
Our Solution For Problem 1.
Maintain a group application system using the group to individual applicants ratio/percentage of total tags available.
I.E. From 2018 Quota and using a 50/50 ratio of groups to individual applications for
WMU 60, the 50 Bull Tags would be split into 25 for groups and 25 for individuals.
The individual applicants would use their accumulated points as proposed in the new system.
The Groups would be able to consolidate their points to have a running total year to year. Once a set number of points are achieved, a tag is allocated and if claimed to the person inside the group who has gone the longest without a tag, AND all members of the group surrender their points.
Limit tag transfers to one in a lifetime unless death occurs between claiming the tag and the start of the hunt.
USING WMU 60 THIS IS HOW IT WOULD LOOK (using 2018 Quota and applicant numbers)
1500 applicants for 50 BULL TAGS, 50% groups, 50% individuals
1500 divide by 50 tags =30
30 would be the required number of points to be awarded a Bull Tag
Under the new proposal as it is today, an individual would receive a tag once 30 points is accumulated.
The number of points required each year would vary slightly and would be based on the previous year’s applications to tag ratio. (1500 divide by 50 example above)
A group would receive a tag once the required number of points is accumulated.
THIS GROUP APPLICATION DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL as it is the same percentage and points system that is currently being proposed.
It simply allows Groups of any size to pool their points.
It also goes without saying that a group of 16 should have a higher frequency of obtaining a tag then an individual, even if solely based on the revenue difference of 16 fees vs 1 fee.
Problem 2 How Points are Rewarded and Accumulated
Under the new proposal an applicant is to receive 1 point for every year they go without obtaining a tag. They can obtain this point by just applying to the process and only paying the application fee.
This is completely unfair to an applicant who applies, pays the fee, is unsuccessful but ends up buying the full license so they can party hunt, and as such produces more revenue for the system.
Solution for Problem 2
Simply make the application fee equal to ½ the total license fee and have the points match the amount paid.
½ point is awarded if the applicant applies, and an additional ½ point is rewarded if the individual buys the other half of the license so they can party hunt on someone else’s tag.
Problem 3 Cutting Group Size to Max 10 Hunters
Why should it matter what size the group is if the tags are separate for groups and individuals?
The separate allocation for groups vs individuals would satisfy all concerns from individuals about ‘ghost hunters’.
The one transfer per lifetime will effectively remove the Ghost Applications over time.
In a camp like ours, and many others in Southern Ontario, there are routinely more then 10 hunters when an adult tag is in hand. This new restriction would be disqualifying 6 hunters in our group and have an adverse effect on revenue as there would be 6 people not paying the full license fee.
Solution for Problem 3
Make group maximum 16 as most traditional camps have 12-16 beds. Although a large group may have a higher harvest rate because they cover area more effectively, the new restriction on party hunting distance would still limit the group to a very specific area.
Limit tag transfers to one in a lifetime unless death occurs between claiming the tag and the start of the hunt.
If a large group has a history of 75% fill rate on adult tags in the past and only got a tag every three years, it would effectively reduce their rate of success to 25% based on a tag every 3 years.
Leaving the large group size preference will speed up the turnover from the back of the line to front as all hunters in the group would surrender their points.
Problem 4 Number of Years Between Front and Back of the Line
Although listed as problem 4, this is quite likely the most concerning issue of all.
How do you recruit new/first time hunters if the wait time is 30 years to get a tag?
(Using WMU numbers of 1500 bull applicants divided by 50 tags)
This will kill revenues as the current hunters die off or retire from hunting.
Problem 4 Solution
Leave the group application in place allowing accumulated point system.  This provides an opportunity for a new hunter to be part of a group with a tag on a more frequent and reliable basis.
This also affords a group to recruit new members on an ongoing basis, which contributes to the sustainability of an active moose hunt in Ontario.
The group application WILL have a positive impact on long-term revenue.

Re: Comments regarding revision of Moose Draw& Tag Allocation
For the most part I will refer to the numbers for WMU 60 as it is where our hunt camp LUP is located.
In the immediate area surrounding us there are 6 hunt camps with an approximate total number of hunters equal to 5% of the Bull Tag Applicants for WMU 60 in the year 2018. Some of these camps/groups apply as a large group but most do not, and as such the ratio of group applicants vs individual applicants may not be consistent with the published number of 49.7% of applicants applied in groups for 2018.
In this case, and as I would expect elsewhere in the province, the percentage of applicants who hunt in a group is much higher then the numbers reflected in the 2018 draw applications. In the camps surrounding us geographically, this has happened for a number of reasons, but mostly because people felt there was no advantage to apply as a group, particularly when in an area without a guaranteed group size and the hunter to tag ratio is higher then the maximum group size of 15.
For arguments sake going forward in this problem and solution comment, I will make my examples using a straight 50/50 ratio of past group to individual applications.
Additionally in WMU 60 for year 2018 there were 1524 applicants for 52 Bull Tags. For simplicity in my examples I will use an approximation of 50 tags and 1500 applicants.
Problem 1: No Preference Given to Groups, Large or Small.
The proposal of no group applications will be a SERIOUS DETRIMENT TO REVENUE.
In our group of 16 for example, the current approximate revenue from licenses is $944 annually. Although we don’t know what the ‘modest fee’ will be for applying under the new proposal, I can tell you that in years that we do not have an adult tag our numbers are usually 6 hunters in the field instead of 16, however in past years we have already spent the entire license fee before the draw.
In talking with our group members and explaining that a calf tag could make you surrender your accumulated points under this new proposal, the overwhelming response was “I just won’t hunt that year” As a result I would expect the number of active hunters to be lower then the previous scenario of 6 because there wouldn’t be any perceived value of 1 calf tag for the group/camp. As a result and using a fictitious amount of $29 as an application fee, the effective revenue for our group would decline by 50% for application fee only.
Our Solution For Problem 1.
Maintain a group application system using the group to individual applicants ratio/percentage of total tags available.
I.E. From 2018 Quota and using a 50/50 ratio of groups to individual applications for
WMU 60, the 50 Bull Tags would be split into 25 for groups and 25 for individuals.
The individual applicants would use their accumulated points as proposed in the new system.
The Groups would be able to consolidate their points to have a running total year to year. Once a set number of points are achieved, a tag is allocated and if claimed to the person inside the group who has gone the longest without a tag, AND all members of the group surrender their points.
Limit tag transfers to one in a lifetime unless death occurs between claiming the tag and the start of the hunt.

33542,/comment/33542,"The proposed changes are all for the single hunter and not camps. It appears like the Ministry does not want to keep hunting camps, which is a very long standing tradition going. I fully believe that there will be more camps folding, less hunting and possibly more illegal hunting or leaving animals that some hunters have accidentally shot. There will also be a lot more single hunters whom will try and take a large moose by themselves and find out that it is extremely hard to field dress and get the moose out of the bush.  NO single hunter will consume a full moose by themselves, whereas the camp will share amongst their numbers so all have a bit.
Trying to increase the population of the moose and yet when the changes came and added a day to the moose hunt seemed ridiculous.

Logging roads in the North often skirt known moose yards and provide easy access. Roads are often opened up by loggers &'although logging may be finished in some of the areas of the cut, the roads remain open. Removing access to these defunct roads would make it more difficult for over hunting in these areas.
These roads can be used by Metis &'First Nations people to decimate a herd. Roads with restricted motor vehicle access should be applied across the board. Loggers are often not safe doing their jobs, and are frequently asked to assist in the  harvest of moose on their cuts.

33570,/comment/33570,"I think that the creation of a 10 person group limit will negatively affect long established hunt groups. Our hunt camp has been around for 30 years now and over those years has grown to almost 20 owners. A group size limit will force the camp to exclude hunters from the group in years that we only have one tag. This will be unfair to those hunters that have been applying in the draw for the last several years. I think a better solution than group limit; would be a limit on the number of days you can hunt during the moose season. On your licence summary hunters could select the days that they would like to hunt. This would limit the number of successful hunts, as hunters would only be able to hunt for example a seven day period, rather than the entire moose season.

33571,/comment/33571,"Ontario's moose hunters are a diverse group, from a variety of backgrounds and with a range of goals and desires.  I'm 40 years old, and have hunted nearly my entire life.  Many of the complaints from hunters stem from one simple fact, that when something doesn't work in one's favor, it's often easier to blame the system.  I believe our current system while not perfect, does a very good job of fairly distributing moose tags.  I have hunted moose nearly every year for the past 20 years, and have almost always managed to be part of a group who had the opportunity to hunt adult moose.  Often it has meant travelling farther north than I may have liked, but it does give the opportunity to see different parts of the country.  The group allocation system does a great job of presenting data from year to year, in a relatively simple format that allows us as hunters to roll the dice in a way that suits us that year.  The proposed system might work ok in some of the most densely hunted/desired WMU's, but for many it could result in significant disadvantages.  There are years that for a variety of reasons I can't hunt the northern WMU's where tags are easier to get.  The current system is fair to me and I can take a chance and apply in a southern WMU, say 56.  Say I do this for 5 years, and then a year comes up where I can go north to a WMU that is easy to get a tag.  I then would use all of my 'points' on that northern WMU tag, even though they were accumulated in a WMU that was much more difficult, and then used in an 'easy' WMU.  I'd be starting from scratch if I then was going back to WMU 56 in the south.
Honestly, the current system might need some tweaks, but changing it completely will result in a new set of complaints, many of which will be legit.  I think changing the calf harvest to a tag system in all WMU's would make sense and be a great first move.  The group size restrictions and distance restrictions will just frustrate hunters, and should not be implemented.  With limited opportunities already, is there really a need to limited the area and size of groups?
Thanks,
Dave

33573,/comment/33573,"I have reviewed these proposed changes and feel:
1) Hard to administer!
2) Most hunters understand the current group system. Yes, it is not perfect but I consider it fair. Given the reduction of Moose in the province (which I blame the MNR for closing the spring Bear season allowing many of bears to remove the calf population). Our hunt area is infected with Bears and it will take many years for a balance of Moose/Bear ratio again.
3) Spraying where we hunt has been sprayed at least 2 times in last 10 years.  Most noticeably last year signs were put up and said it had been sprayed to kill poplar and unwanted deciduous trees!  Pine seedlings were planted.  The moose sign from 1 year before was decimated.  Another weird thing we visibly noticed was little to no bull scrapes!  One local had said natives were in early season and shot the bulls.  Year before was littered with bull sign.   Stop spraying pesticides and herbicides to kill the food they like to eat.
4)We generally qualify for the large group or guarantee group size each year allowing a group of upward of 10 to be removed from the pool and giving the remainder chances to draw a tag. We are satisfied with 1 adult tag whereas we could draw multiple tags in one year.
5)I feel concern for the Lodge owners of Northern Ontario. They count on us each year. At least with a calf tag we can still hunt. There will be years we will not be going due to the lack of a tag, therefore, jeopardizing our position in this lodge.
6) The current system works.
7)These proposed changes are based on an individual draw and yes you may hunt alone but who can tell me they can handle a Moose alone when it is down, let alone look after this amount of meat.
8) Current system first and fourth week no calf hunting is a problem.  We have only accommodations in first week at a lodge, where our large group spends $1000’s of dollars.  We take a cow let calf walk away, and within 8 hours the Bears are chasing this calf all around.  Wolves only found gut pile and moved in 5-6 days later.  It made me sick to my stomach to watch this, and knowing full well the best thing was to allow the hunter to harvest this calf.
* I recommend that you do not change the draw system.
* Spraying and reducing Bear population is keys to bringing, also monitor native harvests, that they aren’t depleting herd.

I think that the new proposed changes are not effectively in any way  going to help increase the moose population. They sound very complicated and need to have alot of tracking making the margin for errors higher. Let’s look at what works in other provinces and not reinvent the wheel like they say.  Let just remove calf and cow hunting season on  every 2nd years and have people apply for bulls. Keep it Simple!!!!!! But effective!

33585,/comment/33585,"The new refs proposed will destroy the well established groups/hunting party’s designed to spread the available tags in the wmu’s.
Firstly close the season provincially by Nov 15
Adopt the proposed bull and cow/calf and without an automatic calf tag
Keep the guaranteed group size for the wmu’s that have one limited to ten and if applicants do not have the required number then they are placed in the individual draw and proposed point system
No transfer of tags allowed unless under certain circumstances
All tags to be allocated on first choice only
no second choice
Successful tag recipient able to give tag back and such tags allocated on a first come basis later without the application of the point system
An example of the continued group tag consider a allotment of 60 cows and 250 applicants and 20 qualifying groups apply and will receive a seal/tag This will leave 40 tags to be distributed by the point system but it would also remove 200 applicants leaving 50 to be available in the new draw for the remaining 40 tags. - better odds and revenue generated for outfitters and Northern communities

Remove the other parts where hunters do not have the guaranteed number and they are all put into the individual point draw system proposed. An example would be in a wmu that has allocated say 65 cow tags and an annual applicant number of 290 hunters . If 15 groups of 10 - assuming that is the required number to guarantee success - then 150 names would be removed , 15 tags secured leaving 50 cow tags available for 140 individuals— a lot better percentage of getting s tag if the 150 hunters were in and all drawn as indivifuals

33591,/comment/33591,"I believe that limiting the number of people that can hunt on a tag will negatively impact larger long established hunt camps. I camp has been established for 30 years. When it was first established in 1989 in WMU #28, we only had 8 members. Back then,  we had enough hunters to be guarantee ourselves a tag. Over the years we have had to add hunters to be able to continue to guarantee ourselves a moose tag. We now have 20 hunters as part of our hunt camp. Under the proposed changes, if we were to obtain only one tag, only 10 of our members would be able to hunt. The other 10 would not be able to participate in the hunt and as a result, would not come up hunting. Over the last 6 years, since the guarantee to get a tag has disappeared, we have had times when we only had one adult tag, that all of us were able to hunt.
I know that we have also had times in the past that we only had calf tags. Even in those times, we still had a majority of our hunters come for the moose hunt.
I think a couple of better solutions would be to either reduce the length of the season, or to have the tag for a successful hunter only valid for a 7 day period.

Re: Comments regarding revision of Moose Draw& Tag Allocation
For the most part I will refer to the numbers for WMU 60 as it is where our hunt camp LUP is located.
In the immediate area surrounding us there are 6 hunt camps with an approximate total number of hunters equal to 5% of the Bull Tag Applicants for WMU 60 in the year 2018. Some of these camps/groups apply as a large group but most do not, and as such the ratio of group applicants vs individual applicants may not be consistent with the published number of 49.7% of applicants applied in groups for 2018.
In this case, and as I would expect elsewhere in the province, the percentage of applicants who hunt in a group is much higher then the numbers reflected in the 2018 draw applications. In the camps surrounding us geographically, this has happened for a number of reasons, but mostly because people felt there was no advantage to apply as a group, particularly when in an area without a guaranteed group size and the hunter to tag ratio is higher then the maximum group size of 15.
For arguments sake going forward in this problem and solution comment, I will make my examples using a straight 50/50 ratio of past group to individual applications.
Additionally in WMU 60 for year 2018 there were 1524 applicants for 52 Bull Tags. For simplicity in my examples I will use an approximation of 50 tags and 1500 applicants.
Problem 1: No Preference Given to Groups, Large or Small.
The proposal of no group applications will be a SERIOUS DETRIMENT TO REVENUE.
In our group of 16 for example, the current approximate revenue from licenses is $944 annually. Although we don’t know what the ‘modest fee’ will be for applying under the new proposal, I can tell you that in years that we do not have an adult tag our numbers are usually 6 hunters in the field instead of 16, however in past years we have already spent the entire license fee before the draw.
In talking with our group members and explaining that a calf tag could make you surrender your accumulated points under this new proposal, the overwhelming response was “I just won’t hunt that year” As a result I would expect the number of active hunters to be lower then the previous scenario of 6 because there wouldn’t be any perceived value of 1 calf tag for the group/camp. As a result and using a fictitious amount of $29 as an application fee, the effective revenue for our group would decline by 50% for application fee only.
Our Solution For Problem 1.
Maintain a group application system using the group to individual applicants ratio/percentage of total tags available.
I.E. From 2018 Quota and using a 50/50 ratio of groups to individual applications for
WMU 60, the 50 Bull Tags would be split into 25 for groups and 25 for individuals.
The individual applicants would use their accumulated points as proposed in the new system.
The Groups would be able to consolidate their points to have a running total year to year. Once a set number of points are achieved, a tag is allocated and if claimed to the person inside the group who has gone the longest without a tag, AND all members of the group surrender their points.
Limit tag transfers to one in a lifetime unless death occurs between claiming the tag and the start of the hunt.
USING WMU 60 THIS IS HOW IT WOULD LOOK (using 2018 Quota and applicant numbers)
1500 applicants for 50 BULL TAGS, 50% groups, 50% individuals
1500 divide by 50 tags =30
30 would be the required number of points to be awarded a Bull Tag
Under the new proposal as it is today, an individual would receive a tag once 30 points is accumulated.
The number of points required each year would vary slightly and would be based on the previous year’s applications to tag ratio. (1500 divide by 50 example above)
A group would receive a tag once the required number of points is accumulated.
THIS GROUP APPLICATION DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL as it is the same percentage and points system that is currently being proposed.
It simply allows Groups of any size to pool their points.
It also goes without saying that a group of 16 should have a higher frequency of obtaining a tag then an individual, even if solely based on the revenue difference of 16 fees vs 1 fee.
Problem 2 How Points are Rewarded and Accumulated
Under the new proposal an applicant is to receive 1 point for every year they go without obtaining a tag. They can obtain this point by just applying to the process and only paying the application fee.
This is completely unfair to an applicant who applies, pays the fee, is unsuccessful but ends up buying the full license so they can party hunt, and as such produces more revenue for the system.
Solution for Problem 2
Simply make the application fee equal to ½ the total license fee and have the points match the amount paid.
½ point is awarded if the applicant applies, and an additional ½ point is rewarded if the individual buys the other half of the license so they can party hunt on someone else’s tag.
Problem 3 Cutting Group Size to Max 10 Hunters
Why should it matter what size the group is if the tags are separate for groups and individuals?
The separate allocation for groups vs individuals would satisfy all concerns from individuals about ‘ghost hunters’.
The one transfer per lifetime will effectively remove the Ghost Applications over time.
In a camp like ours, and many others in Southern Ontario, there are routinely more then 10 hunters when an adult tag is in hand. This new restriction would be disqualifying 6 hunters in our group and have an adverse effect on revenue as there would be 6 people not paying the full license fee.
Solution for Problem 3
Make group maximum 16 as most traditional camps have 12-16 beds. Although a large group may have a higher harvest rate because they cover area more effectively, the new restriction on party hunting distance would still limit the group to a very specific area.
Limit tag transfers to one in a lifetime unless death occurs between claiming the tag and the start of the hunt.
If a large group has a history of 75% fill rate on adult tags in the past and only got a tag every three years, it would effectively reduce their rate of success to 25% based on a tag every 3 years.
Leaving the large group size preference will speed up the turnover from the back of the line to front as all hunters in the group would surrender their points.
Problem 4 Number of Years Between Front and Back of the Line
Although listed as problem 4, this is quite likely the most concerning issue of all.
How do you recruit new/first time hunters if the wait time is 30 years to get a tag?
(Using WMU numbers of 1500 bull applicants divided by 50 tags)
This will kill revenues as the current hunters die off or retire from hunting.
Problem 4 Solution
Leave the group application in place allowing accumulated point system.  This provides an opportunity for a new hunter to be part of a group with a tag on a more frequent and reliable basis.
This also affords a group to recruit new members on an ongoing basis, which contributes to the sustainability of an active moose hunt in Ontario.
The group application WILL have a positive impact on long-term revenue.

As we have an established hunting group with a camp and 20 plus owners of that camp it would be difficult to choose which 10 hunters are to hunt on that tag.  Also, I feel that it would make it difficult for our younger generations to become involved in these hunts if you are limiting the numbers that can accompany our group on these trips.  Less opportunity means less involvement.  In our case it would make more sense for us to limit the number of days we are allowed to hunt on one tag rather than number of hunters that can hunt on one tag.

I from a northern community I’m 3rd generation butcher..
My grand pa was a butcher, passed on to my uncle and I took the trade part time to learn and have more respect and knowledge about the harvest of different game. I’m a big hunter as well, so I understand the different dynamics... involve with the hunting community.. when it comes down to it, plain and simple, the natives and Métis are ruining everything for everyone. Moose hasn’t even been open yet legally and already 14
Moose has been brought to us  by natives and ask to be butchered. This one individual shoots around 20-30 a year.. this other individual shoots a couple every March, April... that’s the native who chooses to bring the meat to my uncle... and disregards other butchers plus the one who does it themselves.
As a hunter it disgusts me...
I take pride, follow the rules, I been hunting for 10 years for moose, only hunted once for adult moose, I never drew a tag. Our area we hunt.. we talk to loggers and they say natives, Métis are in there in August shooting for the whole community. All those kills.. are undocumented, no paper trail...
No rules whatsoever, only requires the native card. It is sickening.
These are the numbers, the stories I hear from being a hunter and also working in the meat shop business. It is it the story you guys hear making the decision. It is the cold heart truth.
It’s Great to change the rules but EVERYONE has to follow them..
It is not fair, they re the one ruining and we re suffering and paying for it. That traite that was sign in the 1800..
Back then natives didn’t have trucks, quads, guns, ... they had to work and hunt with primitive tools.. now society changed, and they are doing the same with today’s technology. It is an outrage and we re just letting them go by like it’s nothing and meanwhile everyone is suffering.
In the end or the day, it doesn’t matter what system you implement, it will be the same unless that problem gets resolve.

  I like the point system as discussed for those who haven't been successful in the draw to get a sliding preferential chance.
  Mandatory reporting-which is finally coming on now. Harvest or no harvest, but mandatory.
  The government of the day needs to be pressured to allocate monitoring funding using knowledgeable people, using accepted techniques, uniformly across core moose areas. If a regional bio decides to use different #'s, they better be able to justify, not just ""I feel that..."" and change the #'s. I see new bios having issues telling moose tracks from wolf tracks from the air.
  No point in flying the moose surveys if conditions aren't correct-just wasting money guessing on what you're seeing, or bad timing resulting in ""off"" numbers.
  Management planning is a long term effort and government is a short term in position. Real need is required to follow through with the planning, if it is ever to work-any new government of the day needs to have the fortitude to carry on with the current plan until an appropriate timeframe has passed that states a yea or nay on whether that plan has or is working. Changing planning techniques is a huge waste of time and money with no concrete results if it become change for changes sake.

33618,/comment/33618,"All bow hunters should be allowed to hunt calves during all open bow seasons. Calves are extremely hard to hunt and the success rate is extremely low. In my entire hunting career (50+ years) I know of only one calf being taken with a bow and that one was harvested to let the cow go. What data was used to determine that archery hunting for calves negatively impacts the moose population. In the above case it helped the population as a breeding cow was allowed to go.
Calf tags should be available as they are now for gun hunters and the season should be moved to the first 1-2 weeks of the regular gun season. Again calves are hard to hunt and could be harvested with the cow to prevent orphaning and ultimately the demise of the calf. It would also increase hunting opportunities with little impact on the population. What studies were used to determine the impact of the calf harvest on the moose population. When the first changes were made we were told that Sweden had determined that the calf harvest had negligible impact on the population because a lot of those harvested wouldn't have survived to maturity due to predation and other causes.
Surplus tags should not be counted for the point system draw as we were told that accepting one would not effect our pool 1 status.
There should be no bonus points for Northern Residents as all applicants should be treated equal. This would be creating a two tier system that would be unfair for residents of Southern Ontario who would be required to pay the same for a hunting license with less opportunity of being successful.
Reducing the distance groups can hunt in from 5 km to 3 km would be extremely dangerous resulting in people getting shot. In hunter safety courses we were told a rifle is considered dangerous up to 1 mile (1.61 km). A 3 km area would reduce separation to 300 metres for a party of 10 hunters. Add to that groups that over lap and it becomes even more dangerous. The distance groups should be allowed to hunt in should be at least 10 km.
People should not be allowed to participate in both the Native and Non Native hunt. They should allowed to hunt in only one season of their choice. Currently it makes policing and proper resource management impossible.

The entire ecosystem is connected.  Reducing moose population will affect wolf populations as they’ll have less prey to feed on.  They’ll have to hunt more of other animals or will starve.  If wolves starve then the populations of their other prey animals are out of flux.
Recreational hunting is not a scientific nor intelligent way to manage wildlife populations.  Managing human activity, e.g. by increasing restrictions on hunting and enforcing penalties on illegal hunting activities, is more logical.

 Also remove calf tags altogether. Fig out how many cow tags you can up in each wmu and call them a anterless tag. This will eliminate mistaken shot cows. I feel that the number of cows shot by mistake is high and a waste. Also as many camps have grown in size to try and up our odds with the old system. Now if we get a tag we have to decide who can hunt that bull? Not a great idea. If a group of more then ten are happy hunting one bull and all pay there way. They should be allowed.

33623,/comment/33623,"I understand that the main problem with the population crash is ,Over harvest by hunters,/Black bear populations are high. ,thus calf loss is high. / Long seasons in some area during snowfall and easier to harvest at the time during snowfall..Wolf populations are high in some areas . So each problem should be addressed in separate manners.. First  would be human harvest. One would be quite harsh and that would be an alternating moratorium on hunting moose. One example would be complete ban on hunting moose every other year. Second could be certain Hunting zones could be banned alternating bans every other year.Or maybe no calf harvest or cows for lets say 5 years in highly hunted areas or easily hunted areas with many roads? Changing the length of the season eliminating hunting during the latter part of November and all of December because of snow fall and easy to hunt moose in snow? Moving on to the bear predation. You could give moose hunters who are successful in getting an adult tag a free bear tag with their moose licence giving them an way to hunt another species and bringing down the bear population? Also for spring bear hunters 2 bear tags on one licence.That would spark the interest in more hunters hunting in the spring. Finally allow hunters to hunt wolves during the moose and deer hunting seasons as well as during the late winter everywhere.  As for the allocating of tags  such as draws That would be maybe everyone has the same chance in draws everyone pays a minimal price to get in the draw. Every year everyone starts at the same place in the draw. Another would be that if you want to hunt moose you can only have two hunting zones you can apply each year. Lets say if you are successful you will not be able to hunt for 3 years. If there is party hunting then if the party is successful   all of them can`t apply for 3 years or what ever is decided on how many years. My ideas are all based on bringing the moose population higher. Is that not what the goal is? You can make the draw system different but if you don't  bring down the number of hunters in all aspects of hunting times  ,or how many in a party . The decision of harvest should not be a blame game. It all comes down to sacrifice and that means Less hunting and harder to harvest at certain times. If there was more educating hunters on how bad the population is and how every moose hunter has to sacrifice I think there may be more supportive. Maybe a pamphlet sent out to all hunters that our moose population is in trouble? Springing on  regulations with no education is troubling to hunters and can sour them as well.  We all need to know more  and a pamphlet can be worth a thousand moose?

This system is fair to everyone, it eliminates hunting female moose to allow population a chance to grow.  Simple to manage and implement.  It works so why would you create another system that will not allow populations to grow and eliminate hunters from hunting in Ontario.

A solution would be to allow a hunter to be part of 3 groups but either separate seasons(archery/gun) or separate WMU,hunters would still be allowed more than one party.
There are groups that have a large pool (20 plus) of ghost hunters that can be used and if they are allowed to party hunt under present proposal without restrictions it would likely not change their present hunting practices thus rendering the proposal inadequate in this area.The proposal would only address hunters that have not been successful in several years.

If I'm reading it correctly, if on the first day, those people party hunting on one tag, they shoot a moose, they cannot hunt anymore even if our group of guys in camp has let's say one or two more tags. This rule would not bare well for people taking a week of holidays to come up to camp to be there for an hour on opening day, would be harmful to our finances as well as our survival of a hunting camp. This 10 people to a tag just isn't going to work for a party hunt..

3. No hunter should be able to posses more than 1 hunting seal your either hunting moose, deer or birds not all  3 at the same time.

Do more to eliminate the high number of predators for a least 5 years.
Start the season later and end earlier for a period of 5 years.
Do not get rid of the group hunt. This is the best way to plan ahead.
Do not allow a cow with a calf to be taken. (Dry cows only)
Eliminate a least 30 to 50 percent of the cows tags that are available now through the draw system.
There is nothing wrong with the draw system that is in place now as it allows a lot of hunters to participate, the problem is the individual hunters, they need to figure out the group system and get involved.

33649,/comment/33649,"In regards to the moose tag changes. I believe this is unfair to all hunters at this time and lost revenue to the government. Before proposing these changes you should try other tactics to increase the moose population such as controlling the bear and coyote/wolf population thru increased hunting opportunities to control there growth. I know the seasons for the above species has been increased in certain areas to help stop moose predation lets give this a chance for a number of years to see if the moose population increases, and keep the moose seasons as they are while this is going on. This will keep all the moose hunters happy.
Step up enforcement to stop poachers and illegal hunting out of season by the natives who use drones and other aircraft to locate and slaughter moose in/out of season. It is common knowledge that certain native individuals do this with out fear of any of punishment from the authorities. Just think how the moose populations would increase if they respected the current laws the law abiding hunters follow.
Have you thought about increasing the group size to more than 15 for a tag guarantee ? We have a camp that holds 20 individuals and if we get 1adult tag the camp is happy. Hunting is not about the killing of an animal it is about spending time together with family and friends. Enjoying the great outdoors and having the potential to harvest an animal legally. Our Camp as well as others do not harvest calves as this is the future stock to increase the moose populations.
By restricting a group to 10 hunters you are denying any hunter above that number the opportunity to carry on a group/camp tradition that they have been doing for the last 1to 50 + yrs for some camps.
I know there will be a decline in moose hunting licence revenue and hunter numbers with the changes that are proposed along with any tax revenue loss from hunters not buying any hunting related items and services etc.

33659,/comment/33659,"I am not in favour of reducing the allowable distance from 3 k's to 5 k's. Our group of 6 to 8 people utilize a radio check in to make sure we can all commuincate effectively. In many areas the terrain is the determining factor.  Is it 3 k from the tag holder in a radius , thus the outside two hunters are 6k's apart. Doesn't seem rationale,  everyone would need a GPS locator, what if my preferred spot is 3.1 k's ? Our hunt last year was limited to stay with the tag holder.
I don't understand how a Northern preference of 2 points per year back to 1992 is not cumulative. Or are you saying northern ontario hunters will get a preference until they have all used up their points and be equal with all other hunters.  We are 14 hours from 21A, northern hunters have an extreme advantage over their southern folk.  Northern hunters have local knowledge, can scout mulitiple times per year . They have many contacts in the logging industry, an extreme advantage  over the rest of the hunters.
I am completely confused why calf hunting is acceptable with such a vulnerable population.  I am not travelling  1200 k's to harvest a calf from it's mother.   I have hunted with two groups, none have shot a calf.
We need to reinstate the spring bear hunt. The province has lots of bears, they are diligent predators in the spring of deer and moose calves.  There aren't enough bear hunters to substantially reduce the population, however it will  limit some of the spring kills ,has to help the population.  Wolf tags out!

33671,/comment/33671,"Proposed for 2020
New bow season and quotas
•	Creating a new bow season with a separate tag allocation in WMU’s 46, 47, 49, 50 ….61, 62 , 63
I am not opposed to this proposal. However the biggest complaint in most of these WMU’s including the one I hunt in (WMU 61) is the lack of adult tags. The current 4-5% success rate for getting an adult tag has frustrated many hunters. The perception that fewer tags will be available to gun hunters due to a separate allocation for the bow hunters will not please many hunters. The intent is to create new hunting opportunities. This may happen, however I suspect most hunters taking advantage of the bow season will be hunters who currently hunt in the gun season.
Proposed for 2021
New selective harvest approach
•	I am ok with the proposed new selective harvest approach. Population monitoring and reporting will be critical. The intent is to put in place tools that will allow populations to increase. It will be extremely important to have the data to show that the new system will bring positive results.
•	I am fine with an application fee to apply for a tag and not require the purchase of a tag to apply
•	I am fine with the proposed point based system to be eligible to purchase tags.
•	I am fine with eliminating the group applications and the northern resident draw
•	The point system will take a few years to get sorted out as hunters reach the desired number of points and forfeit points back to zero.
•	I am fine with moose tags being sold separately and hunters being able to buy a moose license and not a tag.
The new proposed system is quite complex. It will require a great deal of explaining.
•	I am very much opposed to reducing the distance party members can be from a tag holder from 5 km to 3 kms. 3 kms is not very far, especially on Crown land where hunters are using a network of access roads and trails after a forest harvest. I don’t really see how this is going to reduce harvest, but it will increase the potential for violations. You will get into the bizarre scenario of CO’s running around with GPS units trying to catch hunters beyond the 3 kms. Currently most charges are the result of hunters trying to be honest and cooperative not realizing they will be charged and certainly not realizing the exorbitant fines for conviction. My sense is this proposal will encourage hunters to be dishonest. The reality is that the kill site is known, but the location of the tag holder is not known unless the hunter willingly offers that information. There is no on-the-ground evidence of where they are standing. All groups have good communications so this proposal will force hunters to ensure the tag holder contacts the shooter and then reports they are well within the 3 kms. I see no benefit to this proposal and lots of problems with it.
•	I am also against reducing party size. It is my understanding this is more of a social issue than a sustainability issue. It is also an issue the MNRF inadvertently created with the guaranteed group size to qualify for tags. In the south where we hunt we have a number of blue collar workers who have limited vacation time or are self-employed. The camp is less than an hour from Belleville, Trenton and Bancroft. Hunters are coming and going all the time and it is hard to know how many you will have on a given day. Also, hunters if they are smart, will take stock of their numbers and if over the 10 hunters they will designate some hunters to be in a separate group, ensuring they have a tag. There is nothing preventing them from hunting in the same area. I guess this could be eliminated if the they have to have a list but this can get restrictive and could limit opportunities for some hunters. I see no need for this proposal and I see no benefit. If there are social issues, then deal with that as a separate issue.
As mentioned the new system needs a huge communications effort. If it is perceived as too complicated by hunters there will be negative feedback and you may lose more hunters.
Although this is not part of the proposed changes, I strongly urge the MNRF to go back to the Monday opening for the moose season in central Ontario. It would eliminate the need for hunters to take the Friday off previous to the Saturday opening to get to the camp. It would also reduce conflict. The current Saturday opening in central Ontario creates conflicts and safety concerns with other users of Crown land during mid-October when the weather is perfect for recreating. We’ve been encountering large groups of ATV’ers on the trails and access roads on the opening weekend. This creates an unnecessary safety concern not to mention the added disturbance in the forest.  Going back to the Monday would also eliminate back to back moose and deer seasons for 4 out of 7 years. The Saturday opening was intended to coincide with the opening of the calf season in the north. That rationale was always very weak as it was always unlikely hunters in the south were going to flock to the north to hunt calves. However, with the above proposed changes introducing a calf/cow and calf tag system as proposed would totally eliminate the need for the current 4th Saturday opening.

To that end, your proposals to limit party hunting size and remove the right of a resident’s immediate family members to hunt are welcome measures to ensure a responsible and sustainable hunt.
However, your proposal to ease restrictions on wolf and coyote hunting is based on flawed beliefs. There is no scientific evidence that wolf and coyote predation are driving moose decline. In fact, they have been co-existing in a predator-prey dynamic for thousands of years.
Easing regulations around wolf and coyote hunting, including through the elimination of reporting requirements and special game seals, and extending the coyote hunting season to virtually year-round, is irresponsible. We should be strengthening reporting requirements and enforcement, and looking for ways to support healthy ecosystems and all of the species that depend on them.

33674,/comment/33674,"Hello, I have participated in the survey and read the proposal that the BGMAC has put forward. While I am very much in agreement that there needs to be changes I have one main concern.
I reside south of the French/Mattawa rivers and have been hunting moose for the first week of the rifle season the last 17 years in the north west corner of our province. Since the inception of northern Ontario residents having an advantage in the draw over southern residents, it has been a thorn in my side. After having read in the proposal that northern Ontario residents will still be granted an advantage with an additional point being afforded to them over southerners I was infuriated!
I would like to know the justification for this. Under the recommendations section of the Moose Management Review there is a heading titled ""Making tag allocation simpler and fairer"", while it does make it much simpler, it does certainly not make it fairer. In fact I predict it will tip the scales even further than the 5% they are currently exclusive to. How is a hunter that resides in a certain part of our province more deserving of an opportunity to harvest an adult moose over another? We are all contributing members to the economy of this province and as residents we should all have an equal share in the natural resources within it's borders. I have been wracking my brain for a long while as to how someone could justify this. Are you assuming I am hunting strictly for sport and do not need the sustenance? (False) Or is it a person who resides in the northern portion of Ontario have more right to the natural resources within our province as a whole?
In every other division of society we have made great leaps toward equality in the past 17 years. Why is it that the MNRF and BGMAC have gone backwards and chosen to support division within our beautiful province and advantage one geographical area over another.

33681,/comment/33681,"It has come to my attention that the of Ontario Government  proposing to open hunting of wolves and coyotes across the north to address the declining moose populations. Scientists already agree that this strategy does not work and the evidence you’re using doesn’t add up. The proposed changes are lacking in any scientific justification or evidence. There are no population management targets and no rationale for the proposed bag limits. Coyotes don’t consume moose in significant numbers to begin with. Changes to hunting rules and practices have arguably had the greatest impact on moose populations.
Wolves and coyotes play an important role in nature. Wolves, coyotes and moose have lived together in a complex predator-prey relationship for thousands of years. This relationship naturally regulates itself, benefiting each species and the ecosystems they rely on.
We the Residents and tax payers in Ontario expect wildlife policy and management to be based on science and not the senseless slaughter of wolves and coyotes because someone doesn’t understand how these relationships of nature are related.
I think it is time for the government to wake up and look at their own science and knowledge learned in the past.  May be the policy makers need to read the Ontario’s own web sites for sound science that make sense and instead of KILLING more creatures.

As a First Nation member I already practice hunting only mature moose and not calves, and my community already has regulated the total moose harvested every year for all our community members.

33685,/comment/33685,"I have hunted moose my entire life, most consistently in the last 20 years with a group of 12 - 15 guys.  Many in my group are also life-long hunters and collectively, we have gathered a great deal of knowledge.  It is my opinion that the new regulations to limit groups to 10 people will have two unwanted consequences:
1/	If a camp of 14 people has 1 tag, what happens to the 4 hunters who have been part of a gang for years?   Will they be forced to stay home?  Will this lead to them possibly quitting, especially if they aren't able to hunt for an extended time?  How will this encourage future generations?   Your proposal to cap the number of tags/parties an individual hunter can be identified with at three different groups. ...... The new 3km proximity rule can easily make for a very dangerous hunt.  In our experience, there are very few hunt camps in a 3 km (new) proximity to each other to allow a hunter without a tag to be identified with 3 other hunting parties.  This could have very serious, unintended consequences for the Ministry.
My proposal is to leave the group size rules as they have existed in previous years however, every hunter in the group must be identified with the tag(s) the group receives.  My opinion is most seasoned groups would not keep additional tags when they know that a member who declined will be offered another tag based on the new points system the following year.  Doing this gives hunters a greater chance of being able to keep hunting every year with a tag, thereby encouraging future generations.  The trade-off would be to allow the group to pick a specified 7 day window.  This 7 day cap would help the Ministry keep the moose harvest numbers in accordance with new guidelines while accomplishing the goal of a fairer tag system.
Lastly your rational of ""No limits on party size or who is in a party under the current rules makes it challenging to prevent illegal activities like “tag shopping”  and tag filling.  It is my opinion that hunters who participate in illegal activities will not stop no matter what rules are in place.  Has the Ministry considered simply recording all hunter names of the group on the tag?  This step alone would make “tag shopping” or “tag filling” much more difficult.   Lastly it is no secret how some indigenous people think and act towards moose hunting.  If there old traditions dictate harvesting a moose for their own use, ok.  But when moose are slaughtered in big numbers only to sell the meat then something has to be done!!!.
There have been great friendships made in our camp and we hope to hunt together as long as we are able.  It is my hope that you will consider all feedback from experienced hunters as you continue to look at updating future regulations.  We have important knowledge to assist the Ministry in achieving its goals while keeping existing hunters and future generations interested in the vital role of conservation for years to come.

33694,/comment/33694,"I have the following comments to make on the proposed changes for the Moose draw. First of all I would like to commend the ministry and BGMAC committee for all their work on this proposal. I support the principle of the proposal with the following comments.
I support the proposed changes for 2020. Especially the inclusion of a bows only season for WMU's 46,47,49,50,53,54,56,58,59,60,61,62,and 63. However I disagree with the starting date of the first Saturday in October. In those southern WMU's a vast majority of the hunters hunt from established camps and in the past it was convenient to have the season start on a Monday. This allowed hunters to move into the camp on the weekend before the season started and not have to take extra days off work. I would like to see both the new bow seasons and the gun seasons move  in the southern WMU's to a Monday opening. I suggest the last Monday in September for the bow season and the 3rd Monday in October for the gun season. This also eliminates the issue of the gun season for moose ending 2 days before the deer season starts  ( as it does with the current start date every 4 years).
I support the proposed selective harvest approach and the preference point system. However I have  the following concerns.
There is no mention of how the proposal would treat the apprentice hunters. At this time they are not able to enter draws. However they are able to purchase a moose licence  with a calf tag. Under the proposed system if the apprentice's mentor does not have a tag they will not be able to hunt. This could restrict their their hunting opportunities. I feel that apprentice hunters should be able to enter the 2nd chance random draw for a calf tag. These will basically be surplus tags. This would also allow them to gain points for when they are able to enter the primary draw.
There is limited information on the fee structure in the proposal. I feel that the application fee should not be more than $15. Since there is a chance that many hunters / groups will not receive tags and therefore not able to hunt that year, the fee for applying in the draw should be minimal . As well calf tags should not be excessively priced  ( more than $20) since there are many hunters who hunt as individuals or groups of two. Those people would find that the purchase of a tag  every year or every two years would result in the cost of hunting on a yearly basis costing much more than it does the existing system. I would suggest that all tags that are allocated in the 2nd chance draw second and third choice ( the random draw) be of no charge.
I oppose the restriction of the party hunting rules. Although it is suggested that it may reduce fill rates there is nothing to validate that statement.  With the proposed draw system,  you are promoting hunters to hunt in groups through the draw process and then restricting them from party hunting. There can not be a restriction on party hunting size if you are promoting large groups through the draw. Also, reducing the distance for party hunting makes no sense. The emphasis for party hunting must be based on communication of the hunting party and not distance. A ban on the use of cell phones and radios with a range of more than 5 km would make more sense and would be easier to enforce.
The allocation process for issuing the tags is not stated in the proposal. There are at least two ways the tags can be allocated. The first option would be to sort all the applicants in each WMU by their preference number and then allocate the tags to based on the  first choice , then second choice, and finally the 3rd choice ( if there are tags left). The second option would be to sort applicants by the tag choice ( bull, cow/calf, and calf only) and then allocate the tags to the highest preference numbers. There are pros and cons to both options,but I feel the most important thing is to make sure that it is clearly communicated  to the applicants how the tags are allocated.

33696,/comment/33696,"Moose Hunting is not like duck hunting! there is hours and years of preparation land scoping and hunting involved before you can determine on how and where to hunt a moose.
Not many Ontarian's live near an area where there is moose which means we spend years in the bush looking for them. We all know people that have hunted for 30 and 40 years with the point system that already exists and have not even seen a moose.
The proposed system is only going to increase the moose population because no one will harvest a moose when they finally get a tag. After 3 years or more of not having a tag or hunting moose where do you hunt in the WMU you received a tag? when do you hunt? public land? access?......
So know I would have to spend time and money to find an area in the off season where i can camp that is near or in moose country that is not overpopulated with other hunters. When i already have a camp/ property in another WMU that i cannot get a tag in.???
The ""stand in line approach"" will only create allot of frustrated hunters without ever harvesting a moose.
Why would you allow someone to apply to the northern areas who have no intention of hunting there? to grab a bonus point? that makes absolutely no sense. you need to apply to the area you intend to hunt and not encroach on other WMU's that hunters already have camps set up on that will sit empty because no one can get a tag.
Do not allow allow anyone that does not have a tag to hunt moose! your ""product"" is promoting illegal activity, people will hunt moose and do 1 of 2 things, 1. poach it and hope they don't get caught and ask their entire group to put themselves at risk. 2 shoot the animal then go to different camps that have a tag and sell it or give it away.
Changing the fee's for bull or cow is a money grab, the chances of getting a bull moose is slim to none if you don't get to hunt legally until you get a tag. keep non tag holders out of the bush.
Hunters cost the taxpayers nothing at all why do you propose more funds are required? Public display of funds would be vital showing a negative, we all would be happy to pay what is fair. ""modest application fee"" is an absolute bait and switch. what is the fee? how could you want to lay out this plan without knowing? why ask us hunters to comment on vague or inaccurate statements?
What is wrong with the current system and why does it have to change?
Why does the hunter get punished or have to stand in line? If you have property in the WMU you are applying you should have first pick or ""pool A"" if you don't live there too bad.
Hunting is not a rite in Ontario because you got a hunting license without any means of hunting. Apply as a group and keep things Legal. Fair is in Football or Soccer not hunting because you bought a license. Keep in mind the property owner who pays tax on the land that will have it either sit empty until he has a tag or people trespassing and shooting game on his property.
It costs my group of 5 to go moose hunting over $5,000 per year to get to and maintain camp. We hunt Bear moose and Dear and are always building and improving on the land and accommodations.
Keep it the same, police the poachers or make a deal with the Native communities that take hundreds of moose per year illegally. Provide them pigs and cattle to eat paid by the taxpayers of Canada instead of just providing funds that are not being used to feed and cloth them. This will increase the moose population 10 fold in 3 years and at that time you can offer more to hunters which will create much more revenue for the government. Stop the hundreds of moose being poached and watch the tag numbers increase which will help everyone.
Feed the poachers! equals increased moose populations which means more for everyone.
Stop spending money on useless changes!

They would be required to purchase a 'non-resident' license, but not permitted to enter the draw. I believe Calf tags should be restricted to one WMU that is applied for. I do NOT support Calf tag quotas. I believe two or three licenses be attached to one animal, therefore reducing the potential harvest by 50% or 66%. I support the Preference Point System - One point per year of applying since the last successful tag award.

Sustainable adult tag allocation CAN NOT be obtained with the continued harvesting of calf moose, given the already strained population numbers in Ontario.

 I am not in favour of reducing the distance members of the same hunting group can be 3km. i would appreciate if it remained 5 kilometers.
I support non-residents of Ontario be allowed to hunt with immediate relatives. I recognize they would be required to purchase a 'non-resident' license, but would not be allowed to enter the draws. I would like to see some WMUs (like 47) opened up to allow non resident family to be allowed to come to this presently closed WMU to hunt big game once more with their families. Ontario may be Open For Business, but it is a bit late now that our children have had to seek employment in other provinces. I would like them to rejoin us at hunt camp.
I do not support Calf tag quotas. I believe multiple licenses should be attached to one animal, therefore reducing the potential harvest.
I support the Preference Point System - One point per year of applying since the last successful tag award. I do not support a Fee Structure for Moose where Bulls, Cows, and Calves would all be different pricing, with Bulls and Cows being the preferred choice. I would prefer a moratorium on Cow tags until populations are stable.
What I understand from my reading, to hunt moose, you need an outdoors card. The outdoors card plus a small allocation fee allows you to enter the moose tag draw, without first buying the ""moose licence"" for non existent product (a moose).
 If chosen in the points allocation draw, then that individual buys a moose licence, and also pays an additional fee to harvest (if available) either a bull or cow or calf  and receive  their tag.
Next you have the opportunity to have up to 9 other unsuccessful or novice hunters join you to create a hunting party, and these nine do not have a tag; they may have paid an allocation fee to be in the draw, but they may not even have done that. The nine hunters are able to join the successful tag holder, purchasing their moose licence even after the draw. Swarms of tag-less low point hunters will be attracted to a known tag holder like moths to a porch light. The hunt camp hierarchy of who gets in, who in camp has the the best shot at next season for getting a tag, and even recruiting outside camp to bring in a high point sure thing hunter. Some camps will be shuttered for the moose season, without a tag and a 10 hunter party size limit. Many moose hunting licences,  these which offer no moose as game whats-so- ever will go un-purchased, i predict. Revenues will go down, hunting pressure will abate, and hopefully the Moose population will rise, at the cost $ to the OMNR from hunter resignation.

You need to increase the bear harvesting opportunities, to reduce their population, and predication on the calves born.
I would have liked to seen multiple licenses being attached to a harvested moose, up to 4, per adult animal.
I would have liked to see something like the Quebec model, where the adult animal harvest is rotational, and there is no draw system. This would reduce administrative costs and fees, allowing more funds for CO's, for enforcement in the field.

I am writing in response to the proposed changes to moose management and wolf and coyote hunting regulations in Northern Ontario (ERO 019-0405 and ERO 019-0406). Please consider this my written submission to the public review.
I appreciate your government’s undertaking of a review to better support the province’s moose population. They are under threat, and without serious action from your government and others across the country, the continued existence of this national icon is at risk.
To that end, your proposals to limit party hunting size and remove the right of a resident’s immediate family members to hunt are welcome measures to ensure a responsible and sustainable hunt.
However, your proposal to ease restrictions on wolf and coyote hunting is based on flawed beliefs. There is no scientific evidence that wolf and coyote predation are driving moose decline. In fact, they have been co-existing in a predator-prey dynamic for thousands of years.
Easing regulations around wolf and coyote hunting, including through the elimination of reporting requirements and special game seals, and extending the coyote hunting season to virtually year-round, is irresponsible. We should be strengthening reporting requirements and enforcement, and looking for ways to support healthy ecosystems and all of the species that depend on them.
In 2016, the previous government recognized the shortcomings of similar proposals to penalize moose predators without scientific backing. Thousands of Ontarians spoke up then — and we’re speaking up again.
Please listen to us. Listen to the science. Help protect the biodiversity that has made Ontario so special for generations past, and with your action, generations to come.

33717,/comment/33717,"First of all the concept of "" hunt but not harvest"" just means more people in the bush with guns.  We hunt in areas 2,3,4 and 5 and there are way too many people hunting there as it is, most from Southern Ontario. And the giant groups just infiltrate and take over a whole area and feel entitled to the whole area, with guns in their hands!
Second the paper tags are not a good idea, as you will find out quickly enough.
You say there will be no more group allocations.  Maybe consider eliminating the giant groups and let those of us that like to hunt with four or less submit as a group.
The concept of license but no tag is interesting.  Especially with the option to forego a tag one year while not losing points. And the option to be in the random draw after having a tag the previous year.  I know some folks who have applied and not received a tag for over a decade.  Hopefully the points will be retroactive.
And perhaps you could start to make an email list of interested hunters who would like to be kept informed of with proposed changes to the hunting regs or do a better job of making the public information meetings better advertised and for sure to be held in Kenora as one of your stops.

33723,/comment/33723,"I have reviewed these proposed changes and feel:
1) There are too many moving parts to properly administer!
2) Most hunters understand the current group system. Yes, it is not perfect but I consider it fair. Given the reduction of Moose in the province (which I blame the MNR for closing the Bear season allowing many of bears to remove the calf population). Our hunt area is infected with Bears and it will take many years for a balance of Moose/Bear ratio again.
3) We generally qualify for the large group or guarantee group size each year allowing a group of upward of 10 to be removed from the pool and giving the remainder chances to draw a tag. We are satisfied with 1 adult tag whereas we could draw multiple tags in one year.
4) I feel concern for the Lodge owners of Northern Ontario. They count on us each year. At least with a calf tag we can still hunt. There will be years we will not be going due to the lack of a tag, therefore, jeopardizing our position in this lodge.
5) On social media there has been lots of opertunity for hunters whom have not drawn this year to join groups, whom have drawn a tag. This proves the current system works.
6) These proposed changes are based on an individual draw and yes you may hunt alone but who can tell me they can handle a Moose alone when it is down, let alone look after this amount of meat.
I recommend that you do not change the draw system and if you do:
* Leave the Guarantee group size and Large group size also, then with the remaining tags assign them to the draw members with this highest years without receiving a tag.
* Move the calf season around - 1 year weeks 1 -2 then next year weeks 2 -3, etc. This will allow groups with set holidays and Lodge owners whom have a set clientele each year to have the groups to participate more widely.
In the end - I believe the current system is not broke - just tweak it a little!!!!

To: Whom it May Concern, MNRF Moose Policy Committee
Re: Comments regarding revision of Moose Draw& Tag Allocation
For the most part I will refer to the numbers for WMU 60 as it is where our hunt camp LUP is located.
In the immediate area surrounding us there are 6 hunt camps with an approximate total number of hunters equal to 5% of the Bull Tag Applicants for WMU 60 in the year 2018. Some of these camps/groups apply as a large group but most do not, and as such the ratio of group applicants vs individual applicants may not be consistent with the published number of 49.7% of applicants applied in groups for 2018.
In this case, and as I would expect elsewhere in the province, the percentage of applicants who hunt in a group is much higher then the numbers reflected in the 2018 draw applications. In the camps surrounding us geographically, this has happened for a number of reasons, but mostly because people felt there was no advantage to apply as a group, particularly when in an area without a guaranteed group size and the hunter to tag ratio is higher then the maximum group size of 15.
For arguments sake going forward in this problem and solution comment, I will make my examples using a straight 50/50 ratio of past group to individual applications.
Additionally in WMU 60 for year 2018 there were 1524 applicants for 52 Bull Tags. For simplicity in my examples I will use an approximation of 50 tags and 1500 applicants.
Problem 1: No Preference Given to Groups, Large or Small.
The proposal of no group applications will be a SERIOUS DETRIMENT TO REVENUE.
In our group of 16 for example, the current approximate revenue from licenses is $944 annually. Although we don’t know what the ‘modest fee’ will be for applying under the new proposal, I can tell you that in years that we do not have an adult tag our numbers are usually 6 hunters in the field instead of 16, however in past years we have already spent the entire license fee before the draw.
In talking with our group members and explaining that a calf tag could make you surrender your accumulated points under this new proposal, the overwhelming response was “I just won’t hunt that year” As a result I would expect the number of active hunters to be lower then the previous scenario of 6 because there wouldn’t be any perceived value of 1 calf tag for the group/camp. As a result and using a fictitious amount of $29 as an application fee, the effective revenue for our group would decline by 50% for application fee only.
Our Solution For Problem 1.
Maintain a group application system using the group to individual applicants ratio/percentage of total tags available.
I.E. From 2018 Quota and using a 50/50 ratio of groups to individual applications for
WMU 60, the 50 Bull Tags would be split into 25 for groups and 25 for individuals.
The individual applicants would use their accumulated points as proposed in the new system.
The Groups would be able to consolidate their points to have a running total year to year. Once a set number of points are achieved, a tag is allocated and if claimed to the person inside the group who has gone the longest without a tag, AND all members of the group surrender their points.
Limit tag transfers to one in a lifetime unless death occurs between claiming the tag and the start of the hunt.
USING WMU 60 THIS IS HOW IT WOULD LOOK (using 2018 Quota and applicant numbers)
1500 applicants for 50 BULL TAGS, 50% groups, 50% individuals
1500 divide by 50 tags =30
30 would be the required number of points to be awarded a Bull Tag
Under the new proposal as it is today, an individual would receive a tag once 30 points is accumulated.
The number of points required each year would vary slightly and would be based on the previous year’s applications to tag ratio. (1500 divide by 50 example above)
A group would receive a tag once the required number of points is accumulated.
THIS GROUP APPLICATION DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL as it is the same percentage and points system that is currently being proposed.
It simply allows Groups of any size to pool their points.
It also goes without saying that a group of 16 should have a higher frequency of obtaining a tag then an individual, even if solely based on the revenue difference of 16 fees vs 1 fee.
Problem 2 How Points are Rewarded and Accumulated
Under the new proposal an applicant is to receive 1 point for every year they go without obtaining a tag. They can obtain this point by just applying to the process and only paying the application fee.
This is completely unfair to an applicant who applies, pays the fee, is unsuccessful but ends up buying the full license so they can party hunt, and as such produces more revenue for the system.
Solution for Problem 2
Simply make the application fee equal to ½ the total license fee and have the points match the amount paid.
½ point is awarded if the applicant applies, and an additional ½ point is rewarded if the individual buys the other half of the license so they can party hunt on someone else’s tag.
Problem 3 Cutting Group Size to Max 10 Hunters
Why should it matter what size the group is if the tags are separate for groups and individuals?
The separate allocation for groups vs individuals would satisfy all concerns from individuals about ‘ghost hunters’.
The one transfer per lifetime will effectively remove the Ghost Applications over time.
In a camp like ours, and many others in Southern Ontario, there are routinely more then 10 hunters when an adult tag is in hand. This new restriction would be disqualifying 6 hunters in our group and have an adverse effect on revenue as there would be 6 people not paying the full license fee.
Solution for Problem 3
Make group maximum 16 as most traditional camps have 12-16 beds. Although a large group may have a higher harvest rate because they cover area more effectively, the new restriction on party hunting distance would still limit the group to a very specific area.
Limit tag transfers to one in a lifetime unless death occurs between claiming the tag and the start of the hunt.
If a large group has a history of 75% fill rate on adult tags in the past and only got a tag every three years, it would effectively reduce their rate of success to 25% based on a tag every 3 years.
Leaving the large group size preference will speed up the turnover from the back of the line to front as all hunters in the group would surrender their points.
Problem 4 Number of Years Between Front and Back of the Line
Although listed as problem 4, this is quite likely the most concerning issue of all.
How do you recruit new/first time hunters if the wait time is 30 years to get a tag?
(Using WMU numbers of 1500 bull applicants divided by 50 tags)
This will kill revenues as the current hunters die off or retire from hunting.
Problem 4 Solution
Leave the group application in place allowing accumulated point system.  This provides an opportunity for a new hunter to be part of a group with a tag on a more frequent and reliable basis.
This also affords a group to recruit new members on an ongoing basis, which contributes to the sustainability of an active moose hunt in Ontario.
The group application WILL have a positive impact on long-term revenue.

The Green Bush Hunt Club is a proud member of the Ontario Federation of Anglers & Hunters and has been promoting sportsmanship and conservation in the Parry Sound area for over 90 years.
The Green Bush Hunt Club would like to submit our comments regarding the current moose review.
We realize that a number of information sessions were held; however it is unfortunate that the assumption was that no moose hunters live in Toronto. All reviews were considerable distance away.
General Comments
No integration with aboriginal harvest. The review and ultimate changes are insignificant if the aboriginal harvest not included.
Tourist outfitter integration. Tourist outfitters should not be guaranteed tags at the expense of other hunters. Paying an outfitter a few thousand dollars shouldn’t give an unfair advantage to tourist hunters. Perhaps some money collected from regular hunters could partially compensate the tourist outfitters
Year 2020
Our camp is located in WMU 47. How will calf hunting controls work in 2020?
Year 2021
It is proposed we can apply for moose tag with a modest application fee. What is meant by a modest fee? Will we know if there is a reasonable opportunity to draw a tag?
We agree with more restrictive rules for tag transfer with a goal of eliminating “ghost hunters”.
Points based allocation system seems to be fair if it provides an advantage to those who have gone a number of years without drawing a tag. We like the idea that a tag can be refused without affecting the number of points an individual accumulates.
The preference point system only works when a reasonable number of tags are available. For the past two years only one adult tag has been available in WMU 47.
Our hunters would only purchase a moose licence if someone in our group gets a tag. Group hunting would then allowed. How will we know who gets tags?
We don’t agree with limiting group hunting to ten persons. This would force us to break up our traditional moose hunting group of 16. We are OK with being within group hunters being within 5km of tag holder.

It seem you process only gets the attantion of the ratical groups that would not be happy with what ever is proposed.
There are some proposed changes the seem to be good and others that will not make any differnce.   I have been hunting moose since 1972 and as others in Ontario watched the slow deline of the moose population.   As I have watched the mismanagement of the fishing across ontairo paticularly in northern parts of the province.
I don't agree with the proposed chnages to bring back calf season in select WMU or remove the 1 to 2 no calf season in others.   If the moose population is at an all time low then restrict all calf hunting.
Bow hunters and Gun hunters should have the same oppertunities, as currently and in your poroposed changes bow hunters are allowed the prime moose hunting times.  Thsi leads to the lenght of the seasons if the most populated ares of Ontario can be ahppy with a 1 to 2 week season why in your right mind do you have a 2 and half month season in the northern part.
The outfitters only operate fro the 1 to 2 weeks currently as due to frezze up and if that works for them and for resident hunters in the south why does it not work in the northern parts?  As all locals in these ares wait till end of season to go hunting when the moose have yarded up, which does not seem to fit with any of your proposed chnages to increase the moose population.
As I mentioned early I have hunted moose for 50 plus years and watched the deline and the fishing
in the lake nipissing area also deline due to missmanagent and polictical influnce and not giving a care what hppens in the short time frame and 30 to 40 years later trying to fix things when it is to late.

I support the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's (MNRF's) proposed implementation of the the Big Game Management Advisory Committee's (BGMAC) recommended preference point tag allocation system, removal of the right of resident’s immediate family members to hunt, as well as limiting party hunting size and spread.
I hope that the Ministry will consider phasing out calf hunting given that Ontario's research scientists found that the calf hunt was additive rather than compensatory to natural mortality in central Ontario, and that females are more likely to abandon moose where they are hunted. Natural mortality is evolutionarily important – our wildlife communities co-evolved over millennia and make each other stronger. Relative to the moose on the landscape, wolves kill the youngest, oldest and weakest moose, leaving the strong moose behind to reproduce. BGMAC’s surveys show that most hunters support calf protection.
What won’t help our moose is the liberalization of wolf and coyote hunting. Eastern coyotes are generalists, not significant predators of moose. Moreover, it is unethical to allow unlimited killing of these animals, especially during pup-rearing season. More than 2,000 hunters were listed as actively hunting canids last year in the management units where the proposed changes would take place. If every active canid hunter from last year killed wolves, the wolf population would be devastated; game seals help limit interest. However, since wolves are difficult to hunt, the proposed regulation changes will likely only make wolf packs smaller. MNRF's website outlines that smaller wolf packs don’t eat significantly fewer moose than larger packs.
There is no sound science behind this proposal to open up wolf and coyote hunting. Liberal canid hunting may alter predation dynamics and removing the requirement for hunters to report their kills on an annual basis means that this proposal may have unknown and unintended consequences for other species that wolves impact. For example, wolves might switch to caribou if packs are weakened because caribou are easier to kill compared to moose. Woodland caribou are a threatened species.
I urge the Ontario government to abandon the proposal to liberalize wolf and coyote hunting, move forward with proposed actions to conserve our moose, and phase out calf hunting. I ask that reporting requirements and their enforcement be strengthened. Data is at the heart of effective wildlife conservation; a lack of reporting requirements demonstrates the government's unwillingness to take the management of our wildlife, a public trust belonging to all Ontarians, as seriously as is claimed. Apex predators are essential to maintaining biodiversity, and as an Ontario resident, their existence in the province is a priority to me.

33735,/comment/33735,"1.	 Is this about moose management or tag allocation.  This is very much about tag allocations and the system.   If it’s about management then the MNRF needs to  look at forestry practices as well as the provincial Caribou Strategy.  Thus far, in several WMU caribou have been valued much higher than moose.  This has resulted in way to many tags as well as inadequate forest management.  Such as the size of cuts, riparian zones, spraying etc…  Was a big topic with CO last year in Red Lake.
2.	I think the new tag system will be a joke.  Guys I know will be printing off more than one tag and if they get home without being checked then Im sure some will be harvesting a second animal.  I would suggest that they require mandatory animal checks.  These could be lodges, butcher shops, etc.  This will give them a solid count on the number of animals being harvested.  At the very least should be within a minimum time frame
3.	I would suggest they do the same with first nations.  I know they won’t limit the harvest, but they need proper counts of how many are being taken.  The number will be way higher than the counts they expect.  And I imagine since the tag cuts in 2014 they’re harvest has increased…
4.	I recently learned that the outfitters bear tags have been greatly reduced as the number of residents are buying more bear tags.  Again, a mandatory check in would give proper data to manage.  They suspect more bears are being harvested but many guys up north im told buy bear tags to skirt the party hunting rules.
5.	I don’t support  he change from 5 km to 3 km.  Some cuts are that large and if in radio contact I believe the 5 km is sufficient.
6.	I fully agree with a cow/calf tag.  If the population warrants a cow harvest then I think the antler/antlerless approach is much better.  One as its much easier to tell then counting teeth.  The other allows a hunter to harvest the calf and leave the cow rather than the opposite.  I don’t know much about the bull to cow ratios but the number of cows I have seen without calves makes me concerned about over harvesting bulls.  Research is needed to see if cows are being bred or if they are losing calves to predation etc…  Not sure the Quebec system is really much better as if you talk to locals you will get mixed messages about the health of the herd.  I know lots of hunters that go there because tags, but I haven’t talked to many that come home with moose.  I suspect they like the $500 revenue for a non-resident tag..
7. I don't support changes to the way tags are allotted now.  I feel that the group applications allow for greater economical benefits. I believe the draw works well now.  People will complain about any system when they are not successful
8. lso don't support the northern Ontario resident draw as there is no preferential treatment to other draws such as Elk or deer.

33736,/comment/33736,"The moose numbers are decreasing. The moose hunters numbers are decreasing.
The goal of this exercise is to make people who constantly apply for an adult tag in the same WMU year after year where there’s next to no chance of getting a tag, get a tag every once in a while. I’m unsure how this will work. Too Many numbers for my pencil and paper.
There’s only so many moose and so many tags. Both declining year after year. And you feel we can somehow improve the chances of getting a tag better, when all along the odds are decreasing rapidly.
This exercise is also gonna cost more money obviously. So your gonna pass the extra cost onto the individual moose hunters. Prices are going up as always, but this maybe a huge jump in price.
This may just raise the odds of getting a tag by a few percentage points, by forcing some hunters out of the moose hunt because they cannot afford the new costs. Moose numbers stay the same, fewer hunters increases BillyBob’s chances at getting an adult tag for the first time in 23 years.
Decreasing hunting party numbers to 10. Again, BillyBob gets left at home this year cause it’s his turn. His cousin Johnny shoots provincial record bull moose from BillyBob’s stand.
And BillyBob gets one package of stew meat and one package of burger.

33741,/comment/33741,"The proposed changes to moose management does have some good features, and the point-system addresses the concerns of older hunters who have gone many years without tags.  However it does so at the expense of young hunters who know essentially have to earn their right to a tag (and for some, it will take many, many years before they even get close to having enough points).  A percentage of tags that remain random, like the current system, at least gives new hunters a chance of drawing a tag, even if it is a slim chance.  Moose hunting opportunities shouldn't be reserved in high-demand WMUs to the older members of the hunting fraternity.  Pointing to WMUs that are highly inaccessible (i.e. costly to hunt in), or to archery only tags (requiring a lot more experience) doesn't necessarily help, as these hunts too are for the most part out of reach of young hunters.  I was fortunate to draw my first gun bull tag in WMU 28 when I was a teenager, and I would hate to think that no other young hunter will ever be as lucky and fortunate as I was.
I also object to the changes proposed to party hunting.  A limit of 10 hunters is very small, especially if the hunting party is encouraging youth and a lot of parent + apprentice or young hunter pairs (as should be the case for all those who value the future of the sport).  And so too is the 3km radius from the tag holder.  I hunt WMU, in an area where concession roads are not on a metric grid, and often 2 miles apart.  Two hunters hunting the same block would have to either walk through the bush to meet up at a kill site, or drive around on the concession roads (which would almost certainly separate the tag holder from the successful member of the party by more than 3km).  Imposing a metric distance on a grid that was created before the metric system is impractical, and narrow-minded in terms of how one perceives that groups hunt (we don't all own ATVs, we don't all call our moose to us, and we don't all hunt clear-cuts with logging roads or established trails between us, yet we are stlll party hunting with robust communication between party members, all well within the rules prior to this overly restrictive proposal).
I also have concerns about ""variable pricing"" for tags.  Sounds innocent enough as proposed, but when a tag is perceived to be more valuable because demand is higher, then the next logical step would be to consider some WMUs more valuable than others, and that's a step that I feel would be unfair, if it were ever considered.  All Ontario hunters should be treated the same, and not penalized if their hunting property happens to be in a highly sought after WMU, rather than a more remote inaccessible WMU.  That's not managing the resource, that's taking advantage of the situation to maximize revenue.  And for that reason, I am against even preferential pricing for bull versus cow-calf or calf-only tags, because I feel the motivation behind such a proposal is all about maximizing revenues (to compensate for lost revenue that will surely come with the other changes in this proposal).
I also feel that this proposal hasn't given adequate information regarding how license costs will change.  What will it cost to apply, without any intent to buy a license.  What will the license cost when one is successful.  The proposal is taking about changes for as early as 2020; surely then it isn't too early to disclose costs for the same timeframe!   Commenting on how it will cost less over a moose hunters career, or using the term ""modest"" is way too vague to draw meaningful comment.
I also do not agree with separate quotas for archery tags; crossbows being the main reason.  The argument that success rates are lower with archery tags is not taking the full picture into account.   Crossbows are making it too easy for hunters to ""make the switch"", and then with the advantages of being able to hunt earlier in the season, and with highly realistic electronics calls becoming quite affordable, I think archery already has plenty of advantages without then having a separate quota (as a means to increase the number of archery tags and thus overall adult tags allocated, which of course is the motivation).  But at the same time, while reported success may be lower, how many moose (and bears, and deer), are wounded and not recovered with archery tags, especially inexperienced crossbow hunters?
Lastly, the proposal doesn't really address a major problem with the season changes that were very recently implemented.  Allowing cows to be harvested, and orphaning calves, in northern WMUs before the calf season and after the calf season.  Why aren't cows only allowed to be harvested only the same time period as calves, whatever period that might be.  I firmly believe that under no circumstance should a hunter shoot a cow and knowingly (or by necessity of the tag system) pass on a calf (especially twin calves), because a calf realistically has no chance of making it through even a mild northern winter alone.  That is an irresponsible and usually avoidable waste of the resource.

Under the idea of limiting hunting parties to 10 hunters means that some of our current members can no longer hunt in the group if we only have one tag. Existing established groups should be able to continue to hunt as they have for years. Another option would be to award established groups larger than 10 with one adult moose party tag and one calf party tag.
 When it comes to hunting the private land there should not be conflict with other hunters as they are not allowed on that property and therefore distinctions need to be made in the regulation regarding private and municipal lands with regards to limiting size of the party should this regulation pass.

33753,/comment/33753,"Im glad to see some of the charges proposed.  Specifically the proposed updates to how tags will be drawn under the new system.
I am surprised that calf tags have not been completely eliminated.
The distance members of the hunting party can be from the tag holder should remain at 5 km.  Going to 3 km could eliminate hunting opportunity in the north ie fly in camps on larger bodies of water.
Group size reduced to 10 makes sense.  I would suspect that groups larger than this in the past would have had a few ghost hunters in them.  There is no mention of how a group will be identified or named in the new system
My opinion would be that you should only be allowed to not claim a tag twice or you forfeit your points or at minimum 1/2 your points.
There is no mention of maximum points.
Similar to in the State of Maine there should be something like this.  Permits for 65 years old and older: A resident 65 years of age or older with 30 points or more in the moose lottery system who applies for a moose permit is guaranteed a permit.  Basically if you have not drawn a tag after 30 years of applying and your over 65 you get a tag.
Units with 10 tags or less should be closed every other year.

For the initial setting of points, having a surplus tag shouldn't reset someone's points to zero as it is a poor tag and is not comparable to getting what you want in the draw. For the second chance allocation people will just apply for tags so someone else doesn't get them even though they have no intention of taking them. Maybe making them pay for the tag if they choose to go in that allocation process instead of being able to choose to accept or not might help; these tags should also be cheaper than a first allocation tag as they are poorer tags.

33764,/comment/33764,"It has always been the Ontario Goverment's belief that moose hunting is a group activity, and that applicants were always encouraged to apply as a group.  I'm dismayed at the fact that this new policy states ""Eliminate the group application component of the allocation process. Each hunter would apply to the moose tag allocation process by themselves and be treated as an individual based on their own draw history""
I think if a group of 5 applicants always hunts together (as my group does, for the past 20 years), they should have the opportunity to combine their ""points"" so as to increase their chances of getting a tag. This would encourage hunters to apply as part of a group. Once their group is issued a tag, everyone from that group is removed from that draw.
There are groups of 5 that currently don't meet the guaranteed group size and do not draw a tag, and then there are groups of 5 that all apply individually and may end up with two or more tags (this currently happens).
I think if a group is honest and says all 5 will be hunting together they should get preference in the application process over a group of 5 who are dishonest and all apply as individual hunters.  Who out there is going off into the bush for a week and hunting a moose by themselves?
I would hope that you would reconsider and allow group hunting applications.

33775,/comment/33775,"Hello,
I have a few comments regarding the proposed changes to Ontario's moose hunting regulations.
While the changes, as proposed do have some merit, I feel that they will still fall short of helping our moose population regenerate.  My only comment regarding the point system and the group application that I feel would be beneficial (assuming this passes), is to not get rid of the group application process.  I hunt annually in a party of 6, and we do apply as a group.  If the groups are removed and the point system implemented, we would now have to potential to draw multiple tags in one year.  This is not necessary as we would rather have the chance to gets tags more regularly or on an annual basis instead of multiple tags in one year.  By removing the group draw, we would run the chance of 'wasting' tags as we could probably only harvest the one animal, if that.  Also, why not provide the option of pooling points to apply as groups to improve one’s chance of drawing a tag?  Provide an online service where we could log in to see our total number of points and make and educated decision to apply as a group and use two or three member’s points to guarantee a tag.  Once the points were gone, then we would be back to the draw the same as everyone else.
Now as far as implementing a calf draw; in general this will not have as big of an impact as you are anticipating on the moose population.  I hunt WMU-37 and have all my life.  While I can attest to the fluctuation in moose population over the years, based on the number of animals observed while hunting, I can also attest to the increase number of non-traditional hunting parties that we are seeing on a regular basis.  What I mean by this is that there has been a significant increase in the number of large group, non-indigenous parties hunting with native or metis licensed harvesters, which is in direct violation of both the treaties and laws.  Now I know that this is a hot topic and is much debated but I will try and put this as delicately as possible.  There is no way that you can manage a moose population effectively while you are only regulating one half or less of the population of hunters.  We are being over regulated to the point of now not being able to hunt in a given year if unsuccessful in a ‘calf draw’, while native and metis hunters are able to harvest at will both the number and sex of moose that they please!!  On top of this, we are also forced to silently observe the unethical and extremely illegal hunting practices that are occurring annually.  I have either personally, or have had firsthand accounts of all of the following; night hunting, spot lighting, setting up blockades on main logging roads to isolate entire areas with armed guards (could not believe this one), threats of having to pay tolls to cross ‘native land’ which was crown land, one hunter harvesting entire families of moose (bull, cow, calf), a large party of non-indigenous hunters with one metis/native hunter who was intoxicated to the point of not being able to stand with a bull strung up in the trees and loaded rifles and HAND GUNS being shot and laying around on tables!!!; and worst of all, a refrigerated transport trailer which has been used annually for the past 3-4 years to haul out 30+ moose from the Aubrey Falls trading post (which is owned by natives) and is being shipped down south!!!  While all of these actions are unethical and against any sense of proper conservation, many are also extremely dangerous and illegal whether you are indigenous or not!!  So you can now see why it is impossible for me, and others, as responsible hunters to swallow your pill accepting the notion that a calf draw is going to solve all of our problems!!
The only effective way to manage our moose population is to regulate everyone equally and enforce the laws on all.  I can guarantee that if you were to regulate ALL hunters with a fair tag system based on heard numbers, that within 5 years you would have a sustainable population that would allow for increased issuance of tags and hunting opportunities for all.
I am a lifelong moose hunter and (at least) a fourth generation hunter/fisherman in Ontario who enjoys and respects our natural resources.  I believe that it is up to all of us who enjoy the outdoors to do our part to manage game and fish populations responsibly, and feel that it is the responsibility of all Ontarians (not just one group/heritage) to bear the burden of ensuring that future generations have the same opportunities that we have to enjoy what our great country has to offer!  While I understand that this suggestion is leading you down a difficult path, and one that will be met with extreme resistance, it is the only logical choice that you have for success and you know it!!!  GROW A PAIR AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!!  Thank you for your time.

33797,/comment/33797,"Submit following:
CALF HARVEST CONTROLS:
 I do not support the extension of the calf season, have restricted times, not open during archery and only if you have an antlerless tag. DO NOT have calf tags ONLY antlerless tags, or antlered tags
BOW SEASONS AND QUOTAS
Support open archery seasons in all units that have a gun season, with specific tags. As a bow hunter for 30 years our success rate is much lower and therefore should have MORE tags available. ISSUE MORE tags to take gun pressures away.
Include unit 16ABC in this with an early archer season without gun hunting
I do not support calf tags for archery and would rather see the archery hunters get bull ( antlered Tags) and give anlterless tags to the gun hunters.
The objective of bow hunters is to call the bull to you for a close shot, any killing of an anlterless moose is an incidental. Antlerless tags also allows hunters to spread out beyond the 5 km party hunting regulations and this leads to problems
Support southern Ontario archery season with separate tags, to help divert pressures have season run from Saturday to following Sunday, this allows two weekends of hunting and therefore more hunters applying. This should also be implemented for the southern Ontario gun season.
2021 Proposals
NEW SELECTIVE HARVEST APPROACH
Support the new approach, BUT NO CALF TAGS . ONLY antlered OR ANTLERLESS.
Calf tags only allow hunters to make mistakes, this has to end.
At least with an antlerless tag you can tag a mistake and avoid the cow shot as a calf. Our moose can not continue to be mistakenly  killed.
MOOSE LICENCE
Support this change to a product and part of the application process
POINTS SYSTEM
Support the new application for a tag with a modest fee, I suggest min $25.00 to apply.
Moose hunting in Ontario is not an individual sport it is a group activity and therefore we should continue to apply in groups.
I am not in favour of the points system that is proposed, way to confusing and not FAIR
I suggest if we are going to a new system then we ALL start fresh with 1 point. Otherwise so many hunters and our young hunters will never stand a chance. This is suppose to make it more fair and eliminate the ghost hunters, not send us all to Quebec to moose hunt.
We need to apply in groups , NO GUARANTEED GROUP SIZE, have a maximum size ie 4 for archery, 6 for gun ( this is reasonable group size for new party hunting regulation) . The computer picks the successful hunter and the alternate, no chance for ghost hunters , cant stack your odds as wrong hunters might get the tag.
So even though you apply in groups the computer sees ALL  applicants in the WMU as individuals, so still a chance for smaller groups to get tags. But when one of the applicants in a group is selected they all are removed.
NOW if unsuccessful then next year that group of 6 would have 12 points and a much higher chance at getting a tag , following year they would have 18 points , considering they are all still applying OR each hunter having 3 points.
 Now the computer can pick highest points and work backwards OR  someone  with three points would have their name in the draw three times.
SECONDARY ALLOCATION
Great idea, this allows tags to be turned in and help hunters maintain their points system for future years, and distribute tags
END SURPLUS TAGS
ANTLERED TAG $500    ((in Quebec requires two tags on moose at $500 each)
ANTLERLESS tag $300
PARTY  HUNTING
I suggest that tag size be reduced to 4 for archery and 6 for gun hunting. MUST have means of communicating so if checked they must be able to communicate with tag holder and party or face charges. This is a huge problem and leads to wasted moose, must be stopped
I suggest that when that group of 4 apply for an archery tag and are successful in the draw then all four names go on the tag and the Conservation Officer can ensure party hunting within that group, no one else can hunt on that tag .

33802,/comment/33802,"Thank you for your review of Moose management in Ontario. There appears to be some opportunity for improvement in the process of the draw process but reading the proposal I see it as very difficult to understand if the hunter is not extremely attentive to detail and the intricacies of the system will leave many confused or frustrated. . However, I am absolutely opposed to a calf validation tag application across the whole of the Province in 2021. It is clear that the CVT proposal is not specific to a sustainability related concern in many areas and to take many hunters out of the game because they have no association to a tag seems unpalatable to me. Not only does it impact the hunters who are not fortunate enough to secure a tag or find someone with a tag to be associated but it will also impact hunters in the field and in many cases could make otherwise legal hunters unable to  hunt or even illegal.
There has been zero data to demonstrate how going to a CVT system will add new opportunity. There is no information to show what the total cost of an AVT OR CVT will be. We are lacking a clear understanding of how many of us will no longer be able to hunt or more precisely how families and future generations of hunters will no longer be interested in moose hunting, hunting at all.
The realities of implementing a CVT and how it will impact hunters? No longer can a resident of Northern Ontario simply hop on their quad and go out for a hunt, no longer can a family just go for a weekend hunt, no longer can a resident grab a neighbour and go for a hunt, no longer can the many solo hunters head out into the field to enjoy a day calling or in search of moose, no longer when a hunting party goes afield , when their tag holder gets a call to go home for a family need or other will the remainder of the party be able to be in the field, no longer when the tag holder is sick in camp will the others be able to go out, no longer after a day of organized hunting will the members be able to go out to their favourite watch and sit until dark calling and scouting (this is totally legal with the present system as long as they do not shoot an animal they do not have a tag for and many groups use this as a scouting strategy for the following days hunt.) no longer can you go to more than one WMU. (Hunters presently do go to more than one WMU for moose hunting at different times depending on weather and time available to travel, Also, many camps and hunter reside in areas where several WMU's converge or are within close proximity. WMU;S 28, 29, 40 are good examples where Kirkland lake, New Liskeard, Elk Lake, Matachewan resident might hunt without an AVT. Many of these people hold a moose license and enjoy the great outdoors for the ""off-chance"" they might have an opportunity. This will no longer be an option unless they can find someone with a tag to be associated with. Where is the incentive for a young or new hunter to enter the system if  the point system appears out of reach and the random draw is their only hope . Realistically we know those tags available will be limited and people need to book vacation time well in advance in many cases. Presently they can book holidays and know they can plan and go for a hunt. This new system totally eliminates that predictability.
Again, while there are potential improvements in the proposal communication and education are critical key points to address. Evidence or data to support the proposal of a province wide CVT is weak, or non existent. It is not being implemented broadly as a conservation need and it will impact many hunters and communities both socially and economically not to mention the potential impact to the SPA. The net economic loss will impact MNRF, Communities and displace many present and future moose hunters in the Province of Ontario.

33811,/comment/33811,"I support Calf tag control but it should be for the entire province to grow moose populations. No one should be able to harvest calves now without a calf tag, we cannot get adults without maximising our reproduction.
Technology has changed too much and it is not 1983 anymore when this selective harvest system came into effect. First nation harvest is high, wolf protection along with closure of spring bear hunt increased predation on calves. They need help to grow the population. I have heard moose hunters say ""farmers don't kill their calves why should hunters"".
Many units in province are seeing decline which reflects back to lack of available tags, making hunters disappointed in the system. MNR's slow decision making to turn things around has not helped the matters. Many management units could have been fixed early on if you would have just taken quicker action instead of dragging your feet.
So I agree it is time for calf control to grow populations, but also help hunters to apply in their respective units. This will help reduce pressure on other units seeing majority of hunters applying where there are adult tags. I feel that calf tags will allow for more adult tags (a switch off).
Bow season in all units is important to me. It should be in all units in the province where there is a gun season. Right now it is biased to gun which is really very unfair and I don't agree with!  Allocations should also be more fair and not a measly 3-5% of total allocation. With so little this leads to more competition with hunters for tags needing groups size of 12 or more to get an archery tag while gun it is only 5-8 hunters, again totally biased and needs to change now since more hunters having gotten into archery away from gun. Success rates are lower also and seasons are much shorter. Also I would like to see a consistent allocation approach/amount across all units where there is an archery season.
I also feel the fair share of archery tags allocation would be around the 20% mark of the total harvest allocation to provide less competition for a tag, but not saturate hunting areas with too many hunters spoiling the hunt. It seems MNR staff are not aware how much bow hunting has changed across North America and so has the way we hunt.
Archery needs to be in all units in the province and also open units which have no season at this time. I believe there are areas where moose thrive but there are not hunts at this time. A better allocation of tags will help spread hunters out but also increase chances at getting tags within the groups.
Moose seasons in the northeast and northwest are too long on an individual tag. Why not break them into multiple seasons (2-3 weeks long each) and apply tags for each? I am sure that MNR knows when hunters are most successful so apply tags accordingly. We need to spread hunters out to reduce congestions also. This would help increase tags.
As for group sizes I agree but go farther make archery groups of 4-5 and gun groups of 5-7.
Hunters should also apply together in the draw and if their name is not on the tag within the group they cannot hunt on that tag. This would help reduce walk ins, my understanding this increases success rates and can reduce tags in the long run.
As for the point system I am not for it as it stands. This will bring hunters out of the wood work that have either quit applying or have been applying in units that have no tags for many years. Hunters that have followed the system and have gone to units where there are tags may now be penalized through the new system as proposed. Or it will allow hunters with the most points to go into units surrounding their normal place they apply and put more pressure on those units and the hunters that stay within.
This will also affect the youth in getting a tag, I believe that people like me may go a decade or so without seeing a tag or an opportunity which is not right!
I believe keeping the current system is the best, affordable with the lack of funding and downsizing of the government. We need to use the tools we have with some tweaking possibly.
This date and time no hunter should be applying in the moose draw alone, there are just are not enough moose to go around. Eliminate it is the first step and apply tags to groups as a priority allocation. If it is so important that a hunter wants to apply alone then make an allocation very small to them say 10-20% of total allocation. Maybe have a system that allocates to group hunters first process and the last remaining 20% of the tags would go to unsuccessful groups along with individual applicants. This may still give unsuccessful group hunters a chance of getting a tag in the second round of the draw. Again no hunters should be applying as individuals.

I wish to express concern about the impact of some of the BGMAC recommendations on the future of this club, and on our large extended family. Each year, three generations of family participate in the hunt; men and women, grand-fathers and grand-daughters, mothers and sons. The older generation provide crucial knowledge of the past, sharing their experience and advice. The younger generation are mentored by the older generations, learning every hunt.
About half of our club live in proximity to our hunting area. The other half have nearby cottages, trailers, or stay at the hunt camp. Because of this, we have different numbers and combinations of hunters throughout the week. We may have more on the weekend, as high as 15-18 in the last few years, because younger generations especially may not have the seniority to apply for vacation time during moose season, so can only hunt on weekends. Older generations may miss a day or two to rest up or attend a medical appointment. On average, we have about 13 -15 hunters during the week, aged from 18-82.
There are a few recommendations in the BGMAC report relating to the preference point system for distributing tags. They could have serious consequences for our family hunt camp, and I am concerned they would lead to great divisiveness and the loss of valued family tradition and involvement in hunting.
•	I am concerned that this process could be a disincentive to younger generations, just out of high school, or college/ university. They have little income and given they will have accumulated fewer ‘preference points’, unless the ‘modest application fee’ is truly modest, ie $20; they may not apply for a tag when they have no chance of getting a tag. Perhaps you might consider increasing the odds for those with more ‘preference points’, rather than allocate tags only to those with the most points. All applicants could have some chance of a tag, to increase the incentive for them to apply.
•	Pricing tags separately from the draw could place a burden on our older hunters. I am assuming that to make up for the lower tag application price, the purchase of tags will be in excess of the current combined price to apply for a tag. If so, older hunters (who have more points based on the long time they have been hunting) who live on a fixed income may find it cost prohibitive to purchase their tag.
•	Reducing the size of the hunting party to 10 would be devastating to our family hunt camp. How would we decide who gets to hunt? If we did our own draw, what if I get to hunt and not my husband? Each generation provides a necessary and valuable role in the hunt. I have discussed this with my family and we just couldn’t imagine excluding family, who are paid up members of the camp, from a hunt. I hope with all my heart that you will not adopt this recommendation.
•	Further, if we had 15 hunters and 2 tags, when one tag is filled, will 5 members have to be excluded from hunting for the rest of the week? How could we possibly decide who has to stay home?
Thank you for considering these comments. I hope they can influence the decision and ensure that future generations will be a part of this family hunt camp, passing along knowledge of and love of the land, of self-sufficiency, and Canadian tradition.

33824,/comment/33824,"The proposal should also include dividing the season length in two parts.We should have the first part of the 5 week season or the second part as a check off on application on top of others ie wmu,arch,gun.The splitting of the season should also apply to archery hunting.
A hunter should not be allowed to participate in more than one group unless it is another season but can apply in another group if in a different WMU.
Enforcement should be allowed to ticket or seize an animal if the hunter has equipment designed as a moving tower ie argo atv with person on top,this  should be automatic for intent to hunt from vehicle.
We should limit hunting to cutovers that are 10yrs or older,fresh cutovers are not the best cover for moose because of feed but regeneration is there at least 10yrs it starts to provide cover.
Hunting moose has become too easy because of equipment used.Newer Argo s can access any new cutovers even through fresh bog which could not be done years ago.
The use of electronic devices to call moose during rut should be banned,again an example of making it easy for hunters.
Bring back a deputy conservation officer program as a seasonal contract,this would help with enforcement and deterance.

This will prevent hunters , not part of that group , filling other hunters tags. This will also prevent over taking moose population in one area. For example, me and my group have filled our group tag, we should not be able to participate in hunting with other hunters or group’s during moose season. Your tag has been filled, your done hunting for the season.

Why not control the tags given out. In our hunting group some times we have 20 or more hunters. Some elderly and need support of younger people to complete the hunt. Doing this will limit they people who are able to hunt.

Other jurisdictions have a preferred points draw, not a strict front of the line/back of the line system, correct?
Simple Solution for Everyone:
Divide tags per WMU based on percentage of applicants in groups vs individuals (Keeps everybody happy)
Allow groups up to current max of 15 (or revise to 16) to submit collectively and hunt on same tag
ALL Group members surrender points once tag is claimed as does an individual
Party hunting within 3 km is fine
1/2 point for application, 1/2 point for buying license
1 tag transfer per lifetime OR no tag transfers at all unless death or hospitalization occurs with 2 weeks of opening day.
Points required for tag is equal to applications to tag ratio of previous year

Preference point system: What is a modest fee?????
Why do you bend for the northern population, why do they get an extra points? Lets keep all things equal.
I believe some of the statements on large group hunters conflicts is a lot of hear say and should not be part of this decision making. The 5km from hunting members was fine, who wants to be hunting on the same pond? Give us a safe hunting distance.
I don't agree with hunter group size dropping to 10 hunters. Because of this rule you will loose more and more hunters. Organized camps hunt together and add many dollars into the economy now you are saying the other five hunters stay at home, you are no more able to hunt you have no tag!
Public Consultation Opportunities - Why did you not have more open houses, you never had any in the Ottawa area.
Why do you have such a short comment period on this subject?
You continue to change rules and regulation, season times. Many hunters in the south remain unhappy because you changed the moose hunt from Monday open day to the Saturday open day giving them no time to set up camp.
I think with constant change, you are loosing more and more hunters and you never use the news paper for notification to the hunters of changes on the way. Publicise the proposed changes and let the hunters know how they can input, the older hunters do not use computers and they are the backbone. Don't leave them out in the cold!

2) Will the new proposed fees add up to more than we are paying now? Our Moose licence now covers everything. Will application fee, License and Tag fee equal that? If not what is the increase?
3)  Will the points needed for a Bull tag be in reach of anyone with less than 9 points for any given year?
You maintain a group has to be 10 max so 1 hunter hopefully in each group will eventually have that ability.  What about smaller groups that have hunted together for years, ie 6 in a group and the Bull tag is 9   they would have to wait 3 more years, at least,  to get a chance at a  Bull tag.  This may result in some groups just quitting Moose hunting.  Hopefully there can be some sort of Grandfathering smaller groups(individuals) enough points, the first time this new  draw is implemented, to keep people hunting.
4)  If we are trying to increase the herd, why is the Cow tag more readily available?  I know the demand for Bull is higher but the Cows are the future of the herd.  How do we protect more Cows in this points system?

33842,/comment/33842,"limiting the number of people that can hunt on a tag will negatively impact larger long established hunt camps as well as have a negative impact on the industry.  Camps that have over the years added members to increase their likelihood of getting a tag would then have to reduce their numbers. This proposed change would reduce the number of active hunters and reduce revenue for the MNR. It would also have a negative impact on supplier's of hunting equipment as well as lodges/motels. In the past we had 8 members. Back then,  we had enough hunters to be guarantee ourselves a tag. Over the years we have had to add hunters to be able to continue to guarantee ourselves a moose tag. We now have more than 20 hunters as part of our hunt camp. Under the proposed changes, if we were to obtain only one tag, only 10 of our members would be able to hunt. The other 10 would not be able to participate in the hunt and as a result, would not come up hunting. Less would be spent on lodging travel, supplies and tags.
Over the last 6 years, since the guarantee to get a tag has disappeared, we have had times when we only had one adult tag, that all of us were able to hunt.
I know that we have also had times in the past that we only had calf tags.
Even in those times, we still had a majority of our hunters come for the moose hunt.
I think a couple of better solutions would be to either reduce the length of the season, or to have the tag for a successful hunter only valid for a 7 day period.

33879,/comment/33879,"Thank you for taking my comments.
I am a member of a registered hunt camp with the MNRF. We have more than 12 members. Does this mean if we are successful in the tag allocation system we have to tell 2 members that they cannot hunt moose. Further to this we have members that have (sons, daughters, grand children) that are up and coming hunters and normally come up for a day or 2 during the hunt. If we have a maximum of 10 hunters in a party, the inclusion of our next generation hunters could be in jeopardy.
Will there be economic gains to the southern regions that will be having an early bow season? With the tags allotted to the bow season coming out of the gun season quota for that WMU will this potential economic gain be just a wash as you will most likely have fewer hunters in the gun season due to the lack of tags allocated. Additionally this could hurt the economic gains currently enjoyed in the north as bowhunters will be moving their hunts to the southern WMU’s if successful in the tag allocation system.
As a member of a registered hunt camp, if all members are unsuccessful in the tag allocation system then the hunt is canceled. We have no interest in applying for or hunting in a region different from the WMU our camp is in. At least today we would have the option to hunt for a calf. Again an impact to the economic growth for the region
If a group only has a cow/calf tag in the new tag allocation system and a cow and calf come out to hunter and the cow is shot the calf has to be left alone. I question the survival rate of calves in their first year without a cow. Under the new rules we are shooting one moose but are we leaving the other to the wolves or other without the cow.
Under today’s system we would have the opportunity to harvest both if we have a cow tag and have other hunters in the group with calf tag.
Lastly, I have always struggled that a single person would require a moose tag. Especially in the central and southern regions. I can’t imagine there is a lot of sustenance hunters in those regions. I know other regions and I think Ontario did this at one point where 2-3 hunters had to be attached to one moose tag. If we took this system, in addition to your points system, I think that would allow you folks to keep your tag quotas where you want, have the tags spread out to more hunters and not impact the economy in hunting regions.

33897,/comment/33897,"I am pleased that we are looking into the moose issues, although this year we (our group) did not receive a tag in our WMU 13 as we normally do or in our second area of 15b.
Why do you not follow the deer process as it has been a successful achievement to date. Antlered or antlered-less seems to have worked out well for the deer populations. This allows a hunter to take an antlered-less (Doe or fawn).
As a prudent hunter and conservationist, I would take a fawn before a doe (with a fawn) or a dry doe (without a fawn). As I did this last year, seen a lot of doe with fawns before we took a doe without a fawn.
I have noticed that when you draw a cow and the calf season is over you end up taking a cow and the calf is left to defend itself from wolves, bears, coyotes and what ever else that can and will takes it life over the fall and winter months. That is a great loss and shame as the cow could have been bred by a bull already and now you are taking two or three maybe even up to 4 animals (twins) out in one animal.
Still using a draw system to receive a moose licence is a great way to go as I understand that there are more hunters than moose.
I believe that party hunting and having minimum size groups in the party would also help ensure that more people could hunt each year. If we go with the proposed method we could make party hunting a thing of the past as it would be only the one hunter who wins the lottery and draws a tag. They could then decide to be the only one hunting the moose.  Moose hunting should be encouraged to be a party hunt as one moose is too much meat for a single hunter or small family.
If the population is so low in an areas, why not shut down the hunting for a couple years in that WMU and or target the predators in that area to include poachers.
Please continue to monitor and manage our moose populations.
Thank you,
Ross

With the point system people won't accept a calf tag to use up their points opting to wait for a bull or cow tag.
",comments-24.json
33964,/comment/33964,"As for the point system I cannot support. This will bring hunters back into the draw system that have either quit applying or have been applying in units that have no tags for many years. Hunters that have followed the system and have gone to units where there are tags may now be penalized through the new system as proposed. Or it will allow hunters with the most points to go into units surrounding their normal place of applying and put more pressure on those units and the hunters that stay within.  It also sounds confusing leading to more frustration to hunters and more complaints. On top the cost will be high to create a new system, so where is the money going to come from and what else may be cut?
I also see this affecting the youth in getting a tag, I believe that people like me may go a decade or so without seeing a tag or an opportunity which is not right!  The province should keep the current system since it is working but maybe tweak to best fit tag allocations with the new proposals put forth. With the reduction in moose hunters the SPA must be seeing a big hit along with lack of funding and downsizing of the government, it doesn’t make sense to build a new system at this time.

I recommend:

• Reduce cow tags consistently across the province. Without a mother to protect and guide a calf for the first year of its life, its chances of survival are limited, even if it is not taken by a hunter.
• Establish and protect moose refuge areas. These areas would provide relief from loss of habitat, and from the easy access that forestry roads provide for hunters. New legally protected areas should be part of the solution.

I fail to see why it is not possible to restrict hunting to specific sections. Why cannot you establish a home-free or safe zone for moose? Furthermore, while I am writing this, why not spend less money on this legislation and hunting committees and more on monitoring, research resources and even, novel idea here - on enforcement. Hunters do get carried away. Repugnant as the idea of hunting anything except for food is to me, I believe it is permissible under certain circumstances and monitored closely.

Thank-you for addressing the declining moose population in Ontario but I think that greater measure need to be taken to halt this alarming decline. Banning the calf hunt would be a reasonable restriction at least until population levels are measurably on the increase. To further assist a still declining population would be to create hunting free areas, where moose can have better success at increasing their numbers and hopefully create a surplus of adult moose that can migrate into areas of lesser numbers. These two measures would I think be very beneficial. Thank-you for your consideration.

34024,/comment/34024,"A fulsome review of moose management and hunting is a long time coming and I commend the Minister and MNRF staff for conducting widespread consultation on the topic. Moose hunters are creatures of habit and this is a wholesale change to the very structure of moose hunting. Some moose hunters have already consistently demonstrated their inability to understand the regulations, so clear and frequent communication will be key.
In my career as a wildlife biologist involved in moose management in Ontario, I have witnessed a slow but steady shift in the moose hunting community opinion/attitude to a system that provides additional protection to calves, as well as cows (despite an oft-misused analogy to cattle). The proposed changes to calf hunting will negatively impact a lot of hunters but there is likely more overall support within the moose hunting community than ever before.
I fully agree with implementing calf harvest controls but my support is entirely contingent on the promise of increased adult hunting opportunities in the future. There’s a history of district and regional biologists being unnecessarily cautious with the provision of hunting opportunities and it is highly likely that hunters will not be provided with the additional adult hunting opportunities that are being promised.  This lack of consistency between managers must be addressed through harvest management guidelines.
Hunt camps will be disproportionately impacted by this change, and as such I expect public opinion to be polarized.  Some of these hunt camps that have invested thousands of dollars and shared generations of hunting memories will be unable to shift their hunting activity to other units, creating a disproportionate impact compared to other groups that the government has no right to ignore.   How will the calf tag quota be determined in the absence of established guidelines or policy direction? Will it be set at a percentage of total allowable harvest? Will ‘percent calves’ be similar between residents and the tourist industry? I recommend setting the ‘percent calves’ at no more than 20% of TAH, ideally less. This will help strike a balance between maintaining overall hunting opportunities with increasing adult hunting opportunities, and contribute to population sustainability.
I support creating separate tag quotas for bow and gun in northern units but due to the impact on existing gun tag quotas, should start off relatively low. I also support the creation of bows-only seasons in southern units with separate quotas, and shifting the season.
The proposed new selective harvest approach is long overdue. The creation of separate licensing products is a positive and necessary step. However, this change will have an unpredictable impact on the Special Purpose Account. I recommend a pricing structure that is revenue neutral or close to it.
Preference point system: moose hunters were loud and clear – they want change. Whether this new structure is the right decision or not, changing the system has been called for extensively. I support this change in principle (despite the current system actually being much fairer than most hunters perceive) but this proposed preference point system will present a barrier for the recruitment of new moose hunters. The MNRF can scarcely afford unimpeded hemorrhaging of moose hunters, particularly if there will be a projected loss of revenue as a result of moving to an application fee process in 2021. Likewise, for older hunters that have gone a long time without getting a tag, the first few years of this new system will generate a tag in their name but it could also mean they likely won’t ever get another tag in their name in their lifetime. However, I recognize that the details have not been finalized and I look forward to seeing the full details of implementation.
I support the elimination of the Northern Resident draw, a system that sowed unnecessary division between northern and southern residents over provincial resources. The proposed provision of an extra point to northern residents simply reinforces this imbalance between hunters and I strongly oppose this aspect of the proposal. There is no similar accommodation for southern Ontario hunters (elk in Bancroft/North Hastings, antlerless deer). Why is preferential treatment for one segment of the community limited to moose hunting? This wholesale review of moose is a prime opportunity to eliminate this nonsense, not reinforce it.
A two-stage allocation is promising and should address the longstanding issue of unutilized hunting opportunities and allow the province to divest itself from the frustrating surplus tag system.
I am pleased to see the MNRF considering the implementation of a deadline by which tags must be purchased - it’s possibly the most appealing aspect of this proposal. The MNRF should consider a similar deadline for the elk draw. It’s a progressive change, and I’m not ashamed to admit that it’s something that I’ve pushed professionally in the past.
Tag transfers should be limited to extreme circumstances, and I wouldn’t complain about requiring a doctor’s note or some other proof. I assume that a hunter would be able to transfer the tag to any other licensed moose hunter (rather than just a member of a group application)? Since the pool of potential transferees is being expanded, it’s necessary to limit the conditions under which a tag can be transferred so as not to encourage transfers.
In principle, I support efforts to reduce tag fill rates. But I question the proposed changes to party size – how will the limit of 10 hunters be enforced? Has any modelling been done to determine the point at which TFR is actually reduced or are we just guessing at a starting point?
I agree with eliminating special access to moose hunting opportunities in Ontario. I’m pleased to see that the proposal includes aspects that weren’t recommended by BGMAC due to the concerns that I raised earlier about geographical bias in composition.
Finally, we have decades of evidence to support the claim that MNRF communications is dismal at best despite having an entire Branch dedicated to it. These fundamental changes will be a communications nightmare. I recommend developing a clear communications plan that also includes groups like the OFAH.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide input.

34046,/comment/34046,"I have commented on this proposal earlier and I would like to make you aware of one other consideration that should have been added in the proposal and that is open season dates on Moose.
You changed the open season in moose a few years back, perhaps three or four years ago in the south to one week later and open on a Saturday rather then the Monday. You made this decision with very little or no conversation. You have inconvenient or put many hunters in the south in a position to not moose hunt or to not deer hunt, one or the other. In the year 2021, there will be two days between the moose and the deer hunts. That will make hunters decide, now do I moose hunt or do I deer hunt with vacation time back to back.
Many moose hunters and deer hunters in the south have and use camps for both deer and moose or what ever the hunting season will bring them. The season were spaced out that the working man could get the time off work but with the seasons back to back that will not be the case. We pay taxes and upkeep on these buildings and now we may have to give them up for the use for one of our traditional hunts. I think this is wrong and the earlier moose season in the south should be revisited and discuss the opening on the Monday vs the Saturday, another real inconvenience!
I ask you the OMNRF to help the hunter enjoy all the hunt seasons and not to make them choose not to go hunting because seasons too close and they may not get vacation time. All food for thought!

34054,/comment/34054,"I live in WMA 13, I hunt 12B for with my group when successful with a bull tag, and 15A for a calf. That being said, there have been NUMEROUS cows/calf’s shot and left to spoil, I’m sure due to someone not properly identifying the animal there tag allows. I believe EVERYONE who apples for a cow tag and is successful in receiving one weather bow/rifle. Should be aloud to harvest the calf prior to the calf season IF they have a cow tag attached to the calf. This will help the population in numerous ways. 1 if an Animal was misjudged and shot, it can be tagged without spoiling (any faithful honest hunter would attach the tag and now allow the animal to waste). 2 a lot of hunters would rather harvest a calf knowing the cow has a calf or 2. If a cow is harvested in bow or rifle season the chance of the calf surviving has now drastically dropped, and the calf will never survive the winter alone. The other option I know would work is only open the cow season for the same 2 weeks the calf season is open. 9 times out of 10 there’s at least 2 hunters 1 with a cow tag one with a calf tag. This would allow both moose to be harvested and no calf potentially going to waste to nature. Also the wolf population primarily in 15A as I spend a lot of time up there year round, has been increasing faster then the food chain can keep up with. This summer alone I have witnessed numerous wolfs all out scavenging for food. There was a point this summer my grandfather was being stocked and hunted by one of the packs while he was out blueberry picking. I believe wolf season should be opened the same day fall bear season opens, as the wolf’s do often come into the bear stands and a lot of hunters would love to have the opportunity to shoot a wolf but can’t as the seasons not open. I also believe the wolf/coyote tag should be eliminated and provided you have your small game license.this will allow a few more hunters to help maintain the increasing wolf population with out the fear of shooting one and not having that tag. I believe I have stated all my concerns I hope these are taken into consideration to assist in boasting the moose population

The system you have is designed to reduce moose numbers because everyone gets a calf tag and the calves are getting decimated by hunters and predatory animals. By giving out more cow tags you are limiting the calf population, a bull can breed with multiple cow which would increase calf population. Also, do not split tags between bow and rifle. Just allocate the tags and make the tag good for any of the seasons. So if the hunter doesn't harvest a moose during bow season they can use there tag for rifle.

34098,/comment/34098,"Contrary to what hunters often say in defense of their cruel pastime, hunting has nothing to do with “conservation” or “population control.” In fact, animals are often specially bred and raised for hunters to kill.
If left unaltered by humans, the delicate balance of nature’s ecosystems ensures the survival of most species. Natural predators help maintain this balance by killing only the sickest and weakest individuals.
Hunters, however, strive to kill the animals they would like to hang over the fireplace—usually the largest, most robust animals, who are needed to keep the gene pool strong. Hunting” often weakens the rest of the species’ population: For example, in Canada, hunting has caused the bighorn sheep’s horn size to fall by 25 percent in the last 40 years. Nature magazine reports that “the effect on the populations’ genetics is probably deeper.”
Even when unusual natural occurrences cause overpopulation, natural processes work to stabilize the group. Starvation and disease are tragic, but they are nature’s way of ensuring that healthy, strong animals survive and maintain the strength of their herd or group. After hunters kill the largest members of a population, the offspring of weak adults have difficulty finding food and gaining the strength needed to survive extreme weather; therefore, hunting can actually cause starvation rather than prevent it.
“Sport” hunting also exacerbates other problems. For example, the transfer of captive-bred deer and elk between states so that hunters can kill them is believed to have contributed to the epidemic spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal neurological illness in deer and elk that has been compared to mad cow disease. As a result, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has given state wildlife agencies millions of dollars to “manage” deer and elk populations. While the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention claim that CWD has no relationship to any similar diseases that affect humans or farmed animals, the slaughter of deer and elk continue
Hunters’ intended targets aren’t the only ones who suffer. Hunting accidents destroy property and injure and kill horses, cows, dogs, cats, hikers, and other hunters. According to the International Hunter Education Association, there are dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries attributed to hunting in the U.S. every year—and that number only includes incidents involving humans.
Even though less than 5 percent of the U.S. population hunts, nonhunters are forced to share many wildlife refuges, national forests, state parks, and other public lands with armed individuals who enjoy killing animals. Almost 40 percent of hunters in the U.S. slaughter and maim millions of animals on public land every year. By some estimates, poachers kill just as many animals illegally. Most federal and state agencies that are charged with managing wildlife refuges, national forests, state parks, and other public lands are funded in part by hunting and fishing activities, so agency personnel often go out of their way to encourage these activities rather than regulate or police them.
For those who were not exposed to hunting at an early age, agencies and special interest groups hold events and support clubs that target people who are less likely to purchase licenses, such as women, racial minorities, and senior citizens. Wildlife agencies also know that hunters are more likely to purchase licenses in subsequent years if a previous hunt resulted in a kill. Therefore, they implement programs—often called “wildlife management” or “conservation” programs—that are designed to boost the number of “game” species. These programs help to ensure that there are plenty of animals for hunters to kill and, consequently, plenty of revenue from the sale of hunting licenses.
Because wildlife agencies are funded by excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment and by revenue from the sale of licenses, hunters—who constitute a tiny percentage of Americans—enjoy a disproportionate say in how wild areas and the animals who inhabit them are managed. Because money talks, Americans who choose to participate in humane, nonlethal activities such as hiking and bird-watching are given little to no role in decisionmaking.

34105,/comment/34105,"Calf tags
I support Calf Tag Control but it should be for the entire province to grow moose populations. No one should be able to harvest calves now without a calf tag, we cannot get adults without maximising our reproduction. This should allow MNR to increase adult tags. Too many stressors on moose, First nation harvest is high, wolf protection along with closure of spring bear hunt increased predation on calves and habitat loss. We need to use the tools to grow the moose population, you cannot do that by killing to many calves. I have heard moose hunters say ""farmers don't kill their calves why should hunters"". Many units in province are seeing major decline which reflects back to lack of available tags. MNR should have implemented calf tags a long time ago which could have fixed some of the tag problems. I agree it is time for calf control to grow populations, but also help hunters to apply in their respective units. CALF TAGS should also be set up on all units in the province now so it can be turned on and off when needed and don’t need to go through a formal review like this one. Let local managers use it when needed to do the right thing for the moose population.
New Bow Season
Bow season in all units is important to my hunting party. It should be in all the units in the province where there is a gun season, even the far north units that open early for gun (ie 16A,B,C). Right now the system is totally biased towards gun which is really very unfair and I don't agree with!  Very poosr allocations to archery where there is a season of 3-5%. With so little this leads to more competition with hunters for tags needing very large groups sizes to be guaranteed an archery tag while gun it is only 4-8 hunters in many northern units. More hunters are getting away from the gun hunt and looking at archery opportunities, I’m sure MNR can see this! With success rates are lower also and seasons are much shorter than gun could provide more tags. We need to also see a more consistent allocation approach across the province I would suggest 15-20% of total harvest allocations going towards the archery season to be more fair, reduce competition for tags along with group sizes. We also don’t want to saturate one unit in the province having hunters apply there which can spoil the hunt. MNR needs educate themselves how much bow hunting has changed across North America, watch more game channels.
Moose Season
I feel the moose seasons in the northeast and northwest are too long on an individual tag. Why not break them into multiple seasons (4-3 week seasons long each) and apply tags for each? This would help spread people out better , reduce crowding and lower success rate maybe increasing tags. I am sure that MNR knows when hunters are most successful and could apply tags to each season accordingly. Season in south is only 1 week long each for archery and gun, so how can a 12 week season not be hard on tag allocation as it increases chances at filling tags.
Group Sizes
As for group sizes I agree but go farther make archery groups of 4-5 and gun groups of 5-6. Hunters should also apply together in the draw and if their name is not on the tag within the group they cannot hunt on that tag. This would help reduce walk in hunters, my understanding this increases success rates and can reduce tags in the long run.
Point System
As for the point system I cannot support. This will bring hunters back into the draw system that have either quit applying or have been applying in units that have no tags for many years. Hunters that have followed the system and have gone to units where there are tags may now be penalized through the new system as proposed. Or it will allow hunters with the most points to go into units surrounding their normal place of applying and put more pressure on those units and the hunters that stay within. It also sounds confusing leading to more frustration to hunters and more complaints. On top the cost will be high to create a new system, so where is the money going to come from and what else may be cut?
I also see this affecting the youth in getting a tag, I believe that people like me may go a decade or so without seeing a tag or an opportunity which is not right!  The province should keep the current system since it is working but maybe tweak to best fit tag allocations with the new proposals put forth. With the reduction in moose hunters the SPA must be seeing a big hit along with lack of funding and downsizing of the government, it doesn’t make sense to build a new system at this time.
Groups Hunting
This date and time no hunter should be applying in the moose draw alone. Consider giving applying tags to groups as a priority allocation. If it is so important that a hunter wants to apply alone then make an allocation very small to them say 15-20% of total allocation. The system would be set up as now that allocates to group hunters first process and the last remaining up to 20% of the tags would then be made available go to unsuccessful groups along with individual applicants. This would still give unsuccessful group hunter applicants a chance of getting a tag in the second round of the draw. We need to get rid of individual hunters to maximise groups in getting tags. The longest running in the group would still get the tag as they do today.

1. The Calf Hunt: At minimum, there should be no hunting of calves in their first year.  As a generality, it is increasingly clear that hunting calves puts significant stress on the moose population overall.
2. Cow Tags: Reduce them consistently across Ontario.  To promote survival of calves, the presence of a mother is basic--quite apart from issues of hunting as such.
3. Moose Refuge Areas: Their establishment and legal protection helps relieve pressures from loss of habitat and easy forestry road access.
4. Resources for Enforcement, Monitoring and Research: Should be increased, and in any event not linked to  hunting revenue.
5. Composition of BGMAC: This key body should be more evidently reflective of the province it serves, both in general and in specifics.

As a life long Ontario resident, my opinions and concerns regarding moose are every bit as essential as are those of the special interests (killing for fun and gun lobbies) you've engaged to enhance their special interest.
First year calf killing is wrong and needs to be abolished. A baby moose's weight is much easier to manage than an adults and that's why the killers want to kill babies. Truth be told, killers just want to kill anything but easily managed weight is the reason for the calf kill.
Moose population are in decline while poaching is up. Quotas need to be lowered and enforcement needs to be neither kind nor gentle where illegal wildlife activity occurs. The numbers of Conservation officers needs enhancement and increased legislative powers.
The system is broken to the detriment of both wildlife and the people who enjoy them. The system is continually damaged by self righteous killers (hunters), abusers and the politicians who allow it to happen. This is nothing more than self interest, self serving and on the wrong side of right.

I am an Ontarian and deeply concerned about the OMNRF's ongoing failure to address the decline of moose populations in Ontario, and the entrenched influence of the hunting lobby on the OMNRF's approach to wildlife conservation.
Not only do the OMNRF's proposed changes not go far enough to protect declining moose populations, but its own advisory committee, BGMAC (Big Game Management Advisory Committee), is composed exclusively of males, mostly hunters and outfitters. As such, BGMAC does not represent me or the great diversity of Ontarians who are concerned about moose survival.
Based on clear scientific evidence obtained by NGOs involved in this issue, I submit the following recommendations:
1. A complete stop to the calf hunt:
- research confirms that hunting calves puts additional stress on the moose population.
2. Establishment and protection of refuge areas for moose:
- these are critical to counter habitat loss and provide relief from hunters using forestry roads.
3. More resources for enforcement, monitoring and research:
- because funding is currently dependent on hunting licenses, this can create conflict between conservation and research.
Additionally, I urge the OMNRF either to seek another, more balanced advisory body, or to significantly change the composition of BGMAC and make it representative of all Ontarians. An appropriate advisory committee must necessarily include members of First Nations, university scientists, non-hunting/fishing outdoor enthusiasts, environmental groups and women.

- showing bull/cow ratio numbers received from MNRF a couple years ago to a Zoologist and Wildlife Ecologist: these numbers cannot be right - this system diminishes the species

34141,/comment/34141,"Calf Hunting.  REALLY!  Big Brave Hunter can't be bothered hunting a full grown moose.  Would rather hunt a calf that doesn't have the craft or survival skills to avoid a hunter.  Sounds too much like canned hunting.  No wonder moose  are declining in population.  Blame the wolves and coyotes - especially the coyotes which are to small to tackle a full grown moose.  Shame on those who blame the natural predators of the moose rather than those who are so hungry for a trophy kill.  Killing to fill your larder is understandable.  Killing for sport is reprehensible.

34148,/comment/34148,"Why is there any proposal at all for killing moose calves when there is a concern about declining moose populations - this makes no sense at all.
Further, why were comments solicited from male hunters only? There is a broad population of women and men who are interested in the protection of moose and their calves yet these voices are not being heard.
In all reality there should be more protection for moose rather than less.
In summary we would like to see
- the end of any hunting of calves
- a refuge area established where moose can hide especially with their young
- more resources committed for monitoring and research to get a better sense of the real situation for moose.
- expand the composition of the committee inputting into these decisions to make it more representative.

34150,/comment/34150,"First off we should NOT be killing our Canadian baby moose.  It is absolutely abhorrent that we allow calf hunting of our Canadian baby moose at all.  These animals have a right to life, and we have no right to end it for sport.  It is not a sport to hunt a baby.  We need to end calf hunting completely and immediately.
Second: our moose deserve and require refuge areas.  The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry need to establish such refuge areas and these areas must be protected.  It is your duty and all of our duty as Ontarians and Canadians to protect our beautiful wildlife and give them their space.
Thirdly, to protect our wildlife we must commit more resources for enforcement, monitoring and research.  This is easily within budget since it's a matter of redirecting funding and cutting unnecessary expenses like fancy political dinners and high government employee wages with great increases, so thus not creating new expense.  I'm sure with all such capable minds running our provincial government they can come up with a solution to this urgent matter. The MNRF is part of this government.
Lastly, an important problem lies within the BGMAC: it is not representative of all Ontarians' views, opinions and feelings on this subject.  Changing the composition of BGMAC is the only solution for an accurate representation.  Calling out to the public, making these matters more open and aware to all Ontarians and giving us a chance to be heard before passing resolutions is what's needed and what's required.  For our Canadian moose and other wildlife.

34167,/comment/34167,"Hello,
As a person who takes frequent back country canoe trips in Ontario, I'm concerned about the welfare of all species of wildlife in Ontario and all of Canada. In particular, it has come to my attention that the Moose population in Ontario is rapidly decreasing at an unprecedented level that warrants immediate attention to protect them from further decline. In my opinion, that means protecting their habitat, providing them with safe places to go, and monitoring and enforcing the protection of those places. Considering the urgency of the help they need to increase their population, I think there should also be a ban on hunting them, especially their calves, for a period of time until they have adequately recovered from whatever it is that's causing their numbers to decline so rapidly. But the calf hunt should be especially stopped immediately, and permanently, to ensure the continuation of this important species. Hopefully, more resources will be available to research what is causing the extinction of this species, and more resources will be available to protect their habitat and monitor and enforce protection of them and their habitat. I know we can and MUST do more to help them, and I'd like to see more resources directed toward this purpose. We need to change the composition of BGMAC to be more representative of all Ontarians in order to achieve a successful outcome for Moose in Ontario.

34193,/comment/34193,"Calf tags: I would recommend only holders of a valid cow tag be allowed to harvest the calf as well. Opening the season for calves two weeks after opening day of adult moose was put in place by someone or some group that has very little knowledge of what nature will do to a calf left on its own without the cow (wolf food in a very inhumane fashion in most cases) or at the best case starving during winter. An ethical hunter who encounter cow/calf combinations would harvest the calf first, then the cow as it is very likely going to remain to defend the calf. Harvesting in reverse order would have the calf hiding nearby but out of sight with the possibility of not harvesting the calf themselves but leaving it for the wolves.  Input into wildlife management practices should be left to those with the knowledge to do so, most lobby groups are just that protest without knowledge because they would prefer a slaughter house do the harvesting for them and pick it up at the super market or restaurant. As hunter numbers are much lower than those who do not participate in the sport input from all Ontarians would close all hunting, trapping and fishing in Ontario. It was not sound game management practice that cancelled the Spring bear hunt now was it?

I don't oppose hunting, but I have low confidence that the management of these animals is being done in the interests of their long term sustainability.  I've spent enough time in backcountry areas to know that these animals are under tremendous pressure from hunting/poaching, recreational vehicles, cottages/cabins, logging, and other forms of resource extraction.  I would suggest that we should be creating more sanctuaries to provide the moose with a lower-stress environment to reproduce and maintain populations.  I also don't see how it's sporting to shoot moose calf and think that it should be drastically reduced, and preferably eliminated completely everywhere. More efforts should also be directed at reducing poaching, I personally know hunters who think it's ok to shirk the rules as long as a game warden isn't looking. This attitude is  the reason we need more enforcement.
Even if I don't see the Moose often, I like the idea that they are out there and thriving. There are many more of us non-hunters then there are hunters in this province.

Actually the title should be the Moose HUNTING management plan.  The emphasis is almost entirely on increasing access to moose killing opportunities, including the very calves the Ministry should be protecting in order to slow the catastrophic decline in moose populations.
The recently announced government proposal to increase the hunting of wolves coyotes & other moose predators is so laughably inept and scientifically discredited that if enacted, together with the moose hunting proposals we can kiss both predators and prey goodby in Ontario.
Neither government nor hunters are willing to acknowledge that the insatiable greed of hunters for the thrill of killing a large, herbivorous, edible, and vulnerable animal is one of the proximate causes of its decline.
The other government enabled cause is the wilful disruption of the moose (and caribou) habitats by the various destructive extraction industries, timber, mining, drilling, exploration etc. in search of ever more wealth, and ever less real wilderness.
Both hunters and the government/industrial complex had better haul up their anchors and quit  the scene before they create the veritable ""dead zone"" they seem to be planning.
Every few days we hear of more studies that chart the absolute devastation of wild life, world wide.  Insect life is on the decline (thank you pesticides), amphibians, birds, bats etc. that make their living eating insects are also disappearing, no doubt starving.  Ocean birds, mammals, predator fish are in steep deline as the forage fish are sucked and scooped up by both legal and illegal factory fishing fleets.

I support the effort to make changes to permissible moose hunting in Ontario, but don't believe that the proposed changes go far enough given the dramatic reductions in moose populations.  Twenty years ago, I could look forward to encountering moose regularly when I went into the backcountry.  Now, it is increasingly rare to do so, and I have not been able to share the experience with my children, despite trying for the last four years.  Moose need more protection.

34250,/comment/34250,"Comments on the Moose Management Review in the ERO
I attended a workshop in central Ontario and listened to a number of conversations between MNRF staff and hunters and between hunters. I had an extraordinary discussion with a hunter who clearly understood the intricacies of the moose system, the hunt and the factors that influence the health of the herd and didn’t blame the present health of the herd on “others” or “other factors” but clearly understood the role of harvest in the present state of the herd. I’ve reviewed all of the material on the Environmental Registry and have reviewed forest management plans for moose habitat in the past.
1.	Implementing calf tags
I agree with the implementation of calf tags. This will make full harvest control a possibility. The last link will be non-regulated harvest however that may take some time yet.
2.	Archery seasons for S Ontario/
I support an archery season for the S Ontario units. I may even become an archer in the S. Ontario unit I hunt as tags are hard to get for gun and every cow or calf I have killed in the past 11 years could have been easily harvested with a crossbow. NOTE: my switch to archery if I choose to do so is not a new hunting opportunity, just a converted one.
3.	Separate archery quotas.
What I do not support is a separate archery quota taken from the gun allocation.
What I would support is the present fair draw of tags that occurs in units like WMU 41 where gun and archery hunters have equal chance of drawing a tag through one draw where the applicant indicates whether they wish to have the tag issued as an archery tag or a gun tag.
My concern with implementing archery seasons in S Ontario is that it well might attract many more moose archers to these units from distant units like WMU 21 or 12B etc that require 15-20 hr drives. Units like WMU 47 might see an influx of 1-2,000 archers to a unit that might provide 100 adult tags split between gun and archery in a calf controlled environment. These smaller units may see 100% increases in total hunters with 70% being archers, moreso if existing unit gun hunters begin switching to archery as well.
These are not “new hunting opportunities” they are just relocated or converted hunting opportunities that may well cause social issues amongst the strong local hunt clubs within these moose units.
4.	Cow/calf tags
I support the notion that a hunter with a cow tag should be allowed to harvest a calf and leave the cow as a prime breeder. Hunters may not want to orphan calves so this gives them an option other than searching for a dry cow.
5.	Modest tag application fee
The present license costs $50.29 and generates in excess of $4.2 million dollars in license fees (82,000+ applicants +non applicants). Simple math suggest that $2.1 million will be collected if the application fee is $25. In order to generate the remaining income each adult tag would cost approximately $250 requiring a group of 7 or more to split the cost to break even with the present system. This may be mitigated by the number and price of calf tags and encourages the issuance of more adult tags to mitigate adult tag prices (not entirely a good thing).
6.	Selective harvest system is for cow protection
Nowhere have I ever seen where the selective harvest system was about saving cows. Low density populations require the protection of bulls to ensure adequate levels of fertilization according to the literature. Last time I checked we have lots of low density moose populations in northeastern Ontario.  Bulls are differentially vulnerable particularly in early fall which coincides with the unregulated hunt and are the primary focus of archers, again an earlier hunt.
Misleading hunters into believing moose herds can be managed with low bull densities in the same fashion as deer provides a misunderstanding of the significant differences between the two species.
7.	Tag Transfers
The proposed system allows for a hunter who is unable to hunt for acute medical reasons to refuse a tag and retain his or her points. In point of fact there are no details on the criteria for allowing a transfer in this proposal.
Hunters should be allowed to refuse a tag at any time or for any reason up until the day before the hunt and retain his or her points but not be able to transfer the tag. If they determine they will be unable to hunt early enough they can avail themselves of the first refusal all hunters will be able to use. This makes the tag available for reissue for the second draw.
In this way it removes the need to determine the validity of the request for transfer (medical certificate for acute medical reason vs “diabetes”, death in family, vacation denied etc.) This invariable leads to confrontation with frontline staff, exceptions granted to those who call MPPs etc. All in all the results are bad messaging, poor customer service.
The new system is not a group system and as such there is no designated alternate. Transferring the tag to a party member with low points will be the latest moose hunt game.
8.	Forest Management Plans –from proposal text
“Ensure access is being addressed in moose emphasis area prescriptions to address concerns about potential for high levels of moose harvest mortality in recent cuts.”
Moose emphasis areas must be identified early and often in plans. They must be made mandatory in all plans, make liberal use of prescribed fire for site preparation and road decommissioning rather than access being “addressed” in order to be effective.
“Re-evaluate science on the impacts of spraying glyphosate (forest treatment) on moose, and/or conduct research designed to evaluate glyphosate impacts on moose.”
More use of and evaluation of fire as a means of site preparation with an emphasis on moose habitat. Strategies for moose early stage forage provision within spray areas may be an alternative (ie post harvest leave blocks ). A number of great opportunities exist in northeast Ontario to limit hunter motorized access to the 2018 fire sites, prevent silvicultural activities to recover the “unproductive” lands or to salvage timber(making roads) and to evaluate the value to moose over the next 10 years.
“Ensure forest management prescriptions continue to support WMU-scale moose population objectives that were consulted on and approved in 2016 as part of the Moose Project.”
Typical forest management plans promise early successional forest for moose and other users of this forest type however often the forest industry does not deliver on these objectives due to “market conditions”.
The industry is not held to their non performance on their wildlife objectives to improve the forest condition by forest industry biased auditors who focus on site preparation(spray effectiveness), forest regeneration via spray and plant, road networks and water crossings. Often low value stands such as birch and pulp hardwood stands are not harvested due to “market conditions”, a factor that MNRF allows to outweigh the plan’s forest improvement objectives for wildlife.
“However, there is no reporting on how these prescriptions are applied or how moose populations respond.”
Again a statement in the proposal from observers. There seems to be no evaluation of moose emphasis areas that have been established nor whether they are being established on all forest units that have viable moose populations.
FMP’s are an impenetrable maze of text and tables that seem meant to discourage non industry participation. Separate reporting of the wildlife objectives achievement is required in audits. These results must be provided to wildlife advocates such as moose hunters in any easy to read format.
9.	Enforcement
I would hate to have to enforce the paperwork requirements that will face CO’s when they run into a group. Having all hunters listed on the license will be a nightmare. Too many in a group, penciled in daily hunting partners etc etc.
The more onerous the tasks put on hunters the less likely hunters are to do it or do it well. The only thing moose hunters have learned to do is adapt to the systems to benefit themselves. In the field this aspect of the enforcement task may well be laughed at by officers and deemed field unenforceable. This does little for credibility of the system.

34259,/comment/34259,"Calf tags
No one should be able to harvest calves now without a calf tag, we cannot get adults without maximising our reproduction. Too many stressors on moose. We need to use the tools to grow the moose population, you cannot do that by killing to many calves. Many units in province are seeing major decline which reflects back to lack of available tags. We need to set this up for the future.
New Bow Season
I personally believe that there is way too much emphasis on gun season at the moment and it is affecting our bow season. With so little this leads to more competition with hunters for tags needing very large groups sizes to be guaranteed an archery tag while gun it is only 4-8 hunters in many northern units. More hunters are getting away from the gun hunt and looking at archery opportunities, I’m sure MNR can see this! We need to also see a more consistent allocation approach across the province I would suggest 15-20% of total harvest allocations going towards the archery season to be more fair, reduce competition for tags along with group sizes.
Group Sizes
Group sizes should be around 5-6. I also do think that if hunters want to hunt in a group that their names should all be on the same tag. If it is not, then the person in which their name is not on the tag cannot hunt on that tag.
Point System: I do not support the point system as it is going to penalize people who have been loyal to the current system. It also sounds like a very expensive system to have implemented for really no extreme gain.
Groups Hunting
I believe it’s important to only let people apply for tags in a group. Only a small percentage of tags should be allocated to those who are applying alone. This would still give unsuccessful group hunter applicants a chance of getting a tag in the second round of the draw. We need to get rid of individual hunters to maximise groups in getting tags. The longest running in the group would still get the tag as they do today.

34261,/comment/34261,"Hello,
It is my understanding that moose are on the decline in Ontario. However, the Ontario government still allows calves to be hunted. This does not make sense -- the proposal website even states, ""Calf harvest in these WMUs is currently affecting hunting opportunities for adult moose and is likely impacting recruitment and population growth, contributing to these populations being below the population objective ranges."" How can moose populations return to the ""objective ranges"" if we keep allowing hunting of immature calves who have not yet had the opportunity to reproduce? It makes NO sense.
I am asking the Ontario government to:
* STOP the calf hunt TOTALLY
* START designating some areas as moose habitat protection areas
Thank you.

34264,/comment/34264,"It would seem that Ontario's MNRF doesnt pay attention to the now defunct Environmental Commissioner - specifically, Dianne Saxe's last two reports. The Environmental Commissioner describes in simple terms what needs to be done, and her recommendations arent specific to hunting regulations. In the present 'proposal' there  is no mention of any scientific study. Are there any biologists working for MNRF anymore? How about eliminating ALL HUNTING activity until the MNRF actually understand what is going on - control of disease, elimination or utter fragmentation of moose habitat by mining and forestry? All I see in the proposal is the endless fudging of hunting regulations, or the blaming of bears, wolves and coyotes. I cant believe the MNRF will not stop the hunting of calves?  Living in northwestern Ontario, I cant remember the last time I saw a conservation officer.
Just look at a map of northern Ontario and realise the extent of clear-cutting, cut roads, power lines, pipelines and mining activities of all sorts and ask oneself where moose might exist without human interference? You wont find the required answers from a gang of hunters, foresters or miners.
BUT, the worst joke of all to Ontarian taxpayers is the Big Game Management Advisory Committee. Male hunters calling the shots (yes, pun is intended) on our province's most beloved deer species - moose. Absolutely SHAMEFUL!!

34289,/comment/34289,"Calf tags
I support Calf Tag Control but it should be for the entire province to grow moose populations. No one should be able to harvest calves now without a calf tag, we cannot get adults without maximising our reproduction. This should allow MNR to increase adult tags. Too many stressors on moose, First nation harvest is high, wolf protection along with closure of spring bear hunt increased predation on calves and habitat loss. We need to use the tools to grow the moose population, you cannot do that by killing too many calves. MNR should have implemented calf tags a long time ago which could have fixed some of the tag problems. I agree it is time for calf control to grow populations, but also help hunters to apply in their respective units. CALF TAGS should also be set up on all units in the province now so it can be turned on and off when needed and don’t need to go through a formal review like this one. It should be open to change in the areas that require it, as required.
New Bow Season
Bow season in all units is important to my hunting party. It should be in all the units in the province where there is a gun season, even the far north units that open early for gun (ie 16A,B,C). Right now the system is totally biased towards gun which is really very unfair and I don't agree with! ** Very poor allocations to archery where there is a season of 3-5%. With so little this leads to more competition with hunters for tags needing very large groups sizes to be guaranteed an archery tag while gun it is only 4-8 or less hunters in many northern units. More hunters are getting away from the gun hunt and looking at archery opportunities, I’m sure MNR can see this! With success rates being lower and seasons are much shorter than gun, this could provide more tags. We need to also see a more consistent allocation approach across the province, I would suggest 15-20% of total harvest allocations going towards the archery season to be more fair, reduce competition for tags along with group sizes. We also don’t want to saturate one unit in the province having hunters apply there which can spoil the hunt.
Example for 15B 2019 tag allocations possible outcome of harvested animals using 18 Archery allocated and 308 Gun allocated tags:
Total bull tags for 15B (gun and archery) = 326  ​​​​​​​  Archery bulls @ 18 , even if there was a 100% harvest success rate = 18 dead bulls worst case scenario
Gun bulls @ 308 lets put a 50% success rate = 154 dead bulls best case scenario, that’s leaving another 154 possible bulls getting harvested  during the remainder of the gun hunt season ,that’s 8.5 X the amount of bulls harvested compared to the archery hunt and yet the MNR management in certain units blame the archery hunt for the fall of the moose population in their unit. Its not hard to figure out that is NOT the case. There is a lot of room for increased  archery tag opportunities with smaller group sizes and also increasing the herd size by pulling away some of the gun tags.
As far as Cow archery versus gun there are even less cows harvested during the archery hunt but more during the gun hunt and this is not helping in population growth.
MNR needs educate themselves how much bow hunting has changed across North America
Moose Season
I feel the moose seasons in the northeast and northwest are too long on an individual tag. Why not break them into multiple seasons (4-3 week seasons long each) and apply tags for each? This would help spread people out better , reduce crowding and lower success rate maybe increasing tags. I am sure that MNR knows when hunters are most successful and could apply tags to each season accordingly. Season in south is only 1 week long each for archery and gun, so how can a 12 week season not be hard on tag allocation as it increases chances at filling tags.
Group Sizes
As for group sizes I agree but go farther make archery groups of 4-5 and gun groups of 5-6. Hunters should also apply together in the draw and if their name is not on the tag within the group they cannot hunt on that tag. This would help reduce walk in hunters, my understanding this increases success rates and can reduce tags in the long run.
Point System
As for the point system I cannot support. This will bring hunters back into the draw system that have either quit applying or have been applying in units that have no tags for many years. Hunters that have followed the system and have gone to units where there are tags may now be penalized through the new system as proposed. Or it will allow hunters with the most points to go into units surrounding their normal place of applying and put more pressure on those units and the hunters that stay within. It also sounds confusing leading to more frustration to hunters and more complaints. On top the cost will be high to create a new system.
I also see this affecting the youth in getting a tag, I believe that people like me may go a decade or so without seeing a tag or an opportunity which is not right!  The province should keep the current system since it is working but maybe tweak to best fit tag allocations with the new proposals put forth.
It doesn’t make sense to build a new system at this time. It is only costing this province unnecessary dollars.
Groups Hunting
This date and time no hunter should be applying in the moose draw alone. Consider giving /applying tags to groups as a priority allocation. If it is so important that a hunter wants to apply alone then make an allocation very small to them say 15-20% of total allocation. The system would be set up as now that allocates to group hunters first process and the last remaining up to 20% of the tags would then be made available go to unsuccessful groups along with individual applicants. This would still give unsuccessful group hunter applicants a chance of getting a tag in the second round of the draw.
We need to get rid of individual applicants to maximise groups in getting tags. The longest running in the group would still get the tag as they do today.

I also believe we need increased transparency in our draw system, to maintain hunter confidence, and consequently, participation.
In reference to the preference point system, I am familiar with the methods of other jurisdictions, particularly in Western North America, and I believe this will bring us in line with recognized best-practice.

Stop shooting cows as they are what will bring more moose into our forests. Until the ministry has the moose in their best interests, we will always struggle to maintain a ""harvestable"" population. Unfortunately budget and making money is much more important than the health of our ungulates in this province. Just look at how seriously all the western provinces and territories take their big game hunting.

Ontario’s moose population is under threat.  Your government must act with urgency to protect moose and ensure a healthy, thriving population of this nationally important species.
The government’s proposal to ease restrictions on wolf and coyote hunting is unethical and unscientific. There is no scientific evidence that increased wolf and coyote hunting will address moose population decline in Ontario. To the contrary, the Ministry’s own scientific evidence shows that hunting wolves will not decrease overall predation of moose. Eastern coyotes are not even significant predators of moose.
Wolves, coyotes, and moose have been co-existing and co-evolving in a predator-prey dynamic for thousands of years. The real threats to Ontario’s moose populations are human-made: habitat loss, climate change, and human hunting, including hunting of calves in particular.
Easing regulations around wolf and coyote hunting, including by removing requirements for reporting and special game seals, and extending the coyote hunting season, is irresponsible and contrary to the Ministry’s mandate to protect our biodiversity. The MNRF should strengthen reporting requirements and enforcement, and ensure it is managing Ontario’s ecosystems in a manner that promotes healthy, sustainable ecosystems.
I urge the government to take urgent action on the real threats to Ontario’s moose population, by protecting moose habitat and ending moose calf hunting in this province. Apex predators such as wolves and coyotes play a vital role in maintaining biodiversity and are living, sentient beings that deserve our respect and compassion.

• End the calf hunt.  Even with new restrictions, Ontario will still be in the minority of jurisdictions
allowing the harvest of calves in their first year.  Research is confirming that hunting calves puts
additional stress on the moose population. It is time to phase it out.
• Reduce cow tags consistently across the province. Without a mother to protect and guide a calf for the first year of its life, its chances of survival are limited, even if it is not taken by a hunter.
• Establish and protect moose refuge areas. These areas would provide relief from loss of habitat, and
from the easy access that forestry roads provide for hunters. New legally protected areas should be part of the solution.
• Commit more resources for enforcement, monitoring and research that are not tied to hunting revenue.   MNRF budgets continue to be slashed and funding is dependent on hunting licenses which can create a conflict between conservation and research.  As it stands now, when hunting tags need to be cut, there are fewer dollars to fund increasingly needed research.
• The composition of BGMAC needs to be more representative of Ontario.  It needs to include
Indigenous People, university scientists, non-consumptive outdoor enthusiasts, environmental groups and women. Currently it consists of male hunters, outfitters, retired MNRF employees and an
Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunter biologist.

To Whom It May Concern:
Comments re ERO numbers 019-0405 and 019-0406
Recommendation:
We recommend that the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry:
1.	Stop the implementation of the changes proposed by Big Game Management Advisory Committee (BGMAC) in ERO numbers 019-0405 and 019-0406; and
2.	Before implementing the proposed changes to moose hunting for 2020 and 2021, implement a strategy that will protect the moose population by:
a)	Phasing out calf hunting;
b)	Limiting the use of all-terrain vehicles during the hunt;
c)	Ending party hunting and reducing the length of the hunt to 4 weeks;
d)	Continuing to monitor moose populations in relation to the changing climate; and
e)	Managing habitat at the ecosystem level to protect all moose and other wild species, monitor the     effects of climate change on all wildlife, including range changes, increased parasite loads, altered vegetation, invasive plant species and wildfire patterns.
Background:
We are writing to express our opposition to the recommendations made in ERO number 019-0405 and 019-0406. The Ontario’s Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is revisiting a proposal to liberalize hunting of wolves and coyotes across 750,000 km2 of northern Ontario.
Thousands of Ontario residents opposed a similar proposal in 2016 because of its lack of a scientific rationale demonstrating that killing wolves and coyotes would  boost dwindling moose populations.  At that time the previous government abandoned the proposal.
1.	BGMAC Report:
This time the BGMAC has recommended a similar proposal based on hunter concerns about wolf predation on moose.
In Recommendation #14 BGMAC states that “MNRF should address hunter concerns about the potential impacts of predation on moose populations to complement efforts to restrict hunter harvest”.  BGMAC recommendations include removing the game seal requirement for wolves and coyotes and eliminating the bag limit for coyotes in northern Ontario (WMU 1- 37).  It also recommends reviewing the harvest limit of two wolves per hunter per year in these WMUs to ensure that it is scientifically supported, not unnecessarily restrictive and sufficient to result in positive effects on the moose, elk and caribou population. (files.ontario.ca/mnrf-moose-management-review-bgmac-recommendations-report-2019-08-09.pdf)
The BGMAC report presents no population data for wolves, coyotes or moose or number of animals killed by hunters.  The report cites no studies or scientific research papers that would support such a recommendation.  Yet this exact recommendation is now posted on the Environmental Registry for public comment.
2.	Ministry position does not support the BGMAC recommendation:
a)	Wolves:
Studies conducted by Ministry staff show that killing wolves does not ensure increased moose populations.  The document entitled, “Factors that affect moose survival”, found on the Ministry’s web site, calls into question the efficacy of such proposals.  Under the sub-heading, “Results of wolf removal”, the Ministry makes the following statements:  (https://www.ontario.ca/page/factors-affect-moose-survival):
“The number of moose killed per wolf pack will not significantly decrease as the pack size is reduced, so removing just a few wolves from each pack will not decrease overall predation on moose. Only the removal of an entire pack can substantially reduce predation but this practice may not be ecologically or socially desirable. Changing hunting and trapping regulations to allow more wolves to be harvested is unlikely to remove an entire pack. Pack removal often requires intensive removal techniques such as aerial gunning or poisoning applied over several years. Only in limited circumstances may small reductions in pack size result in minor reductions in predation that benefit moose populations in localized areas.
“Some provinces and states have undertaken wolf control efforts. After control measures were discontinued, wolf populations in Alaska, British Columbia, Quebec and Yukon soon recovered to pre-control levels. For example, in the Papineau-Labelle Wildlife Reserve in Quebec, wolf numbers recovered to previous levels less than a year after a 71% reduction in wolf numbers. Once wolf populations recover, moose populations typically return to pre-control levels.
“The Strategy for Wolf Conservation in Ontario directs wolf management in the province. The goal of wolf management is to ensure ecologically sustainable wolf populations and the ecosystems on which they rely for the continuous ecological, social, cultural and economic benefit of the people of Ontario. Achieving this goal requires the consideration of both ecological and social values and interests.”
The recommendation by the BGMAC is entirely at odds with the Ministry whose studies showed that killing individual wolves would simply not reduce predation on the moose population and that changes to hunting and trapping regulations to allow more wolves to be killed would not reduce predation for the very same reason.
b)	Coyotes:
In addition, eastern coyotes are not major predators of moose.  Under the section on “Factors affecting moose survival”, the Ministry sites wolves, not coyotes, as predators of moose.
Since the Ministry’s own website states that coyotes are not listed as having an impact on moose populations.  The question becomes why is the BGMAC and the Minister targeting coyotes for increased killing?  All indications are that BGMAC is using the guise of moose conservation to appease hunters who incorrectly see coyotes and wolves as competition for moose.
c)	Moose:
The Ministry’s own website clearly identifies the impact of hunting on moose populations by comparing the difference between hunting moose in the early 1980s and today.  The chart below shows that there are very real hunting issues that it are detrimental to the moose population.  These issues need to be addressed.  They include:  a longer hunting season; increased road access in many WMUs; more use of all-terrain vehicles are now commonly used; hunting parties are allowed; the calf harvest, which was limited in the 1980s is now substantial in many WMUs; and hunter success rate has increased substantially.

(Source:ontario.ca/page/factors-affect-moose-survival#section-4)
NOTE:  There are moose population numbers but not the
number of moose killed by hunters.
Moose hunting trends in Ontario:  Moose hunting has changed a great deal since the early 1980s, when the selective harvest system was introduced. Hunting success rates for moose are higher today. As a result, fewer adult validation tags can be issued today to achieve the same level of moose harvest.

Conclusion
The BGMAC provides no population data or scientific papers to support its recommendations to increase the wolf and coyote hunt and since the Ministry states that such hunting will not reduce wolf predation on moose and since coyotes are not significant predators of moose, we urge the Minister to adopt our recommendations and implement a comprehensive moose protection programme.
The BGMAC has not addressed the changes in moose hunting identified by the MNRF.  We urge the Minister to address those issues before trying to determine how many moose can be killed during the moose hunting season.

For purpose of population dont extend the calf season either remove it or yes make it as an application process for calf do not give everyone the right to calf. For adult moose in some wmu's where the population is low ok go to point system and restrict the amount of tags. 1c for example is a northern area that not everyone is willing to travel too leave it as is. Restrict the areas with low moose population and high resisdence but for people who are willing to go the distance. Restrict parties to maximum of 10 and leave the regulations as is but to lengthen calf seasons and go to a point system is not the answer on rebuilding the moose population in Ontario. I believe there are better ways to keep hunters happy and plenty of moose in Ontario.

2. Reducing the distance to 3km, should be abandoned - current use of 5 km is adequate, considering the current range of radios in the field.

4. Reducing the gun tags to accommodate bow tags shouldn't proceed - there is precious little opportunity for gun tags as it is.
5.  Agree that the Northern resident priority be dropped.
6. Agree that relative of residents, should not have priority over resident hunters.
7. Disagree with this   -   Moose hunting licence: Change the moose hunting licence to a product that allows hunting of moose but does not come with a tag that would allow the harvest of a moose. This would allow applicants who are unsuccessful in, or who do not apply to, the tag allocation process to party hunt for moose on another hunter’s tag.
8. Disagree  with this, without rational being supplied   -  Allow a hunter to apply to the moose tag allocation process with a modest application fee. The hunter would not be required to purchase their moose hunting licence to apply for a tag.

34486,/comment/34486,"I support the 3 tag system of Bull, Cow/calf and, Calf, with the calf tag extending for the whole hunting season.
Moose licence without a tag is supported.
Preference point system:
I do not support this. I feel the current group process is working effectively and this proposal may only benefit people interested in applying individually. Hunters generally hunt in a group! It is and has been a family tradition for many generations.  If this is proposal is to go through, I feel that Northern Ontario residents hunting in Northern Ontario units should be given an extra point or half point and that point carried over for future years. This could further be broken down to MNRF Regions (northwest, north east instead of 1-42).
The choice of not accepting the tag if granted is great and would support ethical hunting standards of a “Group”. However, if the hunter should be given the chance to not accept the tag through out the primary, and 2nd chance allocation (including second and third choice).
How would you address a tag transfer for people hunting an legitimate hunting group? – says exceptional circumstances for tag transfers?
Hunting party distance should remain at 5km – as you must be contactable anyways.

Agreed to eliminate opportunities for non-resident land owners.

34510,/comment/34510,"The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) is Ontario’s largest non-profit, conservation-based organization, representing 100,000 members, supporters, and subscribers, and 740 member clubs. We have reviewed the Proposed changes to moose management as part of the Moose Management Review and submit the following comments for consideration. Moose hunters have been voicing their dissatisfaction with the current system and advocating for change for years. We appreciate the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) prioritizing this review.
Moose are the premier big game animal in the province and are hunted across most of Ontario’s landmass. Moose hunters come from a wide range of backgrounds and traditions and employ a variety of moose hunting techniques. Therefore, the proposed changes to moose management will impact different hunters in different ways. As the voice of hunters in Ontario, it is the responsibility of the OFAH to ensure that the thoughts and concerns of all moose hunters are heard and considered as part of the Moose Management Review. If the proposed changes to moose hunting are adopted, the OFAH expects to be involved in the development and implementation process to ensure that the final system is hunter-friendly, results in increased hunting opportunities and benefits to moose populations, and does not present any barriers to participation.
Communication
We fully agree with the Big Game Management Advisory Committee’s (BGMAC) position that clear and widespread communication is of utmost importance. Much of the dissatisfaction among moose hunters stems from a misunderstanding about the system that is currently in place. Without a coordinated effort to educate hunters on these changes and how they will be affected specifically, this misunderstanding will persist, resulting in a moose hunter population that is no more satisfied than it currently is even if the changes are ultimately positive. This communication challenge is further exacerbated by the fact that the changes to moose hunting will be coming on the heels of the implementation of the new licensing system, which has resulted in a significant amount of confusion and dissatisfaction among hunters (with specific issues related to the big game draws).
While it is the responsibility of the hunter to be informed, the MNRF has a responsibility to ensure that they are communicating through mechanisms that effectively reach their intended audiences. As pointed out in the BGMAC report and supported by our own experience, many hunters rely almost exclusively on the Hunting Regulations Summary (HRS) for MNRF-published information. We strongly recommend that the MNRF make the HRS the foundation of all communication strategies around the proposed changes to moose hunting. Additional moose information could be added to the summary in its current format or all moose-related information could be printed separately as a stand-alone supplement containing regulations, seasons, draw information, and any changes or updates. This would also be an ideal vehicle for the MNRF to share information on hunter point histories, assuming the preference point system is implemented as proposed. We see several advantages with this approach. First, it would eliminate the need to delay publishing the HRS until after the moose tags quotas were finalized. Second, it would shorten the overall length of the summary, recognizing that not all hunters in Ontario hunt moose. Finally, it would provide the MNRF with a dedicated communications vehicle to engage moose hunters and refer them to when questions arise. It would be the responsibility of the MNRF to ensure that the summary/supplement is readily available to hunters, including as a hardcopy, recognizing that many hunters do not own or even use a computer. Reducing misunderstandings and addressing the lack of awareness will dramatically improve hunter satisfaction and smooth the implementation of any changes to moose hunting in the province.
New bowhunting seasons and quotas
The OFAH continuously advocates for additional sustainable moose hunting opportunities, whether for guns, bows, or muzzle-loaders. In 2018, we pushed for the creation of separate archery tag allocations in Wildlife Management Units (WMU) where they currently do not exist, so we are pleased to see this included in the proposal. We also advocated for expanding the open calf season to the bows-only season due to the historically low harvest of calves by bowhunters. While bowhunting of calves would be possible under the new selective harvest approach and the opportunity likely welcomed by bowhunters, we do have concerns about that approach that we outline in the following section of this submission. Furthermore, we ask that the MNRF closely examine the timing of any new seasons in order to ensure that the dates allow for the greatest participation in the new hunting opportunities.
The amount of support among moose hunters for creating separate bowhunting seasons and quotas where they do not currently exist is directly tied to their preferred hunting method. Gun hunters have serious and legitimate concerns about the loss of even a few gun tags, especially in WMUs where tags have been reduced in recent years. This is balanced with the increasing demand by bowhunters for new opportunities and the ability to create more hunting opportunities per allocated animal due to the lower tag fill rates associated with bowhunting. Care should be taken to prevent creating additional conflict between subsets of the moose hunting community.
This proposal should benefit both groups of hunters. By reallocating relatively few animals from the gun hunt to the bow hunt, hunting opportunities will increase overall. We can also reasonably expect some gun hunters to convert to bowhunting in order to take advantage of these new opportunities, and this should reduce competition for the remaining gun tags. One OFAH member’s suggestion to motivate gun hunters to convert to bowhunting would be to allow bows-only tags to be used during all moose seasons, provided the hunter is using bowhunting equipment. This would maintain the lower tag fill rates associated with bowhunting while providing the major enticement of more days afield. Safety concerns would be negated by the existing requirement for bowhunters to wear hunter orange during an ongoing big game gun season and enforcement would be feasible due to the distinctive difference in wound channels arising from guns, bows, and crossbows.
As with all aspects of the proposed changes, the MNRF’s efficacy at communicating the new bowhunting opportunities and their overall benefits will determine their acceptance by hunters.
Calf harvest controls and the new selective harvest approach
The core of the new selective harvest approach is the establishment of a province-wide calf validation tag (CVT) system in 2021 and interim measures in some WMUs in 2020. Therefore, we feel that it is appropriate to address these two proposed changes together.
The low likelihood of a bull tag holder choosing to use that tag to harvest a calf and the existing ability to tag a calf with a cow tag means that those specific changes will not have a large impact on the moose hunting community. However, the subject of calf hunting is a polarizing issue among moose hunters. Some moose hunters have loudly called for a provincial moratorium on calf hunting due to perceived sustainability challenges and personal hunting ethics, while others oppose restrictions due to lost hunting opportunities. In reality, the current calf hunting system is likely resulting in unsustainable harvest in some WMUs and no conservation concerns in others. Past efforts by the MNRF to address calf harvest through reduced seasons lengths were only temporarily successful and have led to a high degree of dissatisfaction among hunters who question the logic of being allowed to harvest a cow but not the accompanying calf. High calf harvest (in some WMUs it comprises 70-100% of the total allowable harvest) has resulted in limited adult hunting opportunities and the risk of overharvest, especially in those WMUs identified in the proposal as candidates for the 2020 calf harvest restrictions.
The implementation of calf validation tags in WMUs 48, 55A, 55B and 57 has displaced the calf harvest into neighbouring WMUs and the proposed 2020 measures will almost certainly have the same effect in Central Ontario. Rather than the MNRF continuing to implement calf validation tags in an ad hoc manner, there is logic in establishing calf validation tags provincially to prevent this displacement of harvest from occurring and new calf-related problems from arising. However, we have significant concerns that without clear calf quota setting guidelines, calf harvest and hunting opportunity will be unnecessarily restricted, especially given the lack of consistency in moose management between MNRF regions. While the MNRF has committed to working with BGMAC to establish guidelines under the proposed selective harvest system, those guidelines do not exist as part of this consultation process and, therefore, the manner in which the provincial CVT will be implemented cannot be fully assessed. Furthermore, the MNRF lacks crucial data on variables such as calf hunting participation and tag fill rates that will be needed to accurately set calf tag quotas. Acknowledging that there are WMUs where concerns about calf harvest will require immediate action, we recommend that if the MNRF does implement a province-wide CVT, they do so in a conservative fashion. This would allow crucial data to be collected and ensure that hunting opportunities are not unnecessarily restricted, while addressing sustainability concerns where they arise. There are WMUs where there is no concern with unsustainable calf harvest and where restricting calf harvest would not significantly increase adult hunting opportunities. In these WMUs, applicant success rate in the CVT allocation process should be set at 100% for a three-year period, which is the minimum time period the MNRF uses to assess factors such as harvest and tag fill rate. This would allow the MNRF to collect the data needed for setting calf harvest quotas and ensure that the new selective harvest approach is based on a solid scientific foundation. In reality, the WMU-specific nature of the CVT will almost certainly restrict calf harvest on its own as hunters are no longer able to hunt calves across multiple WMUs. If the allocation of calf tags is unnecessarily restricted below 100% upon implementation in 2021, the MNRF would lose the opportunity to identify which of these two competing factors (geographic restriction in harvest or restriction in allocated tags) was responsible for limiting calf harvest.
We are also concerned that the new selective harvest approach will limit wolf and coyote hunting opportunities by requiring hunters to apply for a moose tag even if they have no intention to hunt for moose. The Hunting Regulations Summary states that “hunters wishing to use a centre-fire rifle to hunt wolf or coyote during the seasons for a big game species (other than bows-only seasons for deer south of the French and Mattawa rivers) must have a valid licence for the relevant big game season.” We assume that the vast majority of wolf and coyote hunters use centre-fire rifles and under the proposed changes all tags will be distributed through the allocation process; therefore, being unsuccessful in the moose allocation would likely mean a hunter cannot hunt wolves for a significant portion of the fall in Northern Ontario. We have explained these concerns in more detail in our submission to ERO 019-0406 Proposed changes to wolf and coyote hunting regulations in Northern Ontario.
Implementing a selective harvest approach that includes calf validation tags will significantly limit hunting opportunities, especially for those hunters who hunt alone and/or in areas with high hunter:tag ratios. While hunters are conservationists and will accept restrictions in order to address real concerns about sustainability, it is the responsibility of the MNRF to ensure that hunter opportunities are not restricted more than is required to address these concerns. Furthermore, the MNRF must ensure that the expected benefit of additional adult hunting opportunities arising from the CVT is fully realized for hunters. In the past, moose hunters have accepted restrictions based on the promise of future adult hunting opportunities that never materialized.
Moose hunting licence and separate product pricing
The creation of a separate moose hunting licence that would allow a hunter to party hunt on another hunter’s tag is absolutely essential if the MNRF chooses to implement the new selective harvest approach. For decades, a calf tag has accompanied every resident moose licence. The fact that a calf tag is no longer included will need to be very clearly communicated by the MNRF to avoid the inadvertent harvest of calves in 2021 by hunters who are unaware of the change.
The proposal to make the application fee, moose hunting licence, and tags separate products with individual pricing will address concerns voiced by many hunters about having to pay the full licence cost year after year with no success in the current adult tag draw. Conversely, many hunters have raised concerns about moose hunting becoming a sport “for the rich” or about the potential loss of revenue to the MNRF’s Special Purpose Account and, therefore, less resources available for moose management. The exact fee structure is not included in the proposed changes, making it impossible to weigh these concerns. However, recognizing that the revenue from licence sales funds wildlife management in the province, any fee structure imposed should be carefully examined to ensure that it does not create financial barriers to participation in moose hunting.
Preference point system
The proposed preference point system has generally positive support from moose hunters. Many have expressed support because it would address one of the major points of frustration of the current two pool random draw - the fact that some hunters receive adult tags more frequently through random chance. Moving to a preference point system resolves this by ensuring that no hunter applying for a specific tag in each WMU receives that tag twice before every other hunter receives it once. This system also provides greater certainty about when a hunter is likely to receive a tag. However, this certainty in timing has also been seen as a negative by some hunters, especially those in WMUs where the hunter:tag ratio for preferred tags is high. Hunters have interpreted this to mean that they are guaranteed to not receive a tag for years. They feel that this will cause older hunters to stop hunting under the belief that they will never receive another tag in their lifetime and be a barrier to new hunters who think they will have to wait decades for a tag. These concerns will be somewhat offset by additional adult hunting opportunities created under the new selective harvest approach and the ability to associate with tags held by other moose hunters, but this is a very real concern of hunters that will need to be directly addressed by the MNRF should this change proceed. In reality, the perceived unlikelihood of receiving an adult tag in many WMUs under the current system is a major contributing factor to declining moose hunting participation over the past 5-10 years. We do support the random allocation component of the second chance allocation as it should continue to provide new hunters access to lower demand tags and encourage hunter recruitment. It will also eliminate the need for the surplus tag system.
We are concerned that the proposed two-stage process for allocating tags will be seen by hunters as too complex when many do not fully understand the current system. Some of the proposed mechanisms are not fully explained, making it difficult to assess how the system would function. As repeated throughout this submission, this will require significant communication efforts to ensure that hunters understand both how the system works and know how to apply properly. There were considerable issues with hunters applying to the 2019 moose draw under the new license system and this will likely be magnified as a new allocation process is implemented on top of a new licensing system that is still experiencing growing pains.
One of the main benefits of the current group application system is that it allows hunters to apply together, ensuring that they do not receive more tags than they want and creating a better distribution of tags among hunters. A similar benefit can be achieved under the proposed preference point system and associated allocation process as hunters have the option to either make a null selection (equivalent to the current 99Z option) or choose not to claim a tag they are allocated. However, this requires much more coordination and planning on the part of the hunter and seems contradictory to the goal of making the draw simpler for hunters. While the preference point system removes the random aspect of the allocation and thereby negates the need for hunters to apply as a group to increase their chance of receiving a tag, there remains value in maintaining the group application component from an organizational standpoint. Hunters could choose to apply as a group and if the group member with the highest number of points meets the requirement for the desired tag, that member receives the tag, forfeits their points and all other members are removed from the allocation but still accumulate a point.
Relying on hunters to not claim tags will likely result in high value tags going unallocated as multiple high point members of a hunting party apply to both the primary and second chance allocations and only one member claims a tag. This situation could partially be addressed by emphasizing that hunters who do not wish to receive a tag in a given year, such as in the case of them not being the point leader in their party, should select the null selection; however, this will require additional communication efforts and will likely be only partially successful. Maintaining a group application component is a much simpler way to ensure that tags are being allocated to hunters who will claim them.
Tag transfers
Moose hunters have been expressing concerns about ghost hunters and will largely welcome the proposed restrictions in tag transfers to address this. If the government proceeds with implementing an application fee, tag transfer restrictions are a necessary step. We would oppose any move to eliminate tag transfers entirely as emergencies do happen, especially medical emergencies related to an aging hunter population. Since transfers would only occur in extreme circumstances, we strongly feel that the recipient of the transfer should forfeit their points, rather than the original tag holder. The administration of these tag transfers would be greatly simplified if the MNRF retained a group application component as outlined above.
A potential ancillary benefit of the proposed tag transfer restrictions is that it may convert ghost hunters into actual moose hunters. Based on past application histories, many ghost hunters will likely have competitive point totals. With transfers no longer a feasible option and Ontario’s party hunting rules requiring that the tag holder actively participate in the hunt, this could get these hunters into the field. Hunting is an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling experience and many who experience it for the first time are engaged for life.
Party hunting rules
We acknowledge that Ontario has very liberal party hunting rules which may lead to high tag fill rates and fewer tags per allocated animal. However, any restrictions on party hunting must be well supported by scientific evidence demonstrating that they will have the desired effect. As stated earlier, in the past moose hunters in Ontario have accepted restrictions based on the promise of more adult hunting opportunities in the future that never materialized.
Welcomed by some hunters who have concerns over large group sizes, the proposed restrictions on party hunting size has caused serious concern among others, especially among moose hunters who hunt from large, established hunt camps. Many of these camps have more than ten members and their size is often a direct response to the MNRF’s incentivising of group hunting through the Guaranteed Group and Large Group Allocation components of the current system. However, our members clearly communicated to us the need to balance two different types of hunting opportunities - by receiving a tag directly versus being associated with another hunter’s tag. Restricting hunting party size may increase opportunity through the creation of more tags, but it will also limit opportunity by preventing hunters from hunting as a group, a practice with important traditions beyond the direct act of hunting. Additionally, capping hunting sizes may impede hunter recruitment by limiting the opportunity for existing groups to add new members to their party. The lack of detail about how the restriction would be enforced has caused significant uncertainty among hunters, making it difficult for them to develop an informed opinion. Even questions as basic as “how is hunting party defined?” are unanswerable. Enforcement of the hunting party size restrictions was clearly laid out in the BGMAC report but is absent from the MNRF proposal. Prior to the implementation of any hunting party size restrictions, the MNRF must clearly define and communicate what a hunting party is and how any restrictions would be enforced.
While the MNRF has some evidence that reducing hunting party size will lower tag fill rates, to our knowledge no such data exists to predict the impact of reducing the maximum distance from the tag holder from 5 km to 3 km. Assuming that the tag holder is located in the centre of the party, this reduces the  maximum area that can be hunted on a single tag from approximately 79 km2 to 28 km2. This is a significant reduction and hunters have voiced safety concerns about concentrating hunters into such a small area. If any reduction is adopted, the new maximum distance should be clearly defined in regulation to be “as the crow flies” as there has been some reported inconsistency in the application of the current 5 km limit by conservation officers.
Non-residents hunting opportunities
The OFAH does not have any concerns about the proposed changes to non-resident moose hunting opportunities. Our position remains that resident hunting opportunities must be prioritized over those of non-residents.
General exceptions and special circumstances
There are individual WMUs with unique moose hunting situations that may not integrate well with the proposed changes, such as moose hunting in Bruton and Clyde Townships in Algonquin Park or special opportunities for hunters with lower limb disabilities in WMUs 11B and 65. It is our hope that these unique situations will continue under the new system.
Proposed three-year review
The OFAH fully agrees with BGMAC on the need to review all changes within three years to ensure that they are operating as intended and delivering the expected benefits to both moose and moose hunters in Ontario. This review should include consultation with hunters and all benefits, concerns, and required changes must be clearly communicated.
Additional BGMAC recommendations not covered in the proposed changes
In the ERO posting, the MNRF commits to continue to work with BGMAC and act on their other recommendations. The OFAH intends to hold the MNRF to this promise as the BGMAC report addresses issues that are of vital importance to moose hunters, such as ensuring the protection and creation moose habitat, increased local hunter engagement and consultation, more funding for moose research, addressing concerns about the impact of predation on moose populations, and engaging Indigenous communities as partners in sustainable moose management.
There remain significant challenges in ensuring a sustainable moose population that can provide benefits to the people of Ontario for generations to come. This can only be addressed by considering all factors that influence moose and not solely focussing on licensed hunters. Many aspects of the proposed changes are steps in the right direction, especially with regards to ensuring continued hunter engagement, but there remains much work to be done. The OFAH stands ready as a partner with the MNRF to achieve this.
Thank you for considering these comments.

34527,/comment/34527,"It was clear in ERO 019-0405 that the only persons the Ministry consulted in the formation of this proposal were hunters and those who benefit financially from them.  This is neither an appropriate nor ethical method of forming wildlife policy in Ontario.  It should not be the policy of an Ontario Government Agency to formulate policy which runs contrary to the views and values of most of Ontario's citizens.
The cruelty of hunting, using ATVs, calf hunting, party hunting which will likely include alcohol and peer pressure, and the intensive fear sustained in wildlife during the prolonged hunting periods are all ignored by your Ministry, and display a lack of compassion and humanity which is a part of most citizens of Ontario.  Cruelty to animals is not accepted as normal or valuable in our 21st Century society, and the vast majority of Ontario citizens do not support it.
The BGMAC report provides no population data for wolves, coyotes or moose.  It also provides no data on the number of animals killed by hunters.  This report appears to have no scientific support, since it cites no studies or scientific research papers which would support its recommendations.  It is therefore despicable that instead of seeking science-based recommendations and clarification from BGMAC, your Ministry has posted this exact recommendation on the province’s Environmental Registry for public comment.  Before any recommendation is considered, unbiased scientific research should always be conducted!  Otherwise, your Ministry holds no credibility or ethical validity.
The only other rational conclusion one can draw from the proposed changes to the hunting of coyotes, wolves and moose is that hunters want the moose for themselves, and not for the natural predators of moose, and their demand for moose hunting supercedes any concern they should have for the either the animals or their ecology.
If you believe that the moose population is too low, you should be addressing the activities that are known to affect moose, like ATV use, the length of the hunting season and the hunting of calves.
I urgently request that you listen to the facts and not those who treat our wilderness dwellers as disposable.
I profoundly urge you to consider the ethics of this proposal, and then, instead, move to implement a strategy that will protect the moose population by:
.Phasing out calf hunting;
.Limiting the use of all-terrain vehicles during the hunt;
.Ending party hunting and reducing the length of the hunt to 4 weeks;
.Continuing to monitor moose populations in relation to the changing climate; and
.Managing habitat at the ecosystem level to protect all moose and other wild species, monitor the
 effects of climate change on all wildlife, including range changes, increased parasite loads, altered
 vegetation, invasive plant species and wildfire patterns.

I am glad to hear the Government are taking some steps to help with the dwindling moose population but I am worried it is too little to make a sufficient impact and I would not want to see attempts taken too late.
1. End the calf hunt altogether.
2. Protect the natural lands.  Roads and buildings encroaching upon moose habitat must be protected. We keep building until we have nothing left for wildlife including moose leftto go.
3. I worry about the impact hunters and their interests/influence have on decisions. Hunting licenses and tags create revenue which seems counterproductive to conservation when the population is threatened. I have absolutely nothing against hunting even considered getting a hunting license myself but we need balanced and scientific decisions. When money comes into the equation sadly the best outcomes are not always met. Have you consulted withthe Indigenous people? Scientists?
I hope the action to save the moose are aggressive enough to actually reverse the declining population and bring them back to past populations.

Pay to apply then purchase a separate tag will hurt low income people such as myself who have to save for a couple of years to hunt moose. Varying the price of the tags with bull the highest, cow middle etc will stress one particular type as most will opt for the cheaper tags. Moose are moose, price them the same.  Definitely lower the distance to 3 k from 5 k. This will help stop hunter confusion on multiple animals being harvested incorrectly and will open the door to more land being available to other hunters with out encroaching on a sitting hunter already present.
With the 3 WMU choices, hunter is unsuccessful in choice 1 but is for choice 2 they loose half points. If successful in 3rd choice but not the first 2 choices they only loose one quarter. All numbers rounded down to nearest whole number.

Their unmentioned growing harvest and what seems to be totally unregulated is unfair to the rest of us. Access to moose hunting opportunities should include all of us fairly . The conservation officers I've spoken to are as frustrated as we the hunters are with this privileged access. An ignored fact. Another fact is the very reason subsistence hunting was allowed is rarely necessary. To provide much needed food. Most people carrying status cards are of mixed European and native descent practicing none of their culture other than a government appointed privilege to hunt unregulated. They should be under the same laws surrounding hunting as the rest of us unless survival is involved. The native and metis men I've known never asked for special privilege while working in this country or while being part of our armed forces. When people talk of culture , tradition and rights we all have them too. But being a 9th generation Canadian who's forefathers ate moose meat doesn't give me privileges, why should it.

I strongly oppose limiting the hunting group size to 10. I have been hunting with my extended family for a while. Our family has been making this a cultural tradition for years. We camp outdoors in the Fall with our family (husbands, wives, children, grandparents). Most apply for a tag and are part of the hunt, but we also use this time to teach our children about respecting the bush, nature and the wildlife. We teach the children not to destroy nature. The older adults teach the youth the safety aspects of hunting. Every year we also pick up garbage left behind by others. Camping in the fall and enjoying the outdoors in part of our tradition. Limiting the size of the group will prevent us from doing that. It will prevent part of the family from going out. How do we choose who is in the group? This will ultimately force women, youth and elders out of the group and they would be most likely to give up their spot.
I strongly oppose the maximum distance to be apart at only 3 km. I think that could be potentially dangerous as it may force hunters to hunt too close to each other and risk a disastrous accidental shooting.
And a general comment I have is that the future evaluation of the proposed plan will not be accurate as you are changing so many variables at once. How will you know which variable did or did not result in a change in the harvest?

2) Moose Management Review: Recommendations to the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry on Moose Management.
By far, the biggest concern with the proposed changes to the moose allocation draw is the proposed introduction of a tag draw that will be based on a point system! In its report, the Big Game Management and Advisory Committee (BGMAC) makes reference to the unfairness of the current group application and moose tag allocation system, particularly the use of ""ghost applicants"" that is allegedly employed by some moose hunting groups in Ontario. I understand the concerns of the BGMAC in this regard. However, if memory serves me correct, was it not both the MNRF and the OFAH that encouraged moose hunters to apply in large groups so that moose hunting opportunities would be maximized to the hunting community and tags would be spread out more evenly to a larger number of hunt groups. As a matter of fact, the Ontario Hunting Regulations, until very recently, used to dedicate a few paragraphs to the subject of ""how to maximize your chances in the moose tag allocation draw"", or words to that effect. Just as there are currently vocal moose hunters in Ontario that are not satisfied with the current allocation draw, I predict that there will be those of us that have been recent recipients of moose tags that are going to be equally dissatisfied with the proposed point based system, especially if the system builds in systemic bias by applying points that are indexed back to 1983!
If indeed the problem with current tag allocation system is grossly unfair, then simply amend the rules ""to tighten things up"" and to reduce the chances of abuse. Why do we have to re-invent the wheel, especially since the BGMAC has already admitted in its report that the proposed new point based system is biased in favour of hunters who have gone for long periods of time without receiving a tag. Further, the hunter surveys received by the BGMAC indicate that most hunters are somewhat satisfied with the status quo of the current tag allocation system. I will admit that on the surface correcting past flaws in a system  is a noble cause because it is the right thing to do, but maybe there is a little more to the story than simply saying that its not fair and I will address that subject a little further down the line! In the meantime, may I humbly suggest the following for your consideration?
Modifications to the Group Application System
1) No single applicants in the draw, group applications only;
2) Group sizes between 4-10 hunters;
3) Eliminate guaranteed group sizes;
4) All members of the group must be noted on the application;
5) All members of the group must be present during the hunt;
6) Mandatory check stations and reports.
7) Any violation of the above then receive a financial penalty and automatic 5 year hunting suspension.
I now have some questions concerning the responses from the moose hunter surveys as well as verbal feedback from the listening sessions. Given that there are approximately 80,000 moose hunters in Ontario and given that only 600 (+/-)  hunters attended the listening sessions to vocalize their concerns, this would suggest to me that most of the other moose hunters not heard from are at least somewhat satisfied with the current tag allocation system, otherwise they may have made their concerns known! Either that or more listening sessions are needed over a greater geographical area.
I have a few questions for those applicants that have been unsuccessful for a prolonged period of time:
1) Did the unsuccessful applicants reveal that they were willing to consider employing the services of a registered outfitter that may have been able to provide a moose tag as part of a package hunt?
2) Did the unsuccessful applicants reveal that they were willing to attempt or attempted to join up with other like minded hunters in order to increase their group size and in turn increase their chances of receiving a moose tag?
3) Did the unsuccessful applicants reveal whether or not they were willing to to apply in a more remote WMU with less application demand which in turn could possibly increase their chances of success in drawing a tag?
In short, just how flexible were these unsuccessful applicants in their approach to the moose tag application process? May I humbly submit that in 2019, you cannot expect to hunt with your own tag from the back door of your house, nor should you limit your application to the hunt camp because that's where I always go, nor should you limit your application to the same old WMU because that is where you have always applied  and coincidentally it is the same old WMU that has a very limited number of tags and a very high applicant demand. I have pontificated enough!
Lets face it, this is 2019, we all know that there are very limited resources available and if an individual wants to experience any kind of success drawing a moose tag, then moose hunting has to become a priority in ones life if it is not already and that might also mean one has to be flexible in their approach to tag application, the area to hunt, etc.
Before I continue, I want to state what is commonly known, yet bears repeating in regards to moose hunting and the moose hunters in Ontario.  There are a considerable number of moose hunters in Ontario that each year purchase moose licences, enter tag allocation draws, travel vast distances at great expense just for the opportunity to hunt moose and let us not forget the economic benefits they bring forth to the local Ontario communities and the coffers of the Government of Ontario. Moose hunters don't just take, they also give back!
Tag Allocation via Point Based System
The proposed point system that is contained in ERO 019-0405 has at least three components that cause me concern:
1)Point Crawling;
What mechanism will be in place to regulate or stop this from occurring? My biggest concern is that just when an applicant has met the required point standard, the  MNRF does a ""review"" and then proceeds to raise the point standard to a higher level and thus the applicant must wait patiently year after year to increase their points with no guarantee that the MNRF will not put forth another review and possibly another calculation to adjust the tag quota yet again!
2)High Point Applicants monopolizing the draw;
Just as the Large groups/guaranteed size groups in today's system are accused of abuse, I perceive of at least one situation where a large group that is populated with high point applicants can take ""advantage"" of the intent of the system. For example, Applicant A has high points, receives a tag in the allocation draw, but he knows of several other applicants that also have similarly high points. They form an understanding that, if drawn, the other applicants(s) would defer their tag(s) to the future and become a member of his group. The next year comes and the steps are repeated and again year after year until all the high point applicants of the group are exhausted. Conceivably they could monopolize up to ten years worth of tags, given that the new proposal suggest capping the group size at ten hunters. In my opinion this would be worst that ""ghost applicants"", at least under the current system, there is some fairness that comes with a random draw!
3)Second Allocation;
Consider the following..... Hunter ""A"" defers a tag in WMU 123 and keeps his points. Subsequent to that, there is a second allocation draw in an adjacent WMU, Hunter ""A"" reapplies to the second allocation draw which I believe he is allowed to do and receives a tag in the second allocation but yet does not lose his accumulated points? Is this a correct interpretation?
If the MNRF adapts the contents ERO 019-0405 as it exists today, then I firmly believe that there will also be imbalances/abuse within this system as well. In effect we will have a new ""unfair"" system that replaced the old ""unfair"" system. The only thing that will change as far as the success of an application goes will be the faces and the names and we will be back to this point again in another three to five years to yet again reinvent the wheel.
Other Concerns RE: Moose Management
In it's report, the BGMAC suggests that under the current system, moose hunters are too successful, that there are too many moose being harvested! How can this be? Are quotas not based on data and information gathering that is later formulated into scientific models/harvest quotas? If there is indeed too many moose being harvested, then it would seem to me that there was incorrect data gathered or the model and its assumptions are not valid! Are other factors other than scientific data and licensed hunters being considered when calculating quotas? I do not want to fault the science, but as a lay person something here is not adding up! I will concede that the moose harvest may need to be reduced in some areas, but how can you achieve a lower moose harvest by changing the rules that affect the licensed hunters alone. Clearly there are other factors at play here that are just as important to the stability and future growth of the moose herd. In my estimation, other factors that ought to be in the forefront of moose management are:
1) unlicensed hunters;
2) illicit activity e.g., poaching
3) natural predation e.g., bears/wolves
4) disease and infestation;
5) forestry operations e.g., cutting and spraying activities
6) conflict with the modern world e.g., car/train collisions
What I would have liked to have seen ER O019-0405 was a statement or recommendation(s) on how to proceed  or deal with the above noted activities.  We can no longer look at the licensed hunting community alone. As a lay person, even I can see that the moose herd dynamics are far too complex for that. I believe the focus of the BGMAC has been too narrow in its approach in this regard and that we have to push political and economic factors to the side, let's make this moose study more encompassing.  I find it somewhat ironic that the licensed hunting community that has traditionally paid its fair share of the freight when it comes to moose management are once again called upon to do their part and make their share of the sacrifices and when it comes to the other moose herd dynamics, all we seem to hear are crickets.....
In conclusion, if this exercise is about the Moose, then let us make it for the Moose, no half measures. If toes need to be stepped on, then so be it. Political and economic considerations should not enter into this discussion. It is about what is good for the Moose.
I have taken the liberty to list below what I believe are some important components that may make a workable plan for moose recovery,
1) It is imperative that the Native communities in this province be encouraged to embrace a harvest program that honors their treaty rights and also respects the concepts resource conservation and management. The moose belong to all of the people of Ontario!;
2)Severely restrict or eliminate the calf harvest for a period of five (5) years, then study;
3)Intensify a predator management program by increasing bag limits on bears/wolves for five (5) years and then study in conjunction with (2) above;
4) Restrict forestry operations. Restrict the size and scope of clear cut operations, also leave more and bigger natural buffer areas in and around cuts. Discourage the use of herbicides/pesticides and promote natural forest regeneration.
5) Shorten the moose season to two (2) weeks, no exceptions;
6)Where the herd size is not at its intended goal or is unstable, institute a bows only season and eliminate the rifle season;
7)No tag transfers.If a hunter with a moose tag is unable to attend a hunt, in the proposed system, applicants points would be reimbursed or applicant would be reestablished into Pool#1 in the current system pending medical validation.
8)Increase enforcement penalties where it can be reasonably proven that infractions in the law was intentional (make the penalty a deterrent).;
9)In areas where it can be scientifically confirmed/proven that there is excessive pressure on the moose herd, then eliminate mechanized transport to gain access to a hunting area. e.g.,no airplanes, no motor boats, no land based motorized vehicles allowed. Primitive transport only. e.g., canoes/kayaks/hike
10) Introduce a mandatory Moose hunter education program at no cost to the MNRF. No moose course, then no licence.
The focus of the program should include, but not be limited to the following:
a) hunter safety;
b) firearms proficiency;
c) moose hunting regulations; and
d) moose biology, emphasis on gender identification;
I want to thank you for patiently taking the time to read my submission and perhaps you may wish to give some consideration to the points that I have attempted to make here today.

34576,/comment/34576,"I understand that by shooting the wolves, the theory is it will help keep the moose population down.  If you are truly concerned about the moose population perhaps you could cut back on the number of moose a hunter is allowed to kill.  If these moose are used for human consumption, I would understand.
 That said, I doubt that the majority of hunters are actually there for that one purpose.  Instead they enjoy it as a ""sport"".  I imagine if more game wardens were hired, the government would be able to better keep track of such things.   Perhaps the hunters simply want to have the ability to get a hunting permit for wolves as well.  Certain species of wolves are endangered.  The WWF is exploring methods to strengthen the population of wolves in Europe because of their concerns of their population.  Why on earth would you turn around and choose to allow hunting licences for wolf hunting?

34584,/comment/34584,"I would like to make the following comments on the proposed changes to moose management:
 You should end the calf hunt. Even with new restrictions, Ontario will still be in the minority of jurisdictions allowing the harvest of calves in their first year. Research is confirming that hunting calves puts additional stress on the moose population. It is time to phase it out.
• Reduce cow tags consistently across the province. Without a mother to protect and guide a calf for the first year of its life, its chances of survival are limited, even if it is not taken by a hunter.
• Establish and protect moose refuge areas. These areas would provide relief from loss of habitat, and from the easy access that forestry roads provide for hunters. New legally protected areas should be part of the solution.
• Commit more resources for enforcement, monitoring and research that are not tied to hunting revenue. MNRF budgets continue to be slashed and funding is dependent on hunting licenses which can create a conflict between conservation and research. As it stands now, when hunting tags need to be cut, there are fewer dollars to fund increasingly needed research.
• The composition of BGMAC needs to be more representative of Ontario. It needs to include Indigenous People, university scientists, non-consumptive outdoor enthusiasts, environmental groups and women. Currently it consists of male hunters, outfitters, retired MNRF employees and an Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunter biologist.

Allow applicants who are unsuccessful in, or who do not apply to, the tag allocation process to party hunt for moose on another hunter’s tag;
The point system for distributing tags.
I STRONGLY DISAGREE with the elimination of group tags. My family has used group application for the past 20 years to ensure we will have a moose to harvest each year in order to feed our family. We have seen other families, who do not use group application have not a single a bull or cow tag one year, and then having 3 tags in the next year, and then no other tag in the family for the next 5 years. The group tag allows us to have a bull/cow tag each year so we can have meat each year. Please do not take away the group tag application. The worst scenario is having 3 moose tags in a group of 13 family members one year, and then none the next.

34605,/comment/34605,"I am absolutely appalled at the MNRF's proposal to essentially create an open season on wolves and coyotes. Blaming apex predators that have evolved for millions of years within an ecosystem for man made problems is archaic, meritless thinking at best. At worst, it is cruel and unethical. It is time governments and the people they represent take responsibility for the environmental problems they create, including declining species populations.
How about NOT allowing over-hunting and doing something about the escalating poaching and trophy hunting happening in this province? How about NOT letting mining companies dump tailings into lakes and wetlands, where moose spend most of their time? How about NOT passing bills like Bill 108 which makes is easier for developers and other industries to destroy natural habitats of moose and other wildlife. How about NOT letting the Boreal forest be dissected by roads moose have to cross....or perhaps doing something about the ones that exist to eliminate road collisions with moose and other wildlife.  And how about investigating the causes of moose population declines, using actual scientific research, conducted by actual biologists, instead of biased special interest groups (like the hunting associations that influenced this so-called moose management proposal).
Stop this relentless attack on Ontario's wildlife. The Conservative government's pay to slay /Bill 108, created to appease land developers, is detrimental enough to endangered and threatened species.  There is no justification for this proposal - an easy, cheap way of trying to solve a complex issue. Humans are the cause of moose population declines, one way or another, not wolves or coyotes.
What's next? Open season on peregrine falcons because songbird populations have declined? Open season on Great Blue Herons because amphibian populations have declined?  Yes, ridiculous, isn't it ?   just like your moose management proposal.
The MNRF's mandate is to be a long-term steward for our natural spaces, flora and fauna - regardless of what the government of the day is.  Please, start doing your job and representing the vast majority of Ontarians concerns when it comes to our disappearing wildlife, not the minority out to make a buck from their slaughter.

34613,/comment/34613,"Calf Harvest Controls proposed for 2020
I applaud the proposed changes in moose regulations for calf harvest controls in WMUs 37, 40, 41, 42 and 47.  Given moose population sustainability concerns for adjacent WMUs 35, 36, 38 and 39 these 4 WMUs should also be included for calf harvest controls.  Comparing the 2019 moose population estimates with the lower moose population objective range for these four WMUs indicates that WMU 36 is 38% below its lower range, WMUs 35 & 38 are 26% below their lower ranges and WMU 39 is 15% below its lower range; calf recruitment estimates have also been low and calf harvest concerns are high enough to warrant calf harvest controls across this broader landscape.
For WMU 48 with calf harvest controls, it took 10+ years to grow the moose population towards its then target (close to 1,200 moose).  The calf gun season has been 6 or 7 days (i.e., 1 week) and tag fill rates on gun calf tags appears to be approximately 50%.  This has a direct bearing on how many gun-calf tags that can be made available in the draw.
The current calf gun season for WMUs 35 to 42 is 14 days (2 weeks).  Extending the calf gun hunting season to the full length of the moose gun hunting season (5 weeks), while providing more flexibility for hunters to harvest a calf, comes at the cost of significantly reducing available calf validation tag quotas.  Note that for WMU 48, gun calf tag fill rate is approximately 50% in 1 week – across 5 weeks of a gun season, calf gun-tag fill rate may be at or close to 100%.  Also note that moose calf harvests have historically been high with the previous overlap with the deer gun seasons in WMUs 36, 37 and 42 – this is often due to use of dogs pushing deer and moose from forests during the deer gun hunt.
It would be more prudent to reduce the calf gun season to 1 week (same dates as south of French-Mattawa Rivers) on the above nine WMUs and implement calf harvest controls through calf validation tags.  This would provide hunters with higher calf tag quotas and assist in getting within the moose population objective ranges faster.  Obviously need to keep cow harvests quite low during the moose recovery period to maximize potential population growth.
New selective harvest approach proposed for 2021
This looks promising and in the right direction to sustain moose populations.

34619,/comment/34619,"Comments on Proposed Changes to Moose Management as Part of the Moose Management Review
Environmental Registry Number 019-0405
General Comments
•	I would like to commend Mr. Kaplanis and members of the new Big Game Management Advisory Committee (BGMAC) on the work that they did.  They were great listeners at the public listening sessions and I feel that they did an excellent job taking diverse views and opinions and forming them some practical and progressive recommendations to improve moose management in the province of Ontario.
•	While I agree that we need to revise the moose tag allocation I feel that we shouldn’t lose sight of the management actions that are needed to support healthy moose populations.  The BGMAC references many of these actions in their recommendations document.  In particular, we need to recognize that we need to invest in regular high quality aerial moose inventories, continuing science
on aspects of moose management and, we need to really look hard at how moose habitat is being managed (or not being managed).
Actions Proposed for 2020
Calf Harvest Controls
•	I agree with the need to control harvests of calf moose in Wildlife Management Units 37, 40, 41, 42 and 47. I am pleased that there is finally the recognition that calf harvesting can negatively impact recruitment and inhibit population growth.
•	Let’s make sure, for the rest of the WMU’s, that support moose populations that we don’t wait until populations are in trouble before we take management action to control calf harvests.
•	We need to make sure that we have regular high-quality aerial surveys to help us to understand whether calf harvest controls are working.
New Bow Seasons and Quotas
•	I agree with the creation of early bow specific seasons and quotas for WMU’s where there is an open moose hunting season and where bow specific seasons and quotas don’t currently exist except in far north WMU’s.
•	At the same time we need to make sure that we monitor success rates and wounding rates.  In recent years we have seen a very high wounding rate in WMU 03 as evidenced by moose found after the bow season ended.  This can be confirmed with the Conservation Officers. We should not assume that bow hunting success is far below that of gun hunting as I am pretty sure that the gap has closed substantially.
Actions Proposed for 2021
New Selective Harvest Approach
•	I agree with the need to revise the selective harvest system.  I also, agree with revising the selective harvest system to include tags for bulls, cows/calve and calves. Calf tags should no longer be included with a moose licence.
Moose Hunting Licence
•	I agree with the proposal to create a moose licence that does not automatically come with a tag.
•	Don’t be influenced by hunters who feel that they must get something (i.e. a tag) when they purchase a moose licence.  Hunters should look at a moose licence as a privilege to hunt one of North Americas big game species.
Preference Point System
•	In general, I agree with the implementation of a preference point system including the application of fees for applying, purchasing a moose licence and purchasing a tag if successful in the point system.
•	I think we need to monitor whether this approach continues to support moose hunting in a group.
•	What I don’t agree with is that northern residents only receive one extra in-year point.  I’m not sure that it came across sufficiently in the listening sessions what happens in northern WMU’s when southern Ontario hunters show up.  As northern residents we see garbage issues, moose shot and left either as an illegal moose or as a result of hunters not doing everything necessary to track a moose after a shot is taken (One year I found 9 moose, some buried under brush piles and others only a short distance from the edge of a cutover. These were reported ot the CO’s.), public roads being blocked, family members being accosted for hunting grouse, moose hunters shooting at my Labrador retriever thinking she was a black wolf, being prevented from trapping on my trapline. Now you can say that these are enforcement issues but they are and they aren’t.  This behavior directly affects the quality of moose hunts and other forms of hunting for northern residents.
•	I think that northern residents should be allowed to accumulate extra points for a period of 3 years. After three years extra point accumulation would start over again at 1 point.
Primary Allocation
•	I feel that allowing hunters 3 choices for WMU, moose and season is very fair.
•	I also feel that it is vital that the results of the primary allocation stage be communicated as early as possible to hunters so that they can plan their group hunts.  My feeling is that if this isn’t done that group hunting will decline.
Tag Transfers
•	In my opinion we shouldn’t allow any tag transfers what so ever.  However, if they are still allowed I would like to see the circumstances on when tag transfers can occur severely restricted.  I would also like the BGMAC to review all tag transfers to make sure that rules that are established are actually being followed.
Changes to Party Hunting
•	I emphatically agree with the restrictions that are being proposed for party hunting. This should address a lot of conflicts that I have seen while hunting in norther WMU’s.
•	I would also like to see some recommendations that tighten the requirement that group members be readily be able to communicate with each other.  Otherwise, you can still get the situation where one member of a party shoots a moose, for which they have a tag, but then another member of the same party also shoots a moose. I’m almost positive that this is what happened to some of the 9 moose that I found shot and left a few years ago.  Three of the 9 moose were covered by brush to hide them.
Non-Residents who are Immediate Relatives of Ontario Residents
•	Now this recommendation I don’t agree with.  There cannot be that many tags that are taken up by immediate relatives.
Other Recommendation of the Big Game Management Advisory Committee
•	I see that MNRF has committed to working with BGMAC to address other recommendations in the report entitled “Moose Management Review: Recommendations to the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry on Moose Management”.  I am happy to see that there is this commitment and I will be watching for the posting and implementation of these recommendations.
•	Specifically, I would like to see the following recommendations implemented:
o	Recommendation 2. There needs to be a heck of a lot more transparency in how MNRF harvest quotas and tag numbers.  Right now, it would appear that there is a regional office dictatorship in place.  It is also important to consider the input for management biologists in the various district offices.  Having said this, there needs to be adequate up to date information upon which to establish quotas and tag numbers. For example WMU 3 hasn’t had a survey in 6 years and population levels are being kept the 2014 level even in the face of declining population levels, low bull numbers and calf production below what is needed to sustain the population let alone grow it!
o	Recommendation 5
o	Recommendation 6
o	Recommendation 7
o	Recommendation 9
o	Recommendation 10
o	Recommendation 11
o	Recommendation 12.  There is the perception among MNRF staff that habitat management for caribou via the emulation of natural fire will also be beneficial to moose.  Firstly, I am not sure that this is true and secondly this is really a cop out in terms of habitat management for moose.  If moose are also an important species on the landscape then let’s see what is actually being done to manage habitat for them.  I would also challenge that notion that caribou were evenly distributed across the landscape as inferred by some lines on a map.  Any biologist worth their salt knows that this isn’t true so why can’t some areas that are more conducive to the production of moose be managed for moose in caribou range?  What we need is a complete review of moose habitat management efforts across all WMU’s.
o	Recommendation 13
o	Recommendation 14
o	Recommendation 15

34660,/comment/34660,"Not sure on how I feel about the proposed point system, old system did have flaws but relatively simple and too many big changes will scare off more hunters .
Also I don't like the idea of different prices for the tags .I've always felt both the cow's and bull's were equally important and just because some hunters feel the need to shoot that trophy bull I don't think that justifies putting the tag price higher and speaking for my hunting partners I think they would feel the same .
I'm also not in favour of shortening the distance that you must be to the tag holder . when you're hunting in many areas you're already restricted for areas to hunt by terrain , cutover locations and accessibility . The  old 5 Km distance gives you a little more wiggle room . And also for a larger group of gun hunters you have a little more room to separate for safety reasons . More options is better . As far as communication that is something the hunters must be sure of no matter what . Or compromise at 4 Km not 3.
Was nice to be able to transfer the tag . If in a group and tag holder may only be able to get out mininally then to transfer it to someone more a available to go meant the party could still get out and everybody happy even with some penalty for the transfer . I understand the ghost hunter problem . Can't fix everything all at once .
I close by saying too much too fast will scare more hunters away and thats already happening .

34661,/comment/34661,"In response the proposals for 2021:
I support the following changes:
-	new selective harvest approach
-	the moose hunting license as a product that allows hunting of moose but does not come with a tag that automatically allows the harvest of a calf
-	preference point system for distributing tags
-	bonus preference point for northern residents
-	primary allocation
-	2nd chance allocation
I strongly disagree with the proposals to establish new, more restrictive party hunting rules.  This will decimate the family traditions and culture of moose hunting.   Our family and friends have always applied for tags the way the OMNR recommended (in order to coincide with the guaranteed or large group sizes).  Over the years, we have been content to take our conservative number of tags, just so that we could ensure the tradition of an annual family & friends hunt.  In recent years, the women and the children in our family have harvested the majority of our moose.  If the party hunting size is reduced to a max of 10, we would be forced to exclude members of our immediate family.
A direct example of this - in my immediate family, someone will be left out:
1)	myself
2)	my wife
5) our three children
6) my mother
7) my father
8) my brother
9) my sister-in-law
10) my niece
11) mother-in-law
12) father-in-law
Let’s say (under the proposed changes) that my father decides one year that he will keep his name off the tag so that we can make the max of 10 hunters that would be allowed in a party.  Now he (the one who introduced us all to the tradition) can’t even be out walking with us at moose camp because he would be illegally participating in the hunt as “an extra set of eyes”.
Another issue with this is new hunter retention and recruitment.  For example, take a small group of 4 or 5 men who have always party hunted together.  These hunters would not be allowed to each bring out a partner and child with them to participate in a moose hunt because they would then have a party larger than 10.
It has been noted in the media that women are the fastest growing group of newly certified hunters in the province.  It has been documented that typically, women are getting certified so that they can join their family or their partner in the tradition of hunting.  The proposal to cap parties at a max of 10 will directly impede the recruitment of female and young hunters because mentor hunters will not have the opportunity to add extra hunting apprentices to their party.  This proposal is grossly discriminatory in nature.
In regards to “tag shopping” (listed as a concern under recommendation #5 in the BGMAC Moose Management Review), where hunters shoot a moose then go out looking for another group who has the appropriate tag for the animal they illegally harvested:
This illegal practice would be easily prevented by having a tag holder list all party members allowed to hunt on their tag by a set date (prior to season opening).  No need to limit the number of people in the party as long as the party is pre-determined.
I strongly disagree with changing the distance members of a hunting party can be from the tag holder down to 3km.  Reducing the distance that the members of a hunting party can be from the tag down to 3km is extremely dangerous and restrictive.  Not only is it unsafe to have a group of hunters confined to a radius of 3km, legislating that they do so would be a liability once the inevitable accident occurs.  A radius of 3km is not much area once you consider roads and water bodies that would be included in that area.  Forcing hunters to hunt that close together will also decrease hunter satisfaction in their hunting opportunity.
If the goal is to reevaluate after 3 years in order to see what affects the new changes will have made for the moose population and for hunter satisfaction, but so many variables have been altered, then it will be impossible to identify the changes that worked or did not work.  There was hunter demand for sound science and data.  In the name of sound science, only a limited number of variables can be altered at a given time.   After implementing mandatory reporting (to provide more accurate harvest data), the proposed 2020 changes, the preference point system, and allocating calf specific tags, it is quite possible that fill rates won’t have to be tampered with after all.  Tampering with fill rates will have a detrimental affect on hunter satisfaction.  You would be selling hunters a value-decreased opportunity.
Why not take the 3 years to see what affects those changes bring about.  If more measures are required, then consider the other variables.  In the meantime, if 10-15 (or more) hunters are satisfied with the opportunity to hunt on a tag or two, then leave them to it.
In regards to the “other related efforts beginning 2020”, I strongly support increased communication surrounding any approved changes.  Most importantly, should the “preference point system” be accepted, it will be critical that hunter draw history and point totals are updated and clearly conveyed to hunters on an annual basis.   In similar fashion to how the current annual regulation summaries outline the group sizes that were allocated tags in the previous year, future regulation summaries will need to indicate how many points were required by a hunter to receive each type of tag, for each WMU, in the previous year.

The complainers either applied on their own or too small of a group or in an area that the population is hurting.  Limit calf harvest, share moose in groups and watch this native harvest out of their allowable areas.

• End the calf hunt. Even with new restrictions, Ontario will still be in the minority of jurisdictions allowing the harvest of calves in their first year. Research is confirming that hunting calves puts additional stress on the moose population. It is time to phase it out.
• Reduce cow tags consistently across the province. Without a mother to protect and guide a calf for the first year of its life, its chances of survival are limited, even if it is not taken by a hunter.
• Establish and protect moose refuge areas. These areas would provide relief from loss of habitat, and from the easy access that forestry roads provide for hunters. New legally protected areas should be part of the solution.
• Commit more resources for enforcement, monitoring and research that are not tied to hunting revenue. MNRF budgets continue to be slashed and funding is dependent on hunting licenses which can create a conflict between conservation and research. As it stands now, when hunting tags need to be cut, there are fewer dollars to fund increasingly needed research.
• The composition of BGMAC needs to be more representative of Ontario. It needs to include Indigenous People, university scientists, non-consumptive outdoor enthusiasts, environmental groups and women.

Given this the Moose Management Proposals did NOT INCLUDED these areas in the  restricted or no calf harvest as they did for other WMU's.
Ontario is the only jurisdiction that sells licences to kill the calves of a declining species...historically (published MNR data since 1980) the calf harvest has represented from 20-30 percent of the yearly harvest..it is no surprise that moose are in trouble.
We are well aware that there are many factors contributing to this decline ( habitat loss, disease, predation, increased access etc ) BUT the fact remains that at this time the only immediate and proven action is to protect the remaining cow/calf population . Without this there is no hope of maintaining a sustainable moose population .

•	Establish and protect moose refuge areas;
*      Algonquin Park extend wilderness designation regions to establish intact wilderness habitat for moose;

34810,/comment/34810,"Regarding: Proposed Changes to Moose Management as Part of the Moose Management Review (ERO # 019-0405)
Dear Sir or Madam,
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s (MNRF’s) use of the latest research to implement changes to the Moose Management System in Ontario is a positive step to providing better protect for populations of this animal across the province. I support the MNRF's proposed implementation of the following Big Game Management Advisory Committee (BGMAC) recommendations: a preference-point, tag-allocation system; the removal of the right of resident’s immediate family members to hunt; and, limiting party hunting size and spread. Phasing out the hunting of moose calves is another step that scientific research suggests will benefit moose populations.
The MNRF is, however, paying too much attention to hunters and outfitters. I am deeply concerned that these groups are influencing the development of proposals that would relax restrictions on wolf and coyote hunting. This is highly unlikely to benefit moose populations. Allowing the unlimited killing of coyotes (including pups) – which are not significant predators of moose – year round (and under the pretense of benefitting moose populations) is NOT scientifically supported, and is cruel and unethical. Apex predators, such as wolves and coyotes, are critical to maintaining biodiversity and healthy ecosystems.
Increasing the hunting of wolves is likely to decrease the size of wolf packs; but, culling predators in an attempt to benefit prey often results in unintended and consequences. For example, smaller and weakened wolf packs might switch to preying on woodland caribou (a threatened species), which are easier to kill.
There is no sound science behind the proposal to ease regulations on wolf and coyote hunting. Removing the requirement to report canid kills will also significantly weaken the ability of wildlife managers to enforce limits and to gather critical data for wildlife assessments and the conservation of wildlife populations. This is not appropriate.
In addition, the composition of the BGMAC must be updated to reflect the wishes of the Ontario population at large. The committee requires women, First Nation representation, and general outdoor enthusiasts – not just male hunters and outfitters.
Furthermore, based on the latest research, I think the following should be implemented:
* immediately eliminate the moose calf hunt;
* reduce the harvest of cow moose; and,
* provide more enforcement money to the MNRF so that their staff can adequately monitor moose-management regulations.
I urge the Government of Ontario to proceed with the proposed actions to conserve moose populations, but to abandon the proposal to liberalize wolf and coyote hunting, which is not supported by science. Ontario’s wildlife should be conserved and protected for its own benefit and for that of all Ontarians - not only for special-interest groups (e.g., male hunters).
Thank you for your consideration.

34813,/comment/34813,"I applaud the Ministry with making changes to the moose program in Ontario.  The propose changes reflect a modern approach to tag allocation.  However, I do have the following comments.
Point System
The point system is a great improvement over the guaranteed group size approach and provide a fair opportunity to all hunters.  The approach places all individual license holders on the same playing field.  However a single tag allocation approach will inevitably create a phenomenon known in other jurisdictions as point creep.  Meaning that for most hunters over time, the minimum required number of points to get a tag will increase year after year, eventually creating a barrier to entry, based on age or time in the system.  An alternate approach is a two phase system whereby 80% of the tags are awarded based on the point system, and 20% are awarded based on a complete random  draw.  This does two things, continues to incentive hunters to apply and gain points year after year because the number of tags is heavily weighted to the highest points, while incentive's new or younger hunters to apply to units because there is still a minor chance of drawing in high point units.  This approach has been very successful in other jurisdictions.
Value of Moose License
As a tax payer, and resident of the province of Ontario, I expect that my government generates internal revenues based on fair market value for products.  This approach is embedded into a variety of government policies, including MNR's lands program.  My view on wildlife tags in Ontario, is that we are significantly undervaluing big game tags and licenses, thereby reducing revenues and appropriate financial returns to every Ontarian.  For example, there are many resident hunters in Ontario that purchase Moose hunting opportunities from local outfitters and guides at costs from $1,000 to $2,000, where they are unsuccessful in the resident license application process.  Non resident hunters are willing to pay upwards of $5,000 for an opportunity to hunt moose in Ontario.  In my view, there is sufficient market data to review and appropriately value moose hunting opportunities in Ontario and appropriately set fees for moose tags and licenses that provide a fair market value to all Ontario residents.  Setting fees should not be about equal opportunity, but should be base don the true value of the resource.

2)	Reducing gun tags for bow season.  You should not remove one persons opportunity in favor for another.  This needs to be removed.
3)	The steps you expect hunters to take to get a tag is ridiculous.  Give your head a shake on this one!  This needs to be simplified not made to confuse hunters more.
4)	Paying for a tag you one in a draw you paid to enter.  This is highway robbery!  You expect us to pay to apply, then pay for a licence and pay for a tag I one in a draw I paid for.  This is ridiculous! and the minister should not have approved this cash gabbing idea.  If you won a tag you should get it when you buy your licence…you know….like you do with elk!

I do not like the idea of only allowing 10 hunters to one license - it should be bumped up to a maximum of 20 hunters. Some moose camps have as many as 20 members.
I do not agree with a price system for the moose tags. They should all be the same price. We dont want to see moose hunting get so expensive only the rich can afford it. There are a lot of retirees on fixed incomes in the North that like to hunt moose and it must remain affordable.
I do like the fact that if you are successful in the draw and for some reason you can not hunt, you can refuse the tag and not lose points. Good one.

I appreciate the great work being done to try to make the process fair.
I come from a large generational family, with elders who participate in the hunt, and some young up and coming hunters.  Hunting is a great tradition in our family.  We are a large family, and often have only 1 tag for everyone to hunt with.  There are as many as 20-24 of us who plan to take the moose hunt off to hunt together, and share the rewards of one or two tags we may get (if we are lucky).  In our area #57 we must apply for calf tags as well, therefore the ability to hunt has never been guaranteed.
Does it not make sense that one moose is divided amongst 15 or so hunters rather that one amongst 4?

Reducing the calf harvest will have little impact in reversing the moose population issue, but if this allows the government to move on to effect changes to other  influences affecting the moose population like poor forestry, uncontrolled native harvest, excessive predation by uncontrolled predators, and highway and railway mortality among others, I can accept a complete loss of calf hunting. The only exception will be to harvest a calf that was orphaned by the lawful harvest of a cow moose
But the loss of calf hunting MUST be province wide. There is NO confidence in MNRF biologists to have any idea of what the population is doing with no regular aerial surveys and an unproven mandatory kill registration system.

If a moose lic now costs $200, what bureaucratic idiot would think there would be no negative impact as iterated in the impact statement for these changes at the end. Does this mean no price change? OK then
Preference point system....while proposal appears too have merit, it will be an administrative nightmare..... more complicated than a 2 pool system that seems to get screwed up frequently. No costs associated with this proposal . if application fee for tag and licence fee exceed current costs other than marginally (how much is that????) why would BGMAC think hunters would accept this substantial change.
Good idea to get rid of non res landowners and relatives in tag draw. they can party hunt or go to an outfitter.
I must reiterate in hopes that someone may recognize that moose hunters alone will not reverse the moose decline. You MUST speak to the other influences of a moose population.

To proceed with a points based tag allocation system, the preference points totals must be viewable online every year (personal account) well in advance of the draw deadline.  Past statistics to be maintained and published by MNRF, as before by WMU and sex.
I am extremely concerned that MNRF will set $ values on tags without the amount known in advance to the public, and how increases will be regulated in the future.  The ability to hunt moose shouldn’t come down to those that can afford high fees.  This is discriminatory against those of lower socioeconomic status and certainly doesn’t make tag allocation fairer.  Stating that over a moose hunter’s career this will cost less, assumes people have the ability to stretch out increases over multiple years.  To some people a single time expense of $200 (or likely much more) is absolutely not attainable.
All proposed changes for moose management must be supported through evidence based decision making.  Manipulating multiple parameters won’t reveal a true understanding of how each proposed change affected, positively or negatively, the outcome.  Changes cannot be individually analyzed for their impact when imposed en masse.  Ensure that data continues to be collected through aerial surveys and staff in the field and don’t just rely on mandatory reporting.  However if hunters don’t report, make the penalty severe such as not permitting them to hunt the following year.
I strongly oppose the proposals for more restrictive party hunting rules.  Providing additional hunting opportunities (i.e. more available tags) through the reduction of hunter success rates is an exercise with smoke and mirrors.  This creates an illusion to make hunters happy with receiving a tag, although their success rate will drop, achieving the same harvest numbers.  Economic consequences will not be neutral or positive.  Increased hunting ‘opportunities’ with even lower success rates will lead to a reduction in hunter numbers.  Initially hunters may be receptive to this process, but as the true effects of the restrictions are realized (less success), numbers of hunters will continue or even accelerate in their decline as is the pattern now – review your own statistics.  With the loss of hunters and associated reduction in licencing fee income, where will the money come from to continue with big game management?
I strongly oppose the proposed reduction in hunting party distance from 5 km to 3 km.  I consider this a safety issue, potentially jamming more hunters in a smaller area while participating in a coordinated hunt.  This will also present a huge challenge to the conservation officers in the field trying to monitor and enforce an unnecessary restriction.  I anticipate an increase in charges to hunters, time before the courts and expenses the government will incur in enforcement and prosecution of an unnecessary restriction.  How will that possibly contribute to improved moose management?
I strongly oppose the proposed party hunting size restrictions to a maximum of 10 members, or indeed any restriction.  Through MNRF moose management efforts over the last decade or so, our family and friends have worked with the system dictated to us, and we have evolved our efforts into larger groups that participate in party hunting.  I hunt with my wife, my children, aunts, uncles and cousins, not ‘ghost hunters’.  Our party easily reaches 10 – do I now have to insist that some family members can’t hunt with us anymore?  My two oldest children are apprentice hunters – they will be mentored by us and share our firearms, but do they now count as numbers in the party?  My third child will be an apprentice hunter next year, so potentially 6 members of our max group of 10 will have only 3 firearms and cover that much less territory.  How is that fair to this next generation of hunters, further restricting their ability to be mentored and possibly harvest an animal?  Without future hunters, the system cannot continue to be sustainably managed, unless the government’s goal is in fact to eventually eliminate a moose harvest completely.  Leave hunting party numbers as they are, don’t create another nightmare for the conservation officers to monitor and enforce.
Further with my opposition to a maximum party size, there are additional considerations that aren’t made clear:
o	are the maximum 10 persons to be identified ahead of the tag allocation process?
o	are only those EXACT 10 persons able to hunt on that tag?  So I have to choose my family members or friends to hunt with ahead of the season and can’t deviate from that plan?
Do not consider any further restrictions beyond manipulating the tag numbers as traditionally has been done, and perhaps continuing to limit the calf hunt through the season or introduction of tags, but not restricting adult hunts further in any manner.
I strongly oppose any reduction in the hunting season length or the prohibition of using all-terrain vehicles.  Their use should not be restricted to just game retrieval.  Access to many areas is not possible without an all-terrain vehicle, further restricting the areas available for hunting and potentially placing even more hunters in close proximity to each other.

34913,/comment/34913,"I have a concern with the proposed cow/calf tag as it could result in an overharvest of calves unless there is a safety margin built into the calf tag allocation and the 2 are well within a sustainable level to allow the population in most units to increase.
I agree with the recommendation of maintaining the current 1 week moose season in the south but recommend going back to the former week ( Saturday following Thanksgiving) so in every year there is a break between the moose and deer season  The rationale for changing was to be consistent with the northern calf season but if the calf season is all season long than it no longer applies.  Hunters preferred having at least a one week break between moose and deer seasons.

There is no sport in using the latest technology to kill helpless and innocent animals without any danger whatever to oneself. It is cowardly and cruel. Control over populations of wild animals should be left to nature. Leave the moose and the wolves alone and they will find their sustainable levels of populations.

34935,/comment/34935,"Although I am heartened that MRNF is beginning to heed its own research regarding imposing more restrictions on the hunting of moose calves, these are insufficient.  When I first learned that Ontario allowed the hunting of moose calves, I found that surprising and disturbing, especially in light of  evidence that our moose population is in decline, as a result of many factors, including climate change.
At that time it was my understanding that when the moose calf hunt was originally proposed, the expectation was that most calves would die from predation anyways and hunting wouldn't add much to that total.  However, since most predation occurs in the spring, one can only conclude that those shot by hunters in the fall increase pressure on an already vulnerable population.
In my view, the hunting of moose calves should not be allowed.  Period.  Even with new restrictions, Ontario will still be in the minority of jurisdictions allowing the harvest of calves in their first year.  End it or begin phasing it out.
I also support the following recommendations of the CPAWS/The Wildland League:
• Reduce cow tags consistently across the province.  During its first year of life, a calf needs its mother; otherwise, its chance of survival is limited, even without being hunted.
• Establish and protect moose refuge areas to provide relief from loss of habitat and the easy access that forestry roads provide for hunters.
• Commit more resources for enforcement, monitoring and research that are not tied to hunting revenue.
These actions would help provide much needed respite for moose in Ontario and hopefully buy time to address the other threats they face, including climate change.
I am also deeply concerned about the composition of BGMAC, which currently consists of male hunters, outfitters, retired MNRF employees and an Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunter biologist.  Surely, this group needs to be more representative of Ontario; i.e., by including Indigenous People, university scientists, other types of outdoor enthusiasts, environmental groups and women.
I am remain deeply concerned about the future of moose in Ontario.   In fact, I am extremely concerned about wildlife and habitat generally, including this government’s approach to the protection of endangered species, which is to basically abandon any responsibility to protect them.
I would also add that I am among the many people in Ontario who would gladly pay more taxes so that our government could do the job it ought to be doing, and improve the quality of life for all of us in Ontario, which should include a commitment to protect the flora and fauna of this province.
Thank you for your consideration.

Has the impact of the proposed changes been weighted against changes to habitat is affecting the moose population. Personally I have witnessed the effect of logging, land development, road development have had on the moose hunt.

Your advisers know that the decline in moose populations is not because of predation by wolves and coyotes, it is because of us. So establish protected reserves where moose will be safe from human predators and end the calf hunt completely. Do not cave in to the hunt lobby, they do not truly represent public opinion. People can kill very quickly and easily, but it is almost impossible to revive and extinct or even extirpated species.

34967,/comment/34967,"This response is on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Northwestern Ontario Sportsmen's Alliance(NOSA).
NOSA generally supports the proposed changes for Moose management in Ontario, however the Board of Directors agrees unanimously that an overall increased allocation of adult validation tags in WMU's that are at/within population objective range, will satisfy a greater demand for moose hunting opportunity while not significantly affecting harvest or subsequent population health.
NOSA supports the move to a ""point system"" based on a ""stand in line"" approach to foster a more fair and simplified tag draw system. However, without an increase in the current number of limited adult validation tags, there will still be a significant level of dissatisfaction with how moose are managed for hunting in Ontario.
NOSA encourages OMNRF to continue to work with the Big Game Management Advisory Committee to seek ways to maximize adult tag allocations in those WMU's that can sustain increased demand for moose tags, thus providing for maximized moose hunting opportunities where it is viable and feasible to do so, without negatively impacting population sustainability.
NOSA also wishes to see an expanded role for District biologists who have been left out of the harvest planning process in recent years while a single Regional biologist handles this task. This makes no sense when given the fact that it is the unit bio's who understand the specific moose population dynamics within their WMU's. Therefore their role is critical in harvest management planning and MUST be included in the process going forward.
The inclusion of recommendations relating to habitat management for moose, is encouraging and NOSA would add to this that Moose Emphasis Areas be actively planned for, included in and managed as part of the Forest management planning process for ALL WMU's within Ontario forests where moose populations represent the featured species as per the Cervid Ecological Framework.
NOSA in encouraged by the committee's recommendations concerning predator management, however the proposal does not actively address these recommendations. NOSA would encourage OMNRF to work with BGMAC to look at ways and methods to promote the active management and harvest of predators in WMU's where moose population growth is stalled or declining. Evidence on predation and its effects on moose population health is quite well documented and NOSA believes that OMNRF is not doing enough to actively promote predator management to assist moose population growth in WMU's where moose are in decline or populations are not experiencing evident growth trends.
NOSA in in general agreement with proposals to limit or restrict party hunting latitude. NOSA would like to see party hunting sizes reduced further, but also further restrictions on limiting access into some, not all, fresh cutovers and newly logged areas. This does not mean that NOSA supports complete limitation of access into these areas, however by making access more difficult, it will reduce some hunting pressure and thus reduce some hunter effort and should reduce tag fill rates to some extent. This requires intense planning at the FMP(forest mang. planning) level and it should be done very transparently with rationale and goals and objectives clearly stated before such measures are enacted.
Overall, NOSA is in agreement with the general direction of the proposal as written and we look forward to working with OMNRF and BGMAC on future direction with the moose management planning process.

34970,/comment/34970,"I appreciate your government’s undertaking of a review to better support the province’s moose population. They are under threat, and without serious action from your government and others across the country, the continued existence of this national icon is at risk.
To that end, your proposals to limit party hunting size and remove the right of a resident’s immediate family members to hunt are welcome measures to ensure a responsible and sustainable hunt.
However, your proposal to ease restrictions on wolf and coyote hunting is based on flawed beliefs. There is no scientific evidence that wolf and coyote predation are driving moose decline. In fact, they have been co-existing in a predator-prey dynamic for thousands of years.
Easing regulations around wolf and coyote hunting, including through the elimination of reporting requirements and special game seals, and extending the coyote hunting season to virtually year-round, is irresponsible. We should be strengthening reporting requirements and enforcement, and looking for ways to support healthy ecosystems and all of the species that depend on them.
In 2016, the previous government recognized the shortcomings of similar proposals to penalize moose predators without scientific backing. Thousands of Ontarians spoke up then — and we’re speaking up again.
Please listen to us. Listen to the science. Help protect the biodiversity that has made Ontario so special for generations past, and with your action, generations to come.

34973,/comment/34973,"I agree with this entire proposal. I would however like to see additional restrictions on party hunting group size in southern Ontario - 6 seems reasonable.
For the second tag allocation period a null choose (same similar to WMU 99Z I think) is important as it will allow for hunters such as myself to accumulate points while still taking advantage of less demanded tags - such as bow cow tags.
A points system is far fairer, more predictable and will ensure fair sustainable use of the moose resource into the future.
",comments-37.json
34979,/comment/34979,"First off, I agree in whole with a line up approach. Consider though that the tag allocation draw proposal is more convoluted than is needed to accomplish the goals. Think about initializing a line up using the tag histories on file, using all the points criteria you have already thought about to give priority for the line. Initializing the line up before opening the application process would allow you to issue a line number to each individual. Then you really simplify the application process for hunters. They know where they stand relative to others in their ""party"". Give them the option to take a pass on a tag at the time of application, let them manage their own ""party"". The initial allocation run would then skipping those applicants passing on a tag, and leaving those skipped still in line. The idea of turning back a tag could be left in play but I suspect it would not be a big factor. The need to apply to the draw to maintain a position in line is of course a given.
What to do with the line numbers after tags are allocated, collapse the line of course, and forward hunters their new number to give them a sense of progress up the line.
A way to make this pre-application initialization a bit more palatable is to re-initialize the line each year, same ""points"" rules. But, this is not really necessary and not recommended, as the first year line-up priority order held steady would allow for planning ahead by multiple years from the perspective of 'parties'.
What to do with successful applicants, tag holders? Randomize them and issue new line numbers, all at the end of the line of course.
When I get to the front of a line and the item I really want is not available, then I don't get sent to the back of the line to wait for some left-overs. Please do away with the second choice second chance nonsense. If my second choice is available when I am at the front of the line, assign me my second choice then and there and then go on to the next person in line.
What to do about WMU loyalty? You could initialize lines for each WMU but this does not allow hunters to switch units without losing tag history priority, so I'd suggest resisting that obvious tweak.
What to do about new hunters? Here you could go a number of ways. The most aggressive hunter recruitment strategy would be to seed them at the front of the line each year. The most off putting would be to put them at the end of the line. A little less off putting seed into the randomization of last years successful in the draw end of the line group. A middle of the road approach would seed them at random throughout the entire line.
The idea of limiting party size to limit harvest success has merit. The proposal method keeps the government involved the in the party business though (not desirable), and it also interferes with the history of free association that is traditional in Ontario. I believe it could be a source for dissatisfaction with the program that the reinvented program does not need.
This two cents brought to you by the retired MNRF biologist who first proposed a line up draw.

34987,/comment/34987,"All these changes are to help to increase the moose population. To start off with, how can you increase the population when you are still allowing the hunting of cows and calves.This is your breeding stock and you continue to allow it to be killed off. If a hunter shoots a cow, that's one less moose and if that cow is pregnant that takes two moose out of the herd and if she had a calf with her what are the chances of this calf surviving the winter. Very slim. So that makes 3 animals out of the herd. And if the cow had a female calf with her and it doesn't survive the winter that one less in the reproduction chain. You can't increase your herd size if you keep killing off the cows and calves. Solution - eliminate the cow and calf season.
To help the survival rate for the calves, continue with the spring bear hunt and control the wolf population by including them with the small game license as suggested or a bounty as was done in the past.
Surplus tags - how can there be a surplus of tags when the number of (rifle) hunters greatly out weighs the number of tags if the tags have been allocated correctly. Obviously the allocation isn't done correctly. And then you hear of a group of hunters that get at least one or two tags every year???
Group size - suggested 10 hunters max. - pretty had to split up one moose 10 ways. I know that some hunters are just out for the hunt but then there are others who are not. In Northwestern Ontario it's hard to compete with the large group sizes when you have large hunt clubs and a large number of hunters from Southern Ontario competing for the same tags. There has to be some way to make it fair for the the hunters in the North to compete with these large groups.
Types of license - should be bull or cow - no calf season or bulls only or better still, close the moose season completely. If the population is that small that's what has to be done. I know that the government doesn't want to hear that because they'll lose all that money but how are you going to increase the herd size or are they going to wait until it's too late then close it. It's been closed before.
MNRF is all about conservation. So think like a farmer. He doesn't kill off his cows and calves to increase his herd size. So stop trying to fix it with band-aid solutions to keep the big dollars coming in. In our area they are closing off prime moose hunting areas for the caribou or tourist outfitters which are predominantly American owned. It's like when things change over time you gradually change with it. Same as the caribou habitat, it didn't change over night. So they have to change or adapt to the changes to survive. If caribou habitat is in the north, why are they moving southerly. There's no logging way up north. It's been said that the caribou like the cover of evergreens but up north where their preferred food (lichens) grows, there is no cover there, just tundra. I was told that if a native shoots a caribou, they don't even eat it. It's feed to their dogs.
So close the season so our moose population can thrive and be there in the future.

I think that the creation of calf tags in Wmu's 48 , 55A , 55B and 57 has pushed hunting pressure north to Wmu's 37 , 40 , 41 ,42 and 47 and creating calf tags in Wmu,s 37,40,41 ,42 and 47 will do the same thing in Wmu,s 28 ,29 etc . Maybe it is time to remove the calf tags from Wmu,s 48 , 55A , 55B and 57 and transfer some of the hunting pressure back there .
2. I don't mind a separate bow season but always opposed a separate bow tag allocation . I am of the opinion that the computer should be able to proportionally distribute tags among gun and bow hunters taking into account the differing success rates .
3. I like the idea of being able to put a cow tag on a calf in the non calf season to prevent orphaning of the calf . I can see individual hunters or small groups doing this more so than large groups . This will become less of an issue if they align bull , cow and calf seasons again .
4. I am not in favour of a lower application fee . I think it will flood the draw process more than it is now . I don't think the point system will work any better . I attended the open house in North Bay and as far as I could see the further north you went the less points you needed. So unless you are willing to move and go were the tags are easier to get you are going to be unsuccessful or wait a long time .
5. I am ok with the elimination of the northern tag allowance . I think it was a political decision that really didn't do anything other than create a bunch of surplus tags in areas were few people lived . In the heavier populated areas were a lot of hunters qualified for the northern tag draw tag quotas were low enough that not a lot of northern tags were available .
6. I have taking advantage of the surplus tag draw several times and considered it a tremendous opportunity . I did not consider a first come first serve system with the phone system deciding who got threw as unfair . The 2nd chance allocation seems to be an effort to improve the surplus tag draw . I think you should loose your points for your second choice also maybe not your third .

35013,/comment/35013,"I can not begin to understand the  continual need for changes with in our ministry without scientific proof. We can not possibly begin to make changes when it comes to numbers of moose tags allocated to specific areas without understanding the actual harvest taking place. We will not have these numbers until the end of 2019 and they will not be processed until 2020 maybe even later.
If the ministry truly wants to give opportunities for bull moose to finish the first and most fertile mating process then allocating more gun tags away from gun seasons to give to archery only season makes absolutely no sense. Moose archery only seasons takes complete advantage of the fact that bull moose are in the middle of the rut .  Moose archery season should be shutdown completely.  Generally bow hunters target bull moose during that season when it is easier to call them in, that being said then why not allow a person one tag for the entire season, archery and gun. Same number of animals will be harvested. The successful applicant could harvest an adult moose with a bow during archery only season if unsuccessful then with an approved firearm during the second season for the same adult moose.
 The allocation of calf tags is a very slippery slope. If we begin that process now then people up North  who depend on these animals for the food for the winter such as myself and my family will have no opportunity to go out our door and harvest an animal for the winter. Now I understand not everybody relies on these animals for food but some of us do and I am a licensed Hunter, have been for 20 years.  Yes I've seen the population grow yes I've seen the population decline but I do know that the ministry continues to put out numbers that show the moose are in better shape than  back before the group hunting requirements began.
Ministry of Natural Resources and the big game committee meetings that occurred this past year across Ontario is a perfectly good example of how far they are out of touch with common hunter approx 2500 people show up out of 85,000 plus moose hunters in Ontario. Most didn't even come out to the meeting because they weren't aware of them. Now the big game committee believes that they can help make changes, this big game committee isn't  an elected group of officials representing the people, this is a group of  bullies who have their own self interest at heart be it financial or social. Ministry of natural resources  should be very careful when taking advice from this big game committee it does not appear that they have the support of the general hunting population. Ministry of Natural Resources needs to make a larger effort in making new information available to the hunter's of Ontario this EBR is just a perfectly good example, the numbers that you receive will not be impressive I'm sure. It is not the lack of caring , it is still due to the lack of awareness.  Truly the EBRs don't work,  paper copies is still the only way of contacting the moose hunting community reliably.
A new points system  is even more confusing then the draw system. There is nothing wrong with the draw system, only something wrong with a mathematics that the ministry of natural resources used to make their tag quotes.  There are many different methods of using the current draw system make it viable. Creating a 2 person calf tag harvest mandatory would reduce the number of moose calves that could be harvested by half,  even though very few calves get harvested in Ontario due to the difficulty of harvesting calves not population issues. This would be similar to a process that was used prior to the group requirements .
There is definitely a need for  another opportunity for the public to listen to the concerns of the big game committee and the ministry natural resources.

35017,/comment/35017,"I believe that limiting hunting groups to only 10 people will effect many groups in a negative way. I have been a part of a hunt camp for 16 years but it has been established for 30 years now with 15 plus owners. For the years we are only drawn for one tag this would cause us to have to remove hunters from our group that have been hunting and applying for several years. So where would you draw the line and pick and choose between hunters.

35022,/comment/35022,"I am opposed to the proposal for the following reasons:
1.  It does not adequately reduce moose calf hunting.  Moose populations have declined due to increased human hunter success over the past few decades due to increased length of hunting season, road access, use of ATVs, party hunting, and calf harvesting.  Moose calf harvesting should be further reduced to protect this resource for future generations.
2.  The hunting season should not be extended because it will afford more opportunities to decrease the moose population.
3.  The proposal does not have adequate scientific evidence to suggest that the changes will improve the sustainability of the moose population.
