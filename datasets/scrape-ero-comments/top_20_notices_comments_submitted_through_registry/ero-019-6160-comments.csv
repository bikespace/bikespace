61859,/comment/61859,"No change in authority should be made to the Status of Conservation Authorities. Their scope was laid out specifically to determine whether or not land should be conserved, specifically so that as housing pressure mounted critical drainage and biodiversity systems of watercourses would not be impacted.
Huge swaths of Toronto proper and the GTA remain zoned R1 zoned where quadhousing and duplexes would fit without altering the street scape.  Use the province's authority under CIHA to upzone along new rapid transit routes such as the durham-Scarborough BRT or Line 5. No business would invest into public transit and then incentivize housing that doesn't leverage it. Improve our provinces financial position by encouraging dense urban corridors that reduce servicing and infrastructure cost, while increasing transit ridership.
If you have run out of room for development without cannibalizing conservation zones, then very clearly you are working with a failure of a housing model.

I appreciate the efforts to provide more affordable housing for Ontarians, but I urge the government to find an alternative solution. I am strongly against the revisions suggested to the OWES since it will likely significantly cut back protection of wetland and species at risk.
Wetlands provide incredibly valuable ecosystem services. Removing them from the landscape will lead to considerable consequences down the road as we experience increases in flooding and will eventually result in financial consequences for the province,
These revisions completely go against our commitments to fight climate change. Disturbing these wetlands will release carbon into the atmosphere.
The list of consequences are innumerable and I'm sure the government is well aware of them so I will not go on.
Please do not proceed with reducing protections for wetlands by altering the OWES.

61898,/comment/61898,"Hello,
It is deeply concerning that the intention behind this evaluation is for the purpose of development. The decision making for this proposal is being made by those who are prioritizing housing without the scientific expertise- a short-sighted act that would create new housing with costs that will trickle down to the homeowners. What do you think happens to all the water in these wetlands once the areas are paved? They're not going to simply redirect around those areas, they will cause flooding issues, especially because there's less land that can retain the water. As someone who had to work with residents near  high water tables and seen sump pumps overworking, basements and ROADS flooding, this will only amplify this matter.
If this rezoning will be made to turn these wetland areas to be developed, the provincial government should take charge in compensating the people who will live and work there for any damages and repairs that it'd take up, and not deflect the responsibilities to the municipal government.
And make a lobbying with retaliating threats to politicians illegal, this is just corruption with extra steps.

Milton Weller wrote about this as long ago as 1988 (see attached). We know they are connected by groundwater, even at a distance, and that wildlife use the entire complexes, not individual wetlands. The benefits within a complex are not additive but interactive and synergistic, meaning that they can't be meaninfully reduced to what each smaller wetland within the complex would contribute on its own.

Those homes will not last. They will have no 'nature' remaining, except for small, fenced backyards with new trees planting where they won't thrive, and where a wetland once stood. Wetlands are key in mitigating disaster, and these houses will not be able to withstand the disasters that come. This is quite frankly nothing more than a disgusting money grab - Ontario doesn't need more homes quick, we need more rent control and fewer people buying up properties to sit empty or use as rentals. I have absolutely no idea who thought this would be a good idea. It makes me so sad to see Ontario continue down this road.

Especially in southern Ontario, I think it should be made clear that all wetlands within municipalities need to be evaluated over time. Right now, the wording on page 4 is ""can be applied"", when it should say ""will be applied"".  Otherwise, it may not be 100% clear that a potentially impacted wetland (e.g., from physical development, runoff, etc.) must be evaluated.
Perhaps more importantly, I think removal of MNRF from the process is removing vital objective review. This leaves the evaluation process open to corruption and removes important oversight that is actually one of the main roles and responsibilities of the public servants in the provincial government.  I get trying to reduce demands on already overworked staff, but this aspect of working for the public good should be non-negotiable.

62077,/comment/62077,"I am troubled that these proposals will result in the loss of wetlands in Ontario. First according to the report Back to Basics by Dianne Saxe over 75% of wetlands have been destroyed and there is a waitlist of over 200 years to properly evaluate existing wetlands. On top of this when the borders of wetlands can be changed more easily there is no distinction of the type of wetland. Bogs and fens cannot be replaced in human lifespans and there is evidence that natural wetlands are better. I do not understand the elimination of the Wetland Evaluation Technical Team (WETT) and the Southern Wetlands Evaluation
Review Committee and the Provincial Wetlands Working Group from the manual. I am opposed to a new section Wetland Re-evaluations and Mapping Updates because wetlands in a complexed wetland should be evaluated at the same time and there should be complete evaluation (Un evaluated wetlands should be evaluated first). There are no protections against land degradation a developer could purposely damage a wetland prior to evaluation or wait for years of extreme drought. If development occurs to close to wetlands, they will not be able to follow their natural cycle of growth and shrinkage which is important for the development of plant species and removal of invasive species as well as flood mitigation. A provincially significant wetland should not be allowed to shrink in size in order to allow natural processes to occur. If anything, wetlands should grow. The elimination of references to 120 meters in bordering areas is troubling. This number is based on both scientific and takes into account political consideration as being areas where likely impacts to wetlands could occur.
A section called ""A Complete Evaluation"" means it would be harder to add further protections if new evidence is found that it is needed. There are no changes added to protect smaller wetlands which have been found to better reduce algae blooms
The elimination of Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species and Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or
Threatened Species is troubling because it will result in a lot of points being taken away and fails to consider how wetlands are used. This could violate Federal legislation on endangered species
The elimination of locally significant wetland is troubling
There is also concern about loss of wetlands violate international law such as Aichi targets and may violate the Ramsar Convention if any provincially significant wetlands identified as Internationally important are negatively impacted.
Please do not pass these changes.

62099,/comment/62099,"Not mentioned are the non-evaluated wetland mapping and boundaries. These are usually incorrect, mapped boundaries too far from an actual wetland or no wetland exists at all. Is there going to be a new process or more evaluations completed to update these non-evaluated wetlands that have been mapped? This more of an issue when obtaining a permit to build than the actual evaluated mapped wetland.
Many homeowners/landowners are subject to these non-evaluated wetlands that have been mapped on our property and have no cost-effective way to correct this issue. Proper wetland evaluations are extremely expensive (not affordable) or not possible to complete (wetland mapped over multiple private properties). It would be nice to have a system/program in place to have these problems corrected or remapped to show correctly for wetlands and help landowners on costs and obtain minor/major building permits.
At the current state with municipalities and conservation authorities the use of these non-evaluated wetland maps are excessively used during the permitting process and it does not matter if it's a non-evaluated status, they treated as a wetland and no permits can be obtained, even though a wetland may not even exist.
We need more non-evaluated wetlands evaluation options or ministry staff to start ground truthing/evaluating the current non-evaluated wetlands that have been mapped and updated to actually know the true state and number of wetlands out there, so people can build.

consultants, hired by developers, to recommend if wetlands should lose protected status.
* Wetland boundaries can be remapped without having to re-evaluate the entire wetland.
* OMNRF is removed from the process, leaving all decisions in the hands of local municipalities.

62305,/comment/62305,"The Ontario government recently introduced the More Homes Built Faster 2022 Act (Bill 23) claiming that it will be a new solution to the housing crisis in Ontario. However, if this Bill is passed in its current form, it will have devastating impacts on Ontario's ecosystems. Wetlands are incredibly diverse landscapes with a wide variety of ecosystem functions that are biologically, hydrologically, and biogeochemically significant. Wetlands provide essential habitat to many terrestrial and aquatic species and aid in the cycling of nutrients and storage of carbon, which is critical to protect for climate change mitigation. Likewise, wetland systems aid in flood and drought attenuation, maximize groundwater recharge, and improve ecosystem resiliency against disturbances such as fire or drought. Regardless of the type or size of the wetland, each wetland plays an unique and essential role in our watersheds. However, the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System has the potential to destroy most of Ontario's ""Provincially Significant"" wetlands- an action that is irreversible, even with proper restoration measures. This update will jeopardize the protections put in place by Conservation Authorities to conserve these critical ecosystems, thus transforming our watersheds into areas that lack both ecological and hydrological complexity. As a result, declines in biodiversity and increases in carbon release, flooding, and drought may become more common across the landscape. As a wetland hydrologist, I strongly urge you to not update the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System as it will drastically degrade Ontario's landscape. Instead, I encourage the Ontario government to discover new ways of improving Ontario's housing crisis without destroying Ontario's natural lands. Protecting all wetlands, regardless if they are labelled significant or not, is crucial for climate change mitigation, ecosystem resiliency, water resources management, and the wellbeing of our communities and future generations.

Keep Conservation Authority powers with the Conservation Authorities, as they do their work efficiently and save the province costs in the long-run (i.e., by avoiding home and subdivision flooding!). As a young person, I support the government's efforts to increase the rate of new housing being built. However, this should be done by increasing density in existing urban and suburban areas - more missing middle options (like walk-up apartment buildings, townhomes) in currently single-family-zoned areas as of right would be more effective. We don't need to destroy more of the natural environment to build more homes, we just need to use our already developed land more efficiently. This would also reduce the infrastructure costs associated with sprawl. Natural heritage belongs to us all, and building over it is not needed to increase the supply of housing. Build more, smarter, rather than continuing the mistakes made by governments past.

I have conducted evaluations as an independent consultant, with a couple of consulting companies as well as (during a brief period) with MNRF and another with a Conservation Authority.  In my current role, I have had proposals approved by Municipalities involving wetland removal and compensation, as well as those that have recommended setbacks/buffers/vegetation protection zones.
While I understand that there is a housing shortage, I do not understand how removing some of the wetland protections determined through OWES is going to make housing any more affordable.  The removal of a number of phrases regarding the protection(s) of wetlands in the OWES southern manual, (e.g., that OWES aids in the protection of PSWs under the PPS and that Municipalities may determine if non-PSWs are significant at a local scale and may choose to protect them) is concerning.
I would also appreciate further clarification regarding why all reference(s) to wetland complexes is (are) being removed.  Wetlands in close proximity to each other often provide 'added value' on the landscape with the group providing a function greater than the sum of individual wetland functions.  This value is not solely biological.  Hydrological considerations (e.g., flood attenuation and water quality) are often cumulative.  Reducing the ability to group wetlands for evaluation purposes to those within 30 metres of each other interspersed with small pockets of upland forest and/or wetlands along a river or lake separated by 100 feet or less is insufficient.
As an additional comment, Appendices 5 and 6 should be made available along with the draft manual containing the proposed changes.  Are we to assume they are the same as what is in the existing manual?

Increasing population density within city limits by allowing different kinds of housing, such as apartments, townhouses, attached and semi-detached homes to be built has a multitude of benefits over urban expansion.

62959,/comment/62959,"As long as this new process strengthens existing wetland protections.
Southern Ontario houses a huge amount of biodiversity, especially in wetlands.
Wetlands act as a natural storm water management solution as well - no need to spend money and resources in storm water management infrastructure.
These wetlands protect nearby existing residents from floods as well.
We also need to enhance wetland protections to protect biodiversity. The world is currently experiencing a biodiversity collapse, so we should be working towards stronger protections with our existing wetlands as well as funding new re-wilding projects to create new wetland ecosystems.
We need to allow environmental planners and biologists to do their jobs without greed and politics getting in the way. Developers are very wealthy people so they can easily afford to develop on lands that are already developed or to repurpose an abandoned/existing site.
I work for a civil consulting firm specifically on subdivision development and we also have an environmental planning team. Our developer clients work with us with no issues, as we are transparent with them on the processes and what to expect. Developers can be reasonable people and develop responsibly without destroying forested lands or wetlands. We just need to strengthen protections on these lands so that they are 100% a no-go for development and educate our developers ahead of time.
This will result in a clear cut answer for developers and municipalities for planning and ecological protection.
Thank you.

They provide flood mitigation, carbon storage, water filtration and are home to large amounts of unique species. They're also one of the most quickly disappearing environments in Canada. The evaluation system should be made more restrictive in the context of wetlands and existing greenspace, not less. Sprawl is not the answer to the housing crisis; densifying existing areas is.
Leave wetlands alone. That's the whole point of protecting them.

Could, at the very least, increase points for number/size of nearby wetlands to compensate for the change.
3. Removal of MNRF review is going to cause drift in how evaluations are conducted. Which isn't fair to the wetlands that get under evaluated, or to developers that will get less consistent results between evaluators.
4. No mention of how data will reach LIO now that there is no submission to MNRF, is it up to the evaluators to submit spatial data post evaluation? The municipalities?

64824,/comment/64824,"I strongly oppose the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.  This short sighted legislation will worsen what I feel is our most pressing problem in the province - climate change and loss of biodiversity.  Draining and filling in wetlands to allow more housing and subdivision development will definitely worsen the most pressing issue that we now face in Ontario. That most pressing issue is definitely not housing.
Once the wetland habitat has been drained, species and vegetation cover lost, the water table disrupted, it is irreversible.  We can never make it right again 20 years from now when we realize the impact of this action.  It is irreversible.   Life will become unbearable due to the increasingly high temperatures, violent storms, erosion, poor air and water quality due to environmental degradation.  Having a home to live in will mean little if the world outside your door is an environmental catastrophe.
I feel that this proposal to allow municipalities to make decisions on redrawing wetland boundaries, choosing to bak fill and rezone wetlands, remove the vegetation and proceed with new subdivisions is a disasgter.  Municipalities lack expertise in judging the long term environmental consequences of their land use decisions.  Even with the existing rules on wetlands they continue to frequently ignore recommendations of local conservation authorities in favour of severance, rezoning and development permits.  There is a municipal tax revenue bonus to providing such permissions.  Putting Municipalities in charge of redrawing wetland boundaries is like putting the ""fox in charge of the hen house"".
The province should  be seeking more environmentally friendly and enlightened ideas to solve the housing shortage (densification, building up not out, ""tiny houses"", small footprint homes, etc.  ) rather than irreversibly sacrificing the environment in order to build more and more urban sprawl.

Wetlands are nature’s sponge and help to protect areas downstream (like built-up urban areas) from flooding. Wetlands help to filter and improve water quality and they are critical as carbon sinks with their abundant vegetation. They remove carbon dioxide from the air and store it. If they are ditched and drained during development all that stored carbon dioxide and methane is released making climate change worse.
The Ontario government's proposal to build over wetlands to provide needed housing units sounds like a plan to implement good intentions (for the public good) in the worst possible way, and likely lowering the resiliance that urban infrastructures and systems, and the human society that lives in them, will need to withstand the effects of climate change in the immediate and long-term future.

65330,/comment/65330,"I can offer a unique perspective on both Wetland Evaluations and Development Planning, having worked as a provincial biologist-wetland evaluator for 35 years and now as a private consultant and Species at Risk expert.  The wetland evaluation system was brought into place by the progressive conservative government in the early 1980s. The purpose of OWES was intended to help the local planning authorities discriminate significant wetlands from non-significant wetlands, so they can make better decisions on development planning.
The Wetland evaluation system (OWES) is science-based to remove political bias. Significance is based upon wetland functions including how they protect lands from flooding, erosion, climate change (stochastic weather events), water quality, habitat, forestry, fisheries, and rare species. To remove any one of these functions from the evaluation system would bias the outcome politically and set environmental planning backward 40 years.
The OWES system has changed over the years.  Originally there were 7 categories of significance, the first being the highest level of significance and included wetlands like the Wainfleet Bog, Point Pelee, Long Point Marsh, Point Abino wetland, Willoughby Marsh, Grand River Marshes, Holland Marshes for example. And the seventh category would be small wet- naturalized areas commonly found around old ditches and abandoned farm fields. It was easy to see the difference in protecting these large significant areas over a patch of cattail in a farm field. However, when the Wetland guidelines were incorporated into the Provincial Policy Statement under the Planning Act, the original seven categories of significance were oversimplified into just two categories (significant or not significant). Over the years the OWES has been reassessed and changes made and the knowledgeable provincial biologist's role within the development planning process at the local level has been removed.  This kind of expertise is also not usually available within each municipality. Municipalities now rely on the expertise provided within an Environmental Impact Study prepared by the landowner’s consultant and the review by either the Conservation Authority or Region. The Region and the Conservation Authorities rely on the Provincial Policy Statement and their regulations and policies to provide advice to the municipalities during their review.  Their policies have changed now to include all wetlands for protection including the small wet areas regenerating in a farm field, and they have automatically applied restrictive buffers away from any of these wet areas.   The outcome of the plan reviews has become oversimplified today and is more about checking off a list of planning boxes than applying knowledge gained from the EIS.  The result is an automatic application of restrictive policies and buffer distances from all wetlands significant or not. Landowners now have to protect all “wet areas of land”, interpreted without the objectivity OWES system and the result is a loss of potentially developable land.
My recommendation is to not throw out the objective processes, which is OWES, and the EIS but to reconsider the policies that remove the actual objectivity from the land use decisions. Review the policies that no longer incorporate OWES, those that require the automatic buffering of a feature and therefore reduce developable land unnecessarily.
The OWES was recently reviewed and updated in 2018 and the Provincial Policy Statement was originally updated in 2020 and many Regional and Municipal Official plans were updated in 2022. Please, do not make a science base process the scapegoat for the housing crisis.

The proposed changes would see a wetland evaluation or re-evaluation complete once it has been received by a “decision maker” addressing land use planning and development or resource management matters, as opposed to ecologists, biologists, and other natural heritage experts who should be providing oversight.
The proposed changes to classification of wetland complexes in Durham Region, including Duffins Creek, Carruthers Creek, Lynde Marsh, Second Marsh and Black-Farewell, would result in a piecemeal approach that could reduce separation distances between wetlands and development areas, or remove smaller features in their entirety. This undermines the critical role these areas play in the wider natural system and the ecosystem services they provide. Scoring for the presence of endangered and threatened species has also been removed from the scoring template. Much of the detail outlining the components of a complete wetland evaluation file and sources of information are proposed to be removed. Removing this guidance will create inconsistency and confusion in applying the OWES.

65534,/comment/65534,"Wetlands require MORE protection from experts, not less. It is completely unacceptable to assign municipalities the responsibility of determining which wetlands must be destroyed for development.  Expert guidance exists in the form of reference manuals and experienced professionals at MNRF and Ontario's Conservation Authorities and they need to be consulted in all cases.
In the past, wetlands were drained with little knowledge of the impacts. Now we are very aware of the negative impacts of removing wetlands, we have clear scientific proof of the ecosystem services provided by wetlands, and we have the knowledge base with which to train the next generation of expert ecologists. No government has the right to ignore scientific facts because they interfere with an anti-environment agenda. No government has the right to simplify (dumb down) the communication regarding environmental science, remove a well-established wetland evaluation tool, and disable conservation authorities so that it becomes impossible for sound decisions to be made.
Wetlands are especially valuable to mitigate the extreme rain events that are now the new normal in Ontario. Ontario's residents will enjoy far more benefits from thoughtful environmental protection than from shortsighted, poorly-planned, rushed development.
This is the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration. The goal is ""preventing, halting, and reversing the degradation of ecosystems worldwide"" (https://www.decadeonrestoration.org). Please note the words PREVENTING and HALTING.
In 1981, Canada became a party to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. I would like to include an excerpt from IUCN:
""The Ramsar Strategic Plan 2016–2024, adopted by the 168 Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention at their twelfth meeting in Uruguay includes targets for the restoration of wetlands, with biodiversity conservation.  Given the important role that wetlands play in local and regional climate processes, including storing greenhouse gases, they represent an essential component of strategies for adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change. They can make a significant contribution to building the resilience of communities globally.
Yet these systems continue to be degraded, annual rates of loss have actually accelerated in the last two decades. Since 1970, 81% of inland wetland species populations and 36% of coastal and marine species have declined.  Over the last century we have lost 70% of our natural wetland area.
We, International Organization Partners to the Ramsar Convention would like to remind Contracting Parties to the Convention that our role is to bring these concerns to the forefront of their activities on wetland management, protection and restoration.  We call for a specific programme on Wetland Restoration under the newly adopted UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030).  This would help to urgently accelerate the work of countries in mobilising the Strategic Plan of the Ramsar Convention, and to act at the pace needed to deliver against the ambitious SDGs, Aichi Targets, post-2020 biodiversity framework, as well as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.  We must reverse the decline of natural wetlands, and one key strategy to do that is to restore wetlands and their functions as a key ally for all countries to adapt to climate change impacts, and to help store carbon."" (https://www.iucn.org/news/water/201903/call-wetland-decade-under-un-dec…)
In addition, Canada has committed to the Sustainable Development Goals. The choice to destroy wetlands goes against several goals: Goal 6 - Clean water and sanitation, Goal 13 - Climate Action, Goal 14 - Life Below Water, and Goal 15 - Life on Land. Destroying wetlands to create more urban sprawl goes against Goal 3 - Good Health and Wellbeing and Goal 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities. Removing knowledgeable organizations from the decision making process goes against Goal 17 - Partnership for the Goals (https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/agenda-…).
Meanwhile, Canada has committed to protect 25% of land and ocean by 2025 and 30% by 2030 to mitigate climate change and loss of biodiversity (https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2021/11/the-go…). Some of the most at-risk areas are in the most populated areas. They cannot just be considered sacrifice zones for urban sprawl and developer profits.
Ontario is part of Canada and Canada has made commitments to the global community. Bill 23 cannot be approved.

The proposed changes will reduce the size and function of provincially significant wetlands by removing  protection from wetland ""units"" making up a wetland complex.
According to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System manual, this loss will cause reduced flood protection, water quality improvement, recreation opportunities, and fish and wildlife habitat if reclassified wetland areas are converted to housing or other development.
Furthermore, the updates propose to divest the responsibility for wetland protection from MNRF to municipalities and wetland evaluators employed by developers.  This will inevitably mean that there is less expertise to assess changes to wetland protection and greater pressure from developers.

65814,/comment/65814,"I am quite concerned about certain omissions from the OWES manual that will impact the integrity of wetlands in the future. Particularly, the revisions downplay the need for thorough evaluations informed by expert knowledge. Excluding expert knowledge will lead to poor-quality evaluations with missing data. Decisions based on poor quality evaluations will therefore be misinformed.
Several amendments also clearly open up wetlands for potential land use changes. This prioritizes implementing destructive land use changes over making informed decisions about land use changes based on a thorough understanding of a wetland's ecology. This will result in long term, irreversible impacts to the ecological integrity of wetlands and adjacent natural areas that will cost the province billions of dollars in damages and lost ecosystem services.
Wetlands are land cover types with the highest per hectare values in the ecosystem services they provide, including erosion control and clean water provision. Please see the attached article which assigns monetary value to ecosystem services.
------------------------------------
Please see below some specific omissions of concern and my comments. These omissions are those which are striked-out and in blue font in the ""Proposed Updates"" document:
Page 4: Nevertheless, the evaluation is not a complete biophysical inventory and certain information, particularly about the presence of rare species and about hydrological functions, may be lacking even after the evaluation is completed. If this is determined to be the case, then more information should be obtained before making decisions about the types of land uses in the vicinity of evaluated wetlands (particularly those deemed to be provincially significant).
Concerns: this omission suggests that the possibility of rare species and/or additional hydrologic functions should be ignored, and additional inventories should not be conducted if needed (e.g. if a wetland is to be developed). This prioritizes implementing destructive land use changes over making informed decisions about land use changes based on a thorough understanding of an ecosystem. This will impact ecological integrity of wetlands and adjacent natural areas.
Page 5: 2. By the province as an aid to land use planning. In this regard, the wetland evaluation system serves as an essential cornerstone of wetland policies of the Provincial Policy Statement, authorized under Section 3 of the Planning Act. As well, the evaluation system may prove of value in identifying nationally and internationally important wetland features.
3. By conservation authorities as an aid in implementing regulations under the Conservation Authorities Act. Conservation authorities for purposes of public safety, natural hazard prevention and management, regulate wetlands for flood attenuation, natural storage capacities and for preventing shoreline erosion. Conservation authorities also regulate areas around wetlands that may interfere with the hydrologic function of the adjacent wetland including in general areas within 120 metres of all PSWs and areas within 30 metres of all other wetlands. Many conservation authorities evaluate wetlands; MNR retains authority to identify PSWs.
Concerns: The revisions suggest that results of wetland evaluations will not be used by the province or conservation authorities to inform land use planning. This suggests that significant wetlands are not important to the province for consideration in land use planning, and opens these spaces up to development. Building on wetlands will impact our water quality, flood and erosion-control abilities, and potentially place new development in hazardous areas (which would have been advised by conservation authorities). These impacts are long lasting (some irreversible), and will cost the province billions of dollars in damages and lost ecosystem services in the years to come.
Page 6: If an evaluator is uncertain how to proceed with or interpret any component of this evaluation system, they should contact the appropriate MNR District Office for clarification. In addition to having knowledge about local natural heritage features and functions, the local MNR biologist/ecologist has access to experts in a variety of disciplines who can assist in answering natural heritage questions. Where disagreements about an evaluation occur District MNR staff may seek additional input from the MNR’s Provincial Wetlands Program. Any such advice obtained should be noted/included in the wetland evaluation file.
Included text: This manual sets out guidance for assessing wetlands. Evaluators should rely on their observation, data collection and research and use their professional judgement and expertise in applying the OWES.
Concerns: MNRF staff are expertly trained in wetland evaluations and should be consulted upon uncertainty. This amendment does not specify that evaluators need to be experts to conduct evaluations either. This revision downplays the need to consult experts to effectively conduct wetland evaluations, which may lead to lower-quality evaluations missing critical details such as thorough species lists and documents of other important ecological functions.
Page 8: A wetland evaluation, re-evaluation or mapping update will be considered “complete” once it has been received by a decision maker addressing a land use planning and development or resource management matter.
Concerns: nowhere is it stated that the decision maker need be an expert in wetland ecology.

And wetlands are crucial:  to preserving wildlife  habitat and to preserving a liveable environment for human beings:  by sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change;  by storing and filtering water and water runoff; and by protecting against droughts, wildfires, flooding and extreme weather and other damaging effects of climate change.  They are vital and valuable natural infrastructure and should be seen and valued and conserved as such.
Moreover these proposed new policies would promote still MORE urban sprawl, bringing more GHG emitting traffic and high emissions industrial development into our rapidly dwindling green space  —-  thus further exacerbating the Climate Crisis which is already endangering our health, safety, and wellbeing,  and rendering the province’s climate targets unreachable.
Our housing needs, particularly for more low-cost housing, can and should be met instead by policies permitting and promoting higher density  residential development WITHIN our municipalities  —-  including by more infilling,  addition of “granny suites”,  and “tiny houses”.

66694,/comment/66694,"Wetlands provide many critical economic, social, and environmental services (Whiteley and Irwin 1986, Zedler and Kercher 2005, Yang et al. 2016). Wetlands improve water quality via water filtration and reduce financial and social costs to homeowners and the government by flood prevention and securing groundwater for human use. A recent study estimated that the wetlands in the Credit River watershed reduce insurable claims for a single flood event by 46% and reduce property damages 17 to 29% (up to $3.5M, the wetlands in the Laurel Creek watershed reduces insurable claims for a single flood event by 18% and reduce property damages 38 to 51% (up to $53M) (Moudrak et al. 2017). Wetlands have never been more important with climate change increasing the frequency of severe weather precipitation events.
I support updating the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) for conciseness and clarity but have concerns around the proposed updates. My primary concern is that the proposed changes will threaten economic, social, and environmental services provided by wetlands by (1) degrading wetland function through the fragmentation of wetland complexes, and (2) preventing municipalities from identifying wetlands that protect public and private infrastructure.
#1 Wetland complexes are – by definition – linked to one another through hydrological and hydrogeological processes. Failing to identify the broader complex threatens the long-term function of the complex with consequences for ground water recharge, flood management, and property loss. It is important to keep wetland complexes within the OWES by explaining what they are (pages 9 and 26 in the Proposed Updates) and ensuring that the wetland complex is evaluated in its entirety to prevent fragmentation (pages 7-8 in the Proposed Updates). In short, wetland complexes must be maintained within the OWES.
#2 Locally Important Wetlands: Wetlands provide a critical service to Ontarians by protecting public and private. Removing municipalities’ ability to protect locally important wetlands (page 63) increases the risk of losing functionally important wetlands that may not meet the 600-point threshold to be designated ‘provincially significant.’ Municipalities must be given the latitude to protect wetlands that protect public and private infrastructure from floods, provide groundwater to nearby residents, or impact other important community needs.
#3 Wetlands under 2 ha should added to the OWES. Recent research details wetland conversion in 7 Ontario municipalities and found that most lost wetlands were less than 2 ha in size and that stormwater management ponds intended on mitigating risk were smaller than lost wetlands (Birch 2019, Birch et al. 2022). Small wetlands provide ecosystems services that are not directly replicable by stormwater management ponds (Rooney et al. 2015) and must be considered within policy.

Very quietly in the last month the Ontario PC government has come up with a bold plan that
puts the future of Ontario’s wetlands, climate change policy and environment at risk. The policy
is couched in language about “building more houses faster”, but eliminates much of the
protection conservation authorities were able to provide to Provincially Significant Wetlands
(PSW’s). It eliminates the protection of species at risk in wetlands that the Ontario Ministry of
Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF) provided.
“Wetlands are critical to water filtration, flood retention, erosion control, carbon
storage, nutrient cycling and groundwater recharge. They also provide habitat for
specialized wildlife communities. Over 20 percent of the province’s species at risk are
directly dependent on wetland habitats according to leading researchers and Ontario
Nature.” The government is passing legislation that puts wetlands at risk while
allowing developers to ride roughshod over protections for Provincially Significant
Wetlands(1).”
Some of the key changes that threaten Ontario’s Wetlands include:
 Wetland units that are part of a Provincially Significant Wetland (PSW) complex can be re-
evaluated individually. Those units can be removed from the PSW. This leaves it up to
consultants, hired by developers, to recommend if wetlands should lose protected status.
 Wetland boundaries can be remapped without having to re-evaluate the entire wetland.
 OMNRF is removed from the process, leaving all decisions in the hands of local municipalities
where there may be little or no wetland expertise.
 Conservation Authorities (CA’s) will be prohibited from being contracted by municipalities to
comment on Acts, including the Planning Act.  Therefore, the ability of conservation authorities
to provide natural heritage comments to the City on planning applications may now be
prohibited.
 Endangered and Threatened species will no longer contribute to scoring as a PSW.
 All Conservation Authorities (CA’s) must tell the government which lands they own that would
be suitable for housing. Are we going to cover The Cascades in housing or Mission Marsh
Conservation Area perhaps?
 No permits are needed if Planning Act authorization obtained, and new tools are proposed for
the government to force CA’s to issue permits whether or not development meets
environmental policies and environmental best practices. 
 Developers can carve pieces out of protected wetlands and flood other areas to
“compensate” the damage.

I would consider the current manual to be a fairly high quality document. Could it use some review and improvement? Sure, there is always room to improve and clarify processes when new information becomes available. The proposed changes to this document and the OWES system would in my opinion be a major regression in the quality of this document and the OWES.
Reading through these proposed changes it seems to me like no one with an ecological or wetland science background had much if anything to do with the suggested changes.
It is also fairly obvious what these proposed changes are designed to do, which is not to improve the process of wetland evaluation (and subsequent management and protection) in Ontario at all but to make it much harder for wetlands in Ontario to be evaluated as provincally significant. With reduced protections, it will make it easier for these features to be negatively impacted and/or lost through development activities.
I think it is an important point to note that despite all of the rule's, regulations, etc., that are in place to protect and limit development within or in close proximity to wetlands, the loss of wetland area in Ontario is not a thing of the past. Slowed in recent years due to the protections we have put in place, probably. Reversed, no.
The major themes that I see in these proposed changes to OWES are: 1. removal of MNRF from the process of administering the program. 2. Nearly complete removal of reference to wetland complexes and complexing as a concept and and a wetland property that has any bearing on the scoring of a wetland. 3. A great reduction in the need to document the process of wetland evaluation, reference to field data sheets and the need to document work seems to be for the most part removed, with only the need for digital mapping data clearly remaining. 4. Removal of Endangered or Threatened species as a scoring factor in determining a wetlands significance.
Starting with the first paragraph: “As stewards of Ontario's Natural Resources, one of the MNRF's mandates is the protection and sustainable management of Ontario's natural heritage features, including wetlands.” How is the Provincial Government's total removal of the MNRF's involvement with administering and overseeing OWES going to help accomplish this? To me this is major shirking of responsibility and counter intuitive. This needs some explaining. Is MNRF still going to have involvement in training wetland evaluators? Currently one cannot be acceptably considered a wetland evaluator unless they have recieved the training from MNRF sanctioned sessions.
Who will the responsibility of officially identifying provincially significant wetlands be downloaded to? It is not entirely clear with these proposed changes. It looks like MNRF and Conservation Authorities (the two current governmental entities with the most qualified staff to complete these assessments of wetland evaluations) are proposed to be removed from involvement in the process. Based on the proposed changes it looks like the responsibility would/may possibly go to municipalities but it also appears that anyone who is trained (again, who will they be trained by in the future?) could determine the signficance of a wetland (provincial or otherwise). Would a municpality be in charge of assessing and accepting evaluations? Do they have staff to do this? Allowing anyone qualified to evaluate wetlands could be very problematic if allowed, as many of the trained people who would be doing this evaluation work are consultants directly working for development proponents. Without a relatively impartial third party evaluating their work, the potential for improper assessment and evaluation would unfortunately be greater.
The striking out of all of the sections on wetland complexes and reference to the concept of wetland complexes is a little disturbing, and detached from the reality of the form and function of many wetlands on the landscape. It is a sound and well accepted ecological concept  that not all wetlands consist of only a contiguous wetland unit, and that closely spaced wetland units function together hydrologically and ecologically as a single larger wetland. But it seems that these proposed changes to OWES would mean that each discrete wetland unit would need to be evaluated separately for significance (except for in some narrow, but poorly defined circumstanes, see further comment below), greatly reducing a wetlands scoring potential with reduced size and complexity being attributed to a single wetland unit and not the entire wetland complex. Whether we choose to use the word complex, as we have in the OWES, or another word used to describe grouped items is not important, but the concept is.
Then, a section is added on page 20 under the “Wetland Edges Bordering Lakes and Rivers” section (why is it placed specifically in this section when it applies to many wetlands that do not border on lakes and rivers?) that acknowledges that some wetlands can be composed of multiple closely spaced units (which could be called a complex). It is obvious the removal of complexing as a concept from the OWES would make it next to impossible for many of the smaller units in a wetland complex to be scored as provincially significant, even though they hydrologically and ecologically contribute to the function of the wetland. The complexing section should simply not be removed. Potentially it could be updated, the complexing process clarified, rules for complexing strengthened, but any changes should be based on the best available, scientifically gained knowledge. For example OWES currently uses 750 m for the cut off distance for consideration of complexing units together, if a change to this distance is suggested it should be based as much as possible on defensible background research and data. There are already criteria to consider such that not every wetland that occurs within 750 m of another wetland or wetland complex is automaticlly considered to be a part of that wetland complex.
I don't think there is much to say about the removal of much of the reference for the need to record field data, keeping a wetland evaluation file (obviously under the proposed changes the file wouldn't go to MNRF), etc., other than it is baffling. Environmental assessment work should always be well documented for the basic need of defending a conclusion on a features significance, etc., in the case of legal challenges, etc.
Removal of Endangered or Threatened species from scoring? Why? These species are Endangered or Threatened for a reason, with habitat loss or degradation usually being one of the major factors in a species decline. Obviously, any habitat that is important in the life cycle of a END or THR species should be considered significant. I am not sure what the logic or point of removal of this is from how we assess wetlands under OWES (other than another way to make it very hard for a wetland to be scored as signficant). What is the reasoning or alternative suggestion here? I know END and THR species are not a part of the assessment of Signficiant Wildlife Habitat, as they generally receive some protection under the Province's Endangered Species Act, but to me they are still an important part of determining a wetlands signficance. Removal of END  or THR species as a scoring factor in OWES would need to be defended by some logical reasoning that will not be detrimental to both the species at risk and the habitats that support them. I don't know what that reasoning could be.
There are other things proposed for removal that don't seem to bear much on how a wetland would be scored but are still hard to understand. The removal of several recomended background sources of information and removal of a table that recommends the basic field equipment you would need to complete wetland evaluation work. Scratching out things like taking mapping out to when conducting evaluation fieldwork? Why?
The re-evaluation vs closed file aspect of new proposed OWES rules. The way it reads is that a wetland can be re-evaluated (i.e. under these new proposed rules) but then it is a closed file. Under the current system a wetland evaluation is really never “closed”. Wetland evaluation files are meant to remain open because often a wetland cannot be fully evaluated in one go due to access limitations, etc. To me seems obvious what the tactic is here, make it way harder for a given wetland unit to be evaluated as significant under these proposed changes, you can re-evaluate a previously identified provincially significant wetland unit under these new rules, which will in many cases lead to a new evaluation of “not provincially signficant” for a given unit, then it is a closed book on that wetland unit.
I agree it would be good to more fully clarify the determination protocol in regards to the presence of wetland in the wetland-agricultural land interface. In a logical way, backed by as much research and evidence as is available.
I agree with harmonizing some of the section of the OWES that deal with wildlife habitat features with the specific relevant Significant Wildlife Habitat Ecoregion Criterion Schedules.
Reference to PPS seems to be removed from the OWES manual with these proposed changes. Are changes coming to PPS Section 2.0 Wise Use of Resources/2.1 Natural Heritage? I can only imagine what these would look like. I can't support any change in policy that would reduce protections for our significant natural features. Two of the major environmental crises the entire planet faces, rapid biodiversity loss and climate change will not be positively impacted by easing the occurence of negative impacts to, and loss of area of these natural features.
The MNRF, “Stewards of Ontario's Natural Resources” “MNRF's mandates is the protection and sustainable management of Ontario's natural heritage features, including wetlands” abandoning involvement with OWES , hard to understand. This is the government agency that has always done this, now trying to absolve itself of this responsibility with no clear (or practical?) alternative. I realize that government agencies can shift and change responsibiliites with the whims of whatever administration is in at the time but this just seems, as said before, like a major dereliction of duty. Not even a clear transfer of this responsibility somewhere else.
Appendix 1 – “The ministry has determined that a wetland is provincially signficiant when it has been identfied  as such using this manual”. Which ministry will this be?
Appendix 10 “The Wetland Plant List may be updated from time to time and any such updates will be made available on a website” which website, hosted by what agency?
I think a positive change that could be made to OWES, not suggested in these proposed changes, would be the incorporation of a more statistically defensible method of determing presence of a wetland via the vegetation cover and 50 % relative cover rule. For example point intercept vegetation sampling methods.
I request that details of the authorship and technical consultation process for suggesting these proposed changes be made public, qualifications of those consulted, etc.

I think that clearer policy and direction should be included in the OWES on how to deal with assess and classify man made features (like dug ponds in farming operations, older stormwater management ponds, etc.) that may exhibit wetland characters, that may or may not be in proximity to naturally occurring wetlands. This would include policy on features that may have been on the landscape for varying periods of time, in some cases potentially many years, possibly no longer used, etc. Methods to determin the origin of questionable features, etc. (e.g. air photo review, document review).

ERO # 019-6141, 6160, 6162, 6163, 6177, 6197, 6196, 6172, 2927
At the Mulmur Council meeting held on November 2, 2022, Council of the Township of Mulmur passed the following resolution regarding the More Homes Built Faster Act.
Moved by Cunningham Seconded by Clark
THAT Council receive the report of Tracey Atkinson, Planner, entitled Bill 23;
AND THAT Council direct staff to submit comments by the legislated deadline. CARRIED.
The Township of Mulmur is concerned that Bill 23 and the proposed amendments to the Conservation Authority Act, Ontario Land Tribunal Act, Municipal Act, Planning Act, and Development Charges Act are a further downloading of Provincial responsibilities and costs onto the local municipalities and its residents.
Changes to the Conservation Authority Act appear to encourage development on natural heritage features (such as wetlands), hazards (such as floodplains) and previously conserved lands.  Further, it appears to allow for the consideration of development on lands that have been donated by citizens for the purpose of conservation.  Further amendments to the Act would limit the flexibility of the Township to protect its natural heritage features and areas.
Changes to the Planning Act appear to limit the rights of existing citizens, by removing opportunities to participate and appeal planning applications.  Although changes appear to promote affordable housing, they reduce the tools to collect funds to support the growth and address conflicting land use (through site plan, buffering, etc)
The shortfall from proposed changes to the Development Charges will have to be offset by existing taxpayers opposed to development paying for itself.  Additional work is also being created related to spending and allocating reserve funds. Phasing in charges and exempting the cost of undertaking Development Charges studies from the list of eligible items means that the existing tax base would further subsidize development, without any benefit to the community.
The Township is concerned with the decreased quality and quantity of parkland, and overall decreased service level that could be achieved based on changes to the Development Charges Act and Planning Act.
Lastly, the Township is confused with the new direction to remove the upper tier planning function.  The loss of a upper tier planning function jeopardizes the consistency, attention to cross-jurisdictional matters and the collaboration amongst lower tiers. The County of Dufferin was required, only recently as a result of Regulation 352/02, to adopt an Official Plan.  The County is now part way through a Municipal Comprehensive Review and spending significant resources to update the Official Plan.  The Township is concerned with the proposed classes of upper-tier municipalities and uncertainty related to upper tiers not named, but that the Minister could further name through regulations.
Sincerely,
Tracey Atkinson

68574,/comment/68574,"Overall we find the numerous changes to this 'manual' will weaken the professional discretion of Certified Wetland Evaluators for both the Southern and Northern Ontario versions and their ability to perform acceptable, comprehensive and fair assessments.
As a consequence of downloading the notification to affected land owners of any given evaluation result solely onto Evaluators, and the numerous strike outs of MNRF as a reviewer and custodian of expertise will potentially result in untoward pressures on individual evaluators from any land owner objecting to their findings. In extreme cases it could subject the evaluator to outright intimidation.
The clauses regarding ""re-evaluations"" are completely retrograde and open many wetland classifications to complete incremental removal. This would appear to be the real intent of these changes, and can not be considered 'updates'.
The complete striking out of the Wetland Files section is abhorrent, bad scientific process, irresponsible and detrimental to sound government decisions on land use.
Striking out the section on assessment of breeding habitat for endangered species is a further blow to the efficacy of the Endangered Species Act and Regulations.
In total the changes give the impression that these 'updates' in whole are an attempt to neuter the effectiveness of wetland classification and make more acreage available for land speculation and infills.
Ontario can not afford the loss of any more wetland area. The province's civil infrastructure is increasingly exposed to degradation and collapse resulting in costs far outweighing the economic gain resulting from deconstructing environmental evaluation and classification.
Leave the OWES as is prior to this proposal.

Reducing protection on wetlands and their ecosystem and human health services is short sighted and will result in additional costs to human health and infrastructure.  Building more homes on areas formerly protected as natural features will not solve the housing crisis.  Ontario needs visionary leadership that is not driven by simple approaches such as reassessing land for development.  This approach will continue to encourage sprawl, traffic congestion, loss of life and property due to flooding, increased insurance claims and costs among many other costly and harmful impacts to human health and well being.  The Ontario government needs to be exploring ways to increase affordable, accessible housing that addresses climate mitigation, long term employment and a healthy ecosystem.  Removing protection from lands already at risk is short sighted and a knee jerk response to an issue that requires a systems approach.
It is ridiculous for this government to ignore the research on wetlands and the incredible investment in protecting and creating wetlands on the landscape in Ontario.

That said, I have several concerns and recommendations with the proposed amendments and therefore offer the following comments for your consideration in amending the Conservation Authorities (CA) Act and any associated documents.
Ontario Wetland Evaluation System Classification Changes
Wetlands play a critical role in a healthy, functional environment. Changing the classification system will mean further wetland loss and may result in serious flooding, putting the safety of communities at risk. Wetlands are a natural, cost-effective strategy for protecting downstream properties from floods, adapting to climate change, and retaining water to lessen drought impacts. By changing the classification system, existing Provincially Significant Wetlands could lose their status and un-evaluated wetlands are unlikely to meet the standard for additional protection. This could lead to wetlands being filled in, resulting in loss of habitat and numerous species, decreased storage area for water resulting in decreased flood storage but increased potential for erosion, and poorer water quality. These losses will have detrimental effects on tourism and recreation industries. Loss of wetlands will also result in the necessity of more stormwater ponds which require more maintenance and monitoring than wetlands. The government must be prudent when considering changes like offsetting, which could negatively affect the ability of wetlands to reduce flooding and confuse roles in wetland management and protection between municipalities and CAs.
I recommend that:
· The province re-engage the multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group and work with the working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and develop better alternatives, prior to proceeding with current proposed amendments.

69037,/comment/69037,"Threat to Wetlands in Ontario. Comment: Wetlands are more important than increased housing or housing availability. One can have a place to live but no drinkable water to use. This is the threat that we are facing when our Provincial Government and its governing bodies propose a threat to our wetlands through changes in governance and legislation and legislative interpretation.
Ontario does not need a lessening of governance with respect to Wetlands, it needs a broader and more protective governance.
As an example, I live near the Nith River and the Grand River in Southwestern Ontario. The water quality on the Grand River is already being seriously compromised by development along its shores. With urbanization creeping westward particularly in the Kitchener - Waterloo/Ayr area, the water quality of the Nith River (which feeds into the Grand River) will soon be under threat as to water quality due to this urban sprawl.
The moraines and wetlands that are currently registered need to be better protected and the areas of wetlands and moraine need to be expanded.
This current government is headed in the wrong direction with respect to protecting our natural environment and if these changes go through, we, the current and future citizens of Ontario will suffer dramatic negative effects in future years from these changes.
I have been a student and observer of changes of our environment in the Province of Ontario for the past 70 years starting with the polluted Bay of Quinte and moving through the development areas within the City of Toronto and now living near the Grand River. I have experienced and witnessed the changes in our living conditions with respect to our natural environment over those years and we are not moving in a positive direction with respect to protecting our natural areas and accordingly our citizens with respect to the current attitude of this Provincial Government and its governance.

Re:  Bill 23 More Homes Built Faster (ERO 019-2927, 019-6141, and 019-6162)

I recommend that:
The province re-engage the multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group and work with the working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and develop better alternatives, prior to proceeding with current proposed amendments.
Potential Loss of CA Lands
Minister of Natural Resources Graydon Smith has told media outlets that conservation authorities are “the second largest landowner after the Crown” and have been asked to “evaluate” their land in order to identify areas for housing development. In most instances, these lands have been acquired for specific purposes; typically, lands are purchased to protect the public from flooding and erosion or the lands are left through estate donations to the Conservation Authority by members of the public who wished their private lands stay natural. The development of these natural spaces will have numerous negative implications on the natural environment and a community’s ability to adapt to climate change. Further, the local tourism and recreation industries that rely on these spaces will feel the effects as will individuals of the public of who could experience negative social, mental & physical health impacts.
I recommend that:
The province focus efforts on building up urban areas instead of urban sprawl outwards;
Municipal Official Plans continue to be followed as written; and
Lands identified as natural hazards be maintained as open space.
Prohibition of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Review Agreements
It is unclear how this proposed change will benefit taxpayers.  Conservation Authorities have demonstrated for decades these services can be delivered efficiently, without lengthening the approval process, and is a cost-savings measure for municipalities who can share the cost of this review amongst all CA member-municipalities, rather than hiring staff at each municipality.  As proposed, the consequence appears to be either an increase in taxes as municipalities hire additional staff, a longer review process resulting from municipalities coordinating with neighboring municipalities, the cost of consultants needed for peer-review and the loss of land use plan review and comments provided on a watershed basis. Although the logistics of how this change will occur are unclear, one thing for certain is that this proposed change will also likely result in loss of jobs: Many staff at Conservation Authorities across the province will no longer be required. While currently unclear, if these reviews are no longer required, further job losses can be anticipated for municipal staff, engineers, and consultants who prepare various reports. Another negative implication of this proposed amendment is that studies, such as Environmental Impact Statements, now required to be completed by qualified consultants, could be overlooked or that staff at the municipal level will not have the expertise or capacity to review and comment on report submissions.  It is important to note that Conservation Authorities support smart development.
I recommend that:
Municipalities should retain the option to enter into MOUs with CAs, with clearly defined terms, timelines and performance measures, as allowed under Section 21.1.1 (1) of the CA Act;
Development should be limited to municipal urban boundaries; and
The Province re-engage the multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group and work with the working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and to develop guidance for commenting where a CA has entered into an agreement or MOU.
Low Risk Development Permit Exemptions
It is currently unclear how the proposed exemption of a permit requirement for low-risk development will benefit the people of Ontario. Details are lacking to determine whether the purpose is to transfer this permit responsibility from CAs to municipalities or whether development considered ‘low-risk’ will be exempt from requiring a permit all together.  As currently proposed, this amendment results in a lack of protection for the people of Ontario and a lack of watershed oversight.  I feel it is important to mention that CAs do not exist to hinder development, rather their role is to protect the people of Ontario and their properties. Therefore CAs ensure development is done in a manner to afford this protection. This proposed amendment has many negative implications for the people of Ontario as it quashes the core function of a CA and fragments the CA role in protecting the people of Ontario from natural hazards.
I recommend that:
This proposed amendment be repealed to keep all hazard-related responsibilities with the CA.
Fee Freezing
The details of the proposed amendments remain unclear at this time. It is important to note that current fees were established according to provincial direction, and were intended to recover costs, so as to decrease municipal levies.  Freezing fees will impose additional costs to municipalities, meaning taxpayers will end up paying these development costs. Another negative implication of this proposed change is created when fee revenues are used to pay wages.  Without a cost recovery system in place, the staff compliment required to perform application reviews becomes unaffordable to CA’s as fee revenues would be used, in part, to pay wages.  This will ultimately slow down the approvals process in these times of increased development.
I recommend that:
This proposed amendment be repealed to allow CAs to charge fees according to their internal cost-based analyses; or
This proposal be further amended to require CAs to demonstrate fees do not exceed the cost to deliver the program and have the ability to freeze fees when cost recovery exceeds 100 percent.
To ensure the most effective implementation of this Bill, I believe it is crucial that the government halts the proposed changes and meet with CAs to clarify and consider more effective alternatives. This consultation is imperative to safeguard the best possible outcomes for the people of Ontario.

I am for more housing, but many municipalities and conservation authorities (see supporting document) have come out and said we have enough land for housing, without having to gut environmentally protected land. These changes will only continue to enhance sprawl until there is no land, leading to more severe flooding, lower biodiversity, and a lack of opportunity for us to enjoy the natural beauty of our land.

69306,/comment/69306,"Comments on Proposed Revisions to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation
I was a member of the committee that created the original Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.  I am not, however, up-to-date on recent information sources and methods.  Nor have I used the system for many years.  My comments should be considered accordingly.
I recognize that the changes include helpful editing and updates.
My concerns are:
Throughout: references to MNR as a source of information, an approval agency, and a user of the results are deleted.  I disagree with this distancing.  Is it because of lack of staff or funding?  I hope at least all evaluation data is collected and stored at MNRF.
Throughout: almost all references to wetland complexes appear to be removed.  Since complexes are common in many areas, e.g., moraines, I disagree with this change and do not understand how those situations will be addressed.
Throughout: I am not clear on how some of the changes will affect the total score and if the threshold for PSW will be altered.  I see that Ontario Nature has raised a concern about far fewer designated PSWs: without seeing the proposed scoring, I cannot comment on specifics but I am alarmed if their concern is correct.  As the climate crisis deepens, wetland ecological functions and values to society will only increase in importance.  I see no reason to reduce the number of PSWs.
p. 4. I disagree with the removal of the caution that the evaluation not being a complete inventory.  I feel it is important distinction.
p. 5. I feel the proposed uses of the Evaluation are much too restricted, appearing to omit all provincial and Conservation Authority planning.  I feel these levels bring valuable insights.  I realize this might be reflecting other recent changes in various planning policies, changes I disagree with.
p. 9 – 13.  There are several deletions that I disagree with or least don’t understand the rationale for their removal.  These deletions are: the checklist of Evaluation file components; the guidance on adding information; and data sources.
p. 15. Good idea to add non-evaluation trained experts as assistants.
p. 15. I disagree with the removal of the “open file” discussion since both new data and wetland changes can occur.
p. 51/52.  If I’m correct in assuming 4.1.2.1 and 4.1.2.2 re reproductive, migratory, feeding and hibernation habitat of endangered or threatened species is being included in 4.1.2.3 and 4.1.2.4, shouldn’t the latter two sections’ scores be increased accordingly?
p. 61.  Section 5 on Documentation of Features not Included in the Evaluation: I appreciate this might be a streamlining change, but I question if it will really save any time if it’s just a matter of noting data the evaluator has run across anyway, especially if the data could prove useful for other applications.
p. 63. I feel that guidance to municipalities about locally significant wetlands (proposed to be deleted) can be useful especially if they are the main planning authority since other changes appear to cut out MNRF and CA input to planning.  And all the more so if Ontario Nature’s warning of the scoring system changing to shift some PSWs to locally significant.  So, unless guidance is offered to the municipalities elsewhere, I oppose the deletion of this guidance.

69329,/comment/69329,"The Ontario Farmland Trust (OFT) recommends that the proposed changes allowing for wetlands within a complex to be re-evaluated individually are removed, and that the term wetland complex is reinstated in the evaluation documents.
It is important that wetland complexes are maintained, and that they are reviewed and assessed as a whole. Wetlands within a specific complex are highly interconnected, hence why the term “wetland complex” was created and implemented in provincial land use planning policy in the first place. If one wetland in a complex is altered, it may affect the hydrology of other wetlands within the complex, and as such evaluating wetlands individually rather than as part of a complex may not provide accurate valuation of the ecosystem. For instance, if a wetland that is part of a previously determined complex is developed, due to allowances permitted by re-evaluation, this may alter the hydrology of the complex which could result in flooding of surrounding areas, such as farmland. Preventing flooding in agricultural areas is key to preventing erosion, and wetland complexes play a key role in this.

69441,/comment/69441,"Concerns:
The changes on Pg 5 indicate that the wetland evaluation is only provided to the municipality, and the conservation authorities or other government agencies will no longer have the ability to examine them. This is like setting into law that police departments cannot share information about similar crimes across districts. The purpose of this seems to be to divide and hide.
The changes on Pg 6. Rather than have a robust system wherein Wetland Evaluators can consult with experts, this change now causes the Wetland Evaluator to be the only step in the evaluation process, and they are now the only experts. Even if they are unsure or have additional questions.
On Pg 9 the removal of the wetland complexes section will mean that wetlands that are important as a larger complex will now be able to be divided and assessed as smaller parts - providing for the potential to destroy the ecological functioning of the whole system.

69568,/comment/69568,"DON'T TOUCH ONTARIO WETLANDS:  - The proposed changes are not scientifically based.
Loss of wetlands will impact wildlife, climate change, water quality/quantity, tourism and recreation, and will result in the need for more infrastructure through the creation of storm-water ponds which will require more maintenance and monitoring, potentially adding an increase to municipal taxes and negatively affect the ability of the wetlands to offset flooding.

69588,/comment/69588,"Thankyou Ford government for proposing these changes to the way PSW s are scoped as the system is completely broken. CAs have twisted what is a PSW into a land grab and constraint to development. They might not be a PSW but they are designated as one and it’s so costly and time consuming to the landowner. Maybe some CAs are easy to work with but Halton is dishonest through and through. Even though they proposed this summer draft maps they have been practicing these restrictions since 2018 using bogus maps. A family could not get the approval for his pizza shop in 2018 because CH dragged their heels for approval. It was a little pizza shop in the past but CH without any notice to anyone increased buffers and snuck in the maps. So now why in 2022 are they presenting them to the public when they have been using these bogus buffers since 2018. Ford you have to get rid of these dishonest CAs. Please

69617,/comment/69617,"I am deeply concerned and opposed to Bill 23. The proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System are short sighted and irresponsible. As the climate crisis worsens we need to create stronger protections for Ontario wetlands rather than eroding them. As close to three-quarters of Southern Ontario's wetlands have already been replaced by agriculture and urban encroachment we need to work harder to protect the swamps and bogs that remain. Wetlands are important natural tools that capture carbon and combat climate change.(1) All we have to do is protect them.
It is true that we have a housing crisis in Ontario but new housing needs to be built where existing infrastructure exists, increasing density and protecting against sprawl. Bill 23 would commit Ontario to decades more low-density sprawl, which is ultimately less affordable, more ecologically damaging, and less economically viable. Once you build on precious carbon-capturing wetlands and valuable farmland, you can't go back. The Greenbelt was made to ensure that these lands would be protected from development. It is incredibly upsetting that Bill 23 now seeks to destroy them.

69728,/comment/69728,"The proposed updates indicate the removal of the Ministry of Natural Resources as a resource and final determiner of wetland significance across Ontario.
The updates look to replace the MNR’s role with vague terms such as “decision maker” and “ministry”, which leaves the position for who has the final determination of their significance up to interpretation by the reader. We find these concerning because it indicates that wetland significance will be a planning decision, made by individuals with little education on wetland significance and ecosystem function. It also opens the evaluation process to for profit consulting firms who would be evaluating wetlands, while simultaneously creating the development plans. This is extremely dangerous will lead to the erasure of wetlands from our environment.
The proposed updates implies that the only purpose for evaluating wetlands is to inform the municipality for city and county planning purposes.
Wetlands need to be evaluated for understanding ecosystem integrity, function, and conservation management, in addition to flood mapping, forecasting, and prevention. Greater weight is given to the evaluator’s judgement, and scientific rigour has been removed from the system. Wetlands are known to be some of the most complex and important ecosystems for the environment. They act as water filters and sponges and are integral to the health of all aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in Ontario, which in turn means that they are integral to the health and wellbeing of all Ontario citizens.
The removal of wetland complexes means that many wetlands that fall into this category will no longer be recognized as Significant or even as Wetlands.
Wetlands are irreplaceable and irreplicable. Only 5% of wetlands remain from what existed pre-contact. The current systems we have in place to safeguard and protect these natural wetlands exist because of the short-sighted decision making of early settlers, and politicians alike. These wetlands, deemed significant or not need to be protected, conserved, and their place in our society needs to be maintained indefinitely for generations to come.
Proposed changes are reducing the relevance of rare and endangered species and hydrologic functions of wetlands, which are a key component of any wetland’s value, regardless of the status as Significant or not.
Changing the definition of what is classified as a wetland, and what is classified as a significant wetland will not change the role that they play in our lives, and will not change the fact that without them, thousands of homes will be flooded during large rain events, and eutrophic algae blooms will decimate lakes, their aquatic communities, and our sources of drinking water. Any proposed changes should only be made through intensive, evidence based, research and consultation with the Country's top scientists in wetland ecology, species at risk recovery, and habitat conservation.
The removal of re-evaluation based on species status change will undermine the Ontario Species at Risk Act, as will removing breeding evidence of Species at Risk and element occurrences of Species at Risk.
Wetlands are dynamic, they be and flow, they shrink and grow. With these changes comes the potential for Species at Risk to return to wetlands for habitat. A wetland which was not habitat to Species at Risk plants, animals, insects, birds, etc… could become habitat for them over time through natural succession, and through restoration efforts. These wetlands must be open for re-evaluation in order to protect the most vulnerable species in our province. We are in a global species extinction crisis, and the removal of re-evaluation will only intensify it.
Wetland evaluations can no longer be used as a tool for the MNR to manage and conserve fish and wildlife based on the information collected through the evaluation process.
This will dramatically affect the conservation of important game hunting and fishing species such as moose, deer, and popular fish species like Walleye, Lake Trout, Ling, Salmon, Rainbow Trout, and many others. All of which the province of Ontario receives large revenues from every year.
The document changes appear hurried, with much vagueness and no clear replacements for items that have been removed, particularly the MNR as resource.
There is also sloppiness, switching from imperial to metric, which further gives the impression of haste and carelessness in making the changes. Which further illustrates the governments true intentions of short-sighted interest in development, with little regard for long-term sustainability of the planet.

69902,/comment/69902,"Please revisit the regressive changes proposed to the OWES. Ideally, keep the OWES as it is - the system is not broken, don't fix it. Below are my specific comments.
1.	Retain the section of the OWES Manuals titled “Wetland Complexes” as well as all references to wetland complexes / complexing.
2.	Amend the proposed “Re-evaluation of previously evaluated wetland complexes” subsection to state that re-evaluation of wetland complexes may only occur through a complete re-evaluation of all units in the existing wetland complex, and that the status of a wetland complex (e.g., significant or not) may only change based on a re-evaluation of the complete wetland complex (i.e., all units that were previously evaluated as part of the wetland complex must be re-evaluated at the same time).
3.	If the proposed section titled “Wetland Re-evaluations and Mapping Updates” remains in updated OWES manuals, amend the section to ensure that previous wetland evaluations must be considered when undertaking re-evaluations to clearly identify and document where changes have occurred which result in a different cumulative score.
4.	Retain section 4.1.2.1 (Reproduction Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species) and section 4.1.2.2 (Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species) in the OWES manuals to signal the high importance of these attributes when evaluating or re-evaluating wetlands. Retain the current evaluation scores for these attributes.
5.	Amend the OWES Manual to state that a “wetland evaluation, re-evaluation or mapping update will be considered “complete” once it has been received by a decision maker addressing a land use planning and development or resource management matter, and has been submitted to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry District or Area office in which the wetland is located”.
6.	Clarify who a “decision maker addressing a land use planning and development or resource management matter” may be to assist external agencies such as conservation authorities and private landowners with navigating the process of obtaining completed wetland evaluations.
7.	Retain the section of Appendix 1 which speaks to “locally significant wetlands” to provide transparency of process for wetland designation and protection for wetlands which do not meet the criteria for a “provincially significant” designation.

69915,/comment/69915,"I take issue with many of the proposed changes to the omnibus bill, Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022 as they relate to the protection of natural heritage resources for current and future generations.  These efforts will turn back efforts made over many decades to ensure we preserve the lands needed to support healthy and sustainable communities.  Everyone DOES deserve a place to live but not at the cost of the environment which sustains us.  Not all lands are suitable for development and taking away the powers of communities to set aside and maintain natural heritage systems and determine sustainable housing solutions will cause serious impacts down the road.
I believe the proposed changes to OWES limit oversight and regulation designed to protect our natural heritage, intended to mitigate the negative effects to wildlife populations and water resources - including flooding. We live in a time where impacts of climate change have never been more apparent (Toronto, Calgary, and the lower mainland in BC have all experienced significant damages related to flooding and extreme weather events). These were historic events never seen before which many experts attributed to the effects of climate change.  Where in this legislation are the proposed changes to the consequences of such damage in the future?
Wetlands are unique in their capacity to store carbon compared to other land cover types. Like other natural features, wetlands store carbon in vegetation, in soils below ground, and in decaying biomass. However, the anoxic conditions present within wetlands slow the decomposition of organic material, thus resulting in longer term carbon storage compared to other cover types. Wetlands provide habitat for a wide diversity of species including aquatic invertebrates, fish, migratory and resident birds, fish, frogs, and turtles.
As part of Bill 23 and proposed the updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, the interconnectedness of watersheds, wetlands, and natural areas would be ignored.  This means that wetlands would no longer be assessed as “complexes” and therefore no longer protected in their entirety. Developers would avoid the requirement to compensate for impacts because the wetlands would be downgraded due to changing definitions and reduced protections.
The creation of integrated natural heritage systems (to includes wetlands, woodlands, and meadow habitats) is a priority in developed countries around the world as we now recognize globally the threat that the alternative represents for our planet. Ontario and Canada are rich in natural resources but when we build cities and pave over broad geographic areas we will indeed pay the consequences of that.
Ontarians very much value the natural environment (just look how difficult it is to reserve a spot at a provincial campground).  Our government should be a leader in the protection of our natural areas, especially in southern Ontario where they are in very short supply. We expect our elected representatives to be forward thinking to ensure we are building sustainable communities that can withstand the test of time, including a changing climate.
Significant changes are being lumped together under one bill which limits the ability for public consultation and ultimately harms our democracy.  We have a vested interest to protect our natural heritage as much as reasonably possible not only for our immediate concern, but also for future generations.
I hope this government will reflect upon these comments, and those being put forth by others, and make changes to this legislation so that environmental considerations are not weakened under the guise of affordable housing.  Making housing affordable should be a priority, absolutely, but not at the expense of our natural environment.

It is reckless to state that the reason for this proposal is due to the housing crisis when there are an abundance of homes that are sitting empty due to foreign investment or housing that is incredibly expensive and out of reach for the average Ontarian.
Your proposal displaces a lot of animals and disrupts the vital ecosystem, which is already endangered from the current urban sprawl. They have no voices in this proposal, so many of us not supporting this speak for them.

69941,/comment/69941,"As a certified wetland evaluator, I agree that the manual and evaluation methods need to be revised. The manuals are out of date and there is some ambiguity when it comes to evaluation criteria. What I don't agree with is how these proposed updates and Bill 23 plan to go ahead with it.
Removal of Species at risk from consideration: We are all well aware that much of Southern Ontario is full of degraded and fragmented habitat. Wetlands are more than just the plants on the ground and the water that they protect. These fragmented PSW's are some of the last natural areas and refuges in cities. By removing the inclusion of species at risk from wetland protections we are missing a big piece of the picture. I could easily name 20-30 wetlands that will lose their PSW designation because they are too small and are solely protected due to species at risk being present. These are places that have been fragmented by roads and subdivisions and otherwise poor municipal planning decisions. This is the habitat of Jefferson Salamanders, Blanding's turtles, Musk turtles, and Spotted turtles. Without the species at risk inclusion, these wetlands would not meet the criteria for provincial significance and would lose their protections.
Third Party Review: If the MNRF is no longer reviewing these submissions, then who will be? Removing the MNRF reviews and the Conservation Authority reviews will result in big discrepancies across municipalities on what is considered 'a good report'. Although some municipalities have a team of environmental planners on staff, many do not (such as the City of Brantford). Development planners are not equipped with the tools nor the knowledge to assess wetland evaluations reports. There should be a competent and qualified third party that is reviewing these submissions. Developers and their consultants are known for pushing the envelope, omitting information, and submitting poor reports to support of their proposals. I have personally seen this happen and this problem has only grown exponentially over the past few years.
Wetland Scoring: If criteria for wetland evaluations is being removed or modified, then we should also be adjusting the scores accordingly. A wetland that is 2 hectares in size is only practical in low development regions. In Southern Ontario, this could easily be decreased to half a hectare in size.
Wetland Complexes: This part is unclear and needs to be re-written. I can see how this could be interpreted in both ways. Either 'wetland complexes' are now considered a single wetland or that they are now considered several different wetlands. Clearer guidelines on how fragmentation plays into these decisions should be included. A road that passes through a wetland which creates a berm would have a different effect than one that has culverts/bridges or watercourses that connect nearby wetlands.
Lastly, the current OWES manuals do not effectively address wetlands being turned into farmland. Developers have realized that the easiest way to get their subdivision project built is to have their wetlands removed via farming practices first. As there are not currently any laws or regulations that protect wetlands from farming (i.e. planting crops, or installing tile drains), wetlands are removed, farmed for a few years, and then re-assessed. Once the vegetation has been removed, the areas is no longer considered a wetland (as per OWES) and they are free to develop the lands. If we are updating the manuals and evaluation criteria, there should be new methods for addressing wetland degradation and removals.

Wetlands across the province provide many eco-system services,  including flood control, endangered species wildlife and plant habitats, recreational locations, among many others.    Wetlands conservation and protections can not be eroded by the need to build more homes.
Consultation with the people of Ontario and due process on these proposed changes and their impacts are essential for healthy democratic process, as well as careful legal attention to the Ontario government's duties to consult Indigenous peoples in whose territories many of these wetlands are located.

Not only is changing our standards to encourage development a blatant disregard for our environment and the indigenous peoples who have protected it for millennia before the settlers’ arrival, but also for our future economy. It is well-known that wetlands are crucial for flood mitigation. Artificial solutions are not as efficient and have a limited capacity to support biodiversity in comparison to natural wetlands. Biodiversity loss poses significant threats to food production industries. Costs associated with increased flooding (increased insurance costs and costs associated with flood-related damage) may outweigh any economic benefits afforded by the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.

It is also a bad business decision - for example in the massive rains a few years ago there was tremendous water damage and flooding at Monterra Road and Grey Road 21 that closed roads.
We are not prepared to deal with waterflows and flooding as it is - destroying the Sliver Creek wetland would just make it worse in the Nottawasaga Conservation Area.
We need to protect our environment and that includes our wetlands to keep nature in balance .
Instead we need to be considering higher density housing in areas that do not result in the destruction of wetlands and greenbelts.  We need housing and density to focus our public transit systems, and social services - taking acres of wetlands for housing is not the right answer.
We have seen across Canada the impact of flooding that is only going to get worse.

70025,/comment/70025,"I am not in support of this bill. While I understand the importance of providing more homes, the cost at which these homes are being built does not justify it.
There will be a long-term backlash if we continue to build in our natural spaces. Especially in ones like wetlands that provide multiple ecological functions that are not only integral to plant and animal communities but also to our own.
This bill will lead to more flooding events, more species loss, continued diversity decreases, increased contamination in waterways and soils, and increased waste disposal in natural areas.
Do not allow this bill to pass.

Much of the flooding and landslides would have either not occurred or would have been mitigated were it not for the incredibly foolhardy and destructive government decisions of the past, denuding wetlands and mountain slopes of their forests.

70165,/comment/70165,"For the most part, I have been satisfied with the job the Conservative Party has done for our province, and the way it had navigated the Pandemic when it first arrived in our province. The one area of concern I continue to have is with the lack of public consultation when it comes to the environment, going ahead on building projects ‎over sensitive wetlands, and not considering input from those with valid concerns over long-term effects. Once these areas are developed, there is no going back, and it pays not to rush, nor to be short-sighted. And though I am in favour of development and good business, in these times, it must be done very responsibly.
I think back to the Liberal Party, who won an election and then sold off part of the province's electrical power holdings without disclosure during their run for office, and no public consultation with the taxpayers who owned that public holding through taxes paid. The Liberals were the temporary holders of an office, and they sold our public holdings permanently to pay down debt they'd wracked up. This was tantamount to renters selling the house they don't own.
In this time of increasingly unpredictable weather, and undeniable climate change, I feel  that sensitive wetlands and ecosystems have to be carefully considered and extremely well managed before any further damage is incurred due to lack of forethought in development. Without this, we will experience future pandemic issues as wildlife and humans come into closer contact because, once again, we deny nature the space needed to take care of the environment for all. Wetland areas are also needed to filter and clean our drinking water.
There are less sensitive areas to build homes for immigrants, and not everyone needs to be located in the GTA. This is an opportunity to de-centralize if other considerations are looked for.

70166,/comment/70166,"I do not support the proposed changes, as it would result is less wetlands being protected. While changes are needed, they must focus on increasing wetland protection and science based.
No meaningful consultation has been undertaken with environmental experts, conservation authorities, Indigenous communities, municipalities or the public. A comprehensive consultation process with working groups needs to be established to determine how to improve wetland protection.
Wetlands have been lost at an alarming rate. Given the benefits to protecting drinking water, wildlife, climate change and flood mitigation it is imperative that all wetlands be protected regardless of significance. Many communities including residents in the Region of Waterloo and Indigenous communities rely on groundwater and the Grand River for drinking water. Developing wetlands will have a negative impact on water quality and quantity, and increase flooding particularly in urban areas.
Outside of settlement areas, the Growth Plan protects all wetlands regardless of significance and requires a 30 metre buffer. This minimum standard should be required in all areas, inside and outside of settlement areas. Settlements areas that become concrete jungles and urban heat zones, are most prone to climate change impacts.
While natural areas have been lost at an alarming rate it is due to weak policies and enforcement of those that illegally destroy wetlands. Conservation Authorities need more staff, funding and support to prosecute those that develop wetlands.
The process of protecting wetlands could be steamlined. For example, if all wetlands are required to be protected, consultants would not need to evaluate a wetland for significance and MNRF would not need to approve evaluations.
The proposed change is a step backwards from Provincial plans that protected more wetlands. The Province needs to take a step forward.
The Growth Plan created policies that focused on revitalizing urban areas and redeveloping greyfield areas. As a result, Downtown Cores that were previously vacant, became the hub of the communities. Intensification through condos and mixed use has occurred. This trend needs to continue.
In Cambridge there are many developed properties that are vacant, have been up for lease for over 10 years. Redevelop these properties instead of the precious development. Perhaps there needs to be more flexibility in converting employment/commercial uses to residential and/or mixed use.
Setting clear policies on where development is permitted or not permitted would significantly improve the process. The test of no negative impacts for natural areas and adjacent lands, result in the need for expensive environmental studies by developers and municpalities and conservation authorities having staff to review. They are often the focus at OLT hearings.
Having stronger policies like the Oak Ridges Moraine Plan inside and outside of settlement areas is what is needed. The Province should map a Natural Heritage System whereby no development and site alteration are permitted in core areas, vegetation protection zones and linkages.
Too much time is wasted on ambiguous policies.
Please do what is right and focus on policies and evaluation systems that are crystal clear, protect the environment, and focus development in areas already developed.

The Silver Creek Wetland, deemed a provincially significant wetland, is located in Collingwood, ON in the Nottawasaga Watershed.  Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems in the world, comparable to rain forests and coral reefs. An immense variety of species of microbes, plants, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, fish and mammals are part of a wetland ecosystem and provide a critical habitat for threatened and endangered local species such as the Least Bittern and the Spotted Turtle, as well as the provincially rare plant species, Stiff Yellow Flax.  These and a number of other fish, wildlife and vegetation would be wiped out with the abolition of proper wetland protection.   Plus, as we all know, Wetlands store carbon within their plant communities and soil instead of releasing it to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.

70190,/comment/70190,"taking away the review and commenting authority of conservation authorities is a dangerous step backwards to our 1960s/1970s era of planning. The whole point of conservation authorities is to protect the natural environment and urban infrastructure from natural hazards through planning and management of a watershed. If you take away their ability to do this than what is the point of them. Municipalities do not have the technical skill to pick up this slack. Building homes faster should not come at the expense of proper planning and due diligence. Many areas of the province already have flooding issues that will get even worse with climate change. We need stricter rules regarding construction around floodplains, wetlands, and other natural features to avoid the mistakes of the past and the millions of dollars of damage they cause every year. Wetlands deserve protection as they have huge benefits to cities and the environment through flood mitigation, carbon sequestration, erosion control, climate regulation, not to mention the positive benefit to wildlife. Developers should be required to plan construction with our shared future in mind. We need development, but it must be done in a way that protects the natural environment and its function, as well as protecting said developments from future climate catastrophes and damages. The provincial government promised to protect greenbelt lands and to not remove any part of it. Removing sections at will because  youd like to build there is ridiculous. You cant just take a piece away and add it somewhere else, that defeats the point of having it protected in the first place. agriculture and natural lands are critically important to ontario and must be left intact. This bill is ripe with issues, too numerous to count. it requires heavy revision and increased public and private sector consultation.

70199,/comment/70199,"I do not agree with the proposed changes to the OWES system. As a wetland evaluator practitioner I do not believe the proposed changes will have a negative impact on the province.
Given the current state of wetland throughout the province particularly southern Ontario, many of our wetland system are heavily fragmented and subject to development pressures prior to the proposed changes to OWES. Based on the proposed changes, many of the wetland in southern Ontario will lose the current protections.  The proposed approach fails to take into account that a landscape context is needed when evaluating a wetland. It is critical to evaluate a wetland in terms of its proximity to other features as many wildlife species including species at risk rely on a multitude of different upland and wetland habitats throughout the year. Many smaller wetland features are critical to provide habitat and refuge for these species as the move through the landscape. The value of many wetland come from the fact that size and composition varies within individual wetland units  and it is this diversity in size and community composition and allows
Based on the proposed changes it is apparent that many wetland will loose their status of significance and will likely be subject to development pressure and degradation without the PSW classification. Wetlands big and small are a critical component of climate change mitigation and flood mitigation. We should not be undervaluing what is left for the sake of short-term gains for a select few individuals. Wetlands are critical when considering carbon sequestration and mitigating many of the effects of climate change including droughts and flooding. It is well documented that wetlands assist in buffering the impacts of flooding and allow watercourse to continue flowing during droughts. We are already seeing the impacts of these events such as the 2018 Brantford floods and they will only worsen in the coming years. With fewer protections to wetlands, the impacts of these events will only worsen.
Municipalities do not have the capacity or experience to undertake wetland evaluation. Many of our municipal staff, particularly those from smaller municipalities, do not have the breadth and depth of knowledge that our conservation authority and ministry staff possess. I fear that the loss of this understanding, breadth of experience, and knowledge will result in errors and misclassifications that will further erode our natural heritage systems. The added task of evaluating wetlands will also come at a cost to municipalities. Many municipalities do not have planning ecologist on staff that have the ability to properly re-evaluate wetlands and will either have to subcontract out work or hire additional staff. These costs will ultimately fall on tax payers. It seems both  fiscally and environmentally irresponsible.

70200,/comment/70200,"Although I appreciate the effort put into removing redundancies in this document, I don't like that the government is proposing to water down and decrease protections to wetlands.
Wetlands are of vital importance. They can take in excess amounts of water and slowly release it during dry times, which is increasingly important as our weather and climate gets weirder and more extreme. I wouldn't want to live in a home built on a potential or former wetland: I would worry about water in my basement and the ground settling as it dries out over time. Wetlands are the habitat type with the greatest amount of biodiversity in Ontario. Some wetlands in Eastern Ontario are habitat for waterfowl populations on a continental scale. What happens to their habitat here will affect bird populations all the way down to Mexico. It's important to ensure that habitat of endangered species is protected in order to not contravene the federal Species at Risk Act and to avoid running into headaches and resistance with organizations that have been vocal in the past about protecting endangered species.
The proposed changes, notably on page 5, appear to reduce Conservation Authority and MNR/MNRF ability to protect wetlands. Decision-making ability is shifted to municipalities who, under the strong mayor legislation, in turn can now be heavily influenced by the mayor. That's too much environmental decision-making power concentrated in the mayor's office, which might not have the expertise to make such decisions that will have a permanent effect on our environment.
""The local MNR office has a detailed understanding of the natural heritage features and functions of the area, has access to current and historic reports, may be aware of relevant information and reports not readily accessible to others, and has connections with other organizations that gather natural heritage information."" I don't understand why the preceding statement was removed. I think we should be putting to good use MNR/MNRF staff's experience and knowledge. Getting the MNR/MNRF to take a ""sober second look"" at an evaluator's work should be a helpful failsafe in case the evaluator missed something, so I don't think the MNR/MNRF should be cut out of the process.
Historic reports are important because of the cyclical nature of this type of habitat. In periods of drier years, a wetland may appear to cover a smaller area than in wetter years. I wouldn't want to have a house in a place that was dry for a few years but then becomes swampy if we hit a few wetter years. ""Wetlands are dynamic natural systems and the outer boundary of a wetland"", or what appears to be its outer boundary, can contract and expand again over time.
I would like to own a house someday, but not on a swamp and not at the cost of destroying part of a wetland.

I cannot fathom how this short term land grab is going to benefit anyone but developers. We already have ample land to build on if we change what we're building. Replacing what these natural resources do (water filtration and rehabilitation, flood abatement, fish habitat and so on) for us will cost future generations billions...if we even make it to the end of the century.

70330,/comment/70330,"Niagara Region appreciates the Province’s commitment to providing more housing across Ontario. Niagara Region has long been committed to this goal as demonstrated through various Regional housing initiatives and our new Niagara Official Plan. There are many opportunities to continue to support and improve on the creation of housing in Niagara and to contribute to the goal of building 1.5 million new homes across the Province. However, Niagara Region is concerned that some of the foundational changes proposed through Bill 23 particularly as they relate to municipal development charges and the Planning Act will result in unintended consequences that will prevent the Province, in collaboration with the municipalities, from achieving the desired housing outcomes.
With a focus on recommendations and potential solutions, the Region’s comments attached relate to the following matters:
-• Financial sustainability and growth-related infrastructure funding;
-• Provision of affordable housing;
-• Supporting growth through integrated land use and infrastructure planning;
-• Coordinated development planning; and
-• Protection of resources.

Bill 23 will damage/destroy green spaces, wetlands and farm lands that are critical to the social, economic and environmental health of our region. The removal of development charges for higher density and affordable housing projects will eliminate the funds municipalities require to build the infrastructure for these homes.

70367,/comment/70367,"The proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System are alarming and underscore the decades of work to evaluate and protect Ontario's wetlands. Of considerable note is the removal of wetland complexing. Often wetlands are interconnected and linked both ecologically and hydrologically. Under the proposed changes, it is unlikely any of Ontario's wetlands would meet the criteria for provincial significance. The proposed changes allowing for wetlands within a complex to be re-evaluated individually should be removed and wetland complexing should be reinstated.
Secondly, wetland evaluations should be reviewed by arm’s-length agencies with an objective view. The proposed legislation is not allowing the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry or conservation authorities to review wetland evaluations. The MNRF as an objective arm's length party should be reinstated.
As it stands, the proposed legislation would be disasterous for the prosperous future of Ontario for all.

Wetlands save the region billions of dollars in wastewater treatment plants, carbon capture technology, and future clean up and infrastructure restoration from flooding damage.
It is outrageous that even with a global pandemic, wildfires, storms, flooding, dangerous air quality, and other climate impacts, there are still despicable people who are solely motivated by a lust for profit who haven’t gotten the message that the climate crisis is an emergency. They are totally OK with compromising our environment and accelerating climate change.
With an increase in the frequency and severity of flooding due to a changing climate, losing wetlands means a higher price tag down the road for disaster-relief. And that bill will be footed by taxpayers.
To put homes there is a grievous error! There are other locations to build homes. The wetlands were designated conservation areas for extremely valid reasons. They play a major role in our very future.

*Wetlands naturally filter water runoff from streets and agriculture, so they are important for good water quality in the region
*Wetlands capture carbon from the atmosphere which helps reduce our net carbon emissions
*Wetlands prevent regional flooding which could cause a great amount of damage
*Wetlands are also home to several native flora and fauna and help protect and restore at-risk species
*The first three benefits alone save the region billions of dollars in wastewater treatment plants, carbon capture technology, and future clean up and infrastructure restoration from flooding damage.
The fourth benefit can never be replaced.

70411,/comment/70411,"Frankly I think this, and many other development related proposals are absurd!  My first question is: every time we lose a smaller portion of wetland that was previously part of a provincially significant wetland, how many houses will this permit?  My guess is maybe a dozen or so.   From a cost / benefit perspective, making a dozen homeowners move a bit farther away from the location of their wetland based proposed home, is an insignificant cost versus the benefit the wetland complex provides to everyone in the wetland's watershed.
From my perspective, this proposal and proposed bill 23 are short sighted while producing long term harm.  The apparent fundamental premise of the bill is simply focused on a grade schooler’s understanding of the concept of supply and demand.  The government’s “pitch” to Ontarians is: “the federal government is planning on admitting vast numbers of immigrants most of whom will settle in the GTHA because this is such a vibrant, job rich area.”  This will significantly increase the demand for additional (new) houses. Therefore, we need drastic, autocratic, government powers to ensure that enough new houses are built to accommodate this population.
The government’s premise for taking this position only looks at the supply side of the demand and supply argument.  What is fails to take into consideration is the demand portion of the equation. The following items are totally overlooked by this bill:
1.	Demographics: The baby boom.  The first members of this cohort are now in their mid 70’s.  Many are either downsizing of even dying.  Either activity will free up the houses they spent the last years of their lives in. What do the government’s projections indicate to be the number of houses these activities will add to the market’s housing supply?
2.	The prices of resale houses are based off the cost of new houses.  As long as developers continue to build sprawl dependent, new single-family houses, the cost of all housing will go up.  I expect there are few if any times over the last 20 years where the price of new housing declined by any appreciable amount.  Hence the price of all housing will continue to increase (once we get through adjusting for the current pricing bubble).  This aggravates, rather than alleviates the affordable housing problem.
3.	Thanks to the Ford government’s trashing of our environment, Ontarians and new Canadians may decide to locate elsewhere in Ontario or other parts of Canada.  There is a growing focus on “quality of life” issues.  This is becoming very prevalent in the North American workforce.  Recently there have been a number of articles in our local press about people who have moved to other Ontario and international communities and how happy they are.
4.	Another major demand factor is Ontario’s pathetic seniors care capabilities and strategies.  Most seniors want to “grow old” in their community and in most cases their homes.  Given Ontario’s pathetic seniors policies and programs, the only practical way they can do this is by employing “self-help” solutions. These include engaging live-in care givers. This will, at least temporally, address some short-term demand issues.
5.	Extended families are also something that will undoubtedly reduce demand.  As the cost of housing continues to increase, grown children will delay leaving their parents’ houses.  As is the case in other countries, we will very likely see these children bringing their spouse to live with them in their (parent’s) house and they will, in turn raise their children in that house.  As a result, we will see a growing number of three generation families living in GTA Homes.  Thus, further reducing demand.
6.	We are also seeing an emergence of college housing practices being utilized in the post college community.  In this situation, college friends who shared accommodations while in school continue that sharing practice in shared housing convenient to their places of employment.
7.	Every bit of our wetlands play a critical role in the proper function of our environment. Wetlands provide the following important benefits to the ecosystem. The housing developments that are being proposed to replace these wetlands provide none of these important benefits:
a.	Canada’s wetlands are home to a wonderful diversity of species. In the spring, wetlands are brimming with waterfowl, blackbirds and shorebirds as they nest and raise their young in the safety of reeds, grasses and stones. Not only are wetlands a sanctuary for migratory and year-round birds, there are also home to a variety of fish species, frogs, turtles, muskrats, minks and beavers that are long-term residents.
b.	Wetlands are the kidneys of the planet. Wetlands have the wonderful ability to remove pollutants from water, thanks to their luscious vegetation. Cattails are able to capture excess phosphorus and nitrogen, thereby preventing harmful algal blooms. Even more amazingly, wetlands are able to get rid of 90% of water-borne pathogens. Wetlands recharge groundwater, which 26% of Canadians rely on for drinking water.
c.	Wetlands are masters at carbon sequestration. This process sucks in carbon and stores it in wetland soil. Peatlands, including fens and bogs, collect ‘peat’ or partially decomposed plants and other organic matter. When peatlands are drained for development, carbon and nitrogen are released as greenhouse gases in the form of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.
d.	Wetlands act like giant sponges. When the clouds open up and rain pours down, wetlands are able to absorb excess water. This means that wetlands act as a buffer against flooding.
While there will likely be more changes to the simplistic level of demand envisaged by the Ford Government, at a minimum, these demand variations need to be thoroughly considered before anything like the legislation now being proposed becomes the law of this province.
The government recently engaged an expert panel to determine how to address York Region’s sewage requirements (demand) and got some excellent advice. The province should do the same for the housing demand / affordable housing problem with special focus on the importance of every bit of wetland we have, no matter how small it may seem.
There are very likely a number of possible legislative enhancements that would promote multiple ownerships or tenancies.  Unfortunately, the current Landlords and Tennant Act is so tenant friendly that virtually none of the baby boomers would consider renting out the now significant amount of empty nester rooms in their houses. Given the impact of inflation and problems with potentially living longer that their resources, the additional income that would be available to these seniors would likely be very welcome.
The problem is, if the tenant doesn’t work out, how do they evict them?  Without a really good answer to that question, by way of government legislation, significant amounts of good livable space will never be made available.
This proposed policy to allow “pay to slay” destruction of currently protected wetlands and woodlands, and changes to the rules that are used to identify wetlands, will cause the majority of these rare and ecologically crucial areas to be lost to development.  We have spent decades to preserve these environmentally crucial features.  Trading these environmental gems away for further housing sprawl would be totally unconscionable!

ERO Number 019-6160
Please accept this submission of AEL Advocacy in response to ERO Number 019-6160 .
A.	About AEL Advocacy
Animal Environmental Legal Advocacy (“AEL Advocacy”) is a public interest law practice and not-for-profit organization based in Ontario. Our lawyers understand the important interconnection between humans, animals, and the environment. We combine our in-depth knowledge of the legal and political landscape with a commitment to supporting individuals and organizations working to protect animals and the environments where they live.
B.	Comments on the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
Ontario’s wetlands play a crucial role in protecting biodiversity and providing habitat for wildlife, including endangered and threatened species, across the province. Unfortunately, we have already lost approximately 70 percent of our original wetlands in Southern Ontario, and many of the remaining ones are under threat from climate change, development, and urban sprawl.
For this reason, AEL Advocacy is strongly opposed to the proposed updates to Ontario’s Wetland Evaluation System (“OWES”), as they will drastically alter the way wetlands are identified, assessed, and ultimately protected in Ontario.
First, the proposed updates remove crucial guidance for wetland evaluators in terms of the procedure to be followed when conducting evaluations. Wetland evaluations are highly complex and, as currently written, the OWES provides detailed guidance for wetland evaluators in terms of the procedure to be followed when conducting them. For example, the OWES includes clear instructions about what kind of information should be maintained in a wetland evaluation file, who should be consulted throughout the process, and the sources of information that can provide valuable insight to the wetland evaluator. The proposed updates to the OWES would remove all of this detail and essentially leave it up the wetland evaluator to determine what process should be followed and what sources of information should be consulted. The OWES provides a framework for designating Provincially Significant Wetlands (“PSWs”), which are afforded a high level of protection under provincial law and policy. AEL Advocacy submits that these changes will substantially degrade the quality of wetland evaluations and may lead to the under-scoring of many wetlands which deserve protection as PSWs.
Second, the proposed updates provide that currently evaluated wetlands can be re-evaluated. AEL Advocacy is deeply worried that this will result in many existing PSWs losing their status and ensure that very few wetlands are designated as PSWs in the future. Two other proposed changes make this even more likely. Specifically, the proposed updates remove consideration of (1) wetland complexing and (2) endangered and threatened species habitat from wetland evaluations. The vast majority of Ontario’s wetlands are wetland complexes, meaning that small wetlands located close to one another are evaluated together as part of a “complex”. Wetland complexes often provide valuable linkages for wildlife in terms of migration corridors or surface/groundwater connections. If these small wetlands are re-evaluated individually, it is likely that many current PSWs would no longer qualify for the important protections offered to PSWs.
Similarly, without consideration of endangered and threatened species habitat, many currently evaluated wetlands would no longer qualify as PSWs. This is deeply troubling, as Ontario’s wetlands are home to many endangered or threatened species, such as piping plover, Karner blue butterfly, and the Blanding's turtle, who use wetlands for resting, feeding, and nesting habitat.
The combined effects of these and other proposed changes to the OWES will result in a significant loss and degradation of Ontario’s most valuable wetlands. As such, AEL Advocacy urges MNRF to withdraw the proposed changes to the OWES and conduct further and more in-depth consultation with members of the public and Indigenous communities.
We welcome the opportunity to discuss the above comments and recommendations.
Sincerely,
Krystal-Anne Roussel
Co-Director & Counsel, AEL Advocacy

70515,/comment/70515,"Dear Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry members,
While I understand there is a huge housing crisis in Ontario at the moment, I feel obligated to write to stress the point that there are better solutions to this problem than expanding into sensitive wetland areas, or other environmental areas of the greenbelt. The importance of these areas to the environment, and to all Ontario's people is irreplaceable. To stress this point I'll leave a link to your own site (below: link #1)
Here you stress the importance of preserving these green spaces, and why it is so important. As well as highlighting your promises to step up the protection of these incredibly impactful parts of our Ontario wilderness. To be frank, building urban spaces close to these green spaces can be enough to harm or destroy them (from leaching of common chemicals such as herbicide or pesticides, road salt, fertilizers for grass); all can have catastrophic impacts on such environments. But to build over them would be even worse. We need these spaces that act as natural filters for our drinking water, we need the space for wildlife to thrive to keep our environment healthy, and we need places for ourselves to go to see and learn about Ontario.
To conclude, I ask you to reconsider this bill and look to alternative methods and solutions to the problem. I will also link this study by the UofT addressing the problem, which suggests simply building more houses will not combat the existing crisis nearly enough to solve it (below: link #2)

70536,/comment/70536,"I am deeply concerned about the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System and its implications on wetland conservation in Ontario. However I am even more afraid that these changes will lead to even a greater loss of wetlands without resulting in significant changes to the supply or  affordability of housing in Ontario.
It is important to mention that the proposed changes to OWES cannot be understood independently of the other changes the Province is proposing, particularly in reducing the role and involvement of MNRF and Conservation Authorities within the planning and regulation of natural heritage.
One of the proposed changes is to eliminate the use of wetland complexes in evaluating wetland significance. This will reduce protection of many wetlands that fall short of the size criteria for wetland evaluation, and will result in deeming them not 'provincially' significant. This may accelerate wetland loss across Ontario since they will no longer be offered protection by the Provincial Policy Statement.
As shown in many reports by credible organizations such as Ducks Unlimited Canada, wetland loss across Southern Ontario has been around the 72% since European settlement. Wetlands have been lost due to conversion to other land uses such as aggregate extraction, draining to facilitate farming and urban development. The loss of wetlands has been happening simultaneously to the development of the housing crisis that we are experiencing today. Therefore, it remains unclear to me how the removal of wetland protection, which will continue to the trend of wetland loss, is going to somehow improve the housing crisis in Ontario.
The other aspect is that smaller wetlands and all wetlands that may be deemed not significant if the proposed changes take place still have many important functions for people and other wildlife. Wetlands have a major function in flood mitigation as they absorb and slow down the flow of water, allowing water to infiltrate into the ground and not over run into our built spaces. Wetlands serve the same function for cities as fire break lots or a firewall does to protect cities, towns and buildings from being decimated during a fire. On the other end of the spectrum, wetlands help to retain water during drought periods. As many communities in Ontario rely on groundwater, places like wetlands are important to ensure our groundwater are recharged so they can continuously provide water to people during drought periods.
And finally, many of the smaller wetlands that we have in Ontario are some of the last refuges to wildlife such as reptiles and amphibians which are all now under the risk of extinction. The loss of species is directly related to the removal and conversion of natural systems to other land uses. The province should re-think its approach to development in a way that seeks to protect and enhance our remaining wetlands, big or small, recognizing them as part of the infrastructure of Ontario. Improving the supply of housing should be re-thought by making use of our large cities to accommodate more growth within.

The Silver Creek Wetland, deemed a provincially significant wetland, is located in Collingwood, ON in the Nottawasaga Watershed and is very important for flood control, water filtering, groundwater recharge and discharge and provides important fish and wildlife habitat.  The Silver Creek Wetland absorbs excess rainwater and snowmelt, slows floodwaters helping to alleviate property damage. In the face of climate change, the Silver Creek Wetland is even more important as we experience more extreme storm events.
In addition, the Wetlands provide a critical habitat for threatened and endangered species such as the Least Bittern and the Spotted Turtle, as well as the provincially rare plant species, Stiff Yellow Flax.  These and a number of other fish, wildlife and vegetation would be wiped out with the abolition of proper wetland evaluation and protection.

70631,/comment/70631,"The proposed changes to the OWES are going to be incredibly damaging to Ontario's natural heritage systems and to built infrastructure into the future.
Completely removing MNRF interaction and oversight destroys the value of this system. Limiting its use to a single 'decision maker' and treating it as a 'point-in-time' will create more work in the end if a place has to be evaluated multiple times by different 'decision makers.' Allowing individuals to use 'professional judgment' rather than having direct MNRF reporting and oversight will create opportunities for serious errors with no recourse. Not recommending contact with other outside agencies and limiting suggestions for who could be contacted to vague statements will make this system even more fractured and useless.
Limiting the scope of the OWES, removing the concept of complexes, and no longer identifying hydrologic function as a way to delineate a wetland will make this evaluation system obsolete and will offer zero protection to important wetland systems. Paving over and developing on top of these systems will inevitably lead to serious infrastructure damage in the future when hydrologic function is so impaired that we experience even more aggressive and flashy flooding. Removing habitat for significant species as an important aspect of the scoring system will also create a huge opportunity for more biodiversity loss. As we destroy these habitats, these species will disappear. We can't just create more space in the future as an 'offset' - they won't be able to move fast enough.
Making it so that one does not have to evaluate wetlands where private landowner permission is not provided is also going to create an opportunity for this 'professional judgment' to ignore significant aspects of wetlands completely.
I have SERIOUS concerns about this proposed legislation. It is designed to ignore environmental concern and shift way too much of the burden onto already over-capacity municipalities. Housing is admittedly important, but urban densification is the answer. Not sprawl. Not enriching private interests at the expense of future taxpayers.

70638,/comment/70638,"Hello,
Please reconsider any  immediate changes to Ontario Conservation areas.
I know there is a need for more housing in Ontario most particularly in Southern Ontario.  There is not enough housing for people already here and more growth via immigration is planned.   Both rents and buying are out of the reach of many people.  Housing costs have outstripped incomes for years.
However development for housing needs to be done in a careful and sustainable way.
All opportunities for in-fill housing should be looked at with particular emphasis on housing near transportation hubs. Expropriation in suburban areas already developed should be considered.  This would require market value compensation.
Housing in rural areas should be carefully considered so that it is not the driver for more cars and more roads.
Conservation areas protect watersheds which does mitigate flood risks to those downsteam.  Conservation areas also provide much needs nature access to many people.  The pandemic has emphasized the need for natural areas near to cities and towns.  Conservation areas provide so much good a a low cost that they cannot be tampered with.

70817,/comment/70817,"The most telling parts of these proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System are the parts that have been left out. A process that once included the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Conservation Authorities and diverse naturalist organizations has been reduced to a single Ontario Wetland Evaluator, the graduate of a four-week training program with recommended but unspecified background knowledge and expertise. The MNRF is no longer required to review and confirm wetland evaluations. If Bill 23 is approved, Conservation Authorities will no longer be allowed to review or comment on development proposals. This leaves municipalities in charge of making decisions on development without access to the diverse and high-quality expertise provided by CAs at a reasonable cost. Smaller municipalities will have to hire staff or consultants to provide the same services, putting an additional burden on taxpayers.
The previous Ontario Wetland Evaluation System recommended that information such as the presence of rare species or hydrological functions of a wetland should be obtained before making decisions about land uses in the vicinity of a wetland. That recommendation has been crossed out of the updated version. The same kind of habitat loss and degradation that affects other species, also effects humans. Wetlands are essential for storing and filtering groundwater, as well as preventing flooding and erosion. Threats to the hydrological functions of wetlands are direct threats to human health and survival. Flooding, drought and erosion are all prevented by healthy wetlands.
If the proposed updates are implemented, single wetland units that are considered to be part of a wetland complex can be re-evaluated, re-scored and re-mapped individually without involving the remaining complex. The potential exists for fragmenting the wetland complex with development approvals and drastically diminishing its effectiveness as a whole ecosystem.
The financial burden of these proposed updates will fall on municipal taxpayers. The shared cost of reasonably priced expertise from Conservation Authorities will no longer be available to municipalities. The cost of an inevitable increase in natural disasters, including property damage, healthcare, insurance, food insecurity will overwhelm communities.  The extensive streamlining of the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System that is proposed will benefit developers and landowners in the short term and wreak havoc with the wider community in the long term.

70819,/comment/70819,"As a certified provincial wetland evaluator I recognize the importance of wetlands and their need for protection. The current OWES protocols due have some clarity issues. Some of the proposed updates, such as clarity around wetland boundary updates and reviews, as well as recognizing the professional opinion of wetland evaluators is a positive step. However, any of the other proposed changes hold cause for concern and do not represent the best interest of protecting provincially significant wetlands in the province.
Removing species at risk habitat scoring from the special features section is a worrisome proposed change. Species at risk habitat is critically important for protection. Many smaller wetlands, especially urban wetlands, would lose there provincially significant status if species at risk scoring was taken away. This is not in the interest of wetland preservation. Simply scoring them under significant other species/rare species will not score the same points, or offer the same protection. I would not suggest this removal
Removing the ability to complex wetlands and the verbiage around them is equally worrisome. Many wetlands, especially ones in southern ontario, have become fragmented due to human activity. What remains on the landscape are smaller wetland pockets that are disjointed, but still operate in tandem across the landscape. Losing the ability to complex wetlands together is not in the best interest of wetland preservation. Many smaller urban wetlands would be broken up and lose status, paving the way for development and loss of these critical features.
Adding the ability of non-certified people to conduct wetland evaluations is a worrisome step. Although the shortage of wetland evaluators is understood, more effort should go into bringing back additional certification courses, rather than simplifying field protocols. Simply having a certified evaluator review work conducted by another individual will lead to the potential for errors and incorrect evaluations. This also leads to the potential for wetland loss due to inexperienced and non-qualified individuals as a certified evaluator may not be able to catch these mistakes if they were not out in the field with them. Wetland evaluators should need to be in the field when any work is being conducted and have been the one to collect the data, although assistance in field is a reasonable permission.

We have already lost far too much of this region's wetlands already, with 90% of the Niagara Region's wetlands already gone. As there is intense pressure from developers to destroy these lands, we must make sure there is strong protection for every wetland in the Niagara Region and all of southern Ontario.
First Nations have a long history of opposing European settlement in their lands precisely because settlers drove away animals through their rapid destruction of habitat and negatively impacted the waterways that have been used by First Nations for fishing, transport, harvesting, and many other uses since time immemorial. Canada's courts have found in many cases that by destroying nature, First Nations are deprived of their rights, since their ability to exercise those rights are made extremely difficult if not impossible. In addition, Canadian courts have found that provincial governments have an obligation to protect First Nations' rights, which includes taking steps to protect nature.
The Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council at Ohswken has made it clear that the area covered by the 1701 Beaver Hunting Grounds Treaty is under Haudenosaunee jurisdiction, and that these grounds include the greenbelt and the golden horseshoe. Likewise, Mississaugas of the Credit considers all the waterways within their territory to belong to them, as well as tracts of land surrounding Bronte Creek, 16 Mile Creek, the Credit River, and the Rouge River.
Developing Haudenosaunee and Mississaugas of the Credit lands without their consent would be seriously unethical.
Ontario municipalities have already more than enough room to build new housing within their urban boundaries. Undermining the already hindered ability to conserve wetlands in southern Ontario is a massive mistake that will hurt us for years to come.

Under the “Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System” (Oct 25, 2022), Conservation Authorities can no longer be used by a municipality to evaluate these lands.  We have many wetlands that have not been evaluated in our headwaters area and we rely on CAs to determine which are “Provincially Significant.”   If CAs can no longer do this work, who will ?.  The municipalities do not have the technical expertise to do the work.  Presumably, we hire consultants (at a much higher cost than having CAs help).  Since wetlands do not respect municipal boundaries, we are going to end up with a confusing bag of evaluations  --  say if one municipality scores something one way and another municipality on the other side of the town line scores it another way.
It is also my understanding that the scoring system for wetlands has been changed with the result that it will be more difficult to reach the “Provincially Significant” status.  Also, the proposed legislative changes will no longer allow wetlands to be grouped together as wetland complexes.
The result of all of these changes will be that more wetlands will be lost to development.    Your own report --  State of Ontario's Natural Resources (SONR) Report 2021 (MNRF 2021) – points out that we lost 7,303 hectares of wetlands in southern Ontario between 2011 and 2015 (pg 35).

70941,/comment/70941,"Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the ‘Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System’ as posted on the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO # 019-6160) related to the omnibus Bill 23 ‘More Homes Built Faster’ Act.
I am deeply concerned about the tremendous changes proposed to the scoring, rules and oversight of wetland evaluation in Ontario. Evaluation is the primary tool affording protection to wetlands under the Provincial Policy Statement and in the planning process. I provide comments here as both a certified wetland evaluator and as someone who teaches wetland evaluation skills at the post-secondary level.
My main points are outlined below with reference to the 64-page supporting documentation posted with ERO # 019-6160 entitled Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System 2022-10-25.
1. Removing Species at Risk Scoring Elements from OWES (p. 51-52 of Proposed Updates)
Wetlands provide habitat for at least 20% of Ontario’s at-risk plants and animals (Kip, 2022). The current scoring system recognizes the major importance of this by providing 250 points to evaluated wetlands hosting threatened or endangered species, safeguarding habitat through protections afforded to Provincially Significant Wetlands. Given the recent undermining of Ontario’s Species at Risk legislation, wetland status designation is a critical means of protecting the habitat of at-risk species such as turtles, mussels, wetland-dependent birds, plants and insects.
Removing the recognition and scoring for wetlands providing reproductive, migratory, feeding or hibernation habitat for threatened and endangered species will result in many fewer wetlands achieving Provincially Significant status. Further, many existing PSWs could lose their designation upon re-evaluation. In a province with less than 30% wetland habitat remaining, this spells disaster for the natural areas that sustain us!
I do not support the removal of scoring elements related to threatened and endangered species and urge the government to rescind the proposed updates. To refer to these changes in the ERO posting as ‘housekeeping’ edits highlights an egregious lack of transparency on the part of the government.
2. Removing Wetland Complexes from OWES (p.7 of Proposed Update)
Removing the wetland complexing rules and allowing complexes to be re-evaluated as separate wetland units will exacerbate wetland loss and degradation in Ontario. Wetlands are functionally and hydrologically linked across the landscape, and we ignore this for the sake of housing development at our peril. The flood control, habitat and clean water benefits of wetlands have consistently been valued as more efficient and effective than human-built solutions. Recent research at the University of Waterloo valued the sediment and phosphorus filtration services of wetlands in Southern Ontario - those at most risk from the proposed changes related to OWES changes - at $4.2 billion (Aziz & Van Cappellen, 2021).
Recognizing and evaluating wetlands as complexes is critical to ensuring that wetlands can continue to function and provide these key ecosystem services.
I strongly recommend re-instating the wetland complexing rules as outlined in the current (2013) Southern Ontario OWES manual.
3. Removing provincial oversight of the evaluation process (p.7 of Proposed Update)
The sober second look that provincial government staff provide to wetland evaluations ought not to be removed from the OWES system. Government staff provide added value to evaluations: they have access to records, in-house aerial imagery expertise, institutional history of past restorations or development pressures, and knowledgeable senior staff. Moreover, a central agency (i.e. MNRF) is required to coordinate evaluations and ensure that information about wetland evaluations is made public.
Wetland evaluators are typically employed at environmental consulting firms. While they are generally impartial, consulting staff may be influenced by clients towards certain outcomes for a wetland, or unduly constrained by time and finances in their wetland evaluation research due to the bidding process inherent in consulting contracts.  Removing provincial government oversight of the evaluation process opens the field to errors, oversights and potential bias.
In summary, I urge the government to revoke the proposed changes as outlined in ERO posting # 019-6160 and maintain the current scoring, rules and oversight of wetland evaluation in Ontario per the Southern Ontario Wetland Evaluation System manual (2013). Wetlands are our best nature-based climate solution, offering carbon storage, flood protection and water quality purification services. I would like my government to focus on the protection of these natural habitats and their species rather than dismantle the protective systems currently in place to safeguard wetlands.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

We do not need to support more low-density sprawl which contributes to increased pollution - build where there is existing infrastructure.

70945,/comment/70945,"I would like to state my firm opposition to the amendments weakening the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. Wetlands are perhaps our most important natural systems, cleaning our water, protecting against flooding, and providing great value socially, recreationally, and economically for performing their functions, yet the proposed changes appear to centre around removing their protections.
Severing a wetland from its surrounding landscape from a regulatory standpoint by eliminating complexing and severely reducing wetland buffers seems to attempt to handicap the finding of evidence for the system's importance. A significant series of wetlands assessed individually will of course not find any wetland that bestows all the benefits of the whole, which opens the former complex to elimination and destruction under the findings of a biased methodology reporting that the wetlands provided little to no benefit at all. This is no more true than saying that because no one doctor can cure all diseases, hospitals should be destroyed for being full of useless doctors. The reduction of wetland buffers also seems designed to understate the importance of wetlands by reducing the amount of land in their watersheds. If they are encroached on to within 30 metres and all previously protected land is developed, then the opportunity to see their benefits are reduced, and they will appear less important.
There is nothing wrong with valuing wetlands properly according to the services they provide. Attempting to obscure their value works against the best interest of the beneficiaries of wetland services, which is everyone in Ontario. We need to keep the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, and do away with the proposed changes.

70989,/comment/70989,"Given the current demographic changes, and the decline in birth rates worldwide, it seems likely that after baby boomers age out of their jobs, they will also age out of their homes, creating more availability of single family housing.  Rather than expanding into valuable farmland and conservation areas, it would make sense in the interim, to build up rather than out.  To build affordable housing for young families close to work and transit, especially as the cost of transportation/commuting is becoming formidable. And to expand and develop services and housing for seniors, which most likely will need to be assistive, communal and high density, and also close to services and transit.  I have an uneasy feeling that Doug Ford’s government is catering to the the needs and interests of developers, rather than the constituents it is supposed to serve.  The rights of municipalities to preserve and enhance the quality of living in their own areas, with which they are familiar, should be protected, as should the right of community members to appeal decisions about development.

71018,/comment/71018,"I am a field botanist who specializes in plant identification, Ecological Land Classification (ELC), and wetland delineations/evaluations. I have been employed in this profession for the past 16 years, all of which has been with two consulting companies. I have completed vegetation and wetland surveys throughout Ontario, as well as parts of Alberta, Quebec, and Michigan. I became certified under the OWES in 2009 and have been actively practicing it ever since. The vast majority of my work is for development proposals in a variety of sectors (urban development, linear infrastructure, oil and gas, etc.).
While I can very much appreciate the need for changes to the OWES, I have significant concerns regarding the proposed approach. I have outlined my concerns below, as well as provided discussion of the changes that I feel are more appropriate. I have attached a Word version of my comments, which may be easier to follow for formatting reasons.
Page 6
•	“Evaluators should rely on their observation, data collection and research and use their professional judgement and expertise in applying the OWES.”
o	Define “expertise”. There appears to be a mindset here that once an individual is certified under OWES they are considered an “expert”. In the existing system there was more room to allow evaluators of varying experience levels to complete an evaluation – this is because all evaluations would have to be reviewed and approved by the authority that wrote the methodology (MNRF). By removing that requirement and assigning it to a municipal “decision maker” raises the need for evaluators to have a certain level of experience prior to completing evaluations on their own. Think of it like an apprenticeship that is typical of trades. Without this, and without review by someone with significant experience as an ecologist with wetland expertise, we can expect to see an extreme variation in the quality and thoroughness of evaluations. This will undermine the importance of the evaluation and approval process.
Page 8
•	“Mapping updates to previously evaluated wetlands… A mapping update can be undertaken without undertaking a re-evaluation”
o	Significant changes to wetland size and boundary delineations can influence the overall evaluation score (e.g., area calculations, interspersion, etc.). It doesn’t make sense to make these changes and not apply them to the original evaluation to see how it affects the score. This is particularly true over time, where if multiple edits are made over years by various evaluators, we gradually lose our ability to retain confidence in the original evaluation.
•	“decision maker”
o	Who exactly will be a ""decision maker""? The wording here is concerningly vague. Will they be OWES certified with a minimum level of applicable wetland-specific experience? Will they be capable of recognizing OWES submissions that have insufficient or inappropriate data collection efforts? It’s easy enough for an inadequately qualified “decision maker” to ‘check boxes’ to ensure each component of the evaluation process is present, but it’s an entirely different story for that ‘decision maker’ to understand wetland functional dynamics, species interaction, appropriate timing windows, soils/hydrology, etc. A ‘decision maker’ can’t comment or ask questions if they don’t know what the questions are.
Page 9
•	“In contrast, planting of crops or tillage tends to destroy wetland values and thus should no longer be considered as wetland.”
o	I can not stress enough how inappropriate and frightening it is to add the word “tillage” here. Many times I have witnessed land owners plough a wetland (marshes and even thicket swamps) ahead of my site visit in an attempt to pass it off as being for agricultural purposes. Luckily the current OWES allows me to assess remaining visible vegetation, and check if soils are hydric to ensure it continues to be mapped as wetland. This won’t be the case anymore if OWES literally says a tilled area cannot be a wetland. With this wording in place, I am confident Ontario will not see a net-gain in wetland creation through offsetting practices. It is unquestionably less expensive for a land owner to just plough through a wetland to make it “disappear”, rather than protect or compensate for its removal. Please remove the term “tillage”.
Page 14
•	The following expectation was removed: “In cases where landowner permission can not be obtained, evaluators should conduct the evaluation using any other information they can gather (e.g., aerial imagery, information from adjacent lands, information that can be observed from roads, etc.)”
o	Let's say you have access to a small portion of an otherwise large, contiguous wetland. You are not granted access to the larger portion, which appears to have a higher probability of containing significant species or features. You score the small portion with the data you have, and it comes out as non-significant. Is that conclusion valid or would there be an expectation to assume significance until appropriate property access could be obtained. Is the surveyor allowed to make assessments for the larger portion using any publicly available data/access to assist with that evaluation? Language needs to be clarified here. I would hope the evaluation would be rejected in this example, until property access could be retained.
Page 15
•	Statement added: “While only a trained wetland evaluator can undertake an evaluation, it is recognized that trained evaluators may make use of other persons who may have specialized skills that can aid an evaluator. This can include having persons not trained in OWES helping an evaluator undertake field visits.”
o	While I can appreciate some aspects of this statement (e.g., allowing a non-OWES certified but qualified ornithologist complete avian surveys), it also opens the door to a wide range of possibilities. One scenario is that someone who is OWES certified on paper but with little applicable experience decides to send out someone who has some entry-level experience identifying plants. It’s very possible the certified evaluator won't fully appreciate the needs of the inventory, while the surveyor could very easily overlook significant species. This adds to a recurring concern here that the quality of the province’s evaluations will be extremely variable and thus less meaningful. At the very minimum, I would suggest adding a requirement that the certified evaluator needs to be specialized in at least one of the four OWES components and must participate in at least 50% of the field hours used for the evaluation.
Page 20
•	Text added in relation to the newly defined ‘very closely grouped wetlands’: “…areas comprised of very closely spaced small wetland ponds/pools (e.g., within 30 metres from each other) interspersed with small pockets of upland forest (e.g., a ‘mosaic wetland’ or a’ slough wetland’).
o	The vague use of ""e.g. 30m"" will become a very debated statement. Avoid this by stating a distance rather than giving an example distance. And ensure the distance is supported by credible research showing that the distance provided makes ecological sense.
•	Text added in relation to the newly defined ‘very closely grouped wetlands’. “… wetlands along a river or lake that are separated by 100 feet or less”
o	Not sure why first bullet and second bullet jump from metric to imperial. Ensure this distance is supported by credible research showing that the distance makes ecological sense.
Page 23
•	“This map should show boundary of the wetland’s catchment and all of its detention areas, including its wetlands and other additional wetlands or water bodies. This map will be used to determine scoring for the Hydrological Component of the wetland evaluation and might be used during future updates of the wetland file.”
o	Did something change to the hydrological scoring component? The province has not shown any changes to the hydrological scoring component, so it’s unclear why the above statement was removed. You can't understand wetland hydrology without understanding and evaluating catchment area size... it would be a blind, 'fingers-crossed' style of evaluation....
Page 26
•	There is always so much debate around wetland size, where the OWES refers to guidelines rather than giving defined sizes - if the province is looking to expedite the process, provide a minimum size threshold for wetland units than can be evaluated (e.g., 0.1 ha if wetland ‘complexing’ is eliminated, or 0.5 ha if complexing is retained). I would suggest the 2ha minimum guideline currently provided in OWES is much too large for wetlands in southern Ontario – this is particularly true if complexes are no longer a thing.
Page 48
•	“The wetland evaluator must document evaluation file must include the EO ID (if scoring for an existing EO) and the observation should be submitted to the NHIC along with information associated with the observation… The NHIC may be able to assist in the confirmation of specimens or high resolution photographs”
o	It is unreasonable for the province to tell the evaluator to submit EO’s to NHIC, but also remove the option for the evaluator to contact NHIC to assist with confirming a potential EO. MNRF/NHIC has expertise that must be made available to evaluators.
Page 50
•	“When an animal species that is endangered, threatened, or provincially, regionally or locally significant, is found outside the wetland in the surrounding upland, but where it also makes sound ecological sense that such an individual or group of animals is dependent on that wetland for an essential part of its life cycle, then a score can be recorded in the appropriate category.”
o	There is no logic here. This says the province is keen to acknowledge and score rare species here, but species with a provincially recognized heightened conservation concern are to be excluded?? How does that make sense when assessing significance of a feature? Instead of removing endangered and threatened species from this component, why not just create a list of the END and THR species that are allowed to be scored here. For example, aerial insectivore birds that feed over multiple habitat types could reasonably be excluded.
•	“Since different animal species have different home range sizes and utilize surrounding uplands in different seasons, an evaluator must use their professional judgement.”
o	Again, just another example of how varied evaluations will be when a junior ecologist who’s had their OWES for 2 weeks attempts to use professional judgement, relative to a 20-year ecologist/evaluator. Without MNRF to review, there will not be consistency.
Page 51
•	4.1.2.1 Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species
o	This is the reproductive habitat of species that the province has designated as the most crucial for protection. Wetland protection for that use doesn’t get much more important than that, and it’s not unreasonable that it automatically triggered significance. I can appreciate that some species might be more appropriately scored here than others. So instead of eliminating this section altogether, just simply provide a list of species that should not be scored under this section. Species to be excluded should be species that are in decline due to pathogens or other pressures that aren’t a result of habitat loss. Black Ash is an example, where an insect is causing its decline and it could therefore arguably be excluded from this section. The reproductive habitat of an END or THR species that depends on wetlands to reproduce is of the utmost importance – this becomes even truer if we are no longer complexing wetlands.
Page 52
•	4.1.2.2 Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species
o	Same response to this as the above comment. Prepare a list of species that should be excluded from this section. Species that are not dependent on wetlands for migration, feeding, or hibernation (i.e., the species is known to use a wide variety of habitat types) could be excluded from this section. Some aerial insectivore birds could fit into that list of exclusionary species.
Page 54
•	4.1.2.5 and 4.1.2.6 Regionally and Locally Significant Species
o	I see that, other than voiding consultation with MNRF, no changes are proposed here. Wording in the current OWES is a bit unclear if the species must be ranked as “rare”, or if a rank of “uncommon” is also suitable to score here. I can think of one MNRF employee who always insisted that “uncommon” species get scored here. I suggest cleaning up the wording so that only “rare” species are scored here, as I think that’s what was originally intended.
Page 56
•	MNR District, Regional or area offices and the Canadian Wildlife Service should be consulted for areas of national, provincial, regional (Ecoregion) and Ecodistrict importance.
o	I do not understand the consistent deletion of all mention of the evaluator consulting with a knowledgable government body to ensure they are applying the best possible data. Even if MNRF is not going to be the deciding authority on OWES evaluations anymore, it makes no sense that an evaluator can’t contact them for information.
Page 61
•	5.0 Documentation of Wetland Features Not Included in the Evaluation
o	Why keep Section 5.0 if all the subsections are being deleted?
Overall
•	Removal of wetland complexing
o	Wetland complexes are the majority of what gets evaluated in southern Ontario. Evaluating wetlands on a unit basis with no consideration to complexing is not how OWES was designed and could lead to misleading results that do not reflect the intent of the evaluation process. The existing evaluation process is based on decades worth of data collection, trial evaluations, and refinements to the process. The province is proposing to remove a core component of OWES and bypass a rigorous trials period to ensure the new approach renders appropriate designations to wetlands.
Although there are some inherent problems with our 'complexing' approach, I do believe it's an important component of OWES and should not be removed. Instead, we must remove some of the subjectivity when determining wetlands that get included in a complex. (1) Define a minimum size for wetland units. For southern Ontario a blanket threshold of 2 ha is too large; I would recommend 0.5 ha. For rare or unique vegetation types that inherently tend to remain small, use a smaller threshold (e.g., 0.1 ha). (2) Refine the OWES application of ""catchment area"" so that only wetlands that occur within the same sub-catchment area can be evaluated as a complex - even if other wetlands exist within 750m. The thought process should be that if you remove one wetland within the complex, how does that affect wetlands upstream and downstream. This prevents wetland complexes from jumping from one sub-catchment into another - a scenario where the wetlands might not have any association from surface water standpoint. That also removes subjectivity; catchment areas are determined through a GIS analysis, the results of which are repeatable. (3) Identify wetland types that can (in theory) be easily replicated, such as certain mineral marsh communities, or even some mineral thicket swamps. Create language that allows those community types to be considered for removal and compensation - even if they meet PSW criteria. A reed-canary grass mineral meadow marsh, for example, is a classic example of a wetland that might not warrant PSW protection if it can be demonstrated that its removal within the sub-catchment and replication are feasible.
•	There will be no file system for storing/accessing evaluations
o	It seems there will be no file system for storing/accessing evaluations under the proposed changes. A filing system that is accessible to evaluators is critically important. If I’m working on a project where an evaluated wetland is nearby, I often need to access that evaluation to understand where it came up short of being significant, or what features triggered significance. I can then also understand when it was last evaluated, when and how much of the feature was accessed, and what refinements have been made over time. This helps me understand if the evaluation is adequate as-is, or if it should be reviewed. Another critical piece to maintaining a file system is to ensure edits to an evaluation are filed with the original evaluation, and that the scoring to the original evaluation is properly adjusted to account for those edits. It also appears the checklist outlining the necessary components of a complete evaluation was removed. Why??
•	I would suggest reconsidering our application of the 50% rule. Too often I see fringe communities being included as wetland because, technically, they have greater than 50% cover of “wetland species”. These are communities that often don't contain any wetland indicator species, but often include wetland tolerant species. “Indicator” and “tolerant” wetland plants are collectively treated as “wetland species” by OWES.  The OWES system too easily causes moist uplands to be mapped as wetland. Soils are supposed to help, but they often don't for these types of wetland-upland transitional vegetation community types.
I suggest revising the OWES plant list to address this. One approach that should be considered is to only include species having a wetness index of -3 (facultative wetland) and -5 (obligate wetland) in the list of “wetland species”. As is, our list currently includes many species that grow in uplands just as often as they grow in wetlands (i.e., those with a wetness index of 0). Given that “wetland species” are relied on to define and delineate wetlands, we are placing an over-reliance on species that can just as likely occur in uplands. Further, we even have some species identified as “wetland species” that are considered facultative upland (+3 wetness index; i.e., more likely to occur in upland habitats than wetlands). If we opt not to take that approach, we at minimum should prepare a list of “wetland species” that are considered unsuitable when applying the 50% rule. OWES already provides a cursory list of example tree species that are not to be relied upon – the province could make that list comprehensive for trees, while also including shrubs (e.g., Common Buckthorn), and herbs (e.g., White Avens).

71051,/comment/71051,"I am very concerned with the proposed changes to OWES, which are reckless, short-sighted, and ill-advised. The proposed changes to wetland evaluation criteria such as elimination of wetland complexing, and reduction in the area around wetlands that is regulated only serve to weaken protection of our valuable wetlands, at a time when we should be increasing their protection.
 
Wetlands provide more value to communities than any new warehouse or residential development. Wetlands absorb and retain water that would otherwise flood communities, and slowly release this water helping maintain stream flows, especially during droughts. They filter pollutants, capture sediment, and reduce erosion which improves water quality. Wetlands are a key component contributing to clean drinking water, they provide areas for recreation, tourism, and fisheries, in addition to providing habitat for wildlife and biodiversity. The value of southern Ontario wetlands is estimated to be over 4 billion dollars per year (https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14442). Any changes that enable the degradation or destruction of this valuable resource is extremely short-sighted and will degrade the future health and sustainability of Ontario's communities.
I am also extremely concerned with removing wetland complexes as part of the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System without any scientific justification. This proposed change fails to account for the fact that small, seemingly isolated wetlands provide critical ecological and/or hydrological functions as part of a broader natural environment system. Recent research (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114723) indicates Ontario continues to lose small wetlands and we need stronger protections for smaller wetlands areas.
The withdrawal of MNRF as the body responsible for wetland mapping and evaluations is also concerning and should be reversed. Wetlands do not follow municipal boundaries. Impacts to upstream wetlands in one municipality has the potential to impact downstream municipalities. The MNRF is best suited to continue its encompassing role in wetland management and planning. At the very least, Conservation Authorities should replace the MNRF role, since they can at least take a watershed approach to wetlands.
Agriculture and development have already destroyed over 70% of southern Ontario's wetlands (Archived - Wetland conservation strategy | ontario.ca). Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force said a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the province’s housing crisis. “Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts.” Given these facts and the multitude of benefits wetlands provide to society, there is no defensible reason to reduce protections for Ontario's wetlands at this time. If anything, most wetlands, regardless of size, should be increasingly protected from development to preserve their value and services to society as a whole.
There is a clear need to roll back these proposed changes to OWES, or at the very least hold proper consultation with stakeholders to plan a sustainable way forward. I firmly believe the current proposed changes will only harm the health and sustainability of Ontario's communities and natural systems in the long term.

71055,/comment/71055,"The following proposal raise many concerns such as:
-The benefit of having a third-party regulate wetlands is that they can assess the features from a landscape level. In the proposed updates to OWES plan, how will a municipality determine which components of a wetland can be removed from a complex without understanding the features located outside of their jurisdiction?
-Who will ensure that wetlands that cross a local municipal boundary are assessed consistently?
-How do we determine the sensitivity of a wetland without considering rare species inhabiting these features?
-Which agency will be responsible to assist an evaluator in interpreting components of the evaluation system in a consistent manner if the MNRF is no longer accessible for this service?
-What checks in balances are in place to ensure that the evaluator is in fact using professional judgment to make decisions, especially if the municipalities don't have the resources to have qualified experts.
-What is the scientific and evidence-based rationale  for removing wetland complexing?
-Why is the direction on locally significant wetlands being removed? This removes municipalities from creating and protecting their natural heritage system.
The Province should investigate the following to assist with streamlining development review when it relates to wetland protection:
-Provide an OWES light protocol: A full evaluation is not always warranted. If a wetland does not have provincial designation, the planning authority’s role is simply to delineate the boundaries of the wetland and determine the appropriate setback based on existing policies. Only in higher level-study planning processes does a wetland evaluation need to be carried out on unevaluated wetlands. Although it’s helpful to understand the OWES process, there should be a training program that is condensed for staff only tasked with delineation of the feature.
-Lack of training availability: The MNRF is the only agency currently offering OWES training. It is expensive and located away from most Southern Ontario practitioners. Has the government considered outsourcing the training to a reputable organization that can offer these provincially recognized protocols closer and more cost effectively in Southern Ontario?

Re: 	Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, ERO number 019-6160
Comments
Land Use Rationale
The proposed changes to the OWES contradict the recent history of land use policy with regards to the preservation of significant natural heritage features, including wetlands. The revisions to the OWES are proposed “to support More Homes Built Faster: Ontario’s Housing Supply Action Plan 2022-23”. It remains unclear how this proposal supports the development of more homes, given that wetlands cover only 6.8% of the land base in southern Ontario (Ducks Unlimited Canada 2010) and have flood risks and unstable soils which are unsuitable for development without expensive soil reclamation and fill works.
The revisions to the protocol appear to have been initiated in response to a need to increase the amount of available land for development to address the housing crisis; however, there appears to be no documentation to support the conversion of wetlands as a viable solution to address the housing crisis. Similarly, there appears to be no demonstration of need for development land so pressing to justify de-regulation and reclamation of wetlands to accommodate required housing.  The NVCA supports science-based revisions to the technical aspects of the OWES; however, the proposed changes do not appear to be supported by a scientific rationale.
Indeed, OWES evaluators have concerns and recommendations related to necessary updates to the OWES protocol, but not to the effect of the proposed changes. It is unclear whether the more recent editors of OWES 3.2, MNR’s Biodiversity Policy Section or the Wetland Evaluation Technical Team provided input to the proposed changes, or whether any peer-review of the proposed changes was undertaken. Information related to the authorship of these proposed changes and the specific problems that were identified to be resolved through this update should have been provided to support the rationale for proposed changes to the OWES.
Scoring
At its base function, the OWES is a biological inventory scoring system based on threshold in multiple categories. In the proposed changes, a number of available points have been removed, but the score thresholds for a wetland to be deemed Provincially Significant are unchanged. This has the effect of removing opportunities for scoring in order to make the total score for Provincial Significance challenging, if not impossible, to attain. The proposed revisions indicate an intent to alter the status of currently protected wetlands by opening existing evaluations for scoring under a new system which is designed to be exceedingly difficult to achieve PSW status. The proposed scoring detail sheets are the foundation of the wetland evaluation and have not been provided for consultation, which is a significant omission in this ERO consultation.
Complexing
The NVCA does not support the broad removal of wetland complexing from the OWES protocol. Removal of the concept of “complexing” wetlands ignores the inherent function of wetlands as habitat loci for plants and wildlife which are connected through natural linkages that serve as stepping stones. In the NVCA watershed, 32 of 33 PSWs are complexes. As a result of the proposed changes to the OWES, 97% of the PSWs within the NVCA watershed could be “re-opened” and may be re-evaluated to non-PSW status based solely on the revised protocol, with no changes to the characteristics of the wetland itself.
Wetland complexes are a key component of evaluation and consistent with the national Canadian Wetland Evaluation System. Most wetlands in Ontario are complexes. There is no scientific basis for removal of the complexing of wetland features, as the literature and current Ontario land use planning policy overwhelmingly supports the protection of natural linkages between wetlands. Maintaining hydrologic connections and upland areas between wetland units is a foundational principal of ecological conservation. To remove the inherent value of these linkages and consider wetland polygons in a piecemeal fashion is not a science-based change that the NVCA can support.
Wetland complexes are of particular importance to the NVCA, as many of the wetlands we protect are complexed. The Silver Creek and Wasaga Beach Provincially Significant Wetlands abutting the shoreline and along connecting channels/tributaries are complexed, and provide recreational and flood attenuation values to tens of thousands of residents and visitors in Collingwood and Wasaga Beach. Should these wetlands lose their status as Provincially Significant through re-evaluation under the revised OWES system, the impacts on the local communities in these settlements would be negative and potentially hazardous.
NVCA staff caution the potential for multiple, cumulative negative impacts such as flooding, local drainage problems and loss of critical wildlife habitat downstream in the NVCA watershed. Communities such as Collingwood and Wasaga Beach would be expected to be most affected by these impacts.
Species at Risk
The revisions to the OWES removes Endangered/Threatened species habitat metrics.  Significant impacts could occur in the NVCA watershed as a result of this change; for example, the eastern hog-nosed snake (Threatened) which uses a mosaic of reproductive, feeding and hibernation habitat associated with parts of the Wasaga Beach PSW complex. If the individual habitat polygons are no longer complexed together and considered Provincially Significant, protection of all of the habitats required to support the life cycle of this species may be compromised.
While the proposed changes acknowledge the presence of Provincially Significant species, there will be a negative impact of removal on scoring associated Reproductive Habitat and Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for SAR. Presence of SAR can currently score up to 400 points for one species; whereas the new metric would require presence of over sixty SAR to score the same amount of points.
The removal of scoring for habitats that support direct life cycle functions of SAR, as opposed to the proposed tally score, will make it near impossible for a wetland to achieve a score of over 200 in the Special Features component. NVCA staff do not support the removal of scoring for Reproductive Habitat and Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for SAR as proposed. Wetlands which provide habitat that directly supports life cycle processes of SAR should be recognized through higher associated scores.
Conflicts
The NVCA identifies a number of conflicts with the proposed changes to the OWES which do not appear to have been considered. The indirect consequences of the proposal which have the effect of reducing protection for wetlands may contravene the Federal Migratory Birds Convention Act (1994) which protects the habitat and nesting grounds for multiple migratory bird species with wetland affinity.
OWES Section 2.8 considering the Aboriginal and Cultural Values of wetland resources should be revised and expanded in the spirit of Truth and Reconciliation. The current evaluation method relies on evaluators reporting traditional ecological uses which is not inclusive to Indigenous communities. The OWES protocol should require direct consultation with Indigenous communities and allow Indigenous Peoples to report and score their own values and cultural uses of specific wetlands. Cultural values associated with County Forests should also be recognized and incorporated into the revised OWES Manual.
Ontario’s Endangered Species Act is written to protect the habitat of Threatened and Endangered species, but in application the Act is permissive with no comprehensive mapping of SAR habitat across the province. PSWs in their current form serve as simple and effective mechanisms to delineate sensitive or important ecological landscapes for wetland SAR across land use planning and regulatory agencies. If the proposed revisions to OWES are passed, there appears to be no mechanism to accurately delineate and protect wetland habitats of SAR.
Conservation Authorities regulate wetlands and the delegation of decision-making powers to municipalities to designate PSWs has the potential to create conflict between municipalities and the Conservation Authorities that serve them. Municipalities do no typically employ staff ecologists CAs are relied upon to provide peer review and expert advise on matters related to wetlands. In the Nottawasaga Valley watershed, municipalities have neither capacity nor expertise in environmental planning and ecology to fulfill their proposed roles.
The revisions to OWES aim to shift decision making power to municipalities, yet it removes latitude for municipalities to “determine that some of these ‘other’ wetlands are significant on a local scale and … decide to protect them.” If municipalities are to be the approval authority for Significant Wetland Features, they should be able to designate any feature they determine to be locally significant.
Data Availability
From the proposed revisions, it appears that provincially, regionally and locally rare species data will have relevance, though there are significant changes to data sources and no access to MNRF data/expertise in the proposed OWES. Data access is critical to many of the OWES components.  NVCA has concerns that species lists may not be comprehensive, timely or consistently available to wetland evaluators. Concerns are also raised that if no MNRF tracking of provincially, regionally and locally rare species data is being completed, there will be no species data to inform the lists that may or may not be available from time to time. Given that MNRF is no longer an available data source, who will determine or approve level of significance?
OWES Evaluators
OWES Evaluators have historically acted as liaison between the applicant or municipality and the MNRF as the approval authority for PSWs, working to ensure wetland evaluations were completed in accordance with the OWES and to a professional standard. Under the proposed OWES, submissions by OWES evaluators retained by development applicants have a direct pecuniary conflict of interest in providing favourable wetland evaluations for their clients.
Removal of the ability for OWES Evaluators to gather information on inaccessible properties via remote sensing and visual observations is impractical and will severely limit wetland evaluators from doing their job. While the NVCA recognizes the rights of property owners to privacy and use of their lands, wetland evaluation must consider the landscape scale and adjacent lands. Review of aerial imagery and roadside observations should be permitted in OWES evaluations. Certain limitations, such as the use of only publicly-available information may be an appropriate compromise to address landowner concerns.
Cost Burden for Municipal Partners
By shifting the OWES approval to the evaluator and the municipality, the proposed changes open the evaluation process to a considerable risk of biased evaluations with the MNRF and Conservation Authorities removed as objective peer reviewers to wetland evaluation submissions. It appears that evaluation of many metrics is determined through review of Significant Wildlife Habitat (SWH) mapping/review of data/criteria associated with SWH Schedules.  None of the NVCA municipalities currently have SWH mapping.  It is unclear whether wetland evaluations would be required to undertake fulsome in-season SWH habitat surveys using appropriate/standard protocols to inform scores, or who is responsible for reviewing and approving SWH. If the decision maker is to be the municipality, it is assumed that they would be responsible for retaining consultants or entering into agreements with the Conservation Authorities to undertake SWH mapping and evaluations in accordance with the Criteria Schedules.
NVCA Recommendations
1.	NVCA requests that the Province provide a clear statement of the planning and regulatory mechanisms which remain to preserve wetland features, as the current ERO postings indicate there are to be few.
2.	The Province should undertake a formal, professional assessment process to determine that there is a need to convert wetlands and other natural heritage features to development lands to address the housing crisis.
3.	Existing PSW Complex designations should not be open to re-evaluation under the proposed OWES protocol. These features could be open for boundary delineation refinements, but their status and protections as Provincially Significant should not be altered.
4.	Wetlands should be permitted to be complexed.
5.	The term “connecting channels” must be clearly defined. “Channel” in this context could include: groundwater, a surface water feature, watercourse, drainage ditch, drainage pipe or storm sewer.
6.	An objective, scientifically-based agency should be appointed to oversee quality control and objective assessment of OWES evaluations if the MNRF is to be removed as the data source and decision-maker.
7.	Training sessions for current OWES-Certified Wetland Evaluators should also be provided to ensure the protocols, once revised, are understood.
8.	Review of aerial imagery and roadside observations should be permitted in OWES evaluations in accordance with current OWES practices.
9.	Municipalities should be empowered to designate Locally-Significant features if they are empowered to designate Provincially-Significant Wetlands and Natural Heritage Features.
10.	Sources for OWES evaluation data on provincially, regionally and locally rare species must be known and accessible. MNRF should remain as a lead agency for, species data as well as fish and wildlife management information. Data held by MNRF should fully available to the public as a data source.
11.	Instead of removing important and scientifically-established metrics of assessment, the Province ought to consider altering the score thresholds for Provincial Significance if the aim of the proposal is to alter what the Province considers Significant.
12.	The Province should provide a fulsome, detailed posting for commenting which includes the entire suite of proposed changes tracked within a copy of the current OWES 3.3 (2014) Manual, including the Wetland Evaluation Data and Scoring Record and showing all proposed retained and edited sections.
13.	The province must identify a mechanism to ensure that the approval authority for OWES evaluations can make un-biased, science-based decisions on the designation of Significant Wetland features.
Closure
When considered as a whole, the proposed changes to Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) indicate a dramatic shift away from protection of wetlands in the Province of Ontario. The NVCA supports science-based revisions to the technical aspects of the OWES; however, the proposed changes do not have a scientific rationale. The revised OWES appears to ensure that no new Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs) are delineated and that the majority of existing PSWs have protections removed through re-evaluation under the current proposed protocol.
The proposed revisions to the OWES will remove the concept of “complexing” wetlands. As a result of the proposed changes to the OWES, 97% of the PSWs within the NVCA watershed could be “re-opened” for development and may be re-evaluated to non-PSW status based solely on the revised protocol.
There will be a significant impact of removal on scoring associated Reproductive Habitat and Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for SAR. The removal of scoring for habitats that support direct life cycle functions of SAR will make it impossible for most wetlands to achieve a score to qualify as a PSW.
The delegation of decision-making powers to municipalities to designate PSWs has the potential to create conflict between municipalities and the Conservation Authorities. In the Nottawasaga Valley watershed, municipalities have neither capacity nor expertise in environmental planning and ecology to fulfill their proposed roles. The costs related to delegating these responsibilities would be a burden for which many smaller municipalities would not have funds allocated.
The changes to OWES would remove oversight by a scientifically-based, objective agency such as the MNRF which will have negative implications for the quality, objectivity and reliability of wetland evaluations completed under the proposed system.
The NVCA would welcome an opportunity to provide further consultation on proposed changes to the OWES to update and streamline to process of wetland evaluations to preform effectively for all users of the system. As frontline regulators of wetlands, Conservation Authorities have the experience and technical expertise to work with the Province to ensure evaluation protocols are effective, timely and reasonable. We would be pleased to liaise with Ministry staff to further discuss our concerns and recommendations.

71217,/comment/71217,"There are two significant changes to this document that I believe are not conducive to effective environmental protection.
First, there is significant loss of oversight or consultation between those doing the evaluation of wetands and those charged with the protection of natural heritage (e.g. MNRF, Conservation Authority etc).  If the evaluators are working for those who are involved in the development of land, who is watching over them?  Who is adding alternative expertise and knowledge to the process?  Loss of this oversight will eliminate an invaluable element of the decision-making process.  Is the current system overly bureaucratic?  Perhaps, but that is not a reason to eliminate a check against the potential loss of our natural heritage features.  It would be more sympathetic of the government to eliminate bureaucracy but retain oversight to the degree that it is balanced.
The second aspect I take umbrage with, is the loss to the protection of ""wetland complexes"".  In fact, it seems more like a total obliteration of this concept from the process.    Again, it is obvious that the current government wants to reduce bureaucracy and allow for more rapid development.  Eliminating this idea, however, is not the way to go about it.  Water resources do not follow political or municipal boundaries, they are interconnected areas that are integral not only to our natural heritage and wildlife habitat, but also serve to protect freshwater - a basic human need.   We need clean, fresh, water to survive, and recognizing that these systems are interconnected allow for their protection.  Wetland complexes are an integral part of Ontario's natural heritage.  Too many of these areas have been lost in southern Ontario over the last 200 years, let's not add this loss with narrow-sighted legislation and policy change.  Let's grow sustainably to protect our natural heritage for future generations.

Apart from all of the environmental reasons, and there are so many,  building in the Greenbelt  just doesn't make sense. We need to conserve this farmland. Ok, land specultors purchased it, but that doesn't mean we change the zoning from Agriculture to something else. We need our food close to market as  food costs are escalating. Ontarios are relying more and more on locally grown food and this will be the case into the future.
Bill 23 is undemocratic and I'm appalled that the PC members at Queen's Park are supporting it. The Premier has single handedly put at risk this government's credibility with the public. All of this announced on a Friday afternoon, with the Unions all stirred up and new Municipal Councils not sworn in yet.
Step back , rethink this one and let's get on with some real solutions to the housing problem ie, intensifying urban living, building up the middle sized housing units in walkable, bikeable communities.

Sometimes wetlands exist as complexes, and may not be obviously connected. Multiple wetlands may exist in areas farther than 750m apart, but they function in unison.
Many larger wetlands may cross municipal boundaries, and the MNRF should evaluate wetlands as a whole or as a complex, but they should never be ignored or split.

71330,/comment/71330,"I am a recent University of Waterloo Master’s graduate who specialized in wetland ecology. I am disappointed to learn about the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. The proposed changes make it harder for a wetland to be scored as provincially significant and it would allow for already designated PSWs to be re-evaluated, thus putting nearly all wetlands on a chopping block.
Reducing wetland protection is not a path we should be going down. Wetlands provide critical services and functions that directly benefit us, such as flood mitigation and water purification, as well as providing habitat for species, including many that are provincially and federally at-risk. When wetlands are not protected and subsequently removed from the landscape, cities may have to invest millions of dollars into projects such as water treatment facility upgrades and flood mitigation infrastructure that will provide the same functions/services that wetlands provide for free.
Wetlands are workhorses and key components in mitigating climate change. We cannot jeopardize them to support unaffordable urban sprawl.

71340,/comment/71340,"Comments on the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) October 25, 2022
Background
The Province has estimated that we have already lost 72% of our wetlands in southern Ontario. For example in the southern GTA we only have about 2% of the landscape left in wetlands. Wetlands are critical to the health of our watersheds. They help to reduce downstream flood events, help to recharge our aquifers, protect groundwater, control erosion and clean our waters of pollutants. Their organic soils and vegetation store vast amounts of carbon and are critical to retain if we want to meet our climate targets. Many of the province's animals and plants, including many species at risk, are dependent on wetlands for all or part of their life cycle. Wetlands and their adjacent woodlands and meadows when protected become new public natural areas for the enjoyment of our citizens. Our existing natural areas are suffering greatly from overcrowding especially since the public has rediscovered them during COVID.
In recognition of the importance of wetlands, provincial wetland scientists developed the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System manual or OWES for short. It was first devised in 1982 and has been updated and expanded over the years as we have gained more knowledge on the ecological functions and value of wetlands. The scores for the four components that make up the manual are added up to see if the wetlands meet the provincial significance threshold. If they are provincially significant they are protected from development. Over the past 40 years thousands of wetland complexes have been evaluated, with most of them provincially significant. It is estimated that the majority of the wetlands in southern Ontario have been evaluated.
As a citizen of the Province I cannot support the changes proposed to the OWES manual. The OWES manual and its scoring system is based on sound ecological principles and on the accumulated scientific knowledge we have acquired on the ecological importance and function of wetlands in maintaining healthy watersheds and Ontario's biodiversity. All the changes being proposed are not supported by science. I recommend keeping the manual in its current form.  I want our existing wetlands protected and efforts made to restore some of the wetlands we have already lost to ensure that we have healthy watersheds and more public natural areas for everyone to enjoy.
The proposed changes to the manual will in essence gut the manual. It will invalidate most of the thousands of evaluations that have been completed over the past 40 years. This is being done without consulting all the wetland experts that worked on this manual over the years. These changes will result in consultants for developers being able to downgrade most of the wetlands that are currently provincially significant so that they become non-provincial and therefore open for development.
This will also impact on all the private landowners that currently get a municipal tax reduction through the Conservation Land Tax Incentive Programme (CLTIP) for having a provincially significant wetland.  With the proposed changes, an adjacent owner or developer can get a consultant to downgrade their wetland status so they become ineligible for the tax reduction. The landowner has no recourse when this happens because the Province will no longer review and approve wetland evaluations.
Specific Comments
Wetland Complexing
The current manual treats and scores a grouping of wetlands or a wetland complex as though it is one wetland. This is because wildlife research shows that numerous species visit many wetlands on the landscape, moving between wetlands and also utilizing the surrounding intervening upland woodlands and meadows. For example turtles such as the endangered Blandings Turtle will move around and utilize many wetlands over the course of a year for feeding and hibernating. Woodland frogs will breed in wetlands but then spend the rest of the year in surrounding woodlands to feed. The current manual says that wetlands within a maximum of 750 metres from each other and in the same watershed can be scored together as part of a wetland complex. This 750 metre distance covers the ability of many animals to make such movements between wetlands. The update to the manual removes all mention of wetland complexes from the manual. Sections of the manual referencing wetland complexes are removed from pages 9, 15, 16, 26, 27, 29, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39 and 40. The only wetland complexing allowed in this proposed update (see page 20) is for small wetlands that are within 30 metres of each other in a woodlot or those within 30 metres of each other along a river or lake. There is no scientific basis to restrict wetland complexing to wetlands that are a maximum of 30 metres apart. This new cutoff of 30 metres will invalidate most of the thousands of existing evaluation wetland complexes that have been done over the past 40 years. The changes to the manual will allow a consultant to take out a single wetland from a complex, evaluate it on its own, and down-grade it to non-provincial status. Most wetlands on their own would not score as provincially significant unless they are very large and diverse wetlands. But because they are part of grouping of wetlands in a complex they do score as provincially significant due to the cumulative values of all the wetlands. In conclusion, it does not make ecological sense to only score one wetland in isolation. In fact, if wetlands are only going to be scored individually it would result in most wetlands not being provincially significant.  The existing wetland complexing rules need to be retained.
Scoring for endangered and threatened species
The proposed update to the manual no longer scores a wetland if it supports an endangered or threatened species (see changes on page 52). The manual currently makes a wetland or wetland complex that supports occupied habitat for a Species at Risk provincially significant and gives a high score for traditional migratory, feeding and hibernation habitat used by these species. This scoring is in recognition of the fact that endangered and threatened species are facing provincial extinction if present trends continue. By scoring them in the manual you are helping to protect their wetland habitat or their traditional wetland feeding, migration or hibernation areas. The existing scoring for endangered and threatened species needs to be retained.
No standardization of wetland evaluations and no public repository for wetlands
Currently wetlands are overseen by wetland experts at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) and in areas that have Conservation Authorities these authorities regulate wetlands. MNRF is responsible for ensuring that all wetland evaluations and wetland boundary delineations meet the standards set out in the OWES manual. The Ministry also keeps a repository of all the approved wetland evaluations that are available to the public free of charge and also keeps up to date a digital database on the Province's wetlands that is freely available on the Ministry's website. The proposed update to the manual eliminates all mention of MNRF and CAs role in wetlands. MNRF wetland experts will no longer review or approve them nor will they continue to be the repository for all evaluations. A consultant for a developer with little field experience can now take the 5-day accreditation wetland course and then evaluate wetlands on their own with no one ensuring they meet basic standards. The Ministry will no longer even get a copy of the evaluation for its public repository of wetland evaluations and will no longer be able to update its provincial wetland database. The public will no longer know what wetlands have been evaluated, what wetlands have been downgraded to non-provincial or what wetlands have had their boundaries changed or been totally eliminated because they have been filled-in and developed. The Province will no longer be able to assess the state of its wetlands (i.e. how many have we lost, how many have been restored). It will thus not be able to issue State of Biodiversity reports as required by the United Nations or know if it is meeting climate change targets in regards to wetland carbon sequestration. The Province needs to continue to review and approve wetland evaluations and boundary delineations and the CAs need to continue to regulate wetlands.

•	Replacing the Provincial Policy Statement, which currently requires natural heritage systems planning, would weaken protections for Ontario’s farmland and natural heritage, including Provincially Significant Wetlands, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
•	The proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System for identifying Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs) would result in very few wetlands being deemed provincially significant in the future. Specifically, species-at-risk and wetland complexes are key criterion in determining provincial significance and should not be removed from the evaluation process.
•	Many if not most existing PSWs could lose that designation because of the proposed changes, and if so, would no longer benefit from the high level of protection that PSW designation currently provides.
•	The proposed offsetting policy to compensate for the loss of wetlands, woodlands and other natural areas as a result of development is untenable. Offsetting involves extremely risky trade-offs, where existing natural areas are sacrificed on the premise that they can be recreated or restored elsewhere. The loss is certain, while timely compensation is anything but guaranteed. In fact, over 30 years of experience with wetland offsetting in the United States, Canada and elsewhere indicates that offsetting is seldom successful in fully compensating for the loss of wetland area, functions and values. The very possibility of offsetting is likely to push the flood gates of destruction wide open, especially since the proposal includes a “pay to slay” natural heritage compensation fund. Developers would be allowed to destroy wetlands, woodlands and other wildlife habitats as long as they pay into the fund.
•	The proposed removal of provincial government oversight of the evaluation process would mean there is no central agency assigned to coordinate or approve evaluations or ensure that information on PSW designations is available to the public.

The Silver Creek Wetland, deemed a provincially significant wetland, in Collingwood, ON in the Nottawasaga Watershed, is very important for flood control, water filtering, groundwater recharge and discharge and provides important fish and wildlife habitat.  The Silver Creek Wetland absorbs excess rainwater and snowmelt, slows floodwaters helping to alleviate property damage. In the face of climate change, the Silver Creek Wetland is even more important as we experience more extreme storm events.
In addition, the Wetlands provide a critical habitat for threatened and endangered species such as the Least Bittern and the Spotted Turtle, as well as the provincially rare plant species, Stiff Yellow Flax.  These and a number of other fish, wildlife and vegetation would be wiped out with the abolition of proper wetland evaluation and protection.

71386,/comment/71386,"The following are chief concerns about the proposed OWES changes.
1. Wetland complexes no longer to be recognized or considered - The OWES is the official procedure to identify PSWs and determine their boundaries, based on a scoring system that takes into account biological, social, hydrological and special features. Identifying wetland complexes has been integral to the evaluation and scoring process, based on the understanding that many wetlands are interconnected with complementary biological, social and/or hydrological functions that contribute to the health and significance of the whole (i.e., the complex). Dividing complexes up into individual units for assessment “would not be an ecologically or functionally sound process.” (OWES – Southern Manual, p. 39) MNRF is proposing to no longer consider wetland complexes as part of the OWES. Yet, wetland complexes have been a major factor in designating wetlands – especially smaller ones – as PSWs. If MNRF proceeds with the proposed changes, very few new PSWs will be designated in the future and many existing PSWs will lose that designation and the protection it affords.
2. Endangered and threatened species no longer to be recognized MNRF is proposing to no longer recognize the presence of endangered or threatened species in the OWES process, a criterion which is a key factor in determining provincial significance. Currently, the presence of endangered or threatened species automatically qualifies the wetland as provincially significant. But with the proposed changes, species at risk will be considered only as “provincially tracked species,” worth far less in the evaluation. This major change would affect the scoring of most wetlands in Ontario, leaving many of
them, and the significant species that rely on them, vulnerable to development.
3. Provincial government oversight and coordination to be removed MNRF is proposing to remove itself from any involvement in Ontario’s wetland evaluation process, despite the deep and valuable expertise of ministry staff who have overseen the process for decades. No central agency is being assigned to coordinate or approve evaluations or to ensure that information about PSW designation is publicly accessible. Consultation with MNRF will no longer be an option. It appears that approval authority will be downloaded to municipalities, many of which have little expertise and would no longer be able to consult with conservation authorities (due to proposed Bill 23 amendments to the Conservation Authorities Act). Instead, the onus would be on the wetland evaluator (working in most cases for the
development proponent) to inform the municipality and landowners in writing about the outcome of the evaluation or re-evaluation. MNRF would 1) be unaware of wetland evaluations and outcomes; 2) no longer ensure wetland evaluations were accessible to the public through Land Information Ontario; and 3) have no authority to intervene on behalf of the public regarding an evaluation of questionable merit.
4. Timing of proposed changes- The proposed changes to the OWES are going forward at the same time as Bill 23 and other proposed law and policy amendments that will negatively impact wetland conservation in Ontario. The broad scope of the proposals and the speed with which they are being pushed forward mean that public’s ability to comprehend and respond is severely compromised.
5. Inaccurate and misleading analysis of the regulatory impact on the ERO - MNRF’s description of the anticipated impacts of the OWES overhaul is misleading and far from comprehensive. It mentions only the impacts on business which the ministry anticipates will be positive or neutral. It says nothing whatsoever about the significant negative environmental, social or economic impacts related to wetland loss that would arise from the changes to the OWES system. It would appear either that MNRF has given no thought to these impacts or that it simply does not care.

71412,/comment/71412,"This act eviscerates the authority  of OWES and would result in wholesale destruction of wetlands and habitats.  The proposal to alter the boundaries would fragment wetlands systems/complexes and thereby move them out of protected status, by making it more difficult for them reach provincially significant wetland status.  A wetland is like the human body: if you remove one part then the remaining parts cannot function properly and the removal will likely result in failure of the whole system.
The habitats of many species would be disrupted and/or destroyed further increasing their vulnerability and  leading to their decline and possible extinction.  This applies to all fauna, whether those living there or those transiting through.  Their ecosystems must be preserved.
The oversight for the evaluation status should rest with a neutral body, not the municipality, so as to ensure a broad and long term view which takes into account wetlands covering more than one municipality.  With the dire predictions of the results of global warming, protection against erosion and flooding must be a primary issue when considering development.
Wetlands and their habitats take generations to become established and once built upon, their destruction is irreversible.  This act will accelerate their destruction and I am totally opposed to the proposals in it.  Other options for more housing exist and should be considered.

➢	The eastern shore is a UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserve recognized as having international significance.
➢	Together, the eastern and northern shores and waters (including the eastern end of the North Channel of Lake Huron, known as the Bay of Islands) contain the largest global freshwater archipelago (~35,000 islands).
➢	This area has the largest biodiversity of amphibians and reptiles in Canada and one of the largest in the world.
➢	In addition, there is a substantive biodiversity of other aquatic biota, land-based fauna, birds, insects and flora.
➢	The islands and shore of this area have a collective shoreline of 10,000 kms, which is longer than the collective shoreline of all the other Great Lakes combined.
➢	In this area 53 of Ontario’s species at risk and endangered species are in fact thriving;
➢	The ~19,000 wetlands in this area and the nearby watershed is more extensive, more biologically significant and more diverse than all of the wetlands in all of the other Great Lakes;
➢	These wetlands, and the extent to which they filter water, are a vital component in maintaining good water quality both in Georgian Bay, Lakes Huron and Michigan and downstream through the Great Lakes system and are recognized as one of the most ecologically important wetlands systems in Canada and internationally; and
➢	Communities around Georgian Bay, including the 12 First Nations,  all share a passionate devotion to protecting the environment.
Our primary concerns are as follows:
Removal of third party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal
GBA opposes the proposal to remove third party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal. Removing third party appeals limits / removes the voice of concerned neighbours and members of the community and their right to uphold planning regulations and comment on development applications. Both municipalities and developers need to be held accountable for compliance with planning and land use regulations and concerned citizens have the right to contribute in helping achieve that.
Changes to the Ontario Land Tribunal procedures
GBA opposes the proposed changes to the Ontario Land Tribunal procedures which are aimed at discouraging municipalities from opposing developers at the OLT by potentially adding significantly to the costs of doing so and imposing challenging time constraints. Our member associations and their members reside in the five coastal municipalities along the north and east coasts of Georgian Bay. These municipalities are low density in nature and are committed to upholding planning regulations that promote the protection of the Georgian Bay environment. These municipalities are small and have limited staff and resources. We are concerned that these changes may harm their ability to properly uphold planning regulations and maintain their local planning principles, which could lead to environmental impacts and impair the natural land and waterscapes, including the Biosphere Reserve.
Changes to site plan controls
In our area every island and lot are unique, almost all consist of one residential unit, and careful location of buildings, septic systems etc. is essential to avoid impacting sensitive habitat. Site plan control is therefore important for municipalities to preserve the integrity of planning regulations, ensure compliance with those regulations and avoid potential negative environmental impacts. GBA is concerned that the changes to site plan controls that would exempt developments of up to 10 residential units from site plan control, and the removal of architectural details and landscape design aesthetics from the scope of site plan control, would remove this essential oversight for our area and lead to negative environmental impacts.
Changes to subdivisions approvals
GBA opposes changes that remove the public meetings requirement from applications for approval of a draft plan of subdivision for the same reasons as set out in our comments above on Removal of third party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal. Public and community participation in planning regulations and decisions is a central tenet of the principles of the Planning Act and ensure that the community’s wishes for the character and future of their community are heard. Public consultations are critical in this respect and should not be abandoned.
Allowance of multiple residential units per lot
GBA opposes permitting of up to three residential units per lot (two in the main building and one in an accessory building) as of right, with no minimum unit sizes. It is not clear whether that proposal only applies to areas with municipal services in place. Limiting the number of residential units (main buildings and accessory buildings) helps prevent over development and undue pressure on low/minimal services that exist in the Georgian Bay area, which is environmentally sensitive, sparsely populated and predominantly consists of unserviced land. We seek confirmation that this provision will only apply to serviced land, as it is completely inappropriate and unworkable on unserviced land.
Changes to the Natural Heritage planning
We believe language on the “net positive impact” that might allow for wetlands, and other natural areas, to be developed is unclear and allows for excessive uncertainty on wetlands protection. This is very concerning because of the Georgian Bay environments' extensive wetland system and other sensitive habitat that provides countless ecosystem benefits to all sentient things - including people.
Removal of Conservation Authorities' powers
GBA is concerned with restricting the powers of Conservation Authorities and limiting them to erosion and flooding control. Conservation Authorities have an important role to play in source water protection and wetlands that should remain as a key priority. Removing their ability to provide comments beyond natural hazards and flooding would under-utilize their expertise and dispose of much needed and necessary oversight that could lead to problems with water quality.
Changes to Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
GBA opposes the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. The Georgian Bay ecosystem has significantly important coastal wetlands that contribute to the biodiversity of the area and provide varying ecosystem services, as summarized above. We are concerned that these changes will diminish the ecological value of wetland systems, in particular:
-	No longer recognizing or considering wetland complexes (hydrological connections)
-	No longer recognizing species at risk in the evaluation process
-	Removing provincial government oversight of the evaluation process
As set out above, Georgian Bay is home to ~19,000 wetlands and 53 species at risk and endangered species and provides extensive ecosystem services, which must be protected, particularly as part of the Biosphere Reserve.
Addresses Southern Ontario (urban centers) not Northern Ontario (rural)
We believe that the provisions of Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, are primarily aimed at urban centres in Southern Ontario, and should therefore be confined to Southern Ontario and not apply in Northern Ontario and/or rural unserviced land areas.
Timeline for public consultation
The timeline for public consultation is short relative to the substance and ramifications of the proposed changes. The Government of Ontario should allow for reasonable periods for comment that allows for effective public comment and consultation. This process is essential to gathering useful input from the public and hearing public concerns. The current process undermines the effectiveness of the process for obtaining the input of the public. Accordingly, strong consideration should be given to extending the public consultation timelines.
We would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment on Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, and taking the time to read and understand our concerns. We would be pleased to discuss our concerns and answer any questions.
Yours sincerely,
Rupert Kindersley
Executive Director

71435,/comment/71435,"The impacts discussed in the ERO posting are notably silent with regards to analysis of the significant negative environmental, social and economic impacts related to wetland loss. The public requests that this analysis be conducted and further justification be provided related to this posting.
Natural heritage offsetting for wetlands is founded on a false assumption that compensation for wetland loss in one location can be adequately offset by creation in another location. These are not equal and do not result in no net loss. The ministry has adopted this type of model in other areas such as species at risk for butternut, which makes sense. This doesn't make sense. The public requests that more emphasis be placed on avoidance and mitigation rather than offsetting regarding wetlands.
Removing the requirement to consider species at risk in the designation of a wetland and protecting it is a mistake. I fear this will only result in further decline of species at risk and undermines the protection for these species. This goes against public interest. If a species at risk is present, no destruction of a wetland should be allowed.
I am extremely hesitant and skeptical about removing provincial oversight to the evaluation of wetlands and increasing the role of local municipalities. These local municipalities may not have the resources or appropriate knowledge to deal with these designations. Do they have the capacity for what you are asking? This really just seems like the government is trying to allow developers to push development into areas that are NOT in the public interest. Wetlands provide a required function in the Ecosystem and urban environment.  I am afraid this will only result in developments that will be headaches in future years. Look at all the basement flooding projects being carried out in the City of Toronto in areas where development wasn't adequately planned. The public requests reconsideration of the capacity of municipalities and other local governments in administering this. Furthermore, it is requested that more development controls be put in place to protect homes and infrastructure in the watershed.
Most people do not want their communities and environment to be a strip mall or sea of houses. They want green spaces that foster a healthy environment. We should be looking to urban planning so make use of these natural environments as selling features within our communities rather than destroying them. I would like to see more holistic and sustainable development regulations.

71468,/comment/71468,"On behalf of the County of Middlesex, I thank you for the opportunity to provide input on the proposed More Homes Built Faster Act and related Provincial changes. This submission relates to the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.
It is acknowledged that the provision of housing is important and that municipalities play a key role in increasing the supply of housing while building complete and sustainable communities. Even a few years ago the question of housing affordability would have been a low priority for our community as this challenge was largely an issue for our large urban neighbour. This is no longer the case as our rural and small urban County has significant housing affordability and attainability challenges that in many respects have outpaced our urban neighbour.
Through the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, we understand that municipalities would be delegated the responsibility to review and approve OWES evaluations and maintain wetland boundaries. It would also appear that the current approach, which is largely science-based, to support the long term protection and conservation of wetlands would be significantly changed including matters related to endangered and threatened species and ecosystem complexing.
Under the current model, the Province is primarily responsible for the approval of OWES evaluations. Should the Province undertake to move this authority, it would be our recommendation that this authority be assumed by the conservation authorities given that the maintenance of wetland information is directly related to their core mandate. This would maintain existing efficiencies and use existing capacity and expertise. It would also support other mandatory conservation authority programs including the regulation of hazard lands, and the preparation of watershed management plans and related programs.

71492,/comment/71492,"The whole pretext of the proposal to update the Ontario wetland evaluation system is to free up land for development to alleviate Ontario’s housing shortage. This is a preposterous assumption since wetlands are unsuitable locations for housing development and as many planning experts have stated there is adequate space elsewhere to accommodate Ontario’s housing needs.
Numerous problematic changes within the proposal include the following:
•	Proposal to remove the presence of endangered or threatened species at risk as being a factor in wetland evaluation: Many of Ontario’s species at risk depend on wetlands for their survival. Removal of this consideration is not justifiable.
•	Proposal to remove the concept of wetland complexes from evaluation of wetlands: An entire wetland complex provides greater benefits than the sum of its individual units.  As the current OWES manual states: “Much of the wildlife in the area of a complex is variously dependent upon the entire complex of wetlands, with each wetland unit contributing to the whole.” Many wetlands currently classified as significant in Ontario are wetland complexes. Removal of the wetland complex concept would make wetland complexes vulnerable to declassification and susceptible to development pressures. The difficulty in evaluating each small unit of a wetland complex on its own would make future classification of significant wetlands much less likely.
•	Elimination of provincial oversight: Removing MNRF staff from oversight of provincial wetland classifications would leave local municipalities with limited expertise to their own devices in evaluating the merits of an assessment made by an evaluator working for a development proponent. Also, future central tracking of wetlands classified as provincially significant would become problematic.
The proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System present an outrageous assault on provincial wetlands. Please withdraw this proposal in its entirety.

71500,/comment/71500,"We are strongly opposed to the MNRF's proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES), as they would undermine the protection of Ontario wetlands that are so valuable to all life in Ontario.  We urge you not to proceed with the proposed changes to the OWES, for the reasons outlined below.
1.  Proposed changes are misguided:  According to the ERO posting, the purpose of the proposed changes is to support the construction of 1.5 million new housing units over the next ten years by streamlining the wetland evaluation process.  The Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force has already pointed out that a shortage of land is not the cause of the housing shortage.  Houses should be built on existing available land.  Most of the solution must come from densification.  There is no need to pave over wetlands:  in fact, wetlands must be preserved because they are vital in addressing the harmful impacts of increasingly frequent and intense rainfalls and in reducing associated flood damages and financial losses.  Wetlands provide very important eco-services that we cannot afford to lose.  Already, in southern Ontario, we have lost 72%  of our wetlands.  We must not lose any more!
2.  Abandoning the recognition of wetland complexes has serious consequences.  Wetland complexes typically are related in functional ways: as a group, they tend to have similar or complimentary biological, social and/or hydrological functions.  Much of the wildlife in the area of the complex is variously dependent upon the presence of the entire complex of wetlands, with each wetland unit contributing to the whole.  Furthermore, complexed wetlands work together to provide significant services to communities.  Whereas a single wetland probably couldn't protect a town against a flood, a complex would make the town more resilient to flooding impacts.
3. The proposal to no longer recognize the presence of endangered or threatened species in the OWES process is unacceptable.  Wetlands provide habitat for 20% of Ontario's species at risk.  These species are valuable to the web of life.  If their homes are removed by development, they will die and a link in the web will be removed.  Without all of the species present, working together, the web becomes weakened and the quality of life for all species, including Humans, is diminished.
4. The quality of wetland evaluations is in jeopardy with the suggested removal of the MNRF and Conservation Authorities from the process.  No central agency is being assigned to coordinate or approve evaluations or to ensure that information about PSW designation is publicly accessible.  The onus would be solely on the wetland evaluator who would share the information with municipalities that do not have the expertise to assess the quality of the information.
5.  As a volunteer organization that is working hard to conserve our valued natural heritage, we are opposed to the many changes that are occurring simultaneously and that all will negatively impact wetlands in Ontario.  The broad scope of the changes and the haste with which they are being pushed forward is limiting our ability to provide comprehensive responses.  A 30 day comment period is unacceptable to us.
In summary, Ontario's wetlands play a critical role in sustaining healthy communities, enhancing climate change resilience and conserving biodiversity.  Now more than ever, we need our wetlands.  We urge you NOT to proceed with the proposed changes to the OWES.

Ontario can build almost all the affordable housing it needs within current urban boundaries by building up, not out. Planners all over the world know how to do this, to create wonderful, walkable, energy-efficient communities that are not car-dependent.
Build “missing middle” medium density housing in urban spaces, integrated with retail, business offices and parks. People can walk or cycle to work, transit, shopping, school and recreational areas, all within about 15 minutes of home.

The proposal amounts to a shockingly blatant pandering to private interests instead of protecting the broad public interests that are met by unbiased wetland protection. The proposed changes would support and encourage development proponents to ""shop"" for a wetland evaluator who will revise existing wetland boundaries or similarly produce a new evaluation or mapping updates that will be biased in favour of development proponents. The proposal would result in no oversight except by those making land use planning and other decisions, who have no expertise in the OWES and wetland-related values.
I am also opposed to the attempt to reduce wetland complexing, and to diminish the need for site assessment where no environmental site assessment has yet been carried out. I also strongly support the continued inclusion of the text that encourages protecting ""locally"" significant wetlands.
Given the increasing societal recognition of the importance of protecting biodiversity, species at risk and their habitats, fish and wildlife habitats, woodlands, minimizing the potential for flooding and erosion, promoting groundwater recharge and other wetland values, the protection of the existing OWES and the roles of the MNRF and CAs are critically important.

The division of wetland complexes into individual sites for evaluation could very likely cause some existing Provincially Significant Wetlands to lose their designation, as well as prevent many new PSW designations from being assigned.
Downloading of responsibility for OWES from the provincial government to individual municipalities is short-sighted, as provincial ministry staff are best suited to make the kind of decisions necessary to protect our wetlands. Municipalities will be further handicapped by the proposed changes to Bill 23 that would prevent them from consulting with Conservation Authorities (possibly the best source of knowledge for individual watersheds).
And finally, no longer recognizing the presence of endangered and threatened species in the OWES process will unfairly skew the assessment process in the favour of developers, leaving vital wetlands (and the species that rely on them) vulnerable to development.

71558,/comment/71558,"Re: Proposed Overhaul of Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, (OWES), ERO # 019-6160
There is currently a good Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) in use in the province for Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs).  The Ontario Government is now proposing policy changes to ensure that very few wetlands would qualify as provincially significant in the future.  This would have a devastating impact on Ontario’s natural heritage which currently has wetlands offering all sorts of important buffers against climate change, flooding, and pollution of streams, and offers many environmental and economical benefits.  Wetlands are extremely complex natural features.  The government’s proposed policy changes are further examples of short-sightedness and especially lack of interest in the future health and biodiversity of the land for future generations of humans and other species.
As a biologist and former co-owner of a 42-hectare conservation property in southwestern Ontario, I have witnessed first-hand how valuable wetlands are in improving biodiversity of flora and fauna, providing habitat for species including species at risk, transforming the landscape from former farmland to an area that now has a much richer natural heritage than before, and which is counteracting some of the affects of climate change.  My husband and I have recently donated this property to a Land Trust to protect it in perpetuity.  Valuable natural heritage needs all the help it can get to protect it against harmful exploitation by developers.  The proposals in Ontario Bill 23 that, if passed, will adversely affect the natural environment, will represent an unconscionable move by the Ontario Government, and a huge blot on the Ontario Government’s record.
Recommendation 1: Remove the proposed changes to the OWES that will see fewer, rather than more, wetlands qualify as PSWs.
Recommendation 2:  Retain existing OWES policies to protect as many wetlands as possible, to act as buffers against environmental impacts related to climate change, and protect species which depend on wetlands and contribute to increased biodiversity.

71559,/comment/71559,"The rhetoric used to justify the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System is disheartening. What does building more affordable housing have to do with protecting our precious freshwater wetlands? Wetlands are crucial to the survival of humans. What good are more housing units when the soil we live on can no longer sustain the biodiversity required to grow crops and have access to clean air and water?
By pretending to prioritize affordably housing over wetlands management, evaluation, and protection, the MNRF acts an agent toward endangering our remaining keystone ecosystems.
I solidly refuse the proposed updates. The proposed changes:
- make it difficult for wetlands that are not protected to achieve that status.
- makes it harder for municipalities, many of which are not equipped to do so, to properly evaluate and maintain their wetlands by removing guidance and contextual explanations from the text.
- encourages evaluators (and non-professionals!) to rely on their judgement, instead of setting down proper, province-wide guidelines to which municipalities can refer.
- have /zero/ recommendations from consultations with Indigenous communities.
- weaken important wetland conservation steps that have been taken in the past and give developers even more teeth to ""act first, apologize later"".
There are a lot more issues with these proposed changes, and I ask that you consult with professionals in environmental conservation and law, and Indigenous communities, before considering changes to this document.

The proposed changes remove wetland complexing, but do not change the value and thresholds that wetlands need in order to be considered significant. This will have devastating effects for the existing wetlands within southern Ontario. Since European Settlement, Ontario has seen a loss of over 80% of wetlands, and with one fallow swoop of poorly thought out changes could decimate Ontario’s existing wetlands.
The proposed changes will also no longer recognize species at risk in the evaluation process, a criterion which is currently a key factor in determining provincial significance; and remove provincial government oversight of the evaluation process, with no central agency assigned to coordinate or approve evaluations or ensure that information about PSW designation is publicly available.
All these proposed changes are occurring when the world is in a global climate crisis; wetlands help to reduce flooding, filter water and provide important provisional services. These changes will create a disaster all in the name of sprawl and increased profits in developer’s pockets. Who will be responsible for the increased flooding that will occur as a result of this legislation?

71574,/comment/71574,"Wetland evaluations are a fundamental cog in the identification and protection of wetlands in southern Ontario. I have been certified to evaluate wetlands as a consultant since 1995, and have delineated hundreds of wetlands in southern Ontario since that time. I am constantly reminded when I visit wetlands how important they are in protecting our natural heritage – small wetlands often support plant and animal species and specific habitats that are not within an adjacent larger wetland. The proposed changes to the wetland evaluation system will likely cause the loss and degradation of a large proportion of the wetlands in southern Ontario. Below is the rationale for this statement.
a)	Page 7: Wetland Re-evaluations and Mapping Updates and page 26: Wetland Complexes: Wetlands should not be evaluated as separate units only. Wetlands in the southern Ontario landscape are highly dependent on each other, hydrologically and ecologically. I do not know of any research that would contradict the interconnectedness of wetlands, unless they are completely isolated by major roads or urban development. The past history of farming eliminated many wetlands and reduced others, but the connections provided by the farming landscape and small watercourses remained and allowed wetland dependent wildlife to include many wetlands in their daily and seasonal activities. Frogs and salamanders cross long distances, breeding in one wetland, and using others as stepping stones to reach forests that provide habitat in summer and winter. Birds sing from one wetland, forage in another, and nest in another. Turtles cross farmlands from one wetland to another in search of resources, especially if a wetland dries up during the course of the year – one research project found that Painted Turtles, our commonest species, crossed unexpectedly long distances to reach what they perceived as suitable wetlands, and that often the wetland they reached was not the closest wetland. Plant species travel along small watercourses between wetlands with specially adapted seeds and vegetative fragments to maintain their populations.
Hydrological (surface water) and hydrogeological (groundwater) connections between wetlands are so critical that without complexing, many wetlands will be deprived of their water source. Urban development has major impacts on groundwater and surface water, and maintenance of unconnected wetlands will be rendered even more difficult by the need to consider wetlands separately.
I recommend that the distance between wetlands in a complex be re-examined with consultation and reference to current research, with particular reference to current research in urbanizing areas, but complexing should not be summarily discarded as the connections within wetlands are so important.
b)	Page 20: Wetlands Bordered on Lakes and Rivers: this special case allows complexing of wetlands up to 30 m. Connections between wetlands in southern Ontario extend far further than the proposed 30 metres. Wetland wildlife commonly travel more than 100 metres between wetlands. The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) manual’s reference to a distance of 750 metres between wetlands of a complex has been in place for forty years, and was based on science and has stood for 40 years of practice. It is not unreasonable, given the distance that wildlife can travel between wetlands. However, I recommend that this distance be re-examined, but in consultation with experts.
c)	Page 26: Wetland Size: The stipulation that a wetland smaller than 2 ha must meet the criteria for Provincially Significant Wetlands to remain significant sets an impossibly high bar. The point scoring system was derived with wetlands larger than this in mind. With this criterion, a large proportion of the wetlands in southern Ontario will be deemed non-significant, with consequent loss of the biodiversity, ecosystem functions and hydraulic functions that these wetlands provide. Many highly sensitive wetlands with multiple ecological functions are currently the mainstay of wetland functions in southern Ontario. I recommend that consultation be conducted to determine stronger criteria for the inclusion of small wetlands in a complex but that this provision remain.
d)	Page 54: Regionally and Locally Significant Species: the proposed removal of references to MNRF documents that list regionally and locally significant species will remove an important source of information. MNRF and Conservation Authority staff are generally the only source of this regional and local knowledge. Very few municipalities have lists of regionally and locally significant species. In all but a handful of cases, municipal staff do not have the expertise to develop such lists. An important component of the value of wetlands, to protect our regional and local biodiversity, will be scrapped. While it is acknowledged that the lists are in some cases dated, most are relevant, and these lists remain the only source of information. The lists should be updated. MNRF expertise is highly valuable, and should not be eliminated.
e)	Throughout Document: Removal of Requirement to Consult with MNRF: MNRF have unparalleled expertise concerning wetlands in southern Ontario. To eliminate MNRF oversight from wetland evaluation will contribute to the cumulative loss of wetlands in southern Ontario that I believe will follow from implementation of Bill 23. The expertise within MNRF should be maintained and enhanced, not ignored.

71585,/comment/71585,"A drastic overhaul of the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, ensuring that very few remaining wetlands would be deemed provincially significant in the future and that many if not most existing Provincially Significant Wetlands would be vulnerable to losing that designation, is NOT acceptable.
No remaining wetlands should be destroyed. We need affordable housing but not at any cost to the environment.  Every city and town has land available in the already paved areas. This land may need remediation etc but developers just want easy new land to build on. If cheap, lowest grade standard housing is built in these areas then pretty soon the owners will have flooded basements, dampness and mold. Is this affordable housing ???
If you let this part of the Act be passed then there will be more severe flooding throughout Ontario.
 I walk areas of a wetland, in the Dundas area. It is an area that provides habitat for many endangered species, one of which is various species of turtles, some of which are endangered. There are many groups that work very hard to assist turtles in Ontario, and understand the importance of maintaining their natural habitat, or else the turtles  and many other unique wetland species will  be wiped  out.
 Does your government not understand about a balanced system, if there are no natural wetlands then there will be no way that a human population is sustainable. Natural wetlands are huge filter systems, sure you can alter them by engineering inventive ideas, but time and again this has failed after a few years. Ontario has very little of its original wetlands left, in this new world of climate emergency no natural wetland can be destroyed. If anything you need to overall the mandate of the OWES manuals.
To add new guidance related to re-evaluation of wetlands and updates to mapping of evaluated wetland boundaries. All present wetlands need to be designated and protected.
To make changes to better recognize the professional opinion of wetland evaluators and the role of local decision makers (e.g. municipalities).
We need natural wetlands, DO NOT pave over, or relocate them. Natural wetlands exist where they are because the natural order has found this to be the best location, often a low point where water naturally drains to, whether on a permanent basis or as an overflow when heavy precipitation occurs.
Please listen to the environmental experts not the large developers whose only interest is profit at any cost.

71595,/comment/71595,"I wish to express my concerns and opposition to the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, for a number of reasons.
I personally live in relatively close proximity to a Coastal Wetland complex that does have protection through the current WES, that does have a very practical and real positive impact in balancing water levels and flooding in our neighbourhood, that does face real housing development pressure (not affordable housing), and that would highly likely lose its protection status and be lost within a short period of time if this proposal moves forward.
However, aside from my personal exposure on a micro-level, my concerns are even more profound in consideration of the broader effects of this proposal.
We all feel more exposed to the direct adverse effects of climate change, with more intense precipitation and flash floods, and it is widely known and accepted that healthy wetlands do have a critical role in flood control, water filtering, and groundwater recharge and discharge. In a situation where we need to invest into stronger protection and preservation of existing wetlands today to avoid much higher catastrophe relief costs in the future, this proposal removes several layers of protection for those wetlands, reducing the barrier to destroy them for development of housing. This happens after the province of Ontario even under its current government has spent billions in previous years to protect and restore wetlands in full recognition of their importance.
The approach taken here seems illogical in that it removes protections for a relatively small but critically important portion of Ontario's land, while there is by no means a shortage of land already zoned and ready for development is does not require protection and can accommodate the overall goal of Bill 23 to build 1.5 million homes. Those homes don't need to be built on wetlands for this plan to become reality.
I am also very concerned that the onus of wetland evaluation is proposed to be transitioned from local conservation authorities equipped with the skill set and existing trained staff to perform those evaluations in an efficient manner for an entire watershed, to municipalities who don't have staff with the expertise needed and who are already widely understaffed to perform their planning function under current legislation. This proposal will result in more backlogged planning processes at municipalities, higher staffing costs to municipalities who need to find and hire staff able to perform evaluations, and ultimately higher property taxes - exacerbated by the many other additional burdens placed on municipalities by proposals for other areas of Bill 23. Conversation authorities are much more effective in evaluating wetlands, both financially as well as in terms of their competency, and should remain in charge.
The scoring criteria for wetlands should remain unchanged, or the threshold for attaining “protected” status lowered to reflect and maintain the rationale that governs the current Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.
Furthermore, wetlands should continue to be evaluated as a wetland complex and not just individual wetlands, as looking only at an individual component might not reflect the actual relevance of a system of adjacent or connected wetlands.
The proposal as it stands today should not move forward. It does not help to achieve the goals of Bill 23, but in the opposite it will put many residents of those 1.5m new homes at risk as they are no longer benefiting from the protections our current wetlands provide to them and all of us.

71596,/comment/71596,"The proposed changes outlined in bill 23 to OWES would be a complete overhaul of the system and would be jeopardizing a considerable portion of wetlands that are considered significant. Many of these wetlands have developed over decades if not centuries (if not millennia) to become what they are today. Removing protections and making it easier to develop over wetlands will not solve the housing crisis. Wetlands are vital, crucially important ecosystems that are not only the most diverse types of ecosystems we have, but are so crucial for flood attenuation, helping to create buffers from storms, and generally helping to protect our infrastructure in the long run.
Making these changes means opening up enormous areas for development. While there seems to be an idea that we can just build over wetlands and easily offset by ""building"" another wetland somewhere else, and that is somehow equivalent or even close to net-zero is completely misguided and entirely incorrect. How can something we build over a couple years compare to ecosystems that have developed over 10s/100s/1000s of years themselves? Research has shown time again that offsetting in this capacity never really works.
As someone who just completed the OWES course earlier this year, I learned about how we come to classify wetlands as provincially significant. It takes a lot of work, research, and time to evaluate a wetland, and it takes a lot already for a wetland to be considered significant. The justifications behind what makes a wetland significant, whether biological, hydrological, social or special features, are all based on science, and are not just listed without purpose. And already, we have seen a drastic decrease in wetland covered compared to what we have known historically. With the onset of climate change and knowing that the worst is yet to come means we should be preparing however we can for increased flooding and storm events - going through with these proposed changes means that we are putting ourselves and our homes at risk, valuing short-term benefit (by mainly developers) versus looking at the long-term health of families, this land, and our infrastructure and homes.
Please, please understand that everything we do is connected. Taking away the ability for wetlands to be considered significant in a complex is so detrimental - we know and understand that diversity even within systems is so important, and protecting swaths of that variety is just as important as protecting one larger system. Removing the ability to evaluate wetland complexes as significant is a highly damaging move to these habitats, to at-risk species, to connectivity and watershed health overall. Something like 80% of wetlands in Niagara would lose their protections as they are significant as wetland complexes.
Removing consideration for species at-risk is also highly problematic-  they are disappearing for a reason, largely due to habitat loss, and these moves are just pushing them closer to extinction as we destroy more and more of their habitat.
What kind of world do we want to leave behind for our children? I want to know more than anything that if I choose to have kids, I can show them the beauty of this province and the biodiversity that I feel so lucky to have in Ontario. The thought that my children or grandchildren won't be able to see some of this same biodiversity is devastating. These proposed changes mean destroying precious ecosystems that can never be recreated. Wetlands are highly complex systems that benefit us more than we may ever know - please don't make it easier for us to lose them. Please do not move forward with these proposed changes.

71600,/comment/71600,"The Ontario Provincial Government and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) are proposing changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) procedure.
The proposed changes have been summarized on the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO), as follows:
•	add new guidance related to re-evaluation of wetlands and updates to mapping of evaluated wetland boundaries
•	make changes to better recognize the professional opinion of wetland evaluators and the role of local decision makers (e.g. municipalities)
•	other housekeeping edits to ensure consistency with the above changes throughout the manual
I have reviewed the changes to the OWES procedure and provide the following review and comments.
Summary of changes:
•	removal of third-party oversight, assistance, or expertise
•	removal and re-evaluation of wetland complexes
•	reduction of functionally-linked wetland complexes (750m)
•	new closely grouped wetlands (30m)
•	wetlands less than 2 hectares will no longer be evaluated
•	protections around Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs) reduced
•	species at risk removed from wetland scoring
My concerns with the proposed changes, are as follows:
1.	The loss of third-party oversight and assistance with wetland evaluations has the potential to be detrimental to future wetland evaluations.  There have already been weaknesses in the interpretation of wetlands under the OWES.
2.	Wetland complexes generally consider functionally linked wetlands within 750 metres of each other. Removing wetland complexes greatly reduces the holistic nature of wetland ecosystems and is likely to have negative unintended consequences to biological function and wildlife corridors.  The proposal does not compensate for a degradation of biological function.
3.	I am interpreting “closely grouped wetlands” as a replacement to wetland complexes.  Where closely grouped wetlands are defined as within 30 metres of each other.  Therefore, closely grouped wetlands are 25x smaller than wetland complexes.  This provision has the ability greatly reduce the amount of wetland areas in the province.  No consideration is given to biological function.
4.	Without wetland complexing, wetlands less than 2 hectares in size may not receive the appropriate protections. 
5.	The quantity of PSWs and the protections around PSWs are being greatly reduced.  By removing Species at Risk in Ontario as a scoring factor, the amount of PSWs will be reduced.  The removal of wetland complexing will also reduce the amount of PSWs.  A reduction in the regulation area from 120 metres to 30 metres will not provide adequate protections for wetland function and biodiversity.
6.	I agree that wetland scoring using Species at Risk in Ontario (threatened and endangered) presents some challenges with development and maintenance work on existing infrastructure (i.e. bridge, chimneys, etc.).  However, by removing species at risk as a major component in wetland scoring, we are in turn de-evaluating some wetlands biologic function.
Wetlands provide many important functions such as water filtration, flood mitigation, carbon sequestration, increased biodiversity, and ecosystem support during dry periods.  In Ontario, wetlands are some of the most biodiverse natural features on our landscape and deserve much more protection and understanding then they received.  Wetlands should not be considered an impediment to developed, but should be celebrated and protected.
Established in 1983, the OWES has been useful in evaluating and managing wetlands throughout Ontario.  However, it was not the only system prepared at the time.  Three systems were prepared and the current system was selected.  Since 1983, wetland evaluations have been carried-out all over North America using a myriad of different systems.
My recommendations to the review team are simply:
1.	Refrain from dismantling the current system;
2.	Review and assess existing wetland evaluation systems across North America; and
3.	Consider Species at Risk in Ontario and biological function as major components when evaluating wetlands (i.e. keep the ecosystem component in wetland assessments).
In closing, at the end of the day we all need and want to see an increased protection of wetlands and the ecosystems they sustain.

There is no where for our rainwater or snowmelt to go in urban areas - this increases the risk of flooding, and ends up carrying waste, pollution, and other materials from our cities straight into our waterways through runoff. If Ontario develops over what wetlands we have left, we are going to experience huge increases in flooding risks, loss of local flora and fauna, and increased sediments and pollution everywhere. Whatever compensation areas the government and developers have planned to ""replace"" habitat will NOT be enough. These areas are not 1 to 1 replacements of natural wetlands and ponds, and there is often times no funding in place to support the monitoring of these areas to ensure they are as effective as they say on paper.

71701,/comment/71701,"As an Ontario resident, homeowner and taxpayer I am appalled to read your proposed changes to the OWES under the guise or ""more homes built faster."" Building on wetlands will not provide quality, affordable homes for anyone - nor will it help protect existing homes from increased flooding and erosion as climate change worsens.
Washing the province's hands of wetland evaluation and dropping it in the laps of developers will create major conflicts of interest where developers can simply re-evaluate a provincially-significant wetland on their property to show it can be removed. This will be made even easier if the Province follows through with removing wetland complexing and species at risk considerations from the evaluation process. Wetlands are more than individual marshes, fens or swamps - they are vast, complex hydrological systems through which water is filtered and purified, carbon is sequestered out of the air and stormwater is stored. When you remove complexing from evaluations, these critical functions will be severed, fragmented and destroyed - cutting some areas off of their critical water supply while leaving others to flood.
If it's affordability you're after, please remember that wetlands carry infinitely more economic value when they’re left alone than when they’re developed. A 2021 study from the University of Waterloo found Southern Ontario’s wetlands provide $4.2 billion worth of sediment filtration and phosphorus removal services each year, keeping drinking water sources clean and helping to mitigate harmful algae blooms. Replacing these environmental services with man-made infrastructure could cost anywhere from $2.9 billion to a staggering $164 billion annually, depending on the replacement strategy. And that's just for filtration! As a taxpayer, I find this strategy extremely short-sighted and irresponsible.
Wetlands are also the cheapest and most efficient carbon sequestration machines on the planet. By merely existing, wetlands absorb carbon out of the atmosphere and hold it in their organic soils for centuries – all for free. When a wetland is destroyed, it stops pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and its collected carbon is potentially released back into the world. Taxpayers then either foot the bill for a man-made carbon capture facility or face the rising costs of a rapidly changing climate.
Wetlands are also excellent stormwater management systems, and can dramatically reduce the impact of major floods. Given that all three levels of government paid multi-millions in emergency response costs after the 2019 floods across Ontario - most notably in the Ottawa region - your government should understand that allowing more and bigger floods through wetland degradation is not beneficial to your bottom line or to taxpayers.
The Province argues that it has an offsetting plan, but it is, so far, incomplete and undeveloped - a major concern when the Province is poised to remove wetland protections. We don't yet know who will be responsible for managing and enforcing offsetting requirements, at what ratio, or if developers will be required to offset in the same catchment, subwatershed or even watershed as the lost wetland. Cash-in-lieu options are especially concerning, as they will most severely impact areas that have already experienced drastic historic wetland loss due to urbanization.
Furthermore, offsetting should be the last resort when it comes to wetlands. The guiding principle has been, and should remain, protection first. Wetlands and all of their many interconnected natural services are next to impossible to replicate, and can take years or decades to become truly functional. It's also extremely costly - as much as $1500/sq m of created wetland. It would be cheaper for the developer to simply build somewhere else.  I urge the province to reconsider this strategy and adopt a robust Protection First policy with clear guidelines on how offsetting should be applied.
On OWES generally, I implore the Province to reconsider these short-sighted and destructive proposals and give Ontario the future it deserves - one of sustainable development, liveable cities and protection from worsening climate change.
Thank you.

The cost of building homes by re-evaluating wetlands and farmlands to expand housing developments into rural areas is not sustainable for the future of Ontario and Canada for these main reasons:
•	With the info published by IPCC and Cop27 Paris Climate Change agreement, our world has 10 years to reduce our carbon emissions to minimize a 1.5-degree Celsius rise in global temperature.
•	Canada has promised to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 and be net zero by 2040.   •	Farmlands in Ontario are reduced by 321 acres a day in Ontario , food security is at risk both for Ontario and Canada. Wetlands and farmlands are a much higher value on what they provide as carbon sinks, habitat for species, food security vs the commercial land value or housing value.
•	Amendments to Bill 23 submitted by the Conservation Authorities of Ontario, majors of Ontario, naturalists and scientists will provide sound evidence on why wetlands, greenspaces, and farmlands must be fiercely protected.

71738,/comment/71738,"Currently, wetlands are managed through a variety of policies that include over 20 different pieces of legislation administered and/or implemented by five provincial ministries, two federal departments, a provincial agency (Niagara Escarpment Commission), 36 conservation authorities and 444 municipalities. Some of these statutes enable aspects of natural resource or natural heritage conservation and management, which can include wetlands, while others explicitly restrict certain land uses or activities within them.
In addition to the legislation and policy described, several other provincial statutes require consideration of wetlands when making decisions (e.g., Aggregate Resources Act) or influence wetlands in some way (e.g., Drainage Act). Others recognize that wetlands are part of recharge and discharge areas, which are also important for protecting sources of drinking water in Ontario (e.g., wetlands mapped in source protection plans, including local assessment reports prepared under the Clean Water Act). Several federal policies and statutes also contribute to wetland conservation in Ontario (e.g., Fisheries Act, Federal Policy on Wetlands).
The Ontario government previously understood the importance of wetlands and should continue to provide strong leadership to conserve these vital ecosystems.  Wetland conservation, akin to the management of other natural resources, requires an integrated approach. A shared commitment among all sectors, including the provincial government, is essential to conserving Ontario’s wetlands. The Ontario government should not eliminate its 40 year commitment to conserving wetlands in one misguided attempt to placate the development community.
The gutting of the OWES manual is completely contrary to everything that the government committed to in the Wetland Conservation Strategy for Ontario.  If there are perceived issues with the current version of OWES and the wetland evaluation process, the government could instead work closely with MNRF staff to improve the method by which provincially significant wetlands are reviewed and create efficiency and consistency across the province, while still supporting wetland conservation goals.
It appears that several government programs and procedures (some listed above) will be adversely affected by the proposed changes to the OWES manual.
The MNRF currently maintains a wetland inventory for the province that includes best available information about the location, area and significance of wetlands. This includes high-quality information collected through detailed field work as well as mapping based on air photo interpretation and satellite imagery. While this inventory is a good start, more current and detailed mapping and regular updating are required to better conserve wetlands, not less. If MNRF is no longer involved in wetlands and there is no central repository for wetland data, LIO layer for wetlands will be affected and will no longer be relevant or up to date.  Removing access or erasing the existence of a “wetland file” housed with MNRF will result in a loss of over 40+ years of wetland data and program experience.  To our knowledge, most historical wetland data is not available digitally.  Removing public access to previously collected information and data on wetlands will further diminish the ability for a fair and science-based evaluation or re-evaluation of a wetland to be conducted.
Since the CLTIP and MFTIP programs do not have a development trigger, will there be any ability for these program participants to process any required changes?  Removing MNRF access to wetland evaluations would mean that CLTIP administrators would no longer have access to up to date wetland boundaries through Land Information Ontario (LIO) so effective administration of the program would be hindered.  It is also our understanding that evaluators could potentially reevaluate wetlands occurring on adjacent properties resulting in a loss of PSW status which could have negative impacts on a number of landowners.  It is our opinion that since the province is actively devaluing all wetlands, they should consider allowing all wetlands to be covered by CLTIP and MFTIP instead of only PSW’s.
The review of aggregate applications up to this point in time was already difficult because the government refused to allow wetland files to be updated to current standards.  The proposed OWES changes will further compound the issue, so that planning decisions will continue to be based on outdated or incomplete data that doesn’t take into account the true natural heritage values present on a site prior to development.  In addition, aggregates staff at the MNRF won’t be able to effectively review aggregate applications if LIO is not up to date or if they are not provided with an accurate reevaluated wetland file.
It is clear that removing MNRF from any review and approval role in wetland evaluations and with OWES will also affect confidence in the quality and accuracy in the evaluations and reevaluations submitted to “decision makers”.  MNRF reviewers of OWES evaluations are generally required to have OWES evaluation training.  Most evaluators need to conduct several wetland evaluations before they become proficient.  In the past, MNRF review or WEDSR’s has assisted trained evaluators in improving their evaluation skills.  Without any oversite or review function from someone with more experience in OWES evaluations, it is likely that the evaluations provided will be poor quality and will contain errors.  In addition, if MNRF is no longer involved in OWES, there will be no ability to retrain evaluators or provide updates to training and certification.  None of the currently certified wetland evaluators have been trained in this “revised” evaluation system.  Without MNRF support or a refresher training system, it is likely that evaluators will provide incomplete or incorrect evaluations and reevaluations to “decision makers”. These decision makers may also not have any training in OWES and would not be able to distinguish or identify errors in the WEDSR.  Lastly, it is a conflict of interest for someone who is being paid by a developer to evaluate a wetland which will most likely be downgraded, with absolutely no review or appeal process available to any party.
If the intent is to remove duplication from OWES with other policies (which is the given reasoning for removing END and THR species scoring from OWES), then it seems counterintuitive to refer to the Natural Heritage Reference Manual and the Ecoregion Criteria Schedules which are used to designate SWH to determine a score in OWES.  Also, if there is the potential that the SWH Ecoregional Criteria schedules may be revised in future, it may not be in the best interest to include these in the wildlife scoring sections of the WEDSR.
Scoring in the proposed OWES manual is now unbalanced with not enough weight being given to important features.  Consideration should be given to restructuring the scoring for provincially significant species to remove the compounding decreased score model.
The proposed changes to the OWES manual will undoubtedly have a negative effect on municipalities and their abilities to manage and implement current natural heritage protection policies.  Most municipalities are not equipped to review, accept or keep track of wetland evaluations, and changes in mapping.  Removing MNRF as the central repository for wetland data and mapping will make it difficult for municipalities to implement several PPS policies.  In addition, wetlands often span across several municipal boundaries. If there is no development trigger but a landowner wishes to have a wetland boundary modified or an evaluation or reevaluation conducted, who would this information be submitted to?  It is unlikely that the municipality would have the capacity or interest in processing these changes.  It is also unclear whether municipal development reviews will trigger wetland evaluations or reevaluations.  Municipalities may find it difficult to review and process WEDSR’s without any provincial support.  It seems punitive to transfer this responsibility onto them without any transitional training or provincial involvement.
If the changes in the manual go forward as proposed, the title of the manual should be changed to “4th edition” or “Ford edition” as this revised document is no longer appropriate as a 3rd edition manual, and since the evaluations conducted using this new system would not be comparable to those conducted using the previous science-based, peer-reviewed version of the manual.
We strongly urge the government to repeal any changes to the OWES manual, and instead focus on improving internal wetland evaluation review policies and processes.  We also encourage the government to direct MNRF staff to work closely with municipalities, provide clear direction and support for planning review while ensuring that natural heritage values like wetlands continue to be protected on the landscape.

Removing them and building housing there = more floods and even more flooded homes. Drained wetlands also provide poor bases and foundation for homes so why do it?  Do NOT reduce protections, if anything increase the protections and find a better solution.  Not just the solution that seems fast and easy but is not good for anyone long term.

71756,/comment/71756,"The changes proposed in Bill 23 would be disastrous to the environment in Ontario. Wetlands are incredibly important for many things including species at risk, flood mitigation, water filtration, and act as carbon sinks keeping carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Climate change is currently one of the greatest threats we face, and destroying critical wetlands to build subdivisions would be extremely detrimental to our efforts to fight climate change.
As one of the people outlined in the bill who can't afford to own a house, I agree we absolutely need to build more affordable housing. However, destroying more of our natural spaces is not the way to do it. If the premier wants to make housing more affordable there are many other ways to do it: increase the minimum wage, provide funding for housing-first homelessness programs, relax zoning bylaws to allow for denser, mixed use development in our cities instead of subdivision style single family dwellings, regulate landlords to manage prices, and create a government owned housing system as a way of keeping housing affordable.
I hope the government will reconsider what it has proposed in Bill 23 and put a stop to it immediately.

71778,/comment/71778,"I strongly disagree with the weakening of Conservation Authorities and limiting their ability to comment and issue permits. We need Conservative Authorities to continue to protect our wetlands and natural areas as they are the most cost effective methods for climate change mitigation and adaptation, flood protection, biodiversity conservation and recreation.
Wetlands are nature’s water purification system; they are constantly filtering out pollutants, sediments and excess nutrients to supply clean water and maintain ecological balance. Researchers Tariq Aziz and Philippe Van Cappellen at the University of Waterloo found in a recent study that wetlands provide an estimated $4.2 billion worth of sediment and phosphorus filtration each year, helping to keep our drinking water, lakes, and rivers clean. Simply put, if we continue to dismiss the importance of wetlands, we will need to invest billions in alternative methods to clean water.
The researchers assessed the alternative costs of replacing wetlands with three human-made solutions. Here’s the potential annual bill for each option: 1) constructing wetlands to replace the existing services would cost $2.9 billion per year; 2) using agricultural Best Management Practices to remove phosphorus would cost $13 billion per year; and 3) replacing wetlands by expanding wastewater treatment plants would cost an astounding $164 billion a year.
Bill 23 would remove the power of Conservation Authorities to regulate or prohibit the destruction of woodlands, wetlands, river or stream valleys, within their jurisdiction, in almost every case. It does this through Section 7 of the Bill, which would amend s. 28 of the Conservation Authorities Act to exempt any project that has received land use planning approval under the Planning Act from Conservation Authority regulations regulating water-taking, interference with rivers, creeks, streams, watercourses, and wetlands, or controlling flooding, erosion, conservation of land, or impact on species at risk.
I am strongly opposed to Bill 23 and associated policy proposals that would weaken environmental protections and undermine public involvement in land use planning and decision-making. I urge you to 1) withdraw all amendments likely to weaken the protection of farmland and natural heritage; and 2) retain and uphold the role of the public, Conservation Authorities and regional municipalities in environmental planning and decision-making.
This Ontario government, under Premier Doug Ford, is already sending a message to Ontario landowners and developers that filling in wetlands for development is acceptable. The government’s 2018 changes to the Endangered Species Act empowers the Minister of Natural Resources to suspend protections for species-at-risk for any development project. In the Haliburton area, the filling of wetlands on a Gelert Road private property has threatened the habitat of at-risk species and caused the death of an 125 year old Snapping turtle.
Ontario is blessed with an abundance of wetlands that play a critical role in storing and purifying our water. They also provide habitat for wildlife (including about 20 percent of Ontario’s species at risk), offer wild foods and medicines for local communities, and afford opportunities for cultural and recreational pursuits. In addition, they store carbon and control flooding and are thus of utmost importance in mitigating and enhancing community resilience to climate change. A study by Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources in 2009, conservatively estimated the contribution of wetlands to human well-being at over $51 billion per year in southern Ontario alone.
Stop the creation of a natural heritage offsetting policy and “pay to slay” fund that could lead to widespread and extremely risky tradeoffs, where existing natural areas are sacrificed on the faulty premise that they can be recreated or restored elsewhere. The value of Ontario’s existing natural environment will only increase in the future.  Stop this reckless destruction of highly valuable land for short term profits. Nature belongs to future generations.

We who are citizens of this world demand that every creature is protected and granted the ability to survive because their survival is dependent on our own.
With climate change and the uncertainty of Canada's future food sources it is beyond comprehension that the Provincial government would go ahead and declassify the protection of wetlands and agricultural land in Ontario. It is irresponsible to future residents to place them in harm's way when it has been proven that these areas are prone to flooding. Who will cover their insurance when flooding occurs, the government? It is also irresponsible for the government purposely force residents of this province to source food farther away from where they live. California's lack of water supply only brings forth our need to protect our wetlands so that both water and soil are protected for the future generations.
We talk about the forests in the Amazon being cut at an alarming rate and the necessity in protecting them but is the Ontario government any different when it considers changing the protection of wetlands in Ontario to further the profits of private developers.

71812,/comment/71812,"City of Kitchener comments are attached and summarized below:
Kitchener continues to be a leader in Ontario and has already undertaken some of the work that Bill 23 seeks to achieve:
•	Kitchener’s Development Services Review was acknowledged by yourself in announcing the changes proposed by Bill 23. We are proud of our successes in streamlining development approvals and have seen tremendous results.
•	Kitchener Council recently approved a $2 million fund to pay development charges for affordable housing and in August 2022 through Council’s approval of a parkland dedication bylaw, exempted parkland dedication requirements for affordable housing. I fully support Bill 23 changes to make affordable housing projects exempt from development charges and parkland dedication.
•	In 2021, Kitchener Council was one of the first municipalities in Ontario to update our zoning by-law to allow for tiny houses (additional dwelling units) on over 25,000 lots. To date we have received 37 applications for tiny homes with some already occupied. My team would be pleased to work with your team to assist with a potential consistent province-wide approach to regulating tiny homes.
Kitchener’s key areas of concern, and where we have questions/comments for the Province’s consideration, include the following:
•	Development charge framework – Bill 23 includes changes in development charge (DC) eligible items but does not fully account for the need to continue to supply infrastructure in a timely coordinated manner to support growth. Further it proposes to phase in DCs over a 5-year period resulting in an approximate $17 million reduction in DC revenues for Kitchener. These changes move us farther from a “growth pays for growth” approach and has the potential to shift infrastructure costs associated with growth to existing residents. We are requesting that the Province carefully examine the implications of the proposed changes to development charges to ensure that infrastructure delivery continues to be aligned with housing supply. It is important that Kitchener can quickly deliver and adequately fund the infrastructure needed to support housing growth.
•	Parkland dedication framework – It is our understanding that under Bill 23 park land and cash-in-lieu of land conveyances will be reduced by at least 50%. The cap reduces higher density park land dedication substantially yielding negligible park land per person in higher density scenarios. In August 2022, Kitchener Council approved a new park land dedication bylaw together with a park land strategy, Places and Spaces. Kitchener’s park land strategy is balanced and considers impacts on development proformas and sets realistic and achievable park land provision targets. We are requesting that the Province hold off on any changes to park land dedication to allow for recently approved by-laws that have been appealed to be tested at the OLT and be implemented for a period of time. This approach provides an opportunity to understand any potential implications and areas for refinement.
•	Changes to regional planning authorities – Bill 23 proposes to remove planning responsibilities from the Region of Waterloo. There is merit in a continued coordinated approach to certain aspects that are currently within the Region’s planning jurisdiction. Coordination of growth in geographic areas with shared interests and infrastructure, like groundwater/sourcewater protection, wastewater and water treatment, natural heritage, and transit is beneficial. Coordination will assist with continuing to balance increasing housing supply while maintaining agricultural lands for needed food supply and protecting and conserving lands that are an integral part of our watershed and natural heritage system that cross municipal boundaries.
•	Site plan exemptions – Bill 23 proposes to exclude buildings of 10 units or less from site plan control. Further, Bill 23 proposes to exclude exterior design matters including character, scale, appearance, and design features. Kitchener has concerns about exempting buildings from a site plan process where parking lots, significant grading, or new servicing is proposed. Infill developments are often improved through a site plan process to eliminate off-site impacts. Rather than exempt developments by the number of units, it is recommended that the Province consider exempting certain types of developments, such as street fronting townhouses and additional dwelling units from site plan control. Kitchener supports the exemption of review of exterior design matters such as colour, texture, type of material, and window details from site plan review. We request that the Province consider piloting these exemptions only at this time and monitoring to see if further exemptions are needed.
•	Natural heritage system review/evaluation jurisdiction – Bill 23 proposes to limit the role of the GRCA to matters related to natural hazards and will no longer permit MOUs for services. Kitchener works in partnership with the Region and GRCA on matters related to natural hazards and natural heritage to ensure a consistent streamlined approach to conservation, enhancement and restoration. Should the changes in Bill 23 regarding Regional planning responsibilities and conservation authorities advance, there will be no cross municipal jurisdiction to ensure a consistent approach to the conservation, protection and restoration of natural heritage systems. This is of concern especially in the areas of sub-watershed studies and related community/secondary plan processes.
•	Cultural heritage register and designation – Among the changes within Bill 23 are changes to the timing of the review and addition of properties to the heritage register. Kitchener is concerned that these changes will diminish a municipality’s ability to designate significant cultural heritage resources resulting in potential significant loss of Kitchener’s cultural heritage. Completing an evaluation and designation process for all cultural heritage resources on Kitchener’s register within a 2-year timeframe will at best be challenging. Kitchener is supportive of advancing work on reviewing its register and is requesting that the Province revisit the proposed 2-year timeframe.

The proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System are egregious, and must not pass. The only way to protect the wetlands that in turn protect us from flooding and serious biodiversity loss is to evaluate them as the interconnected complexes that they are. To shift evaluation from complexes to individual parcels guts the evaluation system and undermines any credible attempt by the Province to protect future homes and public infrastructure from the loss of irreplaceable services. The financial impacts of such a move would be felt by Ontarians for decades, even lifetimes to come. No, it is not okay to evaluate wetlands as proposed

71831,/comment/71831,"ERO #019-6160
Southern Ontario has already lost 85% of its original wetlands. The revisions to the Wetland Evaluation System put forward in Bill 23 will result in significant losses to those that remain. By allowing each individual wetland in a wetland complex to be evaluated separately, we will doom the entire complex over time. Each loss makes the entire complex less able to perform its functions.  According to the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority, proposed changes could result in the demise of all of its protected wetlands (Hamilton Spectator, Nov. 2, 2022). Ontario Nature states that, because of the proposed changes, “many if not most existing Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs) could lose that designation” and be subject to development.
Wetlands are rich ecosystems that support a host of species including invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals – many of which are already on the endangered species list.  Allowing these changes could also result in the extinction of these species.
Where the option to destroy wetlands exists, it will be used by the development industry. The plan to “offset” the loss of a wetland is disingenuous – no amount of compensation can replace the complex ecosystem that will be destroyed. Orillia naturalist Bob Bowles, who used to evaluate wetlands for the province, said the proposed changes to the scoring system will significantly reduce environmental protections for those ecosystems. He also noted that some unevaluated wetlands could be provincially significant and as it can take up to three seasons to fully evaluate a wetland, the new scoring system will make it difficult for such wetlands to become protected moving forward (OrilliaMatters.ca).
According to this posting, the proposed changes are intended to “provide greater certainty and clarity related to how significant wetlands are assessed and identified.” However, the significant removals and changes proposed reduce the amount of detail and clarity surrounding procedures and criteria for determining and identifying significant wetlands and their boundaries. (CELA.ca)
When combined with the diminished role of conservation authorities that is also being proposed as part of Bill 23, this could lead to development in natural hazards with resulting higher property damage costs, risks to human health and safety, and increased burdens on municipal partners, who may not have the technical expertise and experience to make informed decisions related to wetland evaluation (as well as other natural heritage systems).
As the Canadian Environmental Law Association notes in their submission to this posting, this review of the OWES system has also missed an opportunity to address equity concerns: “Land use decisions have and continue to play a role in creating and perpetuating discriminatory practices against low-income, vulnerable, and disadvantaged communities.” For example, a recent study found that “the overall flood risk is higher in Indigenous communities than in other Canadian communities” and since Ontario’s wetlands play a critical role in enhancing resilience to climate change and flood risk (through soil stabilization, water filtration, flood mitigation and carbon storage), I agree with CELA that it is important for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry  to apply an equity lens when making decisions related to wetland conservation and protection. This must include direct consultation with Indigenous groups.
For these reasons, I do not support the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.

71839,/comment/71839,"The housing crisis is a challenge in our time; however, disregarding environmental safeguards to dilute the housing market is unsustainable and irresponsible. New homes can be constructed on lands which are not critical for our nation's biodiversity and watershed conservation. Moving an established habitat from one location to another is not a good idea; recreating a landscape forged over millennia is impossible. Those habitats serve niche purposes which can not simply be recreated.
Further,  wetlands are considered the most biodiverse habitats on earth. Biodiversity in these landscapes can be directly linked to overall ecosystem health and provide various ecosystem services.

71840,/comment/71840,"The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System is a science-based system that outlines a process, and a set of criteria to define, identify, and assess the functions and values of wetlands in Ontario. The proposed changes remove entire sections which are integral components of the Evaluation System such as wetland complexing and recognition of the significance of habitat for Threatened and Endangered species. Removal of wetland complexing, coupled with the ability to re-evaluate individual wetland units with no apparent oversite is anticipated to result in a significant decrease in Provincially Significant Wetland area in Ontario. These changes are not based in science, but instead are politically motivated and designed to downplay the significance of wetlands on Ontario to facilitate the removal of features from the landscape. While it is recognized that the OWES did require modernization, the changes should be science-based, not politically motivated to benefit the development community. Wetlands benefit all Ontarians, and facilitating their removal is a short sighted strategy which will have negative implications for the people of Ontario for decades to come.

71851,/comment/71851,"Pg. 4 - Removed verbiage around the fact that data gaps are present in wetland evaluation files (ie. Presence of rare species and hydrological functions may be missing). HOWEVER continues to state the following: The application of this system provides knowledge of the different kinds of wetland values, which is then available for examination and review by any interested person, agency or group. This seems to imply that the wetland evaluation file may substitute for site specific study for development/permitting?
Pg. 4 - Previous verbiage in OWES indicated that PSWs are protected under the PPS, this has been struck out of the revised version implying that PSWs are no longer protected under the PPS?
Pg. 7 - Complete evaluations must be forwarded to the biologist/ecologist at the local MNR District or Area office in which the wetland is located. This has been scratched out. It is unclear who the evaluator is to submit their evaluation.
Pg. 8 - New terminology added: 'Complete Evaluation' - a wetland evaluation, re-evaluation or mapping update will be considered 'complete' once it has been received by a decision maker addressing a land use planning or resource management matter. It is unclear who the 'decision maker' is and who will ensure evaluations are done by qualified professionals following OWES protocols as the MNRF has been struck from the document. Where are the evaluations to be submitted and who does the updating (e.g. mapping updates for boundary revisions and status on the wetland). Who is to oversee this repository?
Pg. 9 - Agricultural usage is more clear: planting of crops or tillage should no longer be considered wetland.
Pg. 11 - Sources of information for background/desktop review of wetlands have been removed and significantly reduced, general intent remains the same and qualified evaluators will be familiar with these methods and information sources.  Consistency of background desktop review for evaluators  will be assumed.
Pg. 14 - Landowner Notification and Permission - Clearly identifies that landowner permission is required prior to attending a site, however implies that wetland evaluations may be completed without permission to access as it is 'a courtesy to notify landowners that a wetland evaluations is being undertaken for a wetland located on their property'.
Pg. 14 - Wetland evaluations required to be completed at an appropriate time of year - not defined in either the previous version or updated version of OWES. Recommend that appropriate timing be laid out (eg. During the growing season) to allow for greater consistency and avoid back and forth for evaluations completed during inappropriate times.
Pg. 20 - 'slough wetlands' are included and described as areas comprising very closely spaced ponds/pools (e.g. within 30 m from each other) interspersed with small pockets of upland forest. These areas are to be evaluated as one wetland under OWES. This section is included in Wetland Edges Bordering on Lakes and Rivers - should be it's own section or more appropriately in the section Wetlands Bordering on Upland Forest. Glad to see that slough wetlands are included.
Pg. 21 - Wetlands on Ontario's Major Lakes and Rivers - resistance to complexing poses problems for these units: The 2 m depth contour (at low water) is to be used to define the deep water boundary of these wetlands (see exceptions above). If the evaluator encounters underwater shoals or knolls rising like islands from deeper water and the tops of these are less than 2 m from the surface, they should be included in the wetland map and the wetland with which they are associated is to be defined as one wetland a complex(a complex removed from and replaced by one wetland) and evaluated as such. Additional clarity should be provided - is the area between these knolls considered part of the wetland or not similar to mosaic/slough wetlands described earlier in the document.
Pg. 22 - Wetland mapping is required to be consistent with LIO, however, as MNRF is no longer approval authority for wetland mapping updates/evaluation changes guidance is required to understand the process for which mapping updates will be incorporated. Who is authorized to approve a change and submit to LIO?
Pg. 26 - The current OWES document highlights the importance of Wetland Complexes ...Many areas of Ontario contain closely spaced wetlands that vary in size from a fraction of a hectare to several hundred hectares. The topography of the landscape in which these wetlands occur, the short distances between some of the wetlands, and the density of wetlands per unit of area landscape may be so complex that delineation of the wetland units into individually recognized wetlands would not be an ecologically or functionally sound process. Such groupings of wetlands are referred to as “wetland complexes.”  Much of the wildlife in the area of the complex is variously dependent upon the presence of the entire complex of wetlands, with each wetland unit contributing to the whole. Now the proposed OWES has completely omitted complexing. This is critical because as previously stated some of the wetlands, and the density of wetlands per unit of area landscape may be so complex that delineation of the wetland units into individually recognized wetlands would NOT be an ecologically or functionally sound process.
Pg. 36 - OWES continues to be ambiguous regarding size of mappable units. 2 ha typically smallest to be evaluated, 0.5 ha smallest mappable vegetation unit - both caveated with that rare flora and fauna may result in significance for smaller polygons. This should be made abundantly clear that limited size does not preclude the potential significance of a wetland and that even small wetlands require study to determine significance.
Pg. 37 - evaluators were required to fill out the same forms but now the forms are just a guide -> Appendix 4 provides templates that will assist in organizing field data. This leaves much to interpretation and takes away a standardized approach to how the information is being presented.
Pg. 42 - If a wetland is used by Aboriginal hunters only, there is no longer a bonus score for Aboriginal value in Section 2.8.1. This gives the impression that cultural importance by first nations are not given the appropriate consideration.
Pg. 49 - Location of species of conservation concern should not be incorporated into publicly accessible versions of the wetland evaluation doc. How is this to be realized if wetland changes are submitted to an unknown entity through a planning process in which supporting documentation becomes part of the public record? Previously MNRF administered Element Occurrence data AND wetland evaluation files, now an unknown middle entity will approve wetland evaluations.
Pg. 62 - The review/approval function of wetland evaluations by the MNRF has been scratched out. Again, unclear who will be reviewing evaluation files.
Pg. 64 - Appendix 10 formerly provided an authoritative list of wetland species to be utilized to apply the 50% vegetation rule when delineating wetland boundaries. This has been revised to be a guideline, this is likely to result in confusion and delays when delineating wetlands due to differences in professional opinion in the absence of an authoritative list.
Pg. 64 - Wetland Plant List may be updated from time to time and these updates will be available on a website. No further detail is provided as to which Ministry, organization etc is responsible for updating the plant list.

71873,/comment/71873,"We are a group of leading professors and researchers working on business sustainability through cross-disciplinary research, leadership programming and community engagement. We have concerns regarding the costs associated with the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetlands Evaluation System.
1) Economic Benefits of Wetland conservation
There are several economic benefits to preserving wetlands rather than developing them. According to scientists and economists, the value of services and goods provided by global ecosystems, such as wetlands, amounts to about USD 33 trillion. Wetlands help stimulate many industries, such as fishing, recreational activities, hunting (under specific circumstances), and others. Anglers, hunters, trappers, and recreational sport shooters spent $6.5 billion in Ontario in 2019. They contributed $4.7 billion (0.6%) to Ontario’s GDP and supported 36,900 jobs. The health of these local industries is dependent on the health of wetlands. This demonstrates the economic activity generated for Ontario by wetlands remaining undeveloped. Thus, wetlands are indeed much more for economic purposes than most would think.
2) The Consequences of a Looser Wetlands Definition
This regulation removes “Cluster wetlands,” opening the door to evaluating each wetland individually and to develop on them. Wetlands are complex and some of the most productive ecosystems on the planet. They are also one of the most endangered, as over 70% percent of wetlands within settled regions of Canada have been lost or degraded. The provincial government is receiving comments on a proposed amendment to the Greenbelt Area boundary. It is essential to consider what the loss and development of these lands mean for local communities across Ontario. For example, wetlands loss is associated with both a decrease in local water quality and with mitigating and preventing flooding. Therefore, communities that have their wetlands developed into new housing may experience issues with local water quality and see increases in flooding.
3) Wetlands Provide Cheap Flood Protection
Changing how wetlands are defined and evaluated economically affects municipalities and the province. Loosening protections for wetlands will allow for low-rise real estate development to occur. Municipalities tend to fund 20% of the capital costs but are responsible for their maintenance. Over time, the costs of infrastructure services, e.g., streetlights, wastewater, etc., get passed on to ratepayers. They become costly for municipalities to benefit from over the long term, given sprawling low-rise developments.
The proposed regulation will remove wetlands’ benefits for flood protection, water filtration, carbon sequestration, and recreation, which are considered ecosystem benefits. A University of Waterloo study valued the ecosystem system services of wetlands in southern Ontario to be worth $9,995 per hectare per year. Since wetlands’ benefits vary from watershed to watershed, it is worth considering adjusting such a benchmark according to the area. For instance, wetlands in the Lake Simcoe watershed have ecosystem benefits worth $11,172 per hectare per year. Thus, the government should consider the economic benefits of loosening this regulation against these economic benchmarks.
4) Wetlands and Climate Change Protection
Wetlands are a vital asset in the fight against climate change. The simplification proposed in this regulation may prove detrimental to Ontario communities in terms of resilience to climate change. In 2021, the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) estimated that weather-related events due to climate change cost Canadians around $2.1 billion in insured damages. This figure could reach up to $139 billion by 2050. Environment and Climate Change Canada scientists reported in 2020 that climate change has made rainfall more extreme and storms with extreme rain more frequent. For instance, Toronto had significant rainfall events in 2017 and 2018.
Meanwhile, communities are funding wetland protection efforts in coastal areas thanks to their benefits in mitigating the impacts of severe weather events. For instance, Swiss Re is working with Mexican authorities to underwrite an insurance product protecting its coral reefs, recognizing the economic benefits of protection. Therefore, removing wetlands for development is highly detrimental to resilience to climate change. The irony is that this regulation is being changed to support the government’s plan to increase homeownership. However, the long-term consequences of simplifying how wetlands are defined may lead to homeowners having increased exposure to adverse weather events like flooding.
5) Lack of Fairness for Stakeholders
The regulation proposes removing conservationists as part of the OWES. Their proposed lack of involvement is concerning, given many conservationists’ expertise on their local wetlands. The regulation eliminates the role of conservation professionals, from conservation organizations to MNR specialists (biologists, hunting regulators, and anglers). It also removes the need for evaluators to give results of an evaluation to conservationists. Such measures further prove that the proposed regulation is trying to limit the voice of conservationists and other stakeholders. This means risking losing species on wetlands, which act as tourist attractions within and outside Ontario.
6) Repealing Rare Species Protections
Along with the potential destruction of valuable wetland infrastructure, the proposed regulation repeals various protections for Ontario’s rare species. Most notably, the proposal would cut the role of MNR workers and conservationists in preserving rare species and allow the sale and removal of wetlands containing rare species that were previously protected. Wetlands, including those on private land, play an essential role in preserving rare species.
Rare species could only be addressed if it is immediately apparent that using a wetland as their habitat is a deliberate attempt to open space for development. A wetland that is lost is not easily replaced. A review of 59 studies of biodiversity recovery by Pezzati et al., 2018 found that recovery times varied from less than one year to 10,000 years with active restoration efforts. The risk to Southern Ontario is especially significant. The Carolinian life zone, an ecoregion extending from Windsor to Toronto, is Canada’s most biodiverse region. It comprises only 0.25% of Canada’s total land but is home to 50% of its species at risk.
7) The Risks of Low-Density Housing in Flood-prone Areas
Many solutions to the housing issue do not involve destroying our valuable wetland regions. Ontario mainly builds low-density single-family homes, with the province building 8,671 single-family units in 2021 alone. These low-density homes fail to solve Ontario's housing shortage. They are increasingly unaffordable due to rising housing prices in Canada and are inefficient land use. Furthermore, it has been estimated that only 50,000 new homes of these single-family homes may be built within the next decade, which is certainly not enough to solve Ontario’s current housing shortage. Therefore, the Ford government should commit to building higher-density housing that is more cost-effective in using existing infrastructure than facilitating building more low-density housing. This is unaffordable to many Ontarians and would now destroy various wetlands. They cannot be replaced once lost.

71879,/comment/71879,"I am deeply disturbed by the changes proposed to the system of evaluating and regulating wetlands. These changes will leave these evaluations in the hands of municipalities and developers, taking the expertise of MNRF and conservation authorities out of the equation. The presence of endangered species will no longer contribute to the overall score of a wetland. The result will be that fewer wetlands are recognized as PSWs, and those that have been recognized in the past will be in danger of re-mapping. Developers will be able to ""compensate"" for their destruction of wetlands by flooding other areas - this is a false equivalency since these newly-created ""wetlands"" will not have the same carbon storage or biodiversity as the true wetlands that were destroyed.
The ostensible reason for all these changes is that Ontario needs more housing; however, the government has not any presented evidence that the root cause of housing problems is a shortage of land. Destroying our wetlands would not be a good solution in any case. Wetlands are havens of biodiversity. These sequester massive amounts of carbon. They act as natural sponges to mitigate against severe weather and flooding. Any measures that lessen our protection of wetlands will cost us dearly in the long run. We should be protecting wetlands, not paving them over.
One of the obvious solutions to the shortage of house is densification. We should be building upwards, not outwards. The proposed measures, apart from their immediate impact on wetlands, will certainly increase urban sprawl. Indeed, the title of Bill 23 should properly be ""The More Sprawl Faster Act"".
I do hope the government will re-consider Bill 23, either dropping it entirely, or re-working it to enhance the protection of wetlands and the Greenbelt, and to decrease sprawl.

They retain and filter water, absorb run-off, absorb and retain huge amounts of carbon dioxide.  Destroying wetlands by building over them degrades one of our most fundamental life support systems.  We need to retain them to support our health and existence, not open them up for development.
In particular I oppose
1.	the change that proposes that wetland complexes will no longer be considered in the designation of Provincially Significant Wetlands
2.	the lack of recognition of endangered and threatened species as a criterion for designating significant wetlands
3.	the reduction of clarity and details around wetland evaluation procedures, including ongoing consultation with the MNRF staff.
4.	the removal of provincial oversight and coordination such that there will be no central record of PSWs in Ontario
5.	the extremely short timeline to consider the implications of the changes
6.	the greatly misleading and inaccurate analysis of the results of the changes that is presented on the ERO listing.  The loss of more wetlands in Ontario will be devastating to wildlife, to the climate resilience of communities which they service, and to the sustainability of communities in their vicinity.
I recommend that:
1.	Sections of the OWES dealing with wetland complexes should not be removed
2.	Sections of the OWES dealing with the habitat, migratory areas, and feeding of endangered or threatened species be retained.
3.	the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry should retain the authority to review and to approve all wetland evaluations completed under OWES.
4.	The section of OWES dealing with 'locally important wetlands' should not be removed.
Real costs associated with the destruction of wetlands include losses of an estimated $15,171  to $17,968  per hectare per year in ecosystem services or a net present value of $500,000 to $600,000 per hectare within 3 generations.  And these are generally considered to be underestimates by knowledgeable people.

The OWES is a science-based system that outlines a process and a set of criteria to define, identify, and assess the functions and values of wetlands in Ontario. Conservation Authorities rely on this proven methodology as an aid in implementing regulations under the Conservation Authority Act. This includes making decisions regarding development and public safety, natural hazard prevention and management, regulating wetlands for flood attenuation, natural storage capacities and for preventing shoreline erosion. The results of wetland evaluations are also used to inform land-use planning decisions.
The GRCA strongly encourages additional time for consultation on the provincial proposals to ensure that the Province, Conservation Authorities, and other stakeholders fully understand the potential short and long term implications of the proposed changes.
Based on a review of the ERO posting, the following comments and recommendations are provided:
1.	Removal of wetland complexing is problematic and will lead to a less standardized approach to wetland evaluation. The removal of this section from the protocol will impact the status of numerous wetlands across the Grand River watershed.
2.	It is unclear who the ‘decision maker’ is and who will be responsible for ensuring qualified persons are completing evaluations.
3.	Municipalities will be required to take on a greater role in the OWES. There is a concern that some municipalities will not have the technical capacity or capabilities to complete the proposed tasks.
4.	Changes to the OWES could also have implications for the Conservation Land Tax Incentive Program for many landowners in the watershed, including the GRCA.
The GRCA supports a review and update of the OWES manual to ensure that it reflects the best available science and incorporates widely accepted inventory and assessment methods. We agree there is a need to create process efficiencies in some circumstances, but this needs to be based on ecological rationale. Staff suggest that any changes to the technical manual should be carefully vetted by qualified experts.
Full Comments:
On October 25, 2022, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry posted on the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) a proposal to amend the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES). These changes are being proposed in support of Ontario’s Housing Supply Action Plan 3.0 and the government’s commitment to support the construction of 1.5 million new housing units over the next ten years. These proposed updates to the OWES are to remove duplicated requirements and streamline the evaluation process.
While we acknowledge that it is important to build more homes in Ontario and make the development process more efficient; this cannot be done at the detrimental expense of important natural heritage features that play an important role on the landscape. The proposed updates identified in ERO No. 019-6160 do not reflect the best available science, would allow for more piecemeal assessment of wetlands and will result in further wetland loss.
Watersheds in southern Ontario have less wetland cover than they did prior to extensive European settlement, with losses exceeding 70% in many jurisdictions. Despite the various protections for wetlands today, wetland loss continues in many portions of the province. Investment in wetlands results in enhanced biological diversity, which in turn provides a range of ecological goods and services for communities. Wetlands collectively serve an important hydrological function and regulate how Ontario’s landscape responds to rainfall, runoff and flooding. Wetlands also serve a critical role in protecting the quality of recharging groundwater to support the drinking water needs of our communities.
The OWES is a science-based system that outlines a process and a set of criteria to define, identify, and assess the functions and values of wetlands in Ontario. Conservation Authorities rely on this proven scientific methodology as an aid in implementing regulations under the Conservation Authority Act. This information is used for making decisions for the purposes of public safety, natural hazard prevention and management, regulating wetlands for flood attenuation, natural storage capacities and for preventing shoreline erosion.
Based on GRCA’s review of the proposed changes to the OWES, we are providing the following comments and recommendations:
1.	We support the review and update of the southern manual, which was last updated in 2014. However, the proposed changes would remove entire sections of the manual. This could lead to further confusion and ambiguity as to how to approach a wetland evaluation in general and could also complicate site-specific reviews of small and isolated wetlands in particular. We recommend that the best available science and widely accepted methods be incorporated into the manual to ensure that all wetlands are properly inventoried, assessed and protected for future generations.
2.	The wholesale removal of the wetland complexing guidelines is problematic and will likely lead to a less standardized approach to wetland evaluation in the province.  Furthermore, the elimination of wetland complexing guidelines will likely lead to great ambiguity and confusion regarding the limits and status of wetlands. The proposed wholesale elimination of complexing from the OWES protocol could potentially affect the status and protection of numerous wetlands across Ontario. We would recommend that a science-based approach be taken to amend the criteria for complexing and scoring to provide greater clarity and efficiencies during the evaluation process.
3.	For many species-at-risk, the greatest threat to their populations is habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. Habitat is a crucial element for the conservation of species-at-risk and includes areas that directly or indirectly support breeding and raising young, feeding, shelter and migration. The proposed changes to the OWES manual would eliminate relevant sections and will affect the score of previously evaluated wetlands. We would recommend that further analysis is needed to understand how the proposed changes to the feature scoring would affect the overall score of wetlands and impact the conservation of species-at-risk.
4.	It is not clear who the ‘decision maker’ is in this document. It also appears that MNRF will no longer administer the OWES. This raises the question as to who will maintain the provincial wetland mapping layer and store wetland evaluation records. Clear instructions are needed to ensure that information and data relevant to a wetland evaluation or re-evaluation are properly documented and filed with the appropriate agency or local municipality. Greater collaboration and improved technology transfer is likely needed to ensure that the results of existing and future wetland evaluations, including evaluated wetland mapping, remain valid, up to date and accessible to decision-makers.
5.	Through the proposed changes, municipalities will be required to take on a greater role in the administration of the OWES. Many, if not most municipalities within the Grand River watershed, may not have the staffing capacity or qualified staff capable of completing the proposed tasks. Another significant complication is that natural features do not follow municipal boundaries, leading to overlap and possible inefficiencies if municipalities are tasked with administrative requirements.
6.	Changes to the OWES could also have implications for the Conservation Land Tax Incentive Program for many landowners in the watershed.
The GRCA supports a review and update of the OWES manual to ensure that it reflects the best available science and incorporates widely accepted inventory and assessment methods. We agree there is a need to create process efficiencies in some circumstances, but this needs to be based on ecological rationale. Any changes to the technical manual should be carefully vetted by qualified experts.
To ensure efficiencies for decision makers and other users, we would also recommend that the Province continue to maintain the provincial mapping layer and database of existing and new evaluation documents. At the GRCA, we have taken a collaborative approach to share data and mapping through the Wetland Evaluation Protocol that was developed by the GRCA, MNRF and Ducks Unlimited Canada in 2005. This protocol outlines priorities and guidelines for the wetland information in the Grand River watershed. It was developed because the most important and fundamental tools for effective wetland conservation are good data and mapping.
Finally, it is recommended that additional time for consultation on this ERO posting to ensure that the Province, Conservation Authorities, and other stakeholders fully understand the potential short and long-term implications of these proposed changes.
Implications of Changes to the OWES on the Grand River watershed
The proposed changes to the OWES will have implications within the Grand River watershed, which comprises approximately 636 km2 (63,603 ha) of wetland. Less than 10% of the watershed is covered by wetlands, of which 493 km2 (78% of the total wetland area mapped by GRCA and MNRF) has been evaluated by the Province. Wetland cover varies greatly across the Grand River watershed. Within the lower middle Grand, the wetland cover is as low as 4%. In the upper Grand River sub-basin, the wetland cover can be as high as 18%.
Within the Grand River watershed, wetlands cover about 23% (53,702 hectares) of the significant groundwater recharge areas and 19% (50,483 hectares) of the high surface water runoff areas identified and mapped by the GRCA. An additional 21,189 hectares of wetland are located within the regulated floodplain areas. The majority of these wetlands are small and isolated, and, in the absence of significant wetland attributes or functions, may not be protected by provincial or local policies. Consequently, many of these wetlands could become more vulnerable to increased land-use pressures. Further wetland loss has the potential to negatively impact key hydrological functions, which help regulate water quality and water quantity and thereby protect the quality of life throughout the Grand River watershed.
The GRCA owns approximately 20,000 hectares or 48,000 acres of land within the Grand River watershed. Changes to the OWES could have implications for GRCA lands enrolled in the Conservation land Tax Incentive Program (CLTIP). Currently, 7,200 hectares of GRCA conservation lands are eligible for a tax exemption through CLTIP based on the presence of important natural features. Of that acreage, approximately 6,600 hectares are eligible based solely or in part on their designation as Provincially Significant Wetland.

71895,/comment/71895,"The proposed changes to the OWES brings the following five concerns to light.
1. Wetland complexes no longer to be recognized or considered
The OWES is the official procedure to identify PSWs and determine their boundaries, based on
a scoring system that takes into account biological, social, hydrological and special features.
Identifying wetland complexes has been integral to the evaluation and scoring process, based
on the understanding that many wetlands are interconnected with complementary biological,
social and/or hydrological functions that contribute to the health and significance of the whole
(i.e., the complex). Dividing complexes up into individual units for assessment “would not be an
ecologically or functionally sound process.” (OWES – Southern Manual, p. 39)
MNRF is proposing to no longer consider wetland complexes as part of the OWES. Yet,
wetland complexes have been a major factor in designating wetlands – especially smaller ones
– as PSWs. If MNRF proceeds with the proposed changes, very few new PSWs will be
designated in the future and many existing PSWs will lose that designation and the protection it
affords.

2. Endangered and threatened species no longer to be recognized
MNRF is proposing to no longer recognize the presence of endangered or threatened
species in the OWES process, a criterion which is a key factor in determining provincial
significance. Currently, the presence of endangered or threatened species automatically
qualifies the wetland as provincially significant. But with the proposed changes, species at
risk will be considered only as “provincially tracked species,” worth far less in the evaluation.
This major change would affect the scoring of most wetlands in Ontario, leaving many of
them, and the significant species that rely on them, vulnerable to development.
3. Provincial government oversight and coordination to be removed
MNRF is proposing to remove itself from any involvement in Ontario’s wetland evaluation
process, despite the deep and valuable expertise of ministry staff who have overseen the
process for decades. No central agency is being assigned to coordinate or approve evaluations
or to ensure that information about PSW designation is publicly accessible. Consultation with
MNRF will no longer be an option. It appears that approval authority will be downloaded to
municipalities, many of which have little expertise and would no longer be able to consult with
conservation authorities (due to proposed Bill 23 amendments to the Conservation Authorities
Act). Instead, the onus would be on the wetland evaluator (working in most cases for the
development proponent) to inform the municipality and landowners in writing about the
outcome of the evaluation or re-evaluation. MNRF would 1) be unaware of wetland evaluations
and outcomes; 2) no longer ensure wetland evaluations were accessible to the public through
Land Information Ontario; and 3) have no authority to intervene on behalf of the public
regarding an evaluation of questionable merit.
4. Timing of proposed changes
The proposed changes to the OWES are going forward at the same time as Bill 23 and other
proposed law and policy amendments that will negatively impact wetland conservation in
Ontario. The broad scope of the proposals and the speed with which they are being pushed
forward mean that public’s ability to comprehend and respond is severely compromised.
5. Inaccurate and misleading analysis of the regulatory impact on the ERO
MNRF’s description of the anticipated impacts of the OWES overhaul is misleading and far from
comprehensive. It mentions only the impacts on business which the ministry anticipates will be
positive or neutral. It says nothing whatsoever about the significant negative environmental,
social or economic impacts related to wetland loss that would arise from the changes to the
OWES system. It would appear either that MNRF has given no thought to these impacts or that
it simply does not care.
Ontario’s wetlands play a critical role in sustaining healthy communities, enhancing climate
change resilience and conserving biodiversity. Together, we must do our utmost to ensure that
MNRF does not proceed with the proposed overhaul of the OWES

land already zoned and ready for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries

I have concerns relating to: the lack of transparency and clear objectives that have led to the proposed changes; removal of references to and integration with other policies such as the Provincial Policy Statement and Conservation Authorities Act; uncertainty with respect to who will take over the oversight role at the provincial level (with MNRF entirely out of the process); the potential bias at municipalities if they are the approver; whether municipalities will have staff and expertise to review, particularly since Conservation Authorities may no longer be able to comment pending draft changes to their jurisdiction; and the removal of wetland complexes entirely, with no rationale provided (which disregards ecological knowledge and practice).

71925,/comment/71925,"The “Regulatory Impact Analysis” section states that the impacts of this proposal will be neutral/positive to businesses, but what about wetlands? What about Ontario’s natural flood mitigation and carbon sequestration system? There is so much more at stake here than business interests.
The proposed updates to OWES will make it more difficult for wetland complexes to be classified as PSWs. Many wetlands in Ontario are complicated interconnected systems made up of smaller components. These complexes of smaller components are equally as important as large stand-alone wetlands and should be considered as “the sum of their parts”, not as distinct individuals. The proposed changes to OWES would allow complexes to be split up and their components evaluated separately, which will make it more difficult for them to be classified as PSWs. This will significantly reduce the amount of PSWs in the province and open up vital wetland habitat for development.
Editing the OWES document to remove the consideration of endangered and threatened species when classifying a wetland is very concerning. Any wetland that is home to a species at risk is likely critical habitat for the survival of the species. Allowing development on SAR habitat will surely increase pressure on already vulnerable wildlife populations.
Furthermore, why is MNRF being completely removed from the process? MNRF staff have the specialized expertise required to evaluate wetlands; most municipal staff do not. Additional changes proposed in ERO 019-6141 would disallow municipalities from consulting with Conservation Authorities on matters such as this. Those with the expertise to speak out against development in sensitive natural areas should not have their voices silenced.
Please reconsider these major changes to OWES. In an era of climate uncertainty and extreme weather events we should be putting more emphasis on the value of wetlands, not less.

Furthermore, increasing the number of housing units will not bring increased affordability, what will increase affordability are measures to control the earning and investment potential of housing units. We cannot keep going at this rate, increasing the number of units will not bring the value of those units down. Neither will a guaranteed number of ""Affordable housing"", these are not affordable, I have seen the programs firsthand, and nobody I know with under 80k yearly income can afford them except investors. Look at the mean even median household income, and move from there, rent cannot be 50% of household income, most of us living here have no option but to pay that much. Where is the government that is allowing this abuse of power to take hold? As long as housing units are seen as investment properties, the affordability of both buying and renting will not decrease. We need rental cap, we need to guarantee that no housing unit is left empty within the city center.

1.	Revisions to the OWES should strengthen, not lessen protection of smaller wetlands (i.e., wetlands less than 2 hectares in size).
2.	Proposed changes to re-evaluating a single wetland unit separate from the whole functioning wetland system does not take into consideration the full function and value, and undermines the wetland. This will result in less protection.
3.	Evaluators need additional information to make informed decisions including different mapping sources and multiple site visits throughout the year.
4.	Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has been reviewing wetland evaluations for more than 40 years. It has highly trained and skilled biologists. Removing MNRF from the review and confirmation process will weaken the assessment and the evaluation results will be inconsistent.
5.	The proposed process has the potential to be biased towards shorter-term decisions without considering the longer-term environmental issues that will result in economic costs.

One resource included for your review esta price of $8000 in damages per acre of developed wetland.
I reject the push to develop these resources as the thousands of acres of land in Ontario have already met current guidelines and are approved for development. However, investors are not developing these lands.
This is not an issue that should be left to individual members of the public, investors, landowners or municipalities. an overarching knowledge of the exsisting provincial ecosystems and their interrelated watersheds is required for responsible development.

71961,/comment/71961,"I understand and support the need to build more housing in Ontario in a mix that will be accessible to, and meet the needs of, all Ontarians. However, the value of housing to Ontarians is more than just a place to sleep; it is a place to live, work, and grow supported by the amenities of a healthy community, including the critical essentials of access to clean water, local food supply, transportation, sewage and flood control, and natural spaces for recreation and leisure, the ongoing cost of which is inseparable from purchase price when determining housing affordability. Bill 23 and the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System contain alarming regulatory changes and rollbacks that will further the destruction of critical natural areas in a time of climate crisis, while also failing to deliver the urban transformation – or the affordable housing – that Ontario needs.
Approving housing development in areas currently recognized as provincially and locally significant wetlands would subject not only the new housing units but existing housing in nearby areas to frequent flood risk and climate change related disaster mitigation costs. Wetlands provide many critical water management services naturally and without added cost or active management. A short list of these vital services includes: providing a home to wetland dependent species, which form a part of every food chain or food pyramid that underpin local and global food supplies; provide flood control by absorbing the vast volume of water that can be suddenly released from rainfall or snowmelt; prevent erosion of streambanks and roadsides by slowing down the velocity of this flash flood rainfall; filter out all manner of materials, from large debris to excess nutrients, that flow in with dirty water from parking lots and hard surfaces, providing an outflow water that is remarkably clean; cool the water as it seeps underground before being released downstream, which supports life better than warm water (high oxygen levels and no algae); recharge groundwater supply, thus ensuring wells don’t have to be drilled deeper and deeper; provide carbon sequestration, production of oxygen, and production of biomass equivalent to that provided by rainforests, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change; attract human users who pay into local economies to enjoy the benefits of hunting, fishing, birdwatching, paddling, and to do nature photography; and provide cultural, historical, and aesthetic value to our society that nurture both our physical and spiritual needs.
The proposed updates to the OWES remove most of the detailed technical guidelines that are necessary for the OWES to function as a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation system. The updates are furthermore destructive to the continued existence of wetlands in Ontario and the safety of housing in adjacent areas in three major ways: (1) some scoring criteria, such as the Special Features category, the ability to group wetlands into complexes, and the ability to identify locally significant wetlands have been removed from the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, yet wetlands must still meet the same score to be considered provincially significant. This makes it much harder for wetlands to reach provincially significant wetland status, meaning many of the wetlands have the potential to be slated for development despite no material changes in their importance as natural features in the landscape. (2) shifting of oversight and authority for wetland evaluations from arm's length agencies with an objective view to the parties most interested in wetland destruction. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has been responsible for ensuring that OWES evaluations are completed by trained professionals, including providing training and certification in the OWES method and maintaining the records about each evaluated wetland. Responsibility for use of the OWES appears to be downloaded to municipalities, which lack the resources and experience to run OWES training courses and validate evaluation files, lack the funds to cover the associated costs, and lack the knowledge and coordination to make determinations where wetlands cross municipal boundaries. This also represents a very real conflict of interests for municipalities who will simultaneously be responsible for planning development and for protecting natural resources that limit development. Furthermore, the wetland evaluator will only be accountable for the objectivity and accuracy of the wetland evaluation to the person paying for it, meaning that a property owner or developer seeking to remove a significant wetland designation will be the only authority determining if the wetland evaluation is valid. (3) the introduction of ""re-evaluations"" will permit already-evaluated Provincially Significant Wetlands to be re-classified using the new scoring system with its degraded criteria. OWES files have always been considered open and subject to updates, but the addition of a ""Wetland Re-evaluations and Mapping Updates"" section lays the groundwork for sweeping reviews of already evaluated wetlands regardless of whether there has been any notable change in their conditions. This is an obvious contemplation of applying the newly deteriorated criteria to strip protected status from wetlands that would previously have been preserved from development.
It takes generations for wetlands to become viable, sustainable, and ecological communities. The removal of or damage to wetlands is not easily reversible, cannot be effectively mitigated through ""offsetting"" or replacement programs, and many species may not be able to recover from the loss. With wetland loss rates already sustained in excess of 85% in many areas of southern Ontario (DUC. 2010. Southern Ontario Wetland Conversion Analysis), any changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System that would result in a further loss of protected wetland area would be a fiduciary breach of duty on the part of the provincial government for all of Ontario's current and future residents.  As identified in the OWES, ""As a steward of Ontario’s natural resources, one of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s (MNRF) mandates is the protection and sustainable management of the province’s natural heritage features, including wetlands."" This proposal represents, at the least, a highly irresponsible and incautiously injurious attempt to speed housing development and, at the worst, deliberate negligence of the role of steward of Ontario's natural resources quoted above, to the short-term profit of developers at the long-term expense of the public. The proposal should be rejected.

-	Given that boundary changes will be allowed after a wetland has been accepted, this could lead to a situation where unauthorized and unpermitted changes to wetlands lead to a reduction in their size or loss over time to facilitate growth in areas that would have been otherwise protected.

71980,/comment/71980,"I oppose the implementation of Bill 23 provisions that will significantly affect how wetlands are evaluated and considered for development in the future. This is a step backwards for the protection of these naturels areas  and the prevention of future climate impacts .
The proposed changes will allow wetland units that are part of a Provincially Significant Wetland complex to be re-evaluated individually. Those units can be removed from the Provincially Significant Wetland. This leaves it up to consultants, hired by developers, to recommend if wetlands should lose protected status. Wetland boundaries could be remapped without having to re-evaluate the entire wetland. OMNRF is removed from the process, leaving all decisions in the hands of local municipalities where there may be little or no wetland expertise.
Conservation Authorities (CA’s) will be prohibited from being contracted by municipalities to comment on Acts, including the Planning Act. Most egregiously,
Endangered and Threatened species will no longer contribute to scoring as a Provincially significant .  The presence of Species at Risk or their critical habitats must continue to be part of the criterion for assessing if a wetland is significant or not.
Conservation Authorities (CA’s) must tell the government which lands they own that would be suitable for housing. This is completely contrary to the reason for establishing and protecting these areas for the natural benefits they provide as well as their intrinsic value for local peoples and all communities in Ontario.
No additional permits seem to be needed if Planning Act authorization obtained, and new tools are proposed for the government to force CA’s to issue permits whether or not development meets environmental policies and environmental best practices.
Developers will be able to  carve pieces out of protected wetlands and flood other areas to “compensate” the damage.  As a former environmental practitioner I am aware of the challenges associated with ensuring these compensated  places are actually managed in a long term way as to achieve the same goals as the areas they replace . This is by no means an assured means to replace naturally functioning significant wetlands .
Wetlands are nature’s sponge and help to protect areas downstream (like my own City of Thunder Bay) from flooding. Wetlands help to filter and improve water quality and they are critical as carbon sinks with their abundant vegetation. They remove carbon dioxide from the air and store it. If they are ditched and drained during development all that stored carbon dioxide and methane is released making climate change worse.
While I understand there is a need for increased  and affordable housing I do not believe it should be at the expense of giving up the abundant natural capital that our wetlands provide .  The regulations should be amène des to ensure that conservation authorities and OMNRF  and their experts continue to provide input into  planning decisions that balance the need to protect and maintain these areas where necessary and for the benefit of all the species these wetlands hold, and allow their continued natural functions such  as flood protection.

71989,/comment/71989,"Wetlands are critically important in helping to conserve and purify water for a healthy ecosystem, providing essential habitat for diverse species and ensuring that Ontario's natural heritage is protected for future generations.   As such, I'm very concerned with any new legislation that would lead to the loss of wetlands for more costly urban development and urban sprawl.
I share the criticisms of the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System that are being expressed by Conservation Authorities, leading conservation and environmental organizations and hydrologists.
The proposed changes will invariably lead to more wetlands being designated as not provincially significant, weakening the protection for these wetlands.   I'm also worried about the proposed removal of wetland complexing.  Currently, certain areas like bogs and marshes are considered as wetland complexes, which is consistent with sound watershed planning.
In contrast, unfortunately, the new legislation would evaluate individual small wetlands separately. There is a real danger that many of them would no longer qualify as protected wetlands.  It is especially problematic in that the threshold for significance remains the same, so an individual wetland must attain the same score as the much larger wetland complex to remain significant. That will be almost impossible, considering that the score for threatened and endangered species will be eliminated.
I'm also disappointed and surprised with a proposal that the Province evidently won't have a role in reviewing or approving wetland evaluations.  In fact, the Province will no longer keep wetland evaluation files or maintain significant wetland mapping.  Nor will it provide information for use in wetland evaluations.  This isn't any time for the Province to shirk its responsibilities for environmental leadership!
The proposed changes appear to delegate all wetland evaluation to local planning authorities such as municipalities.   This is the wrong way to go for two reasons:  first, the municipalities are not being given the authority to review and approve wetland evaluations; second, municipalities certainly may not have the technical capacity or capabilities to take on the task.
In another misguided concept, the wetland evaluator would only be accountable for the objectivity and accuracy of the wetland evaluation to the person paying for it. That is definitely a non-starter in my view.
Finally, I disagree with any changes that would result in the Province removing protections for provincially significant wetlands from the Provincial Policy Statement, in favour of some sort of wetland ""offsetting"" policy which is a highly controversial approach more often than not.
There is little doubt that if the changes are implemented, Ontario will be left with a fragmented and piecemeal approach to wetland assessment, with an inevitable further loss of wetlands.
I urge the Province to listen to the concerns being expressed by Conservation Authorities and many others.  Please reconsider these ill-advised proposals, which should not be fast-tracked. At the very least, I urge the Province to pause these proposals to allow time for much more detailed analysis and informed discussion.

72021,/comment/72021,"The following are my concerns about the proposed OWES changes.
1. Wetland complexes no longer to be recognized or considered.
The OWES is the official procedure to identify PSWs and determine their boundaries, based on a scoring system that takes into account biological, social, hydrological and special features. Identifying wetland complexes has been integral to the evaluation and scoring process, based on the understanding that many wetlands are interconnected with complementary biological, social and/or hydrological functions that contribute to the health and significance of the whole (i.e., the complex). Dividing complexes up into individual units for assessment “would not be an ecologically or functionally sound process.” (OWES – Southern Manual, p. 39)MNRF is proposing to no longer consider wetland complexes as part of the OWES. Yet, wetland complexes have been a major factor in designating wetlands – especially smaller ones – as PSWs. If MNRF proceeds with the proposed changes, very few new PSWs will be designated in the future and many existing PSWs will lose that designation and the protection it affords.
2. Endangered and threatened species no longer to be recognized.
MNRF is proposing to no longer recognize the presence of endangered or threatened species in the OWES process, a criterion which is a key factor in determining provincial significance. Currently, the presence of endangered or threatened species automatically qualifies the wetland as provincially significant. But with the proposed changes, species at risk will be considered only as “provincially tracked species,” worth far less in the evaluation. This major change would affect the scoring of most wetlands in Ontario, leaving many of them, and the significant species that rely on them, vulnerable to development.
3.Provincial government oversight and coordination to be removed.
MNRF is proposing to remove itself from any involvement in Ontario’s wetland evaluation process, despite the deep and valuable expertise of ministry staff who have overseen the process for decades. No central agency is being assigned to coordinate or approve evaluations or to ensure that information about PSW designation is publicly accessible. Consultation with MNRF will no longer be an option. It appears that approval authority will be downloaded to municipalities, many of which have little expertise and would no longer be able to consult with conservation authorities (due to proposed Bill 23 amendments to the Conservation Authorities Act). Instead, the onus would be on the wetland evaluator (working in most cases for the development proponent) to inform the municipality and landowners in writing about the outcome of the evaluation or re-evaluation. MNRF would 1) be unaware of wetland evaluations and outcomes; 2) no longer ensure wetland evaluations were accessible to the public through Land Information Ontario; and 3) have no authority to intervene on behalf of the public regarding an evaluation of questionable merit.
4.Timing of proposed changes.
The proposed changes to the OWES are going forward at the same time as Bill 23 and other proposed law and policy amendments that will negatively impact wetland conservation in Ontario. The broad scope of the proposals and the speed with which they are being pushed forward mean that public’s ability to comprehend and respond is severely compromised.
5. Inaccurate and misleading analysis of the regulatory impact on the EROMNRF’s description of the anticipated impacts of the OWES overhaul is misleading and far from comprehensive. It mentions only the impacts on business which the ministry anticipates will be positive or neutral. It says nothing whatsoever about the significant negative environmental, social or economic impacts related to wetland loss that would arise from the changes to the OWES system. It would appear either that MNRF has given no thought to these impacts or that it simply does not care.
As a Environmental Technician student that is graduating in less than a month, this is devastating for my future career. As a student, I have spent years learning about how important areas like wetlands are and how we need to protect them. This proposal is absolutely terrible and extremely harmful to the environment that we should be protecting most. Endangered species need to be protected. The extinction of species is very serious, and we are on the brink of many going extinct. This proposal will directly add to the long list of endangered and extinct species. This proposal is very ethically unsound.

72033,/comment/72033,"According to scientific knowledge and personal experience, wetlands provide a variety of unique ecosystem services, including fish and wildlife habitat, climate change mitigation through carbon storage, water filtration, recreational and spiritual significance as well as flood mitigation, among others. I do not believe that the proposed changes to the OWES (combined with the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan) will benefit housing construction through the destruction of precious habitats. There should be better ways to tackle the housing problem, e.g. how (corporate) landlords affect the housing market.
1. It is important for wetland evaluations to be reviewed by arm’s-length agencies with an objective view. Considering that many wetlands cross municipal boundaries, if these same municipalities are responsible for development, as well as preserving natural heritage like wetlands, where do they find the balance and how will the different municipalities determine the level of importance for the wetland?
2. Many wetlands are grouped together and function in complexes but the proposed legislation changes will no longer allow wetlands to be grouped together, treating each wetland as its own entity. Smaller wetlands will most likely not meet the criteria to be provincially significant, and may be open for development. One example is the Lower Duffins Creek Wetland Complex in Pickering.
3. If the ""Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species"" and ""Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species"" sections get scrapped, these wetlands that provide such critical habitat for species at risk will become harder to score and hold provincially significant status.
4. I've also recently learned that while Canada has control over about 25% of the world’s wetlands (350,000 km2 of wetlands in Ontario), the province of Ontario destroys these habitats faster than anyone else. In fact, 68% of the wetlands originally present in southern Ontario were lost by the early 1980s...
Through an understanding and appreciation of our wetlands, we should become leaders in the preservation/conservation of these critical habitats.

72037,/comment/72037,"While several concerning changes have been proposed to the OWES, the two most striking are 1) the removal of government oversight or availability for consultation, and 2) the removal of wetland complexes.
In the revised OWES, most, if not all, text has been removed that refers the evaluator to the MNRF and/or MECP. The previous version encouraged the evaluator to contact these Ministries if they had any questions or uncertainties about an evaluation. By removing this text, it can be assumed that evaluators no longer have the option to discuss OWES with said Ministries. If that is the case, then there is no longer an avenue for consultation between evaluators and the provincial government. Evaluators would no longer be able to ask questions or receive guidance on difficult to assess wetlands. There would be no avenue for communication between those who evaluate the wetlands and those who regulate them.
The removal of any language about wetland complexes is the most concerning change to the OWES. The concept of a wetland complex reflects a common feature in landscapes. Often a large area of a landscape functions as a wetland, even though it consists of a mosaic of wetland and more upland areas. The previous version of the OWES considered units within 750 m of each other to be part of the same wetland complex. The revised OWES has lowered that distance to 30 m. This can be expected to decrease the area of a wetland complex, allowing for the re-evaluation of individual wetland units as stand-alone wetlands. An individual unit may not provide the same function as the wetland complex as a whole, and will likely be assessed as having lower significance than it otherwise would. In other words, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. These changes to the criteria for wetland complexes are inaccurate, and ignore the reality of wetland hydrology and function.
The purpose of revising a protocol is to improve upon it. The proposed changes to the OWES will make it less accurate, less reflective of reality, and lead to the degradation of Ontario’s wetlands. It is clear that the proposed changes are not based on science.

We live in a time where we have plenty of research and real-life examples of solutions to provide housing to our growing population (e.g., solutions for combating urbanization, etc). We know how to provide homes without increasing sprawl. We also know that 1 in 10 species live in wetlands, and wetland species are THE MOST threatened species as seen with countless consequences of mismanagement and poor infrastructure planning. We do not need more Acts to continue building houses, we need more Acts to continue protecting wetland habitats.

There are a lot of changes in this document. This is what I would like to ensure our elected representatives keep in mind for any kind of development around our wetlands, green spaces, and farmlands. Wetlands provide recharge for our water in our wells. Wetlands provide home and food for a variety of flora and fauna. They like to have their privacy and do not want a whole bunch of human made noise around their homes. All LIFE is INTRICATELY CONNECTED and these precious habitats, flora and fauna species provide our communities of today and tomorrow with many things we have yet to understand. I would ask my elected representatives and government service workers to carefully keep in mind that our own survival depends on our human family co-flourishing with our habitats, flora, and fauna. We can only truly flourish, live in health, when all life around us does also. I appreciate that we need homes, let's build them in the built up areas that already have the schools, hospitals, parks, businesses, and public transit in place to serve them. Let's not pave over paradise. Let's have respect for the many species that share this planet with us.

Wetlands are under increasing threat of destruction due to pressures of development. This threat is primarily brought to bear by land speculators and developers.
In considering the importance of wetlands in a healthy ecosystem, we must take a long term view. The majority of wetlands in southern Ontario have been destroyed. They contribute a critical role in flood control, filtering and cleansing of surface water, recharge of ground water supplies and they provide habitat for many animal and plant species.
This proposal, which would facilitate significantly more wetland destruction, is extremely damaging.  It is short sighted and does not consider wetlands in their entirety.

72093,/comment/72093,"The proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System undermine the purpose of this policy in a number of key ways that must be addressed. MNRF oversight should not be removed from the OWES process so that there is sufficient expertise as part of the evaluation process. Moving the OWES process to municipalities will further undermine the process, as many do not have the appropriate resources or expertise. If the coordination of OWES must be moved away from MNRF, then it could be moved under the jurisdiction of Conservation Authorities to streamline the process and better support watershed management.
The proposal to remove counting threatened and endangered species in the OWES 'Special Features' category should be removed. We are experiencing a biodiversity crisis, and wetlands provide habitat for hundreds of species at risk in Ontario. This should be counted in their OWES score. The proposal to remove wetland complexing should also be removed to allow interconnected wetlands to be evaluated together based on the best science.

72097,/comment/72097,"The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) should be kept and strengthened as it is science-based and gives a standardized approach to assessing wetlands.  Most Wetlands in the Niagara area are complexes and most would no longer be classified as significant wetlands at all after the proposed changes to the system.  Destroying the smaller wetlands in a complex would lead to others being degraded.
Wetlands should be evaluated with consideration of their function in providing critical habitat for species at risk and for wildlife and migration habitat for all species.
Wetlands are natural assets which provide many benefits to the people in a watershed such as flood mitigation and water purification, carbon sequestering, ground water recharge and erosion control.  There is enough land in Ontario on which to build homes without paving over wetlands.
A central agency, preferably the MNRF, is needed to oversee and coordinate wetland evaluation and information.  Municipalities do not always have staff trained to do this and there does not seem to be a comprehensive method in the new guidelines for the information to be stored and accessed.

Any attempt to ""speed up"" assessment and remove protections is folly given the wide variety of ecosystem services that wetlands provide. They are important in cleaning our water and precventing floods as well as providing homes for numerous endangered species. We cannot only protect isolated ""significant"" wetlands but rather we need to instead maintain a network of wetlands , both small and large, to maintain connectivity for ground and surface water movement and corridors for species to move between different habitats. These features appear to be lost in the current changes and there is a great potential that even when we protect large wetlands they will become further degraded due to this loos of connectivity. Please reconsider.

72110,/comment/72110,"The proposed revisions to the Wetland Evaluation System include three major changes, all of which will result in a loss of protections on wetlands.
The first proposed change is to remove the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry from playing a role in coordinating and reviewing wetland evaluations.  Perhaps that is inevitable, given the years of funding cuts to that Ministry, leaving them with insufficient staff to manage their workload.  I certainly recognize that proponent-driven evaluations exist in other areas of land development, which put a similar onus on the professionals developing the evaluations, with limited government oversight.  In those cases however, there typically are professional accreditations such as P.Eng, RPF or CPA to ensure the work is done by a person with sufficient technical qualifications, and who has passed an ethics exam, to ensure that they will be acting in the public interest.  If the Province wishes to move in a similar direction for wetland evaluations, then Ontario should be adopting a Registered Professional Biologist, or similar program.
The second change is the proposal removal of the section which provides points in the evaluation for Species at Risk.  The proposal document correctly identifies that SAR are also addressed in the section which provides points for species considered Provincially Significant, however those features only receive a score of 50 points per species, as compared to 250 points per Species At Risk.  As you are well aware, this effectively down-weights the importance of SAR. There is absolutely no excuse for this approach.  By my estimate one-fifth of the species on the SARO list are wetland-dependent or wetland-obligate.  Ontario has rightly been criticized in the past for their inaction in protecting species at risk; this proposal will actively reduce habitat for these species.
The third proposal is to remove the section which addressees the complexing of wetland habitats.  The importance of wetlands near to or adjacent to other wetlands has been well established (e.g. Conservation Biology 12:749-758; Ecological Applications 25: 812-825 to give just two examples). Conversely the proposal to remove complexing comes with no scientific justification what so ever.
Together, its hard to read these three proposals as anything other than a cynical attempt to remove wetlands from the landscape.  While I have no particular faith that this government has any interest in hearing the viewpoint of the electorate, I am taking advantage of the opportunity provided by the ERO to tell you that you should be ashamed of yourselves.  Being a Conservative did not used to be synonymous with making bad decisions.  Under the current government, it now certainly appears to.
If nothing else, I hope that this and similar feedback through the public consultation session gives you a sense of how much public support you have lost recently because of Bill 23, and make you think twice about what this Bill will do for the future of the party in Ontario.

72123,/comment/72123,"I don't agree with these proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. I do not believe the government should be forcing municipalities to adjust to this workload and restructuring at their expense. I believe conservation authorities should keep their roles in maintaining wetlands, classifying them, and restricting land use.
Wetlands are vital. Full stop. They need space to flourish, protection, and proper care. They protect us from flooding, drought, and climate change. They protect wildlife by providing hundreds of species with safe places to eat, sleep and raise young. They also clean the water we enjoy at beaches, lakes, and rivers.
Here I thought the Conservative government understood the importance of economic value. Wetlands provide an estimated $4.2 billion worth of sediment and phosphorus filtration each year, helping to keep our drinking water, lakes, and rivers clean in Southern Ontario (source 1). Building near, on, or destroying wetlands does nothing but hurt the production value of the land. You're going to have a healthier environment to flourish around if work is done alongside our current and future ecosystems.
Converting more land edge by edge only restricts and destroys the value of this province. Ontario is a part of an incredibly unique landscape, offering homes to literally millions of organisms.
There's a right way and a wrong way to do just about anything. This is one of the wrong ways. The transition to awarding all the responsibility to municipalities needs to be better supported. I should never, ever want to see a crucial downfall being the expense of others.
I completely agree with the Ontario Conservation Authorities' statements in regard to Bill 23 (source 2):
- Allow municipalities to enter into agreements with conservation authorities for review and comment on development applications such as natural heritage and water resources plan review.
- Development subject to Planning Act authorizations should not be exempt from requiring a conservation authority permit and conservation authority regulations should not be delegated to municipalities.
- The Multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group needs to continue working with the Province to provide advice and solutions for successful implementation.
- Conservation authority development fees should not be frozen since they are based on cost recovery.
- Careful consideration is required when identifying conservation authority lands to support housing development.
Systems can be updated and adjusted as our needs do, however, these changes impact too negatively to support.

72133,/comment/72133,"I am writing to express my concerns related to the proposed changes to Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. I will also be commenting on the “Proposed Updates to the regulation of Development for the Protection of People and Property from Natural Hazards in Ontario” and “Legislative and Regulatory Proposals Affecting Conservation Authorities to Support the Housing Supply Action Plan 3.0” documents. As all three consultations are closely linked, I will be cross posting my comments. I fear that the proposed changes will dramatically weaken protections for Ontario’s natural heritage, including wetlands. As a landowner in southwestern Ontario with property that includes designated provincially significant wetlands, I am dismayed to consider the potential outcomes if these changes are implemented. Natural features provide many significant benefits for human and wildlife populations in Ontario. As we experience the dual global crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, it is extremely upsetting to see the Ontario government pursuing an approach that will further deteriorate remaining habitats in Ontario. These features provide important ecological services to our population such as absorbing flood flows, improving water quality, reducing heat islands, mitigating droughts and protecting land and property. In the long-run, these changes will bring significant additional costs to the citizens of Ontario. Moving forward with these changes while Canada has committed to goals of protecting our biodiversity (25 % protected land by 2025 and 30 % by 2030) and will be hosting an international biodiversity conference (COP15 in Montreal) in December, casts a large shadow over what should be an opportunity to demonstrate positive leadership in protecting natural heritage.
The timelines for comment associated with these legislative changes (including several other related postings that I am unable to review in time) is completely insufficient. The scope and scale of these changes will forever alter the landscape and imperil species at risk in the province. More comprehensive consultations with the public are required before moving forward. Furthermore, it is unclear what efforts have been made by Ontario to uphold its constitutional obligation to the Duty to Consult with Indigenous Nations that will be impacted by these changes. Given the significance of the proposals, it is clear that a consultation at the high-end of the spectrum with impacted Nations is required, including agreement with the proposals and accommodations for the loss of habitats, wildlife and opportunities to exercise their rights and interests.
Some of my key concerns include:
1.	Elimination of provincial administrative role in the OWES
The proposed changes appear to make municipalities responsible for overseeing and approving Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) assessments completed within their jurisdictions. It is unclear how municipalities could be expected to have the expertise to take on that role. Particularly given that companion legislation forbids municipalities from entering into agreements with Conservation Authorities to provide support in the planning process. Despite downloading these powers, the provincial government is simultaneously overruling municipal decisions that seek to protect Ontario’s natural heritage (such as an imposed expansion of the City of Hamilton’s urban boundary and modifications to the Greenbelt boundary).
It is clear through these changes that the intent is not to have a streamlined wetland evaluation process but rather to create a process where the determination of wetlands is at the discretion of the development community and disempowered municipalities without the resources or knowledge to appropriately assess submissions. These inconsistencies all skew towards empowering the development community at the cost of sound planning and natural heritage.
The changes also eliminate the use of wetland evaluations for anything beyond land use planning i.e. development purposes. Wetlands in this context are framed only as impediments to construction without any consideration of how these important features are serving the community. These data are critical for strategically assessing habitat requirements for wildlife, source water protection objectives, flood benefits, academic research, and more.
2.	Removal of provincial support to wetland evaluators
Many of the proposed changes to the OWES involve deletions of references to MNR(F), existing government databases of information, Conservation Authorities, and other knowledgeable entities. Ontario appears to not only be giving wetland evaluators free reign to determine wetland significance but also removing as many tools as possible to help these evaluators in the process. One can only assume this is being done to downsize or eliminate any role for the MNRF in land planning in Ontario and to prevent knowledge transfer concerning wetland features that may enhance wetland scores.
3.	Dramatically reducing consideration of wetland complexes
The proposal removes all reference to wetland complexes and considers linkages between wetlands a maximum of 30 m apart only (vs. existing 750 m). This approach allows portions of wetland complexes to be evaluated as individual units, resulting in lower scores and less protection. This approach ignores wetland science including the important hydraulic and hydrogeologic connections between wetlands over significant distances. The inevitable removal of protection for one portion of a wetland complex will degrade the remaining elements, further reducing wetland habitat in Ontario.
4.	No stand-alone consideration of threatened and endangered species in scoring
The changes remove significant weighting (up to 250 points / threatened or endangered species) from OWES. This move alone will eliminate the provincially significant wetland (PSW) status from many important habitats for species at risk in Ontario. This has huge negative impacts for species at risk in particular but also wetlands generally. By removing scoring opportunities and reducing scores in other areas while maintaining the same threshold score (600), the definition of provincially significant has been completely altered. The validity of the evaluation process is eliminated with these haphazard modifications.
5.	Elimination of the ability for municipalities and Conservation Authorities to consider Local or Regionally Significant Wetlands
Local and regionally significant wetlands are eliminated from consideration under this proposal. These designations account for local factors unique to specific regions within the province and represent a significant proportion of status wetlands currently in the province. These wetlands perform many of the same ecological services as larger PSWs and are often more accessible for communities. They are also important stopovers for migrating birds and local wildlife. Together with other proposed changes, the vast majority of wetlands in Ontario will go from being protected to having no status.
6.	Eliminating portions of the Greenbelt with no consideration of the regional impacts of these changes
The Greenbelt established in southern Ontario has become a treasured part of the landscape. The expectation by the population is that these lands will be protected in perpetuity from development and the whims of future governments. The Conservative government had made promises not to develop these lands and must not go back on this promise.
7.	Ignoring government commissioned reports related to housing development and flood protection
The population of Ontario is growing and there are significant challenges associated with this growth. Rather than address these issues in a comprehensive way, the provincial government is ignoring even their own commissioned experts (Report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force, Feb 2022) to vastly increase sprawl without implementing sufficient measures to enhance densification within existing urban areas of the province. Similarly, the government’s assault on Conservation Authorities runs counter to a commissioned report that indicated that these agencies need to be strengthened and enhanced and collaborate with municipalities to conserve natural features that help reduce flooding (Ontario’s Special Advisor on Flooding Report to Government, 2019). Complaints about Conservation Authorities concerning timelines for review and old floodplain mapping are a direct result of significant financial cuts to the budgets of these organizations by subsequent Conservative governments. It is essential that the government listen to their advisors, consult extensively, and move forward in a measured and deliberate way that considers both housing needs and our natural treasures.
Conclusion
Previous governments, Conservation Authorities, citizen groups and individuals have spent decades working to protect and enhance Ontario’s natural heritage.  Having lived in other provinces over the years, I have always been proud of the efforts that Ontario has made to protect wetlands and other sensitive habitats. Recognizing that it is not perfect and there is always more work to be done, I have been struck by the positive benefits of the Conservation Authority model and recommended its adoption elsewhere. While other provinces take tentative steps in that direction, it is deeply discouraging to see these entities being dismantled. Once habitats lose their status and are developed, they are lost forever to the detriment of wildlife and human populations.
It is unacceptable for the provincial government to make such drastic changes to the rules of development in Ontario with a simple thirty day posting on a website. I, as well as many friends, family and acquaintances are shocked when we find out about these proposals but most people are not even aware this is happening. It is incumbent on the government to take a step back and institute a more comprehensive consultation process, with the population as a whole and in particular with impacted Indigenous communities.

I have observed that many wetlands and forests in our area are sacrificed to the construction of single-family dwellings and farming. (Eastern Ontario).
Should municipalities have the ability to reassess wetlands and their boundaries without the supervision of the Wetland Evaluation Technical Team (WETT), the Southern Wetlands Evaluation Review Committee and the Provincial Wetlands Working Group?
I think not.
Cities evaluate progress by their expansion; cities  do urgently need affordable housing (well built and near community services) but not at the cost of our natural resources.
Wetlands must be protected for the survival of all its flora and fauna. How we treat these areas determine the quality of all living creatures including humans.

72159,/comment/72159,"As an Ontario citizen and voter I am writing this to express my opposition to the provincial government’s proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES). I am a Biologist and Ecologist and deal daily with field data that contributes to wetland characterization (and to OWES evaluations) and with conservation/protection issues involving wetlands. I am very familiar with the OWES system for southern Ontario.
While it can be a useful exercise to periodically examine a program like OWES to ask where improvements might be achieved, I find the proposed changes misguided as they seem to be at cross-purposes with the intention of OWES, that is, to protect wetlands and thereby, their functions.
Unfortunately, the provincial government has the misconception that the OWES program is holding up the construction of affordable homes in southern Ontario. The OWES program is NOT a barrier to Ontario’s housing affordability crisis. In truth, OWES functions as intended, protecting important wetlands - parts of our valuable natural infrastructure that protects citizens from flooding, erosion and maintains our water quality - from destruction. Yes, OWES does stand as a barrier to dangerous development that would threaten our environmental health, the ecosystem services we enjoy and consequently our personal health and well-being. But OWES is not a barrier to good development.
To date, wetlands in southern Ontario are well-defined, their locations are known and are clearly mapped. The OWES process for evaluating wetlands and designating the most significant ones at a provincial scale and has been arrived at thoughtfully, through the contributions of many biology, ecology, conservation and planning professionals, with the good of Ontarians in mind. The OWES designation of provincially significant wetlands (PSWs) is transparent. If prospective developers respect these features and our Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) directing that PSWs are protected and may not be developed, their development applications would speed along as they wish. It is only when developers motivated by profits and greed want to contravene the rules set out in the PPS and damage or eliminate wetlands that applications are held up. There is plenty of land for development (outside of the Greenbelt, for that matter) and there are so few wetlands remaining on the landscape (due to massive losses over the last 100 years) that properly planned development, honestly planned to benefit society and conducted in conjunction with the public’s wish to protect our natural heritage, would be easy.
 There are several aspects of the proposed changes to OWES that are particularly problematic:
•	The proposed removal of MNRF from dealing with OWES is short-sighted.
o	Since PSWs are features protected under the PPS there must be a single provincial authority that oversees and maintains the system.
o	Mapping of PSWs must be maintained as a single authoritative layer and overseen by a single responsible body so they are not question able or debatable.
o	The status of wetlands under the PPS cannot be left to ad hoc decisions by individual municipalities (most of whom lack expertise).
o	There is still wetland field work that needs to be done as all wetlands are not evaluated and this work must be done to a consistent and high standard upheld by a provincial authority like MNRF.
o	Older mapping and evaluations will eventually require updates, held to the provincial standard.
o	While there are many trained and certified wetland evaluators currently, they are not going to live forever so new evaluators must be trained and their training must be standardized, because again, PSWs are protected by provincial policy.
o	MNRF has built a substantial body of knowledge and experience on wetlands in Ontario and to suddenly remove them from that portfolio is wasteful.
•	The proposal to stop recognizing wetland complexes is highly mis-guided.
o	In many cases, clusters of wetlands are hydrologically connected (through the water table) and work together as a whole. These clusters of wetlands are called a complex. This is science-based knowledge.
o	When one part of the complex is damaged or removed (e.g., paved over or drained) the whole wetland is impaired. It may no longer be able to absorb flood waters or runoff, or filter surface water. An impaired wetland’s biodiversity may be reduced so it is no longer resilient to disturbance (like climate change or urbanization) and it may no longer be able to cool air temperatures, or participate fully in the water cycle, or provide health and wellness benefits to neighbourhood residents.
o	The proposal to stop recognizing wetland complexes is akin to removing half of a dam across a river – half a dam just doesn’t do its job.
o	Wetlands of a complex work together, that’s just they way they are, regardless of whether developers like it or not.
•	The proposal to remove Species at Risk (SAR) from the scoring scheme in wetland evaluations fails to reflect the true ecological value of wetlands and undermines protection of Species at Risk under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act (ESA).
o	To protect wetland Species at Risk under the ESA, their wetland habitat must be protected.
o	Modern ecological knowledge has moved far beyond the simple protection of individual SAR bodies, and now understands that habitat protection is essential.
o	If wetland habitat of SAR is not protected, then the ESA will fail.
o	SAR should remain in the PSW scoring scheme.
•	Downloading decision-making on wetlands to municipalities puts an unreasonable burden on municipalities and taxpayers.
o	Almost no municipalities (especially lower tier municipalities) have the expertise to handle decision-making around wetlands and PSW assessments.
o	Municipal staff already have heavy workloads and to require them to take on additional responsibilities around wetlands and whether wetlands qualify as PSWs or not is unreasonable. This is particularly unfair when municipalities don’t have existing ecological expertise or experience.
o	If municipalities purchase expertise (through hiring additional expert staff or through consultant contracts) taxpayers will ultimately bear the costs of development (rather than the developers be paying for their wetland-related arguments).
o	If municipalities (especially small municipalities) cannot afford to purchase expertise and need to handle the additional workload in-house, then development applications will clearly take much longer to process as staff try to acquire new knowledge and as development applications with wetland issues wait in line behind other municipal business.
o	The bottom line is, if municipalities are given more work to do, that extra work will be slower, not faster. This is obviously not the way to get affordable housing built faster.
Given the above substantial problems with the proposal to change OWES, I urge the provincial government to withdraw the proposal to change OWES from Bill 23.
If this government truly wants to decrease processing time for development applications then it should instead, provide more support to MNRF and better funding of the OWES program. This would allow staff to fill in evaluation gaps, update mapping and older evaluations, complete complexing exercises to better reflect the functions of wetlands and bring wetland concepts in line with current scientific knowledge, train more evaluators and respond in a timely fashion to questions about OWES from practitioners.
If MNRF involvement with OWES is too much of a burden then this government might consider strengthening the long-standing working relationship between MNRF and Conservation Authorities (CAs), who have worked together to protect wetlands since the inception of OWES. CA staff have plenty of field and OWES expertise developed in concert with MNRF over the years and have a good understanding of wetlands and hydrology in their jurisdictions. CAs also have high work standards, excellent mapping capabilities and strong relationships with their municipalities. CAs have good networks that can be successful at streamlining development processes while protecting environment.

72161,/comment/72161,"The proposed changes to OWES are frightening. Allowing basically anyone to make changes to Ontario’s wetland mapping with no oversight by trained, qualified individuals is reckless and will leave MANY wetlands open for active destruction. I can tell you firsthand that myself and colleagues have reviewed many flawed wetland mapping/evaluations to the benefit of those looking to destroy wetlands for development and the almighty dollar. Leaving wetland delineation up to whoever has the deepest pockets will leave future generations with a slew of issues to contend with including loss of biodiversity, flooding, increased climate change impacts and reduced opportunities for outdoor recreation, to name a few.
There is no need to cut the current OWES program as many wetlands, particularly within southern Ontario, have already been evaluated and further “revisions” to these evaluated wetlands will only benefit those looking to make a buck. Any good, worthwhile, scientific reporting is peer reviewed and scrutinized for inaccuracies. MNRF must continue to oversee and review wetland evaluations to protect our wetlands and Ontario’s future.

Reports show that there is enough land available now for development without infringing on the green belt and wetlands.  The issue is affordable housing, not urban sprawl.

72168,/comment/72168,"I am deeply concerned by the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System documents and policies. As a Master of Social Work with a specialization in policy analysis and development, my professional opinion is that the proposed edits I have just reviewed will have deep negative impacts on the Evaluation System's scientific validity & its usefulness in protecting wilderness areas essential for the long-term habitability of Ontario.
Just a few of my concerns include:
a) These edits remove all Ministry of Natural Resources oversight from the process - and, in my understanding, all concepts of oversight altogether. While I understand that professional assessors have gone through specific training which qualifies them to perform their work effectively, a key aspect of any data collection & analysis process' validity is that multiple professional opinions come together before decisions are made. Researchers must submit their work for peer review before publication; the proposed changes remove the equivalent process for evaluating Ontario's irreplaceable wetlands, opening up a great deal of room for human error and subjectivity.
I am especially concerned that under the proposed changes, the Ministry would no longer have final say on the validity of wetland assessments performed anywhere in the province - and in fact, it would appear that the Ministry could be excluded from the process altogether. When decisions about land use are being made that can affect the entire province, it is not enough to trust municipalities and private interests to act without Ministry oversight.
b) These edits appear to violate fundamental landowner rights by allowing both licenced assessors and anyone in their employ to effectively trespass on private land for purposes of wetland assessment.
c) These edits appear to strike out nearly all mentions of (and, therefore, protections for) wetland complexes, and would allow wetland complexes that are not extremely compact to be intentionally 'nickel-and-dimed' away by piecemeal re-assessments of their individual importance.
d) These edits strike out a vast amount of detail which currently exists to set specific comparable standards for the assessment process. While again, I respect licenced professionals' ability to render high-quality assessments, it is vital that the requirements for provincial environmental assessment processes remain explicitly laid out and that they be followed exactly in both letter and spirit. Environmental assessments are not like talk therapy, which is very subjective and relational; environmental assessments are more akin to medical blood tests, which must be performed to exacting standards in order to render valid results.
e) These edits would allow licenced assessors to employ anyone they personally deem suitable to perform vast amounts of the labour - and therefore, the hands-on scientific data collection - provided they are willing to sign off on the results and perform the analysis. Since any evaluation is only as valid as the quality of its data, this proposed change would invite vast amounts of human error and unprofessional judgment calls into decisions about Ontario's wetlands.
I am a personal and professional advocate for affordable housing, and I am always eager for opportunities to increase the number of good-quality units available for sale and rent for families & singletons at no more than 40% of a single income at existing minimum wage. However, the potential degradation and destruction of Ontario's wetlands in pursuit of new housing developments, which these proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System would expedite, not only does absolutely nothing to guarantee additional affordable housing; it also carries well-documented long-term flood risks to both new and existing residential neighbourhoods by reducing wetland buffer zones  during rainstorms and Extreme Weather Events.
Given known vacancy rates (30-70% in some cases) in existing Ontario housing units - due in significant part to the use of residential properties as investment capital - there is little need to develop virgin land for new housing. Please listen to well-known affordable housing citizen advocacy groups, rather than to for-profit stakeholders, when taking measures to address Ontario's housing crisis.
Thank you.

72186,/comment/72186,"I am a PhD student and educator with experience working in social services, healthcare, policy, social research, and education fields. The lack of scientific rigor found in the proposal is appalling. It lacks proper research into effective sollutions and is an incredibly ineffecient way of making use of people and experts in the field of city planning and environmental management.
I disagree with all edits made to the document. Wetlands are an important part of our world and are major carbon sinks, grow many medicinally important plants, harbour a plethora of ecologically signficant animals, plants, fungi, and protozoa. The science behind the proposal are faulty and will not result in better wetlands nor human abodes. What's the point of having millions of housing units if we all die from global warming? Wetlands are worth millions of dollars more than the housing that could be built over them.
Please look into what successful housing projects have done in other places. We need leaders like Jennifer Keesmaat leading the housing initiative.
We need an end to foreign investments and limiting investment properties. We need to fill vacent apartments and houses first. Why should there be properties empty when there are people who could be living there? Tax places with vacent units if they remain unfilled for 3 months. We need initiatives to drive the price of housing down. If they can't get renters/buyers, perhaps the cost needs to come down?
Define what a housing unit is and what is not housing more strictly. The minimum requirements for housing need to be increased and there needs to be a maximum size for housing units. We need to crack down on closet/shed ""rooms"" and shared units smaller and tighter packed than prison cells. There is increasingly, more subdividing of houses and apartments into smaller, strange shaped spaces. Then there are the giant, sprawling McMansions that are significantly more than what a single family could ever need. The cap can be generous, but there should be a cap on how large a single family dwelling can be.
Prioritize housing construction applications that are for affordable/non-profit housing initiatives and remove red tape from registered non-profits to build affordable housing. The housing crisis is happening because the vast majority of Ontarians can't afford housing prices. If an incoming police officer or doctor can't afford to rent a place in Toronto, the system is broken. We need millions of quality units that are affordable to all Ontarians. Find spaces within pre-existing cities and towns that could be redeveloped or filled. We haven't been very efficient with our use of the spaces we've already developed.
Housing shouldn't cost more than 40% of someone's income. For people on OW or ODSP, housing for the average bacheolor unit in Toronto is more than 100% of what they make. A minimum wage worker will spend well over half of their income on rent. We need to fill all the vacencies in buildings already built. It's unacceptable for there to be all these units built without people living in them.

72188,/comment/72188,"I wish to comment on some of the disturbing changes being proposed to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES).
1) By removing the complexing of wetlands many, perhaps most provincially significant wetlands will be evaluated as multiple separate wetlands few of which would on their own meet the scoring requirements of OWES. This change alone will see many if not most wetlands once again subject to the whim of the development industry.
2) Private consultants hired by the development industry will under the new regulations be able to do their own evaluations removed from the over site of MNR&F, conservation authorities, local planners and the public. If I understand the proposed changes the first Environmental Assessment (EA) which reaches the municipality will become the accepted EA. with little likely hood of review by now cash strapped municipalities.
3) In addition the presence of an endangered specie will no longer be recorded as part of OWES. It is a sad statement of terribly skewed priorities that this removal would even be considered.
These and other changes proposed in Bill 23 are an assault on science, democracy and common sense.
Wetlands provide us with so much more than flood and erosion control. There is no reason to build houses in wetlands. There are many many reasons not to. This is a desperate, greedy cash grab by those who want access to cheap land for a one off get rich quick scheme at the expense of future health and safety.. This is not the answer to the housing crisis!
Do the right thing and reverse these changes to OWES, protect endangered species, restore the authority of Conservation Authorities and restore the role of the MNR&F, planners, municipalities and the public in safeguarding the few wetlands left in the GTA.

72189,/comment/72189,"It is entirely inappropriate to remove the MNRF, Conservation Authorities & Regional Authorities from land use planning decisions, appeals and aspects of the OWES. They have the expertise and EDUCATION to be effective in these roles. Municipalities do not, nor should that responsibility be downloaded to them.
Wetlands are valuable natural resources which must be preserved from the substantial loss already suffered. Natural areas enhance opportunities for people to experience nature, they serve multiple benefits including flood mitigation, climate resilience, they filter water effectively, and provide habitat for a wide variety of species, including many species at risk. It is wrong to remove species at risk considerations, to eliminate provincial oversight and to not recognize the value of wetland complexes.
Eliminating protection for wild areas is NOT a solution to the housing crisis. Urban planners do not recommend urban sprawl requiring new municipal infrastructure to create affordable housing. Land for farming must also be conserved, particularly to supply food for large urban areas (and to give farmers incentive to plan long term for these lands). These proposed updates to streamline wetland evaluation sound designed to encourage profit taking by developers at the expense of protecting natural areas. This is totally unacceptable.
",comments-27.json
72204,/comment/72204,"This is probably the worst bill this government has proposed - and that is saying something given this government's track record.
First of all I find it unconscionable that this government is hiding behind the Ontario housing crisis it has in large part created as an excuse to open up irreplaceable wetlands and farm land.
Secondly, this bill will encourage developers to build luxury housing mostly in rural areas of Ontario where it is not needed, instead of sustainable affordable housing where it is needed, in the province's urban centers.
Thirdly, this green belt housing will have to be built from scratch - no services like roads, sewers or public transit so it will not only be a strain on local municipalities, it will only add to climate change and permanent environmental damage.  Add to that the environmental damage caused by people commuting to these new homes in rural areas.
Fourthly, this government's track record on reducing ""duplicate requirements and streamline the evaluation process"" has been abysmal. Remember how this government eliminated the ""red tape"" of surprise retirement and nursing  home inspections just before Covid hit and people died needlessly. In 2019, this government closed the Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, and now a serious problem has been identified at a ""for profit"" child group home where a troubled 16 year-old committed suicide, and numerous complaints about physical abuse and have gone ignored.  If this bill is passed it is pretty obvious that all environmental laws and standards will disappear.
Fifthly, This government made a solemn election promise that it  was not going to open up the Green Belt to development. And yet despite that promise, several developers who are known donors to the governing party bought huge tracts of land in the greenbelt after this government was elected. Why would a developer buy land that he/she knew was not allowed to be developed?    With the government's breaking of its promise these lucky developers now stand to gain massive windfall profits on their investments. This is an outright fleecing of the Ontario taxpayer by the ruling party and its donors. This needs to be investigated by the police.
I could go on but any one of the above five reasons is reason enough not to pass this bill. This is not an update to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, it is a complete and utter dismantling of it.

These features cannot simply be relocated and replaced by engineers. Losses of the functions provided by existing natural heritage, whose removal will be justified using a weakened OWES, will lead to expensive and potentially catastrophic consequences for homeowners and municipalities left to cover the costs of disaster mitigation under climate change conditions. Finally, removing wetland complexing is completely antithetical to current scientific understanding of watershed health; it will only exacerbate habitat fragmentation and lead to further losses of provincially significant wetlands and other undesignated wetlands, wood lots and natural vegetation cover. I urge the government to reject the proposed changes to OWES and to recognize that evaluating wetlands properly, enforcing the rules for developers and preserving existing wetlands are critical to the health of Ontario’s environment.

72218,/comment/72218,"To Whom It May Concern,
Please accept my comments for the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System included below. In short, I disagree with most of the changes proposed and there should have been reasoning provided with the document explaining the  larger changes, especially when large portions were being removed or added. This was not done and as such, I believe that this proposal was not shared with the proper information and therefore should not move forward and this should go through a second round of comment with this information provided.
I am not an expert in this field (wetlands, ecology, hydrology, etc.), however, I do work in the planning field and work with the data that is created through these evaluations.
The first concern I have is the removal of the MNR throughout the process, this has a very strong potential to reduce the consistency across the province in what is considered a PSW. The sections which suggest seeking advice from MNR have been removed and examples explaining how to evaluate have been removed. This will also reduce the consistency of how these evaluations occur. This is one of the examples where the removal of MNR could result in inconsistencies ""Any trained wetland evaluator may carry out a full wetland evaluation; however, all wetland evaluations must be reviewed and approved by the MNR before they are considered complete and ‘official’ (i.e. the wetland status may be used to make land use planning decisions). As part of the review of a submitted evaluation, MNR may amend certain scores, information, or features contained in the submitted evaluation."" Who will review these reports and make sure they are completed accurately. Not everyone ""trained"" in their field is doing their job for the right reasons and I have seen first hand where people will make a decision for the right kind of money opposed to the best decision for the environment or in this case preventing flooding and damage to future homes in the vicinity.
Second Concern was the removal of this section of the uses of this work:
""2. By the province as an aid to land use planning. In this regard, the wetland evaluation system serves as an essential cornerstone of wetland policies of the Provincial Policy Statement, authorized under Section 3 of the Planning Act. As well, the evaluation system may prove of value in identifying nationally and internationally important wetland features. 3. By conservation authorities as an aid in implementing regulations under the Conservation Authorities Act. Conservation authorities for purposes of public safety, natural hazard prevention and management, regulate wetlands for flood attenuation, natural storage capacities and for preventing shoreline erosion. Conservation authorities also regulate areas around wetlands that may interfere with the hydrologic function of the adjacent wetland including in general areas within 120 metres of all PSWs and areas within 30 metres of all other wetlands. Many conservation authorities evaluate wetlands; MNR retains authority to identify PSWs. 4. By conservation authorities who at the request of their municipalities or as approved by their boards may be developing a broad watershed plan or study to provide technical advice to municipalities for plan input or to direct management on conservation authority owned land. 5. By MNR to manage and conserve fish, wildlife, land and other resources and to inform stewardship and incentive programs. A wetland that has been evaluated using this system is known as an “evaluated wetland” and will have a “wetland evaluation file”. NOTE: Where there are wetland features on a site that have not been evaluated or that have not been recently evaluated, municipalities, county governments, conservation authorities, landowners, or others should not assume that the wetland is not significant. ""
There are a few reasons I am concerned. The main one is that Conservation Authorities assist municipalities with mitigating potential flood issues. The City of London deal with the Thames flooding and Hurricane Hazel was the reason the Conservation Authorities were put into place. If something closer to Toronto needs to be used as an example, might I use the flooding that happened on July 8, 2013 (https://nationalpost.com/news/toronto/streets-just-couldnt-dispel-the-w…) which trapped a train in the Don Valley. I was on a team that worked closely with the Conservation Authority and Metrolinx to come up with a solution to make sure that wouldn't happen again. And the relationship with the MNR for their conservation efforts is critical.
The third concern is that no trigger has been identified for a re-evaluation. This should be identified. I do not have the expertise to state what this should be, however, this document should state what allows for a PSW to be re-evaluated. Is this something a land owner can request or is this something done by the municipality? And when the re-evaluation is completed, who is picking the “trained professional”?
The fourth concern, why were wetland complexes removed? No reasoning was provided.
The fifth concern is the removal of the Wetland Evaluation File. This should not be removed and as a minimum should have a digital format that is maintained. I could not find anywhere in this manual that referenced where this data and information would be kept and by reducing the required information that should be provided means that less information will be captured. This is a tactic that is used to empower a decision maker to make decisions against something and to reduce anyone from opposing because they will not have the data to back up their argument. This is similar to the Conservatives doing away with the Long Form Census. And if the response is that this should be up to the municipalities to determine the type of information they should be capturing, I have worked with contracts and I know that if it is not explicitly laid out in black and white, you will most likely never receive it. And if you have a novice person dealing with this who tries to use this manual after it has been gutted, they may not know they types of information they should be supplying.
The sixth concern is the examples in the Sources of Information section have all been removed. This is again another example of how this manual is not going to provide useful information for the users. This entire piece should not be removed:
“Contact with appropriate organizations and agencies, outlined below, is vital to the credibility of the evaluation and of the Special Features component in particular. One of the best methods for ascertaining the exact locations of wetlands within a study area is through a review of the following: 1. Digital data and imagery available through Land Information Ontario 2. Infrared, black & white stereo aerial photographs or ortho-rectified digital aerial imagery; 3. National Topographic Series (NTS) maps; 4. Forest Resources Inventory (FRI) maps; 5. Regulatory or watershed based maps that may be available from a conservation authority; 6. Satellite imagery (such as LandSat and SPOT) 7. Southern Ontario Land Resource Information System (SOLRIS) 8. Ecological Land Classification (ELC) mapping 9. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) & contours 10. Soils mapping 11. Surficial geology mapping 12. Other wetland or natural heritage system mapping”.
The seventh concern is again about data. The data within the section titled Completing the Wetland Evaluation Data and Scoring Record should not be removed.
The eighth concern is the removal of Section 4.1.2.1 Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species and Section 4.1.2.2 Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species is unacceptable. In a time when we are in a crisis and losing species could impact the ecosystem to remove these from the evaluation is showing a complete disregard for the environment and our stewardship towards it.
These are all of my concerns. I believe the MNR should not be removed from this process and the proposed changes should come with reasons for why they are making the proposed changes.
I disagree with this revised document being made final.

Concerned Citizen in the Province of Ontario

72248,/comment/72248,"I am writing to express my opposition to any weakening of existing wetland evaluation policy and procedures.
We need the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to remain involved in wetland evaluation and to lead development of wetland policy in Ontario. Approximately 80 percent of wetlands have been lost in southern Ontario and we need strong policies and scientific input to policies to protect wetlands. The proposed policy change would reduce the scientific expertise needed to evaluate development proposals. Municipalities do not have the expertise to evaluate the impacts of development on natural heritage features and the development industry has a conflict of interest in evaluating impacts on natural features. Conservation Authorities have an important role in advising on impacts of new development. We have seen here in Peterborough, as elsewhere, the effects of extreme weather on floodplains, with two 100 year flood events in the last twenty years. Historically, some housing has been built too close to rivers and lakes, with the result that there is  damaging flooding during high rainfalls.
Wetlands need to be preserved under the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, to protect our water sources and fight climate change.
There are other, more environmentally friendly solutions to the housing crisis - more urban infill, developments that are less reliant on cars, higher density dwellings, a relaxing of municipal bylaws that allow for basement and in-house apartments, and more.
In the face of unprecedented and accelerating biodiversity loss and the ever-worsening climate crisis, it is vital that your government do its utmost to protect the farmland, wetlands, forests, rivers and other natural areas that sustain us. As Ontario's Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report, we do not need to sacrifice environmental protection to address the housing crisis. That's because ""a shortage of land isn't the cause of the problem."" (p.10) There is a vast supply of land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries.
I urge you to 1) withdraw all policy changes that would weaken the protection of farmland and natural heritage; and 2) retain and uphold the role of the public, CAs, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and regional municipalities in wetland evaluation, environmental planning and decision-making.

Ducks Unlimited Canada says these proposed amendments threaten to accelerate the loss of wetlands and their associated ecosystems, including impacts on water and other climate mitigation and adaptation service benefits.
Our group missed the deadline to comment on Bill 23, but we fully support the submission from Ducks Unlimited Canada.
The proposal summary for ERO number 019-6160 says that the proposed wetland evaluation policy changes would “remove duplicate requirements and streamline the evaluation process” in support of construction of 1.5 million new housing units.
But this so very, very wrong.
Just as Bill 23 will not improve the housing supply situation in Ontario, neither will the proposed policy changes in ERO number 019-6160.  In fact, increased housing supply is the wrong goal.  The goal must be to develop sustainable communities.  Focusing solely on suburban housing construction is short-sighted in the extreme.
Wetlands are a critical part of our developed landscapes.  Water is life.  By retaining and filtering water, wetlands make human communities sustainable.  They are biodiversity hotspots.
People with ready access to biodiversity-rich green spaces such as wetlands lead healthier, happier lives.
Our group has compiled information about wetlands in the County of Renfrew on our Renfrew County Nature Notebook.  We are proud that the County, and eastern Ontario in general, remain rich in wetlands, given the vast loss of wetlands in southern Ontario.
Many of our wetlands exist as complexes, such as the Killaloe Swamp or the Muskrat Lake Complex.  Many are designated as provincially significant.  Some, such as the Snake River Marsh, Conroy Marsh and Westmeath Bog are protected as conservation reserves.  Our group has led many outings in the County of Renfrew’s wetlands.
We understand the consequences of wetland loss.  Drainage of the Upper Osceola Marsh and channelization of the Snake River upstream of its point of discharge into Muskrat Lake has caused serious pollution of that water body by agricultural runoff.  People in Cobden get their drinking water from Muskrat Lake.  We have worked with other groups such as the Muskrat Watershed Council to mitigate the impacts of wetland loss.
We understand the benefits of wetland creation.  In the City of Ottawa, portions of the formerly channelized Carp River are being restored.  Life is returning.  Local residents are enjoying the trails along the shoreline.  School groups are studying the return of life.
Another good example of the benefits of wetland creation in the City of Ottawa is the series of stormwater retention ponds along Sawmill Creek in the city’s south end.  Heavily-used trails along these ponds provide major recreational benefits.
Retaining wetlands in proximity to housing – not destroying the ecosystem services they provide – makes communities sustainable.  Ecological integrity and sustainable communities go hand-in-hand.
The province of Ontario should be enacting policy changes to increase the supply of wetlands.
Wetland complexes function as a unit and must be retained in their entirety.  The 150-meter buffer zones around wetlands (whose importance has benn demonstrated through extensive research work) must be retained.
MNRF and Conservation Authority staff, who are the experts in wetland hydrology and biodiversity, must retain their powers to designate additional wetlands as being of provincial significance.  Many wetlands in the County of Renfrew that currently lack designation as provincially significant but are worthy of that designation (the Little Lakes wetland complex near Beachburg is but one example).
We see no merit in the proposed policy changes in ERO number 019-6160.

Ontario is a big beautiful province. Why make it easier to  build on life sustaining and climate ameliorating wet lands in the south when there are municipalities  who would love to have more housing? If more housing was built further from these wetlands it would be beneficial to more communities. Densification in the centres we have already, especially in the NORTH where there are facilities to serve those homes built would be a viable alternative. Densification and change in zoning to allow this would be able to provide housing in the space already occupied by the built environment.

72277,/comment/72277,"If the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) go ahead, here's what will happen and the problems this will created.
No more wetland complexing, and existing provincially significant wetland complexes can be broken apart, with each small wetland re-evaluated separately.  The problem with this plan - water does not respect boundaries.  It flows and will find its natural connections within the complex.  Wetlands cannot be assessed separately.
The threshold for significance remains the same, so an individual wetland must attain the same score as the much larger wetland complex to remain significant.  The problem with this concept - as we see when a beaver dams a stream, suddenly we have a lake and downstream dries.
The score for threatened and endangered species will be eliminated. Instead of scoring 250 points previously, they will score 50 points as ""provincially significant"" species.  The problem - where is the evidence that the risk to threatened and endangered species is reduced because a decision has been made to separate wetlands?  The risk is unchanged by artificially drawn lines on a map.
The Province will have NO role in reviewing or approving wetland evaluations. In fact, the Province will no longer keep wetland evaluation files or maintain significant wetland mapping. Nor will it provide information for use in wetland evaluations.  This decision provides a stronger argument for expanding the authorities of the Conservation Authorities to encompass these roles previously a responsibility of the Province.
All responsibility will be delegated to local planning authorities such as municipalities. BUT... the municipalities will have NO authority to review and approve wetland evaluations.  The problem - this plan provides no increased funding for adding the necessary expertise at the municipal level and the funding will be greater than what is required at the provincial level.  BUT the government apparently has considered this problem and solved it - with NO authority to review and approve wetland evaluations what does access to funding and expertise matter anyway.
The changes say explicitly that a wetland evaluation will be considered ""complete"" when it is ""received"" by a planning authority.  This is a very distressing conclusion.  Will the government also use this precedent to degrade the importance of a professional engineer’s stamp when evaluating the safety of plans for infrastructure construction?
The wetland evaluator will only be accountable for the objectivity and accuracy of the wetland evaluation to the person paying for it.  The problem - Ontario’s natural heritage “belongs” to all of us not land developers, not government.  It is hard to believe: the property owner or developer seeking to remove the significant wetland designation will be the only authority determining if the wetland evaluation is valid.
Finally, the proposed changes to OWES make it clear that the Province intends to remove protections for provincially significant wetlands from the Provincial Policy Statement, in favor of some sort of ""offsetting"" policy.  The problem - natural ecological areas are complex and unique.  They are not man-made.  Eons and epochs have created their uniqueness.  There is no offsetting equivalency that makes this plan sensible.

72283,/comment/72283,"The proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System are a significant step in the wrong direction for the people of Ontario. Wetlands are going to be an integral part of Ontario’s strategy to mitigate the effects and stress on Ontario’s communities caused by climate change. I am concerned that the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System will accelerate wetland losses and degrade other significant wetlands in southern Ontario. It is estimated that southern Ontario has already lost greater than 70 percent of its original wetlands.
The storm sewer infrastructure of many urban areas of southern Ontario is already struggling to manage the flooding associated with urbanization and wetland loss. Protecting and restoring wetland cover in these urban areas of southern Ontario is critical to avoid the problems experienced in our older communities and to mitigate and adapt to the expected negative effects of climate change. The damage to property and the risk to human life resulting from additional wetland losses will cost Ontario’s taxpayers and businesses. It is more cost-effective to protect Ontario’s existing natural wetlands.
The following is a list of concerns and recommendations in response to the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. Where applicable page references in the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System document have been provided.
1.	Approval for the Wetland Evaluations
The proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System seem to indicate that the Province intends to abandon its responsibility for overseeing the administration of the OWES and the protection of Ontario’s significant wetlands. There are several proposed edits that strike-out references to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry “administering (p. 3), advising (p. 4) and approving (p. 7)” wetland evaluations. The proposed changes also strive to “Make changes to better recognize the professional opinion of wetland evaluators and the role of local decision makers (e.g. municipalities)”.
The proposed changes suggest that the Province may be considering downloading responsibility for approving wetland evaluations to local municipalities. The vast majority of municipalities currently lack the staff or expertise needed to assess the correctness and completeness of the evaluation to properly support the approval process.
In addition, downloading this responsibility to the municipalities is an inefficient use of tax dollars. Downloading to the municipalities would require each municipality to hire or train staff or rely on external consultants, which is more costly, to provide the knowledge and expertise necessary to properly assess and approve wetland evaluations. There has been recent pressure from the development industry to have municipalities accept the developer's consultant’s opinion on the significance of natural heritage features associated with the development to make land use planning decisions. This is a conflict of interest. The consultants working on these environmental studies are retained by the developer and are working for the interests of their clients, not the municipality. This puts significant natural heritage features and the interests of the people of the municipality and Ontario at risk. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry provides a more cost-effective service by providing the needed knowledge and expertise to all of the municipalities in its District.
Oversight by the Province will also ensure the quality of wetland evaluations and that the application of wetlands policies is fair and consistent and protects the interests of the people of Ontario.
The hydrologic and ecologic functions of wetlands are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the surrounding landscape (e.g. proximity to other natural areas, the amount of impermeable surfaces, and the quality of water within the wetland’s catchment). These functions cross property and municipal boundaries.  Wetlands must be managed at a landscape and watershed scale to protect their hydrologic and ecologic functions. Provincial oversight of the wetland evaluation has a better chance of ensuring that the hydrologic function of the wetland is properly assessed and considered in the evaluation. This cannot happen at the property or in some cases the municipal scale.
The Province also maintains a centralized repository of information and mapping of wetlands in Ontario. Municipalities, conservation authorities, consultants and academics rely on this important information to guide Ontario’s land use, resources and water management decisions. Reassigning responsibility for the administration and approval of wetland evaluation to municipalities or other external parties will result in the loss or corruption of some or all of this valuable and critical data set.
I recommend that the Province through the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry retain responsibility for administering and approving wetland evaluations.
2.	Wetland Complexing
The proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System strikes-out the wetland complex section and many references to the term.
The concept of wetland complexes in the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System addresses the hydrological and ecological functional relationship between wetlands in proximity to one another. Losing the concept of wetland complexes from OWES would result in the loss of smaller wetlands that support the hydrologic and ecologic functions and values of larger wetlands. This can cause an unintentional cascading effect that would degrade the function of the larger wetlands and produce further wetland losses.
Wetlands provide an important service to our communities by reducing the severity of damage caused by flooding and erosion during storms. The amount of wetland on the landscape relates to the ability of the land and our river systems to safely store and convey stormwater. Urban streams in areas with low wetland cover produce extreme and dangerous flows within minutes of the storm. In some urban streams, small intense summer storms cause hazardous conditions to develop so quickly that conservation authorities and emergency services cannot provide sufficient advance warning to the community downstream. The loss of additional wetlands resulting from these proposed changes to OWES will produce new hazard lands in our communities and put more people and property at risk.
I am concerned that removing the concept of wetland complexes will produce significant wetland losses resulting in less stormwater storage capacity in watersheds, increased flooding and erosion, increased risk to life and property, and unintended negative effects in the remaining wetlands and other significant natural heritage features and functions.
I recommend that the Province retain the concept and section of the Ontario Wetland Evaluation referring to wetland complexes.
3.	Species At Risk
The Province proposes to remove scoring in the OWES for Species At Risk. It is important to recognize that wetlands provide multiple functions including habitat for species at risk. Species at Risk may have been observed in a particular wetland unit but it is very likely that the other wetlands also provide habitat for that species and would support the recovery of the species at risk. Typically, the application of the regulations under the Ontario Endangered Species Act focuses only on the wetland in which the species at risk was observed. The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System provides a landscape scale approach that is more likely to protect other habitats that support that species and contribute to its recovery.
I recommend that the Province keep the consideration of Species At Risk in the Ontario Wetland Evaluation.
4.	Appendix 10 – Wetland Plant List
The proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System intend to remove the Wetland Plant List in Appendix 10 as the authoritative list for delineating wetland boundaries.
This wetland plant list is intended to support the delineation of the authoritative and only list to be used to delineate wetland boundaries using the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. The list is to be used to apply the 50% rule, and is not intended as an exhaustive list of all species that may be scored under the Special Features component.
I am concerned that this will result in a lot of arguments and inconsistencies in the identification and evaluation of wetlands. One botanist or biologist will say that it is a wetland while another says it is not. Likewise, one botanist or biologist will say that the wetland starts here while another says it starts over there. This conflict could result in the miss identification and delineation of wetlands and result in a loss of wetlands or a delay in the approval process.
The plant list was developed to address this issue and avoid this conflict. The species list was developed based on the consensus of botanical experts. I recommend that the province retain the Wetland Plant List in Appendix 10 as the authoritative list for delineating wetland boundaries in the application of the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.
5.	Wetlands and Climate Change Mitigation
I am also concerned that many of the proposed changes will result in significant wetland losses and impair our municipalities' ability to mitigate the negative effects of climate change.
Climate change in Ontario is expected to produce more intense rainfall, ice and windstorms, drought and heat waves. These events can cause damage to property and disruptions to critical infrastructure and businesses. Wetlands store, infiltrate and evaporate stormwater helping to reduce the severity of damage caused by flooding and erosion. Wetlands are a critical part of Ontario’s strategy to adapt to and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. Many wetlands are hydrologically connected to streams and other wetlands. The loss of smaller wetlands can have a cascading effect on the quality, health and functions of our rivers and other significant wetlands. Wetlands support communities that are resilient to threats caused by a changing climate. Unfortunately, wetlands are also vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Additional wetland losses will exasperate the effects of climate change on our communities and the remaining wetlands and other natural heritage. Losing wetlands will amplify this problem on the remaining wetlands.
6.	Contradiction with Ontario’s Wetland Strategy
Finally, I am very concerned that many of the proposed changes will result in significant wetland losses which is inconsistent with Ontario’s Wetland Strategy which states;
By 2025, the net loss of wetland area and function is halted where wetland loss has been the greatest.
By 2030, a net gain in wetland area and function is achieved where wetland loss has been the greatest.
Again, I think that the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System are a significant step in the wrong direction for the future of Ontario. The notion that these changes are needed to provide more housing is false. There is an abundant supply of developable land on the urban fringe of many urban centers in southern Ontario. The Province and the development community are using the current economic and social challenges to dismantle Ontario’s environmental protections. This will benefit developers at the expense of Ontario’s future and the taxpayers.

I am particularly concerned about the:
1. Removal of my right to appeal on planning matters that affect my community;
2. Limitations on the power of conservation authorities (CAs) to regulate or prohibit development that negatively impacts wetlands, rivers or streams, to provide expert review of planning applications, and to appeal planning decisions;
3. Removal of the role of seven regional municipalities (Simcoe, Durham, Halton, Peel, Niagara, Waterloo and York) in planning matters, thereby eliminating coordinated efforts to protect farmland and natural areas, determine optimal locations for development and infrastructure, and efficiently deliver municipal services;
4. Drastic amendments to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, ensuring that very few wetlands in Ontario will be deemed provincially significant and protected from development;
5. Replacement of the Provincial Policy Statement with a new policy instrument geared to facilitating unchecked development; and
6. Creation of a natural heritage offsetting policy and “pay to slay” fund that could lead to widespread and extremely risky tradeoffs, where existing natural areas are sacrificed on the faulty premise that they can be recreated or restored elsewhere.
In the face of unprecedented and accelerating biodiversity loss and the ever-worsening climate crisis, it is vital that your government do its utmost to protect the farmland, wetlands, forests, rivers and other natural areas that sustain us. As Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report, we do not need to sacrifice environmental protection to address the housing crisis. That’s because “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem.” (p.10) There is a vast supply of land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries.
I urge you to 1) withdraw all amendments likely to weaken the protection of farmland and natural heritage; and 2) retain and uphold the role of the public, CAs and regional municipalities in environmental planning and decision-making.

Dear Minister Smith,
Re: ERO #019-6160 - Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
We, the 70 undersigned organizations, are strongly opposed to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s (MNRF) proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES), as they would completely undermine the protection of wetlands in Ontario.
As you know, the OWES is a science-based ranking system that provides a standardized approach to determining the relative value of wetlands. OWES assessments are necessary to designate Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs). This designation in turn results in a high level of protection under provincial law and policy such as the Provincial Policy Statement (sections 2.1.4,  2.1.5 and 2.1.8). Yet the complete overhaul of the OWES, as proposed, will ensure that very few wetlands would be deemed provincially significant in the future and that many if not most existing PSWs could lose that designation. As a result, very few of Ontario’s wetlands would benefit in the future from the protection that PSW designation currently provides. We urge you not to proceed with the proposed changes to the OWES, for the reasons outlined below.
1. Misguided purpose of proposed changes
According to the ERO posting, the purpose of the proposed changes is to support the construction of 1.5 million new housing units over the next ten years by streamlining the wetland evaluation process. This purpose is misguided for several reasons.
First, as noted by Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force, a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the housing shortage:
Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts … Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (Housing Affordability Task Force, 2022, p.10)
There is no need to pave over wetlands to provide housing.
Second, as noted in the 2019 report of Ontario’s Special Advisor on Flooding, wetlands are vital in addressing the harmful impacts of increasingly frequent and intense rainfall events and reducing associated flood damages and financial losses. Among its sources, the report referenced two studies: one commissioned by MNRF in 2017 which found that “maintaining wetlands can reduce flood damages and costs by 29% in rural areas and by 38% in urban areas;” and another by the Insurance Bureau of Canada documenting the “cost-effective” ability of wetlands to reduce flood damages and associated costs. We simply can’t afford to weaken protections for wetlands. In addition to flood control, wetlands provide water filtration, carbon storage, groundwater recharge, erosion control, wildlife habitat, wild foods and medicines, and recreational opportunities. They provide these benefits at minimal cost to taxpayers. In a 2009 study commissioned by MNRF the contribution of wetlands to human well-being was conservatively estimated at over $51 billion per year in southern Ontario alone.
Third, historic wetland loss in southern Ontario exceeds 72 percent, and the loss continues. In municipalities such as Essex, Kent, Lambton, Brant, Russell & Prescott, Perth, Middlesex, Niagara and Toronto, wetland losses exceed 85 percent. Given the fundamental importance of wetlands in responding to the interconnected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, the Government of Ontario should be doing its utmost to strengthen, not weaken wetland evaluation and protection.
2. Wetland complexes no longer to be recognized or considered
As stated in the ERO posting, the OWES is the official procedure to identify PSWs and determine their boundaries, using a science-based scoring system that takes into account biological, social, hydrological and special features. Identifying wetland complexes has been integral to the evaluation and scoring process, based on the understanding that delineating “the wetland units into individually recognized wetlands would not be an ecologically or functionally sound process.” This is because:
Wetland complexes are commonly related in a functional way, that is, as a group they tend to have similar or complementary biological, social and/or hydrological functions. Much of the wildlife in the area of the complex is variously dependent upon the presence of the entire complex of wetlands, with each wetland unit contributing to the whole. (OWES – Southern Manual, p. 39)
MNRF is proposing to no longer consider wetland complexes as part of the OWES, a plan that is not science-based and will facilitate and promote the “de-listing” of provincially significant wetlands. Despite decades of effort to develop and refine approaches to delineating and scoring wetland complexes, these would be erased from the system. As a result, crucial interconnections among individual wetlands will no longer matter, and smaller wetlands assessed in isolation from the whole simply won’t qualify.
In the current system, wetland complexes have been a major factor in designating wetlands as PSWs. Wetlands are complexed based on their proximity to each other and their occurrence within the same watershed. This makes sense from a variety of perspectives, including resilience to climate change impacts: while one small wetland may not be able to protect a town from flooding, a complex of wetlands may be able to.
If MNRF proceeds with the proposed changes, very few new PSWs will be designated in the future and many existing PSWs will lose that designation and the protection it affords. Developers who want to drain or pave over a wetland will have an easy time with the new piecemeal approach – just ignore the complex and separate the evaluation of individual wetlands from that of the whole. An individual wetland could be re-evaluated by a developer without consideration for how it contributes hydrologically or ecologically to the remaining complex. Through this process the complex could be disassembled bit by bit until nothing remains of the PSW.
3. Endangered and threatened species no longer to be recognized
MNRF is proposing to no longer recognize the presence of endangered or threatened species in the OWES process, a criterion which is currently a key factor in determining provincial significance. Wetlands provide habitat for at least 20 percent of Ontario’s species at risk. Protecting the habitats upon which they rely to carry out their life processes (e.g., reproduction, migration, feeding, hibernation) is critical to their survival and recovery. Currently, the presence of endangered or threatened species automatically qualifies the wetland as provincially significant. But with the proposed changes, species at risk will be considered only as “provincially tracked species,” worth far less in the evaluation. This major change would affect the evaluation of most wetlands in Ontario, leaving many of these wetlands and the significant species that rely on them vulnerable to the adverse impacts of development.
4. Provincial government oversight and coordination removed from the OWES
MNRF is proposing to remove itself from any involvement in Ontario’s wetland evaluation process, despite the deep and valuable expertise of ministry staff who have overseen the process for decades. No central agency is being assigned to coordinate or approve evaluations or to ensure that information about PSW designation is publicly accessible. Consultation with MNRF will no longer be an option. It appears that approval authority will be downloaded to municipalities, many of which have little expertise and would no longer be able to consult with conservation authorities (due to proposed Bill 23 amendments to the Conservation Authorities Act). The onus would be on the wetland evaluator (working in most cases for development proponents) to inform the municipality and landowners in writing about the outcome of the evaluation or re-evaluation.
MNRF’s abandonment of its role in wetland evaluation is problematic in many respects:
i)	There would be no central administration of the OWES program going forward, including training and certification oversight;
ii)	Most wetland evaluations and re-evaluations would be undertaken by evaluators working for development proponents with no checks and balances, creating a built-in bias in favour of development;
iii)	There would be no central authority to make decisions regarding conflicting opinions;
iv)	MNRF would have no authority to intervene on behalf of the public regarding an evaluation of questionable merit;
v)	MNRF would not be aware of wetland evaluations and outcomes, undermining coordination and public transparency. There would be no centralized process for record-keeping and uploading the information to Land Information Ontario, necessary to ensure that public and private organizations and individuals can find, access and share geographic data;
vi)	Taxes and landowner eligibility for the Conservation Land Tax Incentive Program) would be negatively impacted. MNRF’s approach has been to contact all landowners with more than two hectares of wetland within the PSW and invite them to participate in the tax incentive program. Landowners currently participating in the program could see this benefit removed if the wetland is re-evaluated and loses its PSW status.
vii)	MNRF’s non-involvement would severely compromise its ability to achieve the two targets it set out in the Wetland Conservation Strategy for Ontario, 2017 – 2030: 1) by 2025, the net loss of wetland area and function is halted where wetland loss has been the greatest; and 2) by 2030, a net gain in wetland area and function is achieved where wetland loss has been the greatest.
5. Timing of proposed changes
The proposed changes to the OWES are going forward at the same time as numerous other proposed law and policy amendments that will negatively impact wetland conservation in Ontario. These include proposed changes to the Planning Act, the Conservation Authorities Act, the Provincial Policy Statement and the Greenbelt Plan as well as the creation of a new offsetting policy for natural heritage. The broad scope of the proposals and the haste with which they are being pushed forward mean that the public’s ability to comprehend and respond is severely compromised. These factors, along with the tight timeline for public comment on the proposed OWES changes (minimum 30-day comment period on the ERO) suggest that MNRF has little interest in receiving informed public comment on the proposal.
6. Inaccurate and misleading analysis of the regulatory impact on the ERO
MNRF’s description of the anticipated impacts of the OWES changes on the ERO posting are misleading and far from comprehensive. They speak only to the impacts on business which MNRF anticipates will be positive or neutral. They say nothing whatsoever about the significant negative environmental, social or economic impacts related to wetland loss that would arise from the changes to the OWES system. It would appear either that no thought has been given to these impacts or that the ministry simply does not care.
Concluding remarks
If MNRF proceeds with the proposed changes to the OWES, Ontarians can anticipate that very few PSWs would be designated in the future, that most existing PSWs would be vulnerable to losing that designation, and that ongoing wetland loss in Ontario would accelerate and intensify.
Ontario’s wetlands play a critical role in sustaining healthy communities, enhancing climate change resilience and conserving biodiversity. We urge you not to proceed with the proposed changes to the OWES.

Urban sprawl is a problem across Ontario. We continuously build expansive, single-family housing projects without first building public transit infrastructure to support them, which means more cars on the road, and larger parking lots to accommodate those cars. The consequences of all of this--more pavement (ie. less green space), more cars (ie. pollution), etc.--exacerbates the climate crisis.
Please consider converting as little wetland as possible and maximizing its use. Build mixed-used complexes, mid-sized residential apartment complexes (not just single-family homes, which should be at a minimum), and transit infrastructure (including LRT).

Build where housing is starting to fall apart. So many cities have neighbourhoods that are in such disrepair. Rebuild there and leave the wetlands alone.

72335,/comment/72335,"The proposed changes outlined in Bill 23 to OWES would be a complete overhaul of the system and would be jeopardizing a considerable portion of wetlands that have been classified as significant. Many of these wetlands have developed over decades if not centuries (if not millennia) to become what they are today. Removing protections and making it easier to develop over wetlands will not solve the housing crisis. Wetlands are vital, crucially important ecosystems that are not only the most diverse types of ecosystems we have, but are so invaluable for flood attenuation, groundwater recharge, buffering from storms, and generally helping to protect our infrastructure in the long run.
Making these changes means opening up enormous areas for development. While there seems to be an idea that we can just pave over wetlands and easily offset by ""building"" another wetland somewhere else, and that is somehow equivalent or even close to net-zero is completely misguided and entirely incorrect. How can something we build over a couple years compare to ecosystems that have developed over 10s/100s/1000s of years themselves? Research has shown time again that offsetting in this capacity never really works.
As someone who just completed the OWES course earlier this year, I learned about how we come to classify wetlands as provincially significant. It takes a lot of work, research, and time to evaluate a wetland, and it takes a considerable amount of work for a wetland to be considered significant. The justifications behind what makes a wetland significant, whether biological, hydrological, social or special features, are all based on science, and are not just considered without purpose. Already, we have seen a drastic decrease in wetland cover compared to what was present historically. With climate change, we know that the worst is yet to come, which means we should be preparing however we can for increased flooding and storm events. Going through with these proposed changes means that we are putting ourselves and our homes at risk, valuing short-term benefit (by mainly developers) versus looking at the long-term health of families, this land, and our infrastructure and homes.
Please, please understand that everything we do is connected. Taking away the ability for wetlands to be considered significant in a complex is so detrimental - we know and understand that diversity even within systems is so important, and protecting swaths of that variety is just as important as protecting one larger system. Removing the ability to evaluate wetland complexes as significant is a highly damaging move to these habitats, to at-risk species, to connectivity and watershed health overall. Something like 80% of wetlands in Niagara would lose their protections as they have been evaluated as wetland complexes and been classified as significant as a result.
Removing consideration for species-at-risk is also highly problematic-  they are disappearing for a reason, largely due to habitat loss, and these moves are just pushing them closer to extinction as we destroy more and more of their habitat.  What kind of world do we want to leave behind for our children? I want to know more than anything that if I choose to have kids, I can show them the beauty of this province and the biodiversity that I feel so lucky to have in Ontario. The thought that my children or grandchildren won't be able to see some of this same biodiversity and experience these precious wetlands is devastating. If the provincial government goes through with these proposed changes, that means destroying invaluable ecosystems that can never be brought back or recreated.

Each entity will have to do their part to be part of the solution to this crisis.”
As a child in Ontario, I was told conservation was to be achieved through cooperation and it was vital to the health of my parents, grandparents, and future generations. I was disheartened as an adult to read the above sentence, written from the perspective of destroying the wetlands we were taught were ecologically and culturally vital to our futures, for houses.
Wetlands provide a buffer against flooding, they provide important habitat to endangered and threatened species, they are a carbon sink that help slow climate change, they purify water before it enters the lakes that we swim and fish in, as well as draw our drinking water from. Wetlands are important locations for agricultural purposes, they are locations where we educate our young about the importance of protecting wildlife and safeguarding our environment for the future.
As an adult, I cannot fathom where this proposal came from. I am an adult, looking to buy a house, but I would never want that house to have been built at the sacrifice of a protected wetland. This proposal at its core seeks to diminish the protections around wetlands, and looks to quantify one part of a wetland as being more important than another. That is a slippery slope. Before we blink, we could have no wetlands if this proposal proceeds.
In a time of population growth we need to consider the long term as well as short term importance of wetlands. In 50 years we will need more food, more clean water, more opportunities for recreation and tourism. Areas that do not reach the 600 point milestone today will reach this milestone in a few short years. Prior to considering wetlands as sites of development, we should be prioritizing redeveloping swaths of land that are already developed, but are  underdeveloped. Buildings empty due to expired leases, building underground parking with condos above rather than having huge tarmacs of open air parking, re-purpose empty office buildings to housing complexes, build up, not out, to reduce the amount of new land needed for housing, repair government housing to adequate states so people don’t feel they have to get out of inferior housing situations, provide landlord incentives to upgrade dilapidated spaces to be suitable for housing. There are many options to explore before destroying wetlands that will never recover, will never provide services to the community again.
Reducing the protections on wetlands is shortsighted, focuses on building quick profits for the few, provides a band-aid solution to a larger problem, and is effectively a very bad idea.
The people of Ontario did not vote for this. Doug Ford’s campaign included green belt protections, not greenbelt destructions. We, the People of Ontario have been deceived. We have been mislead and lied to. We are supposed to sacrifice our futures for the short term profits of a few developers. I am strongly opposed to the proposed changes to Bill 23. It is unacceptable to diminish the protections to our wetlands.
Developing wetlands will devalue Ontario in the long run. We will experience more flooding, have lower water quality, have less fertile agricultural land to grow food, have less ability to cope with rising carbon amounts. we will experience more detrimental effects from climate change, and will lose endangered and threatened species forever. We will lose tourism and recreational profits associated directly or indirectly with wetlands and the above listed activities.
We have to explain these choices in 30 years to our children. This is a very bad choice. Building homes is not a good enough reason to destroy our wetlands when there are other options available. Once more, in the words of Bill 23, from the much more ecologically, socially, and economically important perspective of protecting our wetlands: “It will take both short-term strategies and long-term commitment from all levels of government, the private sector, and not-for-profits to drive change. Each entity will have to do their part to be part of the solution to this crisis.”

72348,/comment/72348,"The proposed approach to updating the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) demonstrates a lack of understanding of wetland science and the unique context of Southern Ontario. As a professional ecologist certified in OWES and having practised as an ecological consultant in Ontario for over 15 years, I am not in favour of the proposed changes for the following reasons outlined below. I also understand that developers (and consultants!) are frustrated at the length of time development approvals take. Many of my colleagues have ideas about how to achieve ecological protection, enhancement and restoration (as required by the Provincial Policy Statement) and increase efficiency of applications' review. To that end, I would invite the government to consult with conservation authority, municipal, and consultant task forces on this issue.
The MNRF has a proven track record of reviewing wetland evaluations and maintaining the province's wetland database, along with other natural heritage information sources. Giving municipalities the responsibility for wetland files will increase the cost and time it will take to review background information (for both consultants/developers and municipal staff), and will limit the ability of consultants to provide quick and accurate answers to developers looking for a natural heritage constraints analysis in support of property speculation. Further, municipalities do not have the staff or technical knowledge to properly review wetland evaluations. Does the government plan to provide more money to EACH municipality so that they may staff up to fulfill their duties or to outsource the task to qualified consultants? Is record keeping going to be standardized prior to changes taking effect?  It seems obvious to me that it is more cost-effective and effective for a few experienced MNRF staff to review than for each municipality to do so.
Furthermore, eliminating wetland complexing is anti-science and will negatively impact wetland ecology and the ecosystem services they provide. It is well known that wetlands sequester massive amounts of carbon, contribute to ground and surface water quality, and alleviate flooding. These are all major concerns as the effects of climate change become more pronounced.
I do recognize that at times the MNRF have been overly conservative when including small wetlands to Provincially Significant Wetland complexes based solely on the 750 m proximal distance criteria alone. I suggest that in order to complex a wetland, there needs to be an additional technically defensible reason for complexing separate wetland units within 750 m of each other (e.g., hydrologic connection, significant corridor function, etc.). Wetlands should remain as open files (with MNRF as central repository for the files) so that wetland complexes with questionable elements may be reexamined. This, along with a technically defensible offsetting policy, could allow for these small wetlands oft surrounded by developable land, to be compensated for elsewhere on the landscape.

ALL remaining wetland need to be protected. We have already lost a huge percentage of wetlands in Ontario. We can't keep developing wetlands or removing them from protection and expect healthy ecosystem functioning.

RE: ERO Posting 019-6160 Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
To Whom It May Concern,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the above-mentioned Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) posting and the supporting document Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, dated October 25, 2022, prepared by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's (MNRF) Resources Planning and Policy Branch.
""Science is the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence.""  In its never-ending pursuit of knowledge, science builds on known truths to delve deeper into the known and unknown.
The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) is a science-based ""evaluation system … designed to identify and measure recognized values of wetlands.""  Consequently, based on the previously defined science, the OWES should evolve as new knowledge is acquired, adding to its existing knowledge base.
The difficulty with the proposed amendments is the loss of current knowledge, not the promised advantages.
•	OWES requires each evaluated wetland to have a wetland evaluation file containing all of the information gathered and created during its evaluation.   ""Information gathered through the application of this evaluation system can provide the basis for considering management options and alternatives.""   The proposed changes eliminate the requirement for a wetland evaluation file while providing nothing in its place.  Where will this information be stored for easy access, and will existing files be kept?
•	Convenient references, such as lists of agencies, organizations, programs, and initiatives that may provide helpful natural or general wetlands information, have been replaced with a generic, bland list. Also missing are helpful hints for researchers heading out into the field, such as what to bring (e.g., aerial photos, GIS mapping). The proposed changes appear to be hindering rather than helping the evaluator.
•	The proposed changes ambiguously define the role of the ""decision maker."" The modifications do not elaborate or provide advice on this new role. Apart from municipalities, as an example, we have no idea who the government intends to appoint to this position. We are also not told what specific challenges made recognizing a decision maker's role difficult before the changes. More importantly, when comparing the current and proposed OWES, prominent decision makers (e.g., District MNRF staff) are removed from the evaluation process.  Their removal is a concern given their local knowledge and ability to evaluate in a local context.
•	Considering the MNRF's removal as the approval authority for OWES evaluations, who is their proposed replacement? Who will oversee assessing a wetland evaluator's professional qualifications and competency?
•	What challenges made it difficult to recognize wetland evaluators' professional opinions under the current system?  Furthermore, who ensures that qualified professionals perform evaluations following OWES protocols? The changes are not obvious.
•	For transparency, it would be helpful to know who the practitioners who raised concerns were and their recommendations for improvements. One must wonder who is pushing for an overhaul of the OWES - practitioners or landowners?
•	What is the reasoning behind the removal of sections 4.1.2.1 Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species and 4.1.2.2 Migration, Feeding, or Hibernation Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species and their scoring?  The scoring was weighted to protect a habitat that appears to be under threat from these changes. Perhaps these changes have been identified as the means to release several wetlands for development by removing a previous impediment.
•	Another concern is the proposed new manual's omission of Locally Important Wetlands.  Removing these wetlands reduces their value as a valuable regenerative resource for local groundwater needs. The proposed changes put these wetlands up for review. If they are not designated as Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs), there is no way to identify or protect them, leaving them vulnerable to development.
•	Because wetland complexes have been removed entirely from OWES, each wetland unit must now qualify as significant on its own.  This approach has only one goal: to fragment wetland complexes impeding development. Is this the underlying reason for triggering wetland re-evaluations, in which case these changes are motivated by profit rather than science?
•	Given the following remark in the current OWES manual, why is there such a sudden interest in re-evaluating wetlands? What are the specific reasons for re-evaluating wetlands? The new section titled Wetland Re-evaluations and Mapping Updates offers no insights.
""The relative scores assigned to the subcomponents, attributes and sub-attributes were developed over a decade. The 1984 edition of the Evaluation System was applied to about 2,000 wetlands across southern Ontario, during which time a great deal of experience was gained. Hence, the judgement of dozens of people about the relative importance of the recognized values is the basis for the credibility of the assigned scores.""
•	Who will be in charge of maintaining the wetland classification mapping inventory? The proposed changes are ambiguous. Conservation Authorities have kept wetlands data inventories for many years and are well-suited to take on this role.
Recommendations
•	Establish a filing system like the current wetland evaluation file system, describing the information that must be included and identifying the official body in charge of its upkeep and maintenance. Better yet, maintain the current wetland evaluation system.
•	Consider restoring, perhaps by including useful lists of sources and tips to assist evaluators in evaluating and re-evaluating wetlands in the appendices.
•	If MNRF is removed as the decision maker, clearly identify who will take over this responsibility to assess the integrity and thoroughness of an OWES evaluation. To ensure consistency of OWES evaluations, Conservation Authorities should ideally be given this responsibility.
•	Identify the specific challenges of being a wetlands evaluator and the body in charge of ensuring their professionalism.
•	Provide a list of organizations and businesses that sought and proposed changes to the current OWES system.
•	Sections 4.1.2.1 Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species and 4.1.2.2 Migration Feeding, or Hibernation Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species, as well as their scoring, should be restored in the new manual unless there is a legitimate scientific reason not to do so
•	Rather than removing complex and locally significant wetlands, collaborate with conservation experts (e.g., conservation authorities) to review and amend the OWES criteria using a scientific approach.
•	Collaborate with conservation experts to create a scientific criterion that justifies re-evaluating existing wetlands.
•	Charge Conservation Authorities with maintaining OWES mapping of evaluated wetlands
Several challenges are associated with the proposed ""updates"" to OWES. Besides the threatened loss of current knowledge, some roles and responsibilities and information storage are ambiguous. The surgical nature of specific text removals suggests a calculated strategy to remove barriers defending a wetland's Provincially Significant Wetland status or Locally Important Wetlands status from re-evaluation.
The passage of this Bill is premature as more consultation with wetlands experts is required to perfect the science and methods to ensure appropriate stewardship of the public's wetlands.
Yours truly.

72351,/comment/72351,"As someone who values wetlands for the incredible services they provide (water storage, water filtration) which taxpayers would otherwise have to pay for infrastructure to deal with, I have to say the proposed changes to OWES are absolutely terrible. Getting rid of provincial oversight, wetland complexes and consideration for species at risk would lead to many of our wetlands being unprotected and therefore developed. We need wetland complexes to help mitigate the increased record breaking storm and flood events caused by climate change. I urge you to consult with organizations who are experts at mitigating floods like conservation authorities, reinstate provincial oversight through the MNRF and do not remove wetland complexes from the OWES.
I am not against building more housing, but getting rid of wetlands to do it is completely unnecessary and short-sighted.

In fact, bogs and wetlands are overwintering grounds for protected reptiles such as the snapping turtle.  They dig holes and stay underground until spring.  Any work done in that habitat in winter will be killing those turtles. Work done in spring would disrupt nesting of all species.
The hatchet job done on Duffins creek recently most certainly destroyed turtles and salamanders, multiply this by the hundreds and you have only one of the disasterous outcomes of bill 23.

These changes will lead to fewer designations of provincial significance to the wetlands that will be evaluated from now on, as it will not take into consideration smaller wetlands that have enjoyed protection under wetland complexes, and also may lead to de-notification of existing provincially significant wetlands. As highlighted by so much of the research and reports; wetlands offer a variety of benefits that are irreplaceable by any offsetting policy that is being proposed. Please take into consideration the science-based research and reports done by experts in the field over the years.
In the age of the sixth mass extinction that we are living in, if we do not consider a habitat of a species at risk worth protecting, then we are surely fast-tracking the demise of all our wildlife neighbours in urban as well as rural and far wild spaces.

72366,/comment/72366,"The City of Burlington recognizes the importance of a systems-based approach to planning for natural heritage and key features. Wetlands are a vital component of the functional connections between aquatic and terrestrial systems. The ecological, social, and economic benefits of wetlands are substantial and provide for some of the most productive and biologically diverse habitats in Ontario. Since the 1980s, a substantial amount of southern Ontario wetlands have already been lost to encroaching land uses and development. The conservation and protection of the remaining wetlands is of more importance than ever.
From a natural heritage planning perspective, the proposed changes to the complexing of wetlands does not represent a systems-based approach to planning for the natural environment. This direction is not supported by a science-based ecological understanding of natural systems. Advances in mapping and modelling over the past 10 years have resulted in a better understanding of hydrological connections of wetland complexes and more efficient delineation processes. Removal of the complexing approach to wetland assessment is not a direction that is supported by the current policy or guidance provided by the Provincial Policy Statement (2020) or the Natural Heritage Reference Manual. This direction is likely to result in:
• An inconsistent approach to wetland evaluations;
• Challenges to recently assessed wetlands;and,
• A net loss of overall natural heritage system within municipalities.
These changes would be opposite to Provincial direction regarding proper accounting for ecosystem services. As noted in A Place to Grow (2020) wetlands provide numerous benefits including water storage and filtration, cleaner air and habitats, and support pollinators, carbon storage, adaptation and resilience to climate change. These benefits may be cost prohibitive to replicate with traditional infrastructure or services if the features supporting ecosystem services are lost; at expense to the municipality. It is likely, due to the wording of the proposed changes, that municipalities will seek their own OWES evaluator to either review completed evaluations, or to proactively evaluate wetland features deemed important to the City’s natural heritage system in order to deliver on several identified matters of provincial interest.
Next Steps:
There is general support for the modernization of OWES and for additional clarity on the complexing of wetlands. However, permitting an individual component of a larger system to be assessed in isolation from that system is a significant departure from accepted ecological principles and a departure from principles enshrined in the Provincial Policy Statement (2020), A Place to Grow (2020), and the Natural Heritage Resource Manual. The opportunity to have a more open and productive dialogue on modernizing OWES would be preferred and some innovative consideration may include:
• update to include conclusive minimum size criteria for wetland units.
• OWES scoring for SAR/THR/Rare species could be modified to better reflect some of the inconsistencies in the process.
• Creating a scoring cap.
• Applicability where species status lists are current and available.
Currently, OWES recognizes the ecological complexities of wetlands. These complexities, such as the interaction of groundwater and surface water inputs, is part of what makes a wetland such a valuable feature suited to providing important ecosystem services. While the type of studies that may be required to assess these interactions can be both extensive and expensive, the general goal of revising OWES should focus on making the process transparent and replicable rather than disposing of important evaluative concepts.
Finally, It is unclear what role municipalities will have in the wetland evaluation process. Clarity should be provided regarding whether a municpality has the ability to retain their own OWES evaluator where there may be a dispute in the evaluation process. Additional clarity is also sought regarding at what level oversight occurs. In general, having no or unclear oversight of the matter of wetland evaluation opens the process to abuse and potential conflicts of interest and the potential of undermining of certain matters of provincial interest enshrined in the Planning Act. It is suggested, in-lieu of an appeal mechanism, and removal as MNRF as arbiter, that it be clarified what recourse is available where there are conflicting evaluations or where there is a dispute regarding conclusions.

Essentially- you are describing a scenario where developers can pay consultants (""evaluators"") to approve requested changes to boundaries, with no oversight. This is appalling and reeks of one-sided development interest. Further- why would you remove any consideration of Ontario's species at risk from this system? ultimately- this literally paves the wave for blatant resource exploitation, lines the pockets of developers by eliminating any kind of objective review for changes to boundaries, and the people will pay the price. When flooding happens, or patterns of landscape drainage change - destroying agricultural systems-  - it will be too late to ""compensate"", and we will be left with the bitter regret of letting money guide short-sighted decision-making.

Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
The regulatory impact analysis states that the impact of this proposal to business will be positive.  It does not mention any negative impacts, whereas the impacts and real costs to all Ontarians will be vastly negative. Changes outlined in this proposal will put people at risk. They will impact city infrastructure including sewer backup risks, municipal building codes, clean drinking water, biodiversity, First Nations communities, agriculture, the insurance industry, fisheries, human health, and tourism.
The negative impacts far outweigh any positives; these impacts will be cumulative and ongoing, and the proposal should be scrapped.
There are more fiscally responsible and environmentally responsible ways to address the housing crisis than to develop over filled-in wetlands.
The proposed changes to wetland evaluation will weaken protection for all wetlands. The new wetland classification system may result in no provincial oversight over wetlands at all. The proposed evaluation changes will open the door for even more development and loss; the proposal is an invitation for developers to spread housing sprawl and get rid of wetlands completely.
Wetlands filter nutrients and sediment from runoff, which purifies rivers and groundwater.
To put a cost to just this one of the impacts of this proposed change, a University of Waterloo study uses economic valuation to understand the importance of Southern Ontario’s wetlands for water filtration, and the authors conclude that these wetlands provide $4,2 billion worth of sediment filtration and phosphorous removal services each year, keeping our drinking water clean and helping to mitigate harmful algal blooms in our lakes and rivers.    (‘Economic valuation of suspended sediment and phosphorous filtration services by four different wetland types’, Aziz and Van Cappellen, Hydrological Processes, November 2021)
While Ontarians understand that the climate crisis is the most urgent issue of our time, this proposal ignores this entirely. The effect of this proposal will contribute to climate change and will reduce the means of mitigating its impacts.
And this is at a time when we need all remaining wetlands in southern Ontario. Southern Ontario has already lost 72% of its original wetland area.
Wetlands are critical nature-based available climate solutions.  Up to 38% of potential damages and costs caused by floods in urban areas are reduced by wetlands.  Wetlands reduce the severity of serious floods, control erosion. At a time when climate change is causing more frequent and intense storm events, we need wetlands more than ever.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada puts the catastrophic costs from flooding at $ billions.
Removing wetlands is like removing dams and reservoirs. Wetlands act as natural infrastructure that absorb and retain a significant volume of snow melt and rain which reduces flood levels during spring runoff and storm events. They also release this water slowly throughout the year, helping augment water levels in lakes and rivers during low flow periods, which reduces the affects of drought conditions.
During times of drought, wetlands provide water to aquifers and base flow to rivers. These benefits are particularly important where lakes, rivers and groundwater are supporting agriculture, recreation and fisheries. During drought, wetlands replenish the aquifers that farmers need and municipalities rely on to supply drinking water to their communities.
Municipalities and Conservation Authorities could never afford to build the infrastructure it would take to replace wetland functions and protect upstream and downstream communities from flooding and drought.
Wetlands store carbon.  20 to 30% of global carbon storage is accounted for by wetlands.
We need intact wetland complexes for deep carbon storage and also for their high biodiversity value. The proposed changes do not recognize integrated wetland complexes. Breaking up these complexes, and offsetting are not the answers. The wetlands near urban areas are at particularly high risk, and this is where the flooding and drought risks are.
The proposal downloads onto municipalities the responsibility for evaluating the risks, and where is the expertise coming from? Municipalities don’t have the technical expertise or capability of evaluating these risks. It is far too complex. It is impossible for municipalities or developers’ consultants to assess the far-reaching impacts.
The University of Waterloo study puts an additional cost to the filtration benefit of swamps and marshes. The study concludes that marshes in Southern Ontario contribute about 80% of the overall filtration services we benefit from at a value of $3.4 billion per year. Without these wetland services, implementing agricultural Best Management Practices to remove an equivalent phosphorous load would cost $23 billion annually, while expanding current wastewater treatment capacity to replace wetlands’ filtration service would cost $164 billion per year.   (‘Economic valuation of suspended sediment and phosphorous filtration services by four different wetland types’, Aziz and Van Cappellen, Hydrological Processes, November2021)
A fundamental problem is that this proposal was tabled on October 25, the day after the municipal elections. The proposal involves changes to land-use planning affecting municipalities.  This timing was planned and strategic.  Across Ontario outgoing mayors and councils are disempowered, and new mayors and councils have not yet been sworn in.  This October 25 timing was strategic to take the voice away from municipalities, from elected officials and the citizens they represent. This timing is a betrayal of public interest and democracy, and the proposal should be dismissed on this basis alone.

72395,/comment/72395,"Wetlands are critical natural infrastructure in Ontario.  Protecting them is imperative to address the serious problems of loss of biodiversity and climate change.  The deep deposits of peat in bogs, fens and swamps store carbon thus preventing its release into the atmosphere.  Wetlands also prevent flooding, maintain water quality and recharge groundwater.  Safe homes and drinking water are crucial to the health of Ontarians.
The recent changes in Ontario’s Wetland Evaluation System will eliminate the protection of provincially significant wetlands previously ensured by your government.  The ability to remove a component of a wetland complex, reclassify it and then approve it for development is short-sighted.  You cannot remove a component of a natural system and expect it to function efficiently.  You are in effect damaging ecologically sensitive habitats and undermining the wetland’s ability to prevent flooding and keep our drinking water safe.
Changes in the scoring system for species at risk will drastically reduce the ability to identify provincially significant wetlands (PSW).  Your government has made a commitment to protecting habitats for species at risk. There will be no protection unless the boundaries of significant wetlands are accurately identified and mapped.  Fewer provincially significant wetlands will result in less accurate mapping of wetland boundaries and this has serious implications for housing.  Housing should not be located on a flood plain or near a wetland complex.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada has identified flooding as a serious problem and has stated that protecting natural infrastructure is a nature-based solution.  Wetlands must be protected to ensure the economic and environmental sustainability of the province.
Downloading the approval of PSWs from the province to municipalities puts an additional burden on municipalities, particularly rural municipalities who may not have a planner on staff.
I implore you to rescind the recent changes made to the Wetland Evaluation System and return to system presently used.

72399,/comment/72399,"Dear MNRF Public Input Coordinator,
The National Farmers Union - Ontario (NFU-O) is responding to ERO 019-6160 to voice our opposition to the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES). We believe that the revisions to the OWES threaten a healthy ecology across the province, endangering the thriving natural systems that make growing abundant and nutritious food possible.
The NFU-O recognizes that Ontario’s wetlands are complex and interconnected systems that support ecological diversity and create important natural buffers during climate fluctuations. These wetlands connect to water systems on farms (spring–fed ponds, wells, rivers, creeks, and streams) and must remain reliable and non-contaminated for us to feed our growing population.
We question the rationale behind the OWES revisions: The NFU-O believes it is unnecessary to remove or undermine wetland designations in order to address the affordable housing crisis. The provisions that are removed under these proposed OWES updates are not “red-tape” in need of cutting; they are crucial to protecting our natural heritage and agricultural lands for future generations.
The NFU-O is an accredited farm organization representing thousands of sustainable farmers in Ontario and has advocated for farmers across Ontario since 1969. Members work together to achieve agricultural policies that ensure dignity and income security for farmers while protecting and enhancing rural environments for present and future generations. We have frequently shared our expertise as Ontario farmers to advocate for policies that will offer more, not less, protections to the province’s waterways and wetlands and the biological diversity that resides there.
The NFU-O is particularly concerned about the following proposed changes to the OWES:
•	Power being stripped from Conservation Authorities (CAs)
We are against the revocation of CAs power within the OWES to require permits and oversight of development projects regarding water-taking and their potential interference with rivers, creeks, streams, watercourses, wetlands, flood or erosion control. We see this as part of the larger proposals in Bill 23 to disempower CAs ability to advise municipalities regarding watershed planning decisions. Municipalities do not have the in-house expertise or the financial resources of CAs to adjudicate the value of wetlands or complex ecosystems. We see the stripping of CA power as a way for the Ontario Government to shirk oversight and analysis of the environmental and agricultural impacts of paving over wetlands, and will move us away from green and sustainable urban planning. The checks and balances within the current OWES and the participation of CAs and the MNRF are crucial to responsible development and environmental protection.
•	 The disallowing of the “complexing” of wetlands and the “re-evaluation” of currently-protected wetlands
By disallowing the “complexing” of wetlands, the updates to the OWES ignore the research that proves that, while small wetlands might not be considered “provincially significant” on their own, taken together, wetlands play an incredibly important role in naturally sequestering carbon, mitigating floods, and creating rich habitats. We see the disallowance of “complexing” as a means to reduce the number of wetlands classified as “provincially significant” and therefore requiring protection from development.
That the changes also allow for single wetland units that were previously evaluated as part of a larger wetland complex to be re-evaluated, re-scored, and re-mapped without a complete re-evaluation of the entire wetland complex is a dangerous move away from legislative protections that take into account that wetlands, no matter their size, do not exist in isolation. Even the smallest wetlands are crucial to neighboring farmers and local communities.
•	The elimination of endangered species criterion
The proposed elimination of endangered species criterion (4.1.2.1 and elsewhere) when assessing the need to protect any given wetland is alarming. We know that wetlands are crucial reproductive habitats and homes to many of Ontario’s endangered species. The loss of these endangered species will have ripple effects that have the potential to impact pollinators and other life necessary for the sustainable production of the food we eat.
In the face of a rapidly changing climate and uncertain seasonal weather patterns, relaxing protections for complex wetland and waterway systems will have massive impacts on above and below ground waterways and the production potential of nearby agricultural lands. The revisions to the OWES will undermine community resilience to flooding on both agricultural lands and built areas. Removing legislative protections of Ontario's natural areas like the ones proposed will have a decisively negative impact on Ontario's food security.
The NFU-O strongly opposes any changes that would result in the loss of any more wetlands in Ontario. Instead, we would support any Government legislation that offered proposals on how to expand existing policies designed to protect our finite wetlands and waterways.

300 Water Street, 2nd Floor, South Tower Peterborough,
Ontario K9J 3C7
Subject:  ERO# 019-6160 Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) is Ontario’s largest, non-profit, fish and wildlife conservation-based organization, representing 100,000 members, subscribers and supporters, and 725 member clubs. We have reviewed ERO posting 019-6160 Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System and offer the following comments for consideration.
Wetlands are an extremely valuable natural resource in Ontario. According to Environment and Climate change Canada, wetlands “… support a disproportionately high number of species and are often very productive” (2016) as compared to other ecosystem types. Wetlands filter nutrient-rich and polluted waters, protect against flooding and control the dispersal of groundwater, sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and provide vital habitat to a variety of native organisms. Many valued wild game animals, including moose and waterfowl, are reliant on wetlands for food, breeding habitat, security, and more (Merendino, et al. 1995; Tendeng et al, 2016). In fact, many Southern Ontario wetlands, due to their close proximity to the Great Lakes, act as vital stopover habitat for birds migrating along the Mississippi and Atlantic flyways each year (CWS, 2014). In addition to supporting healthy populations of these species, wetlands also provide great opportunities for outdoor recreation in the form of hunting and trapping. While we acknowledge that the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System is in need of revision, we fear the proposed amendments could hinder the effectiveness of the process rather than improve upon it.
MNRF and Expert Consultation:
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry plays a vital role in ensuring that Ontario’s wetlands are appropriately protected, particularly with regard to vulnerable ecosystems. The proposed changes would significantly reduce the involvement that MNRF experts play in the wetland evaluation process, removing requirements from the MNRF to approve wetland boundary changes, locally significant species lists, and OWES evaluations, as a whole, in addition to removing requirements to consult local MNRF experts on unique scenarios and species.
This lack of MNRF consultation and oversight will greatly jeopardize the health of our wetlands. Individual wetlands and wetland systems are complex and unique, sometimes requiring more thorough consideration than any one protocol, including the OWES, can provide (MNRF, 2013). MNRF district employees have historically provided important context and details for evaluators to make informed decisions. The proposed changes not only eliminate the MNRF’s role in almost all such cases, but they also endeavor to place almost all the responsibility on wetland evaluators and “local decision makers” such as municipalities. Many municipalities don’t have the expertise or experience in wetland evaluation, thereby creating a less robust and potentially bias-friendly process.  The OFAH strongly recommends the MNRF maintain its role as a valuable source of input and a key decision maker with respect to wetland protection and the wetland evaluation process.
Wetland Complexes:
The OFAH is gravely concerned about the proposed elimination of “wetland complexes” from the OWES. The concept of wetland complexes, which may be defined as a grouping of wetlands with such a topography, closeness, and density that delineation into individually recognized wetlands, would not be ecologically or functionally sound (MNRF, 2013), have been a key component to the protection of closely linked wetlands in the past. If this concept is eliminated from the wetland evaluation process, innumerable (likely smaller) wetlands will no longer meet the requirements for protection. These unique ecological features are an important source of biological and ecological diversity, often representing the different wetland types that exist within a region, in addition to providing population connectivity for many vulnerable terrestrial and aquatic species (Roe & Georges, 2007; Petranka et al. 2007).
Although the proposed changes allude to the treatment of multiple “close” wetlands as a single unit in some cases, no elaboration or guidance is provided in the consultation documents. The OFAH strongly recommends that the MNRF create a new section for the purposes of outlining how and when multiple wetlands may be combined as a single unit and to ensure that all wetlands previously designated as “complexes” receive appropriate protection.
Other Sources of Information:
The OFAH feels it is unnecessary to remove the lists of resources found on pages 11 and 12 of the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. These lists serve to improve the quality and consistency of wetland evaluations by providing valuable contacts and resources for information on wetland locations, boundaries, biology, and unique features. Referral to outside expertise and varied sources of information should be encouraged rather than discouraged.
Property Access:
With the creation of a new “Landowner Notification and Permission” section, it is unclear whether this proposal eliminates an evaluator’s ability to use other sources of information (such as aerial imagery) to complete their evaluations in cases where landowner permission cannot be acquired. Such changes would make it impossible to complete wetland evaluations for many critical wetland systems across the province. The OWES must be adaptable, and the OFAH encourages the MNRF to update their policy to incorporate the use of new technologies such as drones and high-resolution imagery to complete evaluation requirements. We would appreciate clarification on the implications of this proposed amendment and assurance that evaluators can use all the tools at their disposal to complete these important evaluations.
Low-risk Activities:
The OFAH recognizes that some low-risk activities may not require conventional permitting. However, we are concerned about the potential cumulative effects of activities (e.g., well installation) which now have reduced or eliminated permitting requirements, if overutilized. Will the MNRF impose regulations to restrict the number of “low-risk” activities done within a particular space? How will these be enforced? Additionally, the OFAH is concerned about the potential impacts of overflow from offline ponds. Without proper consideration of pond location, this “low-risk” activity could easily become a high-risk for the spread of invasive species in the event of a flood. Will there be measures set in place to prevent this and how will they be enforced?
Endangered and Threatened Species and Sensitive Habitats:
There are over 200 at-risk species in Ontario, most of which are threatened by habitat loss (MECP, 2021). The OFAH has worked tirelessly, investing considerable financial, human and other resources, in the restoration of many extirpated, endangered and threatened species in Ontario, and we are alarmed at the complete elimination of endangered and threatened species as factors for consideration in the wetland evaluation process. Not only have at-risk species been removed from consideration, but so too have breeding, hibernation, staging and moulting, winter cover, and stopover habitats for all native Ontario species. Without these considerations, countless sensitive and ecologically critical wetlands will no longer be protected when, logically, they should receive the most protection. Considering this proposed change, the OFAH feels it is extremely important that the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) continue to have an active role in reviewing OWES submissions with a species at-risk lens.
Despite increasing the role that municipalities play in the process of wetland evaluation (as well as an increased associated cost for municipalities), the proposed changes would remove a municipality’s ability to designate wetlands as “locally important” for ecological, social, and functional reasons, eliminating yet another protection.
The implications of these proposed amendments are potentially significant. The OFAH strongly recommends that the MNRF amend the proposed changes to ensure the manual retains its consideration for endangered and threatened species, sensitive and important habitats, connected wetlands, and locally important wetlands.
Protecting our wetlands is critical to maintaining the health of Ontario’s wild fish and game species, to creating opportunities for outdoor recreation, and to supporting conservation, as a whole.
Thank you for considering our comments. We look forward to continued discussions on how best to balance Ontario’s development needs with the protection of our vital natural heritage.
Yours in Conservation,

72441,/comment/72441,"The Severn Sound Environmental Association (SSEA) is pleased that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) provides guidance and oversight of wetlands in the province, and we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES).
The Severn Sound watershed is in southeastern Georgian Bay. The SSEA is a Joint Municipal Service Board under the Municipal Act, and works closely with eight lower tier municipalities (Midland, Penetanguishene, Tay, Tiny, Springwater, Georgian Bay, Severn and Oro-Medonte) and two upper tier municipalities (County of Simcoe and District of Muskoka) in the Severn Sound area, as well as provincial and federal government agencies and non-government organizations. The SSEA’s mission is ensuring exceptional environmental quality through exemplary stewardship of the Severn Sound area through sound science, collaboration and partnerships. The SSEA collects environmental data and provides expertise to member municipalities, works to keep water clean so it supports healthy terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and has been heavily involved in municipal drinking water source protection activities, as well as in conducting wetland evaluations and identifying and documenting natural heritage features for several member municipalities for use in their Official Plan updates. The SSEA is the local Source Protection Authority in the Severn Sound area.
We offer the following comments regarding the above noted ERO posting.
1.	There has already been significant loss of wetlands in Ontario. Wetlands – large and small, provincially significant and non-provincially significant – are important for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: providing habitat for common and at-risk species, contributing to native biological diversity, improving water quality and attenuating flooding and contributing to climate resilience. Wetlands are critical natural infrastructure, natural assets on the Ontario landscape, contributing environmentally and economically. Preserving remaining wetlands is important, since it is challenging to fully compensate for all values through offsetting projects, and since there is uncertainty about the effects of climate change on wetlands and some wetland loss from this threat may occur despite gains made elsewhere.
The Province previously developed a draft Wetland Conservation Strategy for Ontario 2016-2030 which included strong guiding principles and actions for conservation and protection of wetlands, with three priority actions: improving Ontario’s wetland inventory and mapping, developing policy approaches and tools to prevent the net loss of wetlands in Ontario, and improving guidance for evaluating the significance of wetlands. The SSEA submitted comments on this Strategy which were supportive of its intent and priority actions. Preventing net loss of wetlands and their critical functions locally and broadly on the Ontario landscape remains paramount to a healthy environment and strong economy and a sustainable Ontario.
The proposed changes to the OWES, including wetland complexing and scoring, such as removing points for presence of Endangered/Threatened Species At Risk, will result in fewer wetlands meeting criteria as Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSW) and some wetlands currently designated as PSW may lose this designation, which is likely to result in considerable loss, fragmentation or alteration of wetlands as well as their benefits and values to humans and the ecosystem. This would be in direct opposition to the goals, guiding principles and actions for conservation and protection of wetlands previously identified by the Province.
We strongly encourage the Province to maintain and further develop policy approaches and tools to prevent the loss of wetlands, strengthen provincial wetland policy including recognizing the importance of non-Provincially Significant Wetlands/ locally significant wetlands and unevaluated wetlands, improve wetland inventory and mapping data to support wetland conservation and restoration, and ensure appropriate land use planning decisions are made regarding wetlands including ensuring adequate terrestrial buffers to these features. In addition, there is a need to ensure that policy approaches and tools that are developed are effectively implemented.
2.	One of the strengths of the OWES is that it was developed by experts including input from the provincial Wetland Evaluation Technical Team and working groups of professionals with specific expertise. It is not clear that the proposed changes were all science-based decisions, with conservation of wetlands as the priority. For example, there is no scientific rationale provided for the proposed changes to wetland complexing or removal of scoring for Endangered/Threatened Species At Risk (SAR). The current OWES acknowledges that wetlands located within 750 m of one another can be ecologically and hydrologically linked and as a whole be important for wildlife; the importance and connectivity of these wetland complexes would be diminished under proposed changes. Numerous SAR rely on wetlands or wetland complexes for part or all of their life cycle, and the presence of Endangered or Threatened species is often a key factor in determining significance of wetlands - it is impossible to protect species without protecting the habitat they rely on.
The SSEA urges the Province to retain current complexing rules and scoring for Endangered/ Threatened Species At Risk in the OWES, and not implement the proposed changes to the applicable sections.
3.	Under the current OWES, municipalities and other agencies have had access to Provincial expertise such as MNRF biologists and staff with significant experience in wetlands and habitat, and with protection and conservation of wetlands as a focus. This has been a valuable asset for municipalities that do not have this expertise, for example in determining on-the-ground limits of PSW that need to be protected from site alteration and development in accordance with provincial policy.
With the proposed changes, the Province would no longer be responsible for oversight of wetland evaluations, including designating their significance and boundaries or ensuring that information about wetland significance is publicly available. The onus would shift to local decision makers, including municipalities, who may not have appropriate expertise, resulting in greater financial burden for accessing external expertise, and/or the risk that decisions may be made that are not consistent with protection of wetlands. It is unclear if there is any appeals process for wetland evaluations, or who the final authority would be in the event of a dispute about a wetland’s significance or on-the-ground extent and boundaries.
The SSEA is of the opinion that the Province should maintain expertise in wetlands and oversight of the OWES, including designating wetland significance and boundaries; continued investment into MNRF is needed to ensure strong leadership in wetland conservation and adequate funding and resources for successful implementation.
4.	Some municipalities have progressive policies to protect all wetlands, regardless of significance. The proposed changes to the OWES removes the section on Locally Important Wetlands which currently includes the text “all wetlands have value, both to society and intrinsically” and “Municipalities may determine that some of these ‘other’ wetlands are significant on a local scale and may decide to protect them”.
Removal of this section of the OWES weakens the recognition that non-PSW have value, and there may be little incentive or support for municipalities to go over-and-above provincial policies for wetland protection. Municipalities may have difficulty defending policies for protection and conservation of all wetlands (not just PSW), resulting in increased pressure to allow non-PSWs to be developed, resulting in the loss of habitat, species and benefits to humans and ecosystems. The science tells us that wetland have significant local value to the environment and economy beyond habitat and natural areas, including flood attenuation and filtering water, which are also important for protecting drinking water sources.
As proposed, the changes to the OWES would considerably weaken overall protection for wetlands in Ontario, when conservation of these habitats and natural assets is needed more than ever. We urge the Province to invest in and support conservation and protection of wetlands, retain current complexing rules and scoring for Endangered/Threatened Species At Risk in the OWES, and maintain MNRF oversight of OWES and ensure any proposed changes are science-based and incorporate knowledge from wetland experts and working groups as well as Indigenous perspectives and traditional ecological knowledge.
Thank you again for the opportunity to offer feedback on the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. Please continue to include the SSEA in additional proposed changes to the OWES. The SSEA welcomes the opportunity to discuss our comments further at your convenience. If you have any questions or comments please feel free to contact the SSEA office.

Wetlands and green space such as the green belt also give people access to nature and the outdoors-proven to have physical and mental health benefits. In southern Ontario, it is of utmost importance to conserve our remaining wetlands with stringent protection measures. Wetlands are hundreds to thousands of years in age, and truly cannot be compensated within a reasonable period of time once altered or destroyed. To date, some parts of southern Ontario have lost more than 85% of their wetlands. Thus, it is critical that we treat ALL wetlands as provincially significant unless otherwise proven (as highlighted in 2018 by Environmental Commissioner Dianne Saxe in the Back to Basics report: https://auditor.on.ca/en/content/reporttopics/envreports/env18/Back-to-…). Housing can be expanded and made more affordable by developing on already developed land and through proper land use planning. In short, it is crucial to NOT further streamline development processes because they put wetlands and their invaluable functions at risk, and they take away from the focus of creating affordable housing where sufficient infrastructure already exists.

These risks range from problems with municipal water systems and building codes, drinking water and aquifers, agriculture and tourism, biodiversity and endangered species, flood control and fisheries, and human health including First Nations communities that had no input into this ridiculous direction to disaster.
It is poorly thought out as these impacts will degrade our environment continually as wetlands are key to balance, water storage and flood control. Leaving them with no oversight is irresponsible at best! This is an open invitation for sprawl and loss of wetlands.
 Ontario has already lost almost three quarters of our natural wetlands! This would spell disaster for a safe future for Ontarions as our water filtering system is threatened by aggregate removing filters and developers paving over the other filtering system.
This would leave us vulnerable to loss of safe drinking water, more algae blooms, and make Walkerton  water disaster look puny.
Floods cost billions and so get ready to pay that cost. You may want to talk with the insurance industry about the costs of flooding and you would be removing another line of defense. Climate change is real and we need to be working to mitigate water risks not increasing them!
We need functional municipalities, Conservation Authorities, appeal options, citizens voices heard, consent from First Nations and democratic decision making with proper advice before taking sledgehammers like this to oversight. This proposal must be withdrawn as the dangerous move that it is!

The government must be prudent when considering changes like offsetting, which could negatively affect the ability of wetlands to reduce flooding and confuse roles in wetland management and protection between municipalities and CAs.

Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
The regulatory impact analysis states that the impact of this proposal to business will be positive.  It does not mention any negative impacts, whereas the impacts and real costs to all Ontarians will be vastly negative. Changes outlined in this proposal will put people at risk. They will impact city infrastructure including sewer backup risks, municipal building codes, clean drinking water, biodiversity, First Nations communities, agriculture, the insurance industry, fisheries, human health, and tourism.
The negative impacts far outweigh any positives; these impacts will be cumulative and ongoing, and the proposal should be scrapped.
There are more fiscally responsible and environmentally responsible ways to address the housing crisis than to develop over filled-in wetlands.
The proposed changes to wetland evaluation will weaken protection for all wetlands. The new wetland classification system may result in no provincial oversight over wetlands at all. The proposed evaluation changes will open the door for even more development and loss; the proposal is an invitation for developers to spread housing sprawl and get rid of wetlands completely.
Wetlands filter nutrients and sediment from runoff, which purifies rivers and groundwater.
To put a cost to just this one of the impacts of this proposed change, a University of Waterloo study uses economic valuation to understand the importance of Southern Ontario’s wetlands for water filtration, and the authors conclude that these wetlands provide $4,2 billion worth of sediment filtration and phosphorous removal services each year, keeping our drinking water clean and helping to mitigate harmful algal blooms in our lakes and rivers.    (‘Economic valuation of suspended sediment and phosphorous filtration services by four different wetland types’, Aziz and Van Cappellen, Hydrological Processes, November 2021)
While Ontarians understand that the climate crisis is the most urgent issue of our time, this proposal ignores this entirely. The effect of this proposal will contribute to climate change and will reduce the means of mitigating its impacts.
And this is at a time when we need all remaining wetlands in southern Ontario. Southern Ontario has already lost 72% of its original wetland area.
Wetlands are critical nature-based available climate solutions.  Up to 38% of potential damages and costs caused by floods in urban areas are reduced by wetlands.  Wetlands reduce the severity of serious floods, control erosion. At a time when climate change is causing more frequent and intense storm events, we need wetlands more than ever.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada puts the catastrophic costs from flooding at $ billions.
Removing wetlands is like removing dams and reservoirs. Wetlands act as natural infrastructure that absorb and retain a significant volume of snow melt and rain which reduces flood levels during spring runoff and storm events. They also release this water slowly throughout the year, helping augment water levels in lakes and rivers during low flow periods, which reduces the affects of drought conditions.
During times of drought, wetlands provide water to aquifers and base flow to rivers. These benefits are particularly important where lakes, rivers and groundwater are supporting agriculture, recreation and fisheries. During drought, wetlands replenish the aquifers that farmers need and municipalities rely on to supply drinking water to their communities.
Municipalities and Conservation Authorities could never afford to build the infrastructure it would take to replace wetland functions and protect upstream and downstream communities from flooding and drought.
Wetlands store carbon.  20 to 30% of global carbon storage is accounted for by wetlands.
We need intact wetland complexes for deep carbon storage and also for their high biodiversity value. The proposed changes do not recognize integrated wetland complexes. Breaking up these complexes, and offsetting are not the answers. The wetlands near urban areas are at particularly high risk, and this is where the flooding and drought risks are.
The proposal downloads onto municipalities the responsibility for evaluating the risks, and where is the expertise coming from? Municipalities don’t have the technical expertise or capability of evaluating these risks. It is far too complex. It is impossible for municipalities or developers’ consultants to assess the far-reaching impacts.
The University of Waterloo study puts an additional cost to the filtration benefit of swamps and marshes. The study concludes that marshes in Southern Ontario contribute about 80% of the overall filtration services we benefit from at a value of $3.4 billion per year. Without these wetland services, implementing agricultural Best Management Practices to remove an equivalent phosphorous load would cost $23 billion annually, while expanding current wastewater treatment capacity to replace wetlands’ filtration service would cost $164 billion per year.   (‘Economic valuation of suspended sediment and phosphorous filtration services by four different wetland types’, Aziz and Van Cappellen, Hydrological Processes, November2021)
A fundamental problem is that this proposal was tabled on October 25, the day after the municipal elections. The proposal involves changes to land-use planning affecting municipalities.  This timing was planned and strategic.  Across Ontario outgoing mayors and councils are disempowered, and new mayors and councils have not yet been sworn in.  This October 25 timing was strategic to take the voice away from municipalities, from elected officials and the citizens they represent. This timing is a betrayal of public interest and democracy, and the proposal should be dismissed on this basis alone.

72461,/comment/72461,"Wetlands are now known to play and invaluable role that has already cost Ontario billions to replace. Many of the functions they provide aren’t replaceable. Wetlands maintain water quality, absorb harmful chemicals, provide surface water during droughts, replenish aquifers, control flooding and erosion, and sequester carbon.
They also provide habitat for a wide range of plants and animals, a third of which are threatened or endangered. Many also lie on the path for migratory birds.
Wetlands contribute to the sustainability of recreational fishing, and nature tourism, which often focuses on wetlands, is a major economic driver in Ontario.
Wetland soil is also totally unsuited for development. Water still has to flow when they are filled in, and many homes built in these areas face ongoing seepage, flooding and subsidence issues.
Wetlands have been protected from development for all these reasons, and it’s extremely important that this protection is maintained across Ontario. If they’re lost to development, they’re lost forever.

72462,/comment/72462,"The proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System are very short-sighted. Wetlands protect us from flooding and serious biodiversity loss. The Insurance Bureau of Canada is highlighting the risk to homeowners from flooding and their decreasing ability to protect homeowners with the increasing incidence of flooding due to climate change. Wetlands need to be evaluated as interconnected complexes, not as small individual parcels. To shift evaluation from complexes to individual parcels guts the evaluation system and undermines any credible attempt by the Province to protect future homes and public infrastructure from the loss of irreplaceable services. The financial impacts of such a move would be felt by Ontarions for decades.
Evaluations need to be completed by competent, independent evaluators to ensure that the Ontario government's policies for wetland protection are followed. Municipalities do not have the tools, staff or resources to provide these functions and downloading this role to municipalities will effectively remove essential protection to wetlands.
Responding to climate related storms is an increasing burden on taxpayers at both municipal and provincial levels. We need MORE protection for wetlands and other nature-based solutions to reducing the impacts from an unstable climate. This proposal is not giving consideration to the full suite of impacts that changes to the OWES will trigger. Please restore full protection for wetland complexes - it is the fiscally responsible thing to do.

I believe that it is so long overdue to make the environment THE top priority when making any governmental decisions, and I am definitely not seeing this in this proposed bill. There are so many empty or underused buildings all over Ontario, which could offer different solutions to the housing concerns....let's be creative and innovative! Once again, I feel the government is thinking in short term tunnel vision, rather than the long term and big picture!

72469,/comment/72469,"I do not support this proposal. Wetlands in southern Ontario are seriously threatened and deserve the highest level of protection. To ensure that wetlands are properly protected, a rigorous evaluation system must remain in place.
In order to have a consistent approach in wetland evaluation, it is essential for the province to retain a strong role in the evaluation process. If some responsibilities for wetland evaluation are transferred to others, then it is essential for the province to have a strong role in review and approval of the work done by consultants, municipalities, etc. Most municipalities do not have the expertise to properly review such work.
To ensure that the review process is timely and effective, the province must provide sufficient funding to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to enable it to do the work that is required.
Another option would be to transfer to the responsibility for wetland evaluation to conservation authorities. Conservation authorities have expert knowledge about their respective watersheds and are well placed to evaluate wetlands and/or review wetland evaluations conducted by others. I note that there are other policy proposals in circulation at present, that would diminish the role of conservation authorities. I suggest that it would be most appropriate for the province to look at ways to strengthen role of authorities in environmental protection, and to provide funding for the conservation authorities to operate effectively.
I note that the policy proposal provides for the re-evaluation wetlands within wetland complexes. I find it troubling to see wording such as the following: “All wetland units that were previously evaluated as part of a wetland complex do not need to be re-evaluated at the same time. There is no requirement to update the wetland evaluation that applied to an entire wetland complex.” This appears to overlook the importance of considering a wetland complex in its entirety. Each wetland complex will have its own special ecological interactions, and these must be understood and respected.
In conclusion, I do not support the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. At the very least, this proposal must be revised to include a provincial review component for new evaluations and re-evaluations.

RE: York Region Citizens’ response to Bill 23 and Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt & Redesignation of the Oak Ridges Moraine
ERO Submission for Greenbelt: https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-6216 “Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan”  and https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-6218 “Proposed Redesignation of land under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan” ERO deadline December 4
Bill 23: https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-6192 “Supporting Growth and Housing in York and Durham Regions Act, 2022” ERO deadline November 24, extended November 23 to December 9
Executive Summary
We are deeply troubled by Bill 23 and the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan. Many of the Ontario government’s actions can only be described as undemocratic, as there is no mandate for these sweeping reforms. The province is dismissive of stakeholders, ENGO’s and NGO’s that express concern and/or opposition. The ENGO community has gotten used to this, but the fact that the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario’s concerns are also being ignored is unprecedented.  This head in the sand behaviour reflects an unwillingness to acknowledge the magnitude of public concern and to fairly listen to all experts and stakeholders.
Our High Level Recommendations:
1.	Slow down: Do not pass Bill 23 or support the Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan until proper consultation is completed with affected stakeholders, key interest groups including Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO), the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, Conservation Authorities (CA), and affordable housing advocates. The housing rationale used for these measures must be demonstrated to be sound; to date the measures proposed are not supported by planners, municipalities or housing advocates.
2.	Allow Conservation Authorities to maintain their current role in permitting in regulated areas, allow them to conserve land, reduce pollution via land use planning review and permits. Don’t further consider land owned by CA’s for housing development. Uphold the purpose and rationale for CA’s, namely preservation, conservation and stewardship of land with natural hazard risks.
3.	Require a full Environmental Assessment for the Duffins York-Durham Sewage System servicing northern York Region.
4.	Abandon the abolition of Regional Planning: There are issues with regional planning, but the only support for the proposal to eliminate the important coordinating role of regional government, particularly for infrastructure planning, is from land speculators and developers. If there’s a rationale for the government’s proposal that serves the public interest, please provide.
5.	Do not encroach on the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine: There’s enough land to build the housing that Ontario needs for 30 years. Even BILD has said they don’t need Greenbelt. This file stinks; any self-respecting MPP or Councillor should immediately distance themselves from these hand-picked, unjustifiable Greenbelt land removals.
6.	Protect Wetlands, Natural Heritage, Species at Risk and Ontario from the inevitable risks of Climate Change! It is unfathomable that we even need to say this. Southern Ontario is an “ecoregion in crisis”. Removing more natural features here and adding protections to lands elsewhere obviously isn’t going to improve our ecoregion. Do not change the OWES wetland evaluation system. Maintain strong prohibitions on alteration of landscape in Ontario’s Natural Heritage System (NHS) and its features in the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS). Do not allow offsets, trades, or “compensation” agreements. Capitalize on the free service provided via natural asset management instead of infrastructure and capital intensive engineered solutions.
7.	Allow Members of the Public and CA to appeal Official Plan, Zoning Bylaw Amendments and Sprawl Proposals to the Ontario Lands Tribunal. Make the playing field level once more by providing the same rights to both project proponents and community players interested in challenging and/or improving planning proposals/Official Plans. Consider threshold levels to reduce appeals abusing the process.
8.	Do not override Official Plans. For better or worse they are far more democratic than the proposals flowing out of the government of Ontario at this time.
9.	Maintain the PPS & Growth Plan, its density requirements, and support rational infrastructure phasing policies to make the best use of limited taxpayer and developer dollars.
FULL SUBMISSION
The Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA) has indicated that Bill 23 is the most extensive and biggest package of legislative changes they have seen in over ten years. We do not offer an analysis as it is impossible to do with our limited resources and time given. We do express our support and agreement from the groups listed in Appendix 1 who have made statements and have or will submit comments on Bill 23 and the various Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) postings. We acknowledge there may be good elements in the Bill but we are overwhelmed by the magnitude of regressive changes and fail to see how they are in the public interest in a climate emergency and affordable housing crisis. Some quotes for perspective.
“The proposed changes in Bill 23 will create a number of unintended consequences which roll back 70 years of successful conservation authority watershed management at a time when we need this work more than ever in order to address the growing impacts of climate change .” Conservation Ontario.
“Preliminary analysis of the Bill indicates the transfer of up to $1 billion a year in costs from private sector developers to property taxpayers without any likelihood of improved housing affordability. Similarly, the bill’s provisions designed to reduce environmental protection will benefit developers in the short term, with costs to the public and homeowners that cannot be calculated .
Members of the Committee and all Members of the Provincial Parliament will need to consider in whose interest they govern. Bill 23, as drafted, benefits private interests at the expense of public interests – at the expense of property taxpayers and Ontario’s natural environment.” AMO.
TIMING IS ANTI DEMOCRATIC AND HOSTILE TO STAKEHOLDERS
Recommendation: Slow down the process.
On October 25th, 2022  the day after municipal elections were held across Ontario’s 444 municipalities, the current government introduced Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act and posted numerous notices for public consultation on the ERO. Additional notices were posted on November 4th approving York Region  and other municipal Official Plans as well as proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Act and redesignation of land under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act . Then 2 weeks later, on the day before the inaugural Council meetings of Niagara, Peel and York Regions, Bill 39 was introduced .
New Councils have not yet been formed, and have not been able to meet to approve or formulate responses to the Province. The Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO), representing Ontario’s municipalities, was not provided an opportunity to present to the Legislature’s Standing Committee on Heritage and Culture at the Bill 23 hearings. The official opposition did invite them to present their submission and it was shared with all MPPs .
Voters, especially those in two tier - regional governments, had no indication that the responsibilities of regional governance would fundamentally change or that the province would be appointing Chairs , likely extending Strong Mayor Powers to unelected Chairs of their choosing or initiate an ‘assessment’ of regional governance . It is unfortunate that the public went to the polls and elected a regional council without the knowledge that the province was going to fundamentally change regional governance.  The province conducted a 2019 Regional Governance Review, which was never acted upon and the recommendations remain confidential advice to cabinet .  The public does not know if what your government is proposing is consistent with the advice provided in that review. Thus there is no evidence, available to the public, to support the need for the aggressive changes to regional governance.
GREENBELT REMOVALS IN YORK REGION
Recommendation: Keep your promise; do not remove lands from the Greenbelt and be transparent about the downgrading that has already commenced.
Why are so many Greenbelt removals being proposed now outside of the ten-year review period, especially when a Greenbelt review and land removals were completed in 2017? The Ontario Government has quite simply lied to the people of Ontario by proposing to remove portions of the Greenbelt. Seven of the fifteen Greenbelt land removals and the only Oak Ridges Moraine land-use redesignation   are located in York Region.
King Township lands:
The Greenbelt removal in King Township has received significant media attention due to the timing of land transactions and a motion by King Council in support of the Greenbelt removal to facilitate a new Southlake hospital. It is unclear if the province is aware or supportive of the hospital proposal, if this is Southlake’s preferred site or even a candidate site. There is also much concern about who knew what and when? The removal of Greenbelt protection and subsequent re-zoning would increase land value above the purchase price of $80M last September .
Upper York has no servicing capacity to give, existing 2010 growth can’t be fully serviced and the Upper York Sewage System, now abandoned, was supposed to be the solution for this growth. It is implausible that the lands in King Township would be an eligible candidate for new housing development; northern York Region doesn’t have a servicing capacity solution for what was just approved in the new Official Plan. Why do Minister Clark and the Mayor of King believe these lands meet the eligibility criteria for Greenbelt removal and that servicing capacity could be prioritized and feasible, ahead of all other development projects awaiting servicing allocation?
Markham and Vaughan Greenbelt Removals Plus Downgrading Greenbelt NHS:
The Greenbelt removals in Vaughan and Markham are adjacent to, or contain Greenbelt ‘fingers’ that are part of Ontario’s NHS and had land use designations downgraded from prime agriculture to rural to allow active parkland uses when Minister Clark approved York Region's Official Plan . These removals combined with Minister Clark’s recent decision in the Official Plan are not consistent with the Greenbelt Plan and do not uphold previous tribunal decisions that clearly identify that expansion of urban boundaries is not permitted into the Greenbelt NHS . Are accessory uses such as parks that support adjacent developments a settlement expansion in the Greenbelt NHS?
The Ontario government appears to have little regard for compliance with its own policies. The current government’s defense for inaction on Climate Change  is, in part, because it is a policy that can’t be enforced. We are fearful that this attitude is percolating into land use planning, resulting in the destruction of Ontario’s NHS; a policy, not a land use designation protected by regulation . The combination of the multitude of legislative changes that reduce natural heritage protection - ie. redefining wetlands could permit the dumping of soil of questionable quality, combined with a  reduction in  resources and legislated authority of independent government-paid subject matters to comment and approve land use decisions, appears to leave little oversight or protection. This leaves us extremely fearful that even the portions of the Greenbelt that remain intact will fail to be protected due to multiple threats, undermining the purpose and intent of the Greenbelt Plan.
The general public does not yet understand that this government has already downgraded Greenbelt protection in York and Peel Regions Official Plan Approvals by downgrading land use designations. This is not a removal but it is a lowering of protection that does not require a change to provincial regulations. York Region’s Official Plan also concerns several alarming changes that indicate the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act regulations will be changed to allow future urban development in Vaughan and Stouffville. There’s also reference that some existing developments which meet certain criteria may not need to comply with certain requirements of the ORM Conservation Plan . The government has failed to analyze the cumulative impacts of localized and province wide decisions and legislative changes.
PROVINCIAL POLICY IN DISARRAY, DISREGARDED, DISRESPECTED
Recommendation: Provide evidence-based rationale for policy changes & clean up your own house first
The changes, even simple administrative matters, do not appear well thought out. It seems implausible that the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (the Ministry) has or will have the capacity, staff and administrative processes in place to be the approval authority for lower tier Official Plans and Amendments. The Ministry hasn’t provided basic data on whether the Growth Plan is effective or ineffective, if municipalities are meeting greenfield density targets or have adequate housing supply approved in the pipe-line . This Ontario government has failed to provide reasonable evidence supported by data, facts or figures province-wide to justify such broad sweeping legislative changes.
Provincial ministries with conservation, preservation, endangered species protection remain critically underfunded. The province has failed to address recommendations and shortcomings brought forward by the former Environmental Commissioner and now the Auditor General . Illegal land use is rampant on prime agricultural land, trees are being felled illegally . Our bylaws  and penalties are ineffective, the province is absent or worse giving approvals in the absence of approved zoning and then expecting by-law officers to enforce nuisance and traffic impacts. The changes to CA’s will leave Ontario’s Natural Heritage vulnerable and exposed because there will be no publicly funded institutions with sufficient resources left to speak, and act to protect our natural heritage. It is reckless to make these changes in the absence of any real and meaningful attempts to address the already identified shortcomings that have forced CA’s to take on the very roles the province seeks to or has already eliminated.
MASSIVE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR MUNICIPALITIES
Recommendation: Consult with AMO and municipalities to ensure these changes do not bankrupt municipalities and do not affect the levels of services and park land that Ontarians have come to expect.
Municipal staff are warning of staggering losses as a result of reduction in development fees; the City of Markham estimates that property taxes would have to increase by 50 to 80 percent just  to maintain existing services . It is foolish to believe that smaller municipalities with less resources will have or be able to obtain specialized staff with the expertise to adhere to  specialized specific provincial policy plans and the knowledge to protect residents from natural hazards. Contracting out these services opens up a whole other set of administrative, financial and accountability issues that again do not appear well thought out. Reducing parkland requirements is the exact opposite of what we learn that we need most for our communities during the pandemic.
CONSERVATION AUTHORITIES
Recommendation: Allow Conservation Authorities to maintain their current role in permitting in regulated areas and allow them to conserve land and reduce pollution via land use planning review and  permits.
Ontario residents trust CA’s because they have demonstrated they have the staff, expertise and resources to comment on complex planning applications with environmental and natural hazard risks. Further, they have been responsible stewards for the conservation and preservation of the lands entrusted to them. To direct CA’s to put a list of land together suitable for development is nonsensical. Land comes into their ownership because it has been donated with expectations of having conservation status in perpetuity, or the lands contain environmentally significant features and natural hazards that require protection.
UPPER YORK SEWAGE SYSTEM
Recommendation: We support the Williams Treaties First Nations in their comment that a full Environmental Assessment of the southbound Duffins Creek route is needed.
We are pleased that the Upper York Sewage Treatment Plant is not proceeding, that the government recognizes the sensitive health of Lake Simcoe, the need to proceed expeditiously with the phosphorus reduction plant and the necessity of compliance with the Lake Simcoe Protection Act and Plan. However, it is frustrating that $100M has been spent on the Upper York Sewage System Environmental Assessment with little to show.  It is unreasonable to transfer this growth to Durham residents in the absence of a full Environmental Assessment and to suggest that York Region staff will be able to accomplish anything to approve and achieve the old or new growth targets set by the Province in the near future. Staff has been told to start over, develop a solution to deliver a third expansion of the York-Durham Duffins Creek Treatment Plant and pump water against elevations of 100m (twice the height of Niagara Falls). We are no further ahead to achieving growth in upper York.
Upper York Region is a case study in what not to do in infrastructure planning with stranded assets and unrealized growth creating burdens on capital budgets because development fees can’t be collected . This is a direct result of provincial inaction and inadequate, non-existent provincial support and resources provided to municipalities but still demanding growth targets be met . It is setting municipalities up to fail and Bill 23 will formally shift the blame for not achieving growth targets onto a lower level of government with no recourse to respond because they are ‘creatures of the province’ not recognized in the Canadian Constitution. It is unfair.
CONCLUSION
If Bill 23 is passed in its current form then the Ontario government will have failed to listen to professionals, subject matter experts, and ignored science and established best practices. It will have failed to protect land that will be critically important to reducing the impacts and adapting to climate change - CA regulated land, the Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine. They will have failed to provide the type and diversity of housing needed by Ontario’s most vulnerable communities. The implications of Bill 23 place unacceptable fiscal and legal risk upon the Government of Ontario, municipalities and taxpayers -  it is short-sighted and reckless.
We urge you to slow down.  Do not pass Bill 23 or the proposed Greenbelt removals . Consult properly, and do the job that only the government can do: protect the public interest.

I believe the Significant Wildlife Habitat (SWH) ecoregion schedules can be a useful way of identifying areas of importance for wildlife, including those that use wetlands. It may be able to identify areas that the MNR and CWS have not already identified. However, there are several issues with the SWH ecoregion schedules that should be addressed before relying on them to score sections 4.2.2-4.2.5.
One issue I have is using some of the fieldwork protocols outlined in the ecoregion schedules to assess the bird-related SWH criteria for several reasons. First off, the SWH ecoregion schedules tells the evaluator to follow the protocols outlined in the Birds and bird habitats: guidelines for windpower projects. https://www.ontario.ca/page/birds-and-bird-habitats-guidelines-windpowe… The guideline relates to windpower projects, not SWH, and does not seem appropriate to use. Second, none of the bird SWH criteria in the ecoregion schedules specifies which protocols in the Birds and bird habitats: guidelines for windpower projects to actually use. The guideline is an assemblage of different protocols, which can make it difficult for the evaluator to know which one to use. This can result in inaccurate results, especially if the evaluator is inexperienced in performing these types of surveys. Third, the timing windows to do surveys in some of the SWH criteria can be too broad to observe the species. This can lead to missing the target species during the surveys. For example, for the landbird migratory stopover areas, the SWH ecoregion schedules 6E and 7E say the surveys can be done starting at the beginning of April. In Southern Ontario, this is not an appropriate time to survey landbirds, since very few species are in Ontario at that time. Surveying then will almost certainly result in the study area coming out as not confirmed for SWH, especially if evaluators only do the bare minimum number of surveys.
All the reasons I state above will result in inconsistency in how the fieldwork is completed.
A second issue with the SWH ecoregion schedules is the ambiguous language used for assessing sites as confirmed SWH. Confirming many of the breeding bird SWH criteria (e.g., section 4.2.3 waterfowl breeding) often requires that evaluators observe “nesting pairs”. As an ornithologist, this is confusing since “nesting pairs” does not state what level of breeding evidence is needed (possible, probable, or confirmed breeding evidence under the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas https://www.birdsontario.org/breeding-codes/). Most ornithologists rely on these evidence codes to collect data. The ambiguous language in the ecoregion schedules very likely will result in evaluators inconsistently assessing sites for confirmed SWH.
I strongly suggest improving the survey protocols and the ambiguous language in the SWH ecoregion schedules before using them to assess sections 4.2.2-4.2.5 in the OWES manual.
It is also necessary to provide training to evaluators in how to complete and assess SWH assessments for wetlands so there’s consistency.
For section 4.2.5, there is no SWH criterion for raptor stopover habitat. How are surveyors supposed to assess it without a criterion? This change effectively eliminates the ability for evaluators to assess a wetland for raptor stopover habitat. I suggest maintaining the areas that the MNR or CWS has already identified.
I have serious concerns with wetland evaluators now doing these SWH assessments. Wetland evaluators require botanical identification skills amongst others. Now, they also must be able to identify birds too. I know many botanists; very few of them also have strong bird identification skills, let alone have any experience also doing the targeted SWH surveys in the OWES manual. I strongly suggest you also allow surveyors with specialized skills to contribute to the evaluation process.
Also, will wetland evaluators now receive training on how to do SWH assessments as part of their certifications?
Comments for Sections 4.1.2.1-4.1.2.2
I am very concerned about the removal of sections related to threatened or endangered species. What is the justification for doing this? Wetlands that support threatened or endangered species are generally less common in the landscape and would be more significant than those that don’t.

72475,/comment/72475,"I cannot support a government whose policies are so narrow minded and Dismissive toward our environment. I am deeply concerned with their proposed changes to policies regarding wetland evaluation. After reading the proposed changes I have made some notes:
Owes has already completed the assessment of significant wetlands, using tried and true methods created to allow unwarranted destruction of the said lands. The assessment was made in two parts:
a) determine the wetlands that are significant, and
b) determine the boundaries of significant wetlands.
As these assessments were made by highly qualified individuals with vast knowledge of the significance of wetlands, it is counter productive to open up reviews on the assessments.
The Ontario government is proposing to usurp these assessments not because they feel they were unfairly or improperly done. They are doing so to feed these sensitive areas to developers under the guise of providing more housing. More housing is definitely needed, but not at the cost of our environment. They can and must build these houses in unused or vacant properties that lie within the municipal boundaries. There are plenty of these areas readily available to them. They must also look at creating more dense developments and halt further urban sprawl.
In this legislation, the government proposes “to allow for further streamlining of development decisions by removing the requirement for the ministry to review and confirm wetland evaluation results.” In other words, they propose to remove the ministry’s ability to assess wetlands prior to decisions being made to allow development. This is absolutely unacceptable. Keep the ministry reviews in place, do not allow developers to make decisions that they lack the knowledge to make.
Under the proposed changes to Owes evaluation document is this one:
“All wetland units that were previously evaluated as part of a wetland complex do not need to be re-evaluated at the same time. There is no requirement to update the wetland evaluation that applied to an entire wetland complex. The evaluation is considered a point-in-time document used to assign a status (significant or not) to each wetland that the evaluation covered (i.e., all wetland units that had previously been complexed together). Previous wetland evaluation documentation can be used as a source of information when re- evaluating a formerly complexed wetland unit.”
This is particularly disturbing as it then allows a previously assessed wetland system to be attacked and possibly developed bit by bit. It is an attack of attrition that will lead to diminishing wetlands as urban areas encroach ever closer to the heart of every wetland system.
Immediately following this proposal is another that is equally disturbing:
“Mapping updates to previously evaluated wetlands: Wetlands are dynamic natural systems and the outer boundary of a wetland can be updated if new information becomes available or if the extent of the wetland on the land changes. A mapping update can be undertaken without undertaking a re- evaluation. Evaluations are point-in-time assessments to determine a wetland’s status (significant or not) and are not to be ‘updated’. At times decision makers may require a re-evaluation of the wetland to confirm its status.
As wetlands are, as said, dynamic and have ever changing boundaries it seems inconceivable to allow reassessment of their boundaries because what is really being said is the government wants to shrink those boundaries when urban sprawl meets them.”
Further on in the document another proposed change is puzzling:
“Although site visits are an important part of any wetland evaluation, it is not expected that a wetland evaluator will traverse the entire wetland. Existing information prepared from earlier field visits allow the evaluator to utilize information collected about the site
_____________________________________________________________________ Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System 2022-10-25
                                  10
by others.”
Who are “others?” If, by others, the government is referring to third parties paid by developers, then this action is not acceptable. Leave the evaluation process as it is to maintain impartiality.
Soon after this change was proposed, the government stated that a completed evaluation must be considered an open file. In other words, no matter what the evaluation, a wetland will never be safe from developers. It is a totally unacceptable position and one that assures continued urban encroachment.
In my reading of this document, it is blatantly apparent that the government has declared open season on wetland protection in favour of uncontrolled development. Housing at any cost is irresponsible and will cause wide reaching and irreversible damage to the environment that we depend on for our existence.
",comments-31.json
72481,/comment/72481,"I am commenting to implore the Ontario Conservative government to abandon Bill 23 and the irreversible damage it will do to the province's wetlands and ecological integrity. While Ontario needs more housing, it is imperative that we proceed with sustainable solutions that consider long-term impacts and consequences. This bill will allow for virtually unrestricted development in sensitive wetland habitat which are critical to the survival of countless Threatened and Endangered species, and which provide crucial ecosystem services such as flood protection and carbon sequestration. Over 70% of Ontario's wetlands have already been destroyed by agricultural and urban development. Species-at-risk that depend on these wetlands cannot sustain further loss of habitat. Bill 23 will single handedly lead to the extirpation of species from their Ontario ranges, undermining the ecological integrity of our ecosystems. We do not exist in a vacuum and humans cannot survive without a functioning ecosystem providing services to us. This has been demonstrated time and time again, as climate change ravages our planet and natural disasters become more and more frequent. An ecosystem missing some of its members will not serve us in a way that is sustainable for future generations. The Ontario Conservative government’s proposal to allow developers to build in wetlands is irresponsible to say the least. These wetlands absorb runoff and are critical to reducing and mitigating flood impacts. As climate change increases the frequency and severity of storms, wetlands will be more important than ever for absorbing runoff.  By building on wetlands, not only will developers be building houses that are prone to flooding, risking the health and safety of their occupants, they will also be increasing the risk of flooding for existing homes in the surrounding area. Elevated runoff into nearby water bodies will also increase pollution, potentially contaminating community water sources and poisoning aquatic wildlife. Furthermore, in this era of climate action, Bill 23 will increase Ontario’s carbon output. Wetlands sequester carbon by preventing its breakdown in waterlogged soils. By draining wetlands for development, all of the carbon currently stored in the wetlands will be released to the atmosphere via decomposition and contribute to the world’s accelerating climate crisis. Artificial wetlands cannot, under any circumstances, serve as a substitute for natural wetlands; they cannot provide a similar level of services due to stark differences in their physical properties and much reduced biodiversity.
This policy is incredibly short-sighted and irresponsible. Who will help the families who move into these homes and experience flooding, or the families who have lived in their homes for decades and suddenly experience flooding because the ground can no longer hold enough water? If Ontario needs more housing it needs to be done right; we need to focus on building up not out, and development should only occur in upland areas. Conservation Authorities should not be muzzled – they should be able to share their expertise in order for politicians and authorities to make the best-informed decisions. Ignoring the facts about environmental health, climate change, and biodiversity loss, will only harm us in the long run. Do not let the short-term profit of a small number of people outweigh the health and safety of our entire province in the long-term.

The proposed increase in housing is tempting for young professionals, but this bill will ultimately result in future costs that cannot be made up for by short-term thinking. I, therefore, voice my concern over the lack of foresight this bill proposes and demand a re-evaluation that accommodates long-term community development and sets a standard for urban development in Ontario, and Canada.

72497,/comment/72497,"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the “Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System” (ERO#019-6160).
Kettle Creek Conservation Authority (KCCA), is one of 36 conservation authorities (CAs) in Ontario which deliver programs and services that protect and manage water and other natural resources in partnership with a variety of stakeholders, including government, landowners, and other organizations. In 2011, CAs developed a standardized method of reporting on the health of the natural resources within watersheds known as Watershed Report Cards. These reports provide a better understanding of local environmental issues helping to guide the best use of resources and can track progress over time.
KCCA’s 2018 Watershed Report Card provided details on the state of wetland cover in the Kettle Creek Watershed. Only 1.34% of the entire Kettle Creek watershed is wetland habitat – earning an “F Grade” – emphasizing how devastating historical human impacts, such as development activities and agricultural practices have had on wetland cover.
Wetlands have many ecological benefits, but wetlands also provide flood and drought mitigation making them important tools in climate change mitigation. KCCA’s watershed is characterized by flash floods and highly erosive characteristics. Rain events in the upper reaches of the watershed can reach Lake Erie within 12 hours, deeply cutting valleys and eroding the landscape as it rushes through the system. The flashy nature of the watershed is only worsening.
Wetlands hold significant volume of snow melt and rain which reduces flood levels during spring runoff and storm events. They also release this water slowly throughout the rest of the year, helping augment water levels in lakes and rivers during low flow periods which reduces drought conditions. Consequently, KCCA works with landowners to maintain and enhance the amount of wetland cover in the watershed – in an effort to increase flood capacity and retain water on the land during drought conditions.
Every wetland in the watershed is a valuable and essential piece of green infrastructure, with the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change. For these reasons, land use planning tools such as the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System must remain robust and comprehensive to provide the best available information to municipalities, the province and conservation authorities. Likewise, the wetland evaluation framework must continue to ensure that wetlands which are provincially significant are protected and evaluations of all wetlands remain robust and accessible.
Consequently, KCCA supports Conservation Ontario’s comments on this posting. Specifically, KCCA recommends that the section of the OWES Manuals titled “Wetland Complexes” as well as all references to wetland complexes/complexing be retained. KCCA also recommends that the proposed “Re-evaluation of previously evaluated wetland complexes” be amended to state that re-evaluation of wetland complexes may only occur through a complete re-evaluation of all units in the existing wetland complex, and that the status of a wetland complex (e.g., significant or not) may only change based on a re-evaluation of the complete wetland complex (i.e., all units that were previously evaluated as part of the wetland complex must be re-evaluated at the same time).  Very small wetlands that work together as a complex can provide habitat for wildlife or serve other important ecological, hydrological, hydrogeological or social functions.
Wetland complexes are interconnected wetlands that work in concert. Separating them would impact the whole. In the Kettle Creek watershed, 70% of provincially significant wetlands are “wetland complexes”. Without the ability to define them as complexes many of these wetland features may be lost to development pressures and/or agricultural expansions. With just 1.34% wetland cover, the watershed cannot afford to lose any of its existing wetlands. Strong and resilient natural ecosystems help us adapt to many different challenges including the impacts of climate change, rapid urbanization, threatened biodiversity, and increased pollution.
KCCA encourages the province to pause implementation of the proposed changes to OWES Manuals and conduct meaningful consultation with stakeholders to ensure the proposed changes do not irreparably harm natural infrastructure that is integral to local efforts to combat the impacts of a changing climate including flooding and erosion.

72499,/comment/72499,"Algonquin to Adirondacks Collaborative response to ERO posting #019-6160
Re: ERO posting #019-6160, Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetlands Evaluation System
The Algonquin to Adirondacks (A2A) Collaborative is a Canadian, U.S. and First Nations organization of over 50 partners that works with scientists, policy-makers and a variety of conservation groups to protect and enhance the unique ecological features and functions of the region stretching from and encompassing Algonquin Park in Ontario and Adirondack Park in New York State. The following comments are unanimously submitted by the Board of Directors of the A2A Collaborative:
We are especially concerned with the protection of wetlands, as two-thirds of these critical ecological features have already been lost in Southern Ontario. Unfortunately, the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetlands Evaluation System (OWES) in ERO posting #019-6160 would dramatically reduce the protection of wetlands in the province, and must be withdrawn.
ERO posting #019-6160
In ERO posting #019-6160, the Ontario government proposes to make major changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) in order to “support the construction of 1.5 million new housing units over the next ten years”. We strongly oppose such changes to the OWES. Wetlands must not be destroyed or compromised to build housing developments.
Southern Ontario’s wetlands are critical for wildlife habitat, water quality and flood reduction. Unfortunately, two thirds of Southern Ontario’s wetlands (including many in the A2A region) have already been lost due to development of various kinds over many decades. The importance of protecting the remaining third has been widely recognized for many years.
Ontario already has sufficient lands available to accommodate present and foreseeable housing, without the need to sacrifice sensitive natural areas such as wetlands. Indeed, the Ontario government’s own Housing Affordability Task Force has concluded that “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem” and “Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected” (Housing Affordability Task Force Report, 2022, p. 10). New housing developments must not be built on or adjacent to our remaining wetlands, and must not be located where they may compromise wetland functions.
The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) determines which wetlands are considered “significant” and establishes the boundaries of significant wetlands. It is a highly-regarded, science-based tool. The proposed changes in ERO posting #019-6160 would alter how the OWES identifies Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs), and would make it more difficult for wetlands to qualify as PSWs in the future, and result in the de-designation of many existing PSWs.
The proposed changes to the OWES would greatly reduce the evaluation and protection of wetlands. The Rideau Valley Conservation Authority (RVCA), in the A2A region, has stated that these changes would lead to “increased flooding, erosion and drought, as well as diminished groundwater, which is the source of drinking water in much of rural Ontario. Studies have shown the loss of wetlands in the Rideau watershed would increase flood levels by 10%” (RVCA website, Nov. 10, 2022).
Of particular concern is the proposed change that would eliminate the use of ”wetland complexes” (two or more wetlands that are functionally linked, but separated by a non-wetland area) in evaluating and designating significant wetlands. Many organizations with expertise in wetland conservation have expressed alarm at this proposal. For example, the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority (NPCA) has stated that “The removal of complexing along with the other proposed changes to the OWES would result in the eventual chipping away of our wetland complexes in Niagara. In the NPCA’s jurisdiction, there are over 170 wetlands that have been evaluated, with more than 135 evaluated as wetland complexes. With the above changes this means that almost 80% of the NPCA’s wetlands that are currently evaluated as complexes could be negatively impacted” (NPCA comments on ERO postings, NPCA website, Nov. 7, 2022).
The proposed changes would also eliminate scoring of habitat for Endangered or Threatened species, a critical element in evaluating wetlands.
Overall, the proposed changes would have a devastating impact on Ontario’s wetlands and species at risk, and must therefore be withdrawn.
Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022
The proposals in ERO posting #019-6160 are directly linked to the government’s Bill 23, which contains many additional proposals that would directly or indirectly affect wetlands. For example, Bill 23 proposes to greatly limit input to planning processes by Conservation Authorities (CAs), which currently play a major role in protection of watersheds, wetlands and in flood mitigation.
The proposed “offsetting” policy is also of grave concern. It is supposed to compensate for the loss of wetlands and other natural areas due to development, by recreating these features elsewhere or allowing the developer to simply pay into a compensation fund. There is no evidence that such schemes actually work. Destroyed wetlands cannot simply be recreated elsewhere.
All provisions of Bill 23 that would negatively affect wetlands must be removed.
A2A has commented more fully on the many negative aspects of Bill 23 in a separate submission to the Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy.
Lack of public and stakeholder consultation
There was no meaningful consultation with the general public, First Nations, Conservation Authorities or municipalities before the proposals in ERO posting #019-6160 or in Bill 23 were put forward. This is unacceptable.
Conclusions
To protect Southern Ontario’s remaining wetlands, we ask that:
•	ERO posting #019-6160 on the OWES be withdrawn.
•	All proposals in Bill 23 that would the affect the identification, designation or protection of wetlands, or that would reduce the role of Conservation Authorities be removed.
•	The government fully consult with the public, First Nations, Conservation Authorities and municipalities before any proposals that affect wetlands are put forward.

Yes Ontario needs to build more housing, but doing so by changing the policies that protect our important wetlands is not the way to do it. Removing environmemtal oversight, stripping Conservation Authorities of their ability to advise, and allowing wetland boundaries to be remapped is foolish and irresponsible.
Furthermore, allowing consultants, hired by developers, to recommend if wetlands should lose protected status is a conflict of interest.
Removing endangered species from the scoring system in determining significant wetlands is extremely irresponsible.
Allowing developers to carve pieces out of protected wetlands and flood other areas to “compensate” the damage is disgraceful.

",comments-31.json
72505,/comment/72505,"I am gravely concerned about the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES).
The proposed updates to the OWES suggest removing some scoring criteria, while wetlands must still meet the same score to be considered provincially significant. The updates also include no longer allowing wetlands to be grouped together as a wetland complex but instead treating each wetland as its own entity. With this proposed change wetland units on their own will unlikely meet the criteria to be provincially significant and may be open for development. This could inevitably open the door to wetland complexes with pre-exiting Provincially Significant Wetland (PSW) status being re-evaluated and stripped of their provincially significant designation.
As such the negative impacts this could present to critical natural habitat and threatened and endangered species, would put them further at risk.
This this is without question putting developers and land speculators ahead of environmental protections that safeguard people’s health, homes and livelihoods.
In years gone by wetlands have been drained, altered or destroyed due to farming, housing, roads  construction, and other development. In some ways this is almost excusable due to a lack of understanding regarding the services wetlands provide and the impact such destruction could have.
Land-use and planning mistakes made in the past led to the creation of laws, regulations, and plans to restore and protect wetlands in Ontario.
Wetlands are among the most valuable ecosystems on the planet!
We know wetlands are vital for biodiversity, to purify the air so we can breathe properly, cycle nutrients so we have access to clean drinking water without costly infrastructure, reduce flooding by acting like natural sponges that absorb water to prevent floods, help buffer against drought, pollinate our crops so we don't go hungry as well as capture and store carbon dioxide in vegetation  and so much more. Once damaged or destroyed, the carbon wetlands were storing is released into the atmosphere and is impossible to recapture. This makes wetlands a most effective and long-term nature-based approach to mitigating climate change that should not be dismissed.
Wetlands are economically important to Ontario. They are popular places for recreational activities, such as hunting, hiking, canoeing, and bird-watching which is a tourism draw. Nature tourism is a huge economic contributor and helps support communities in rural and remote areas. This translates to employment opportunities as well.
Today, equipped with the best possible science based information available and a much better understanding of the services wetlands provide and our dependence on them. We have no excuse but to be good stewards to wetlands. Finding ways to bypass wetland protection through revising the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System so access can be gained to protected wetlands for development is going backwards and gambling with our future.
Filling in wetlands to build is about short sighted gain. When wetlands are filled, the water that makes them wet has to go somewhere. They do not easily support development. The soil is wet, spongy, and difficult to build on. There are chances that a home built will settle or suffer from seepage problems and drainage issues in the long run. Filling in a wetland and thinking the matter of water running it’s natural course is dealt with or outmaneuvered is an uphill battle just begun.
Developers carving away at even small wetlands may benefit but homeowners will be left with the problems created such as flooding and drought damage, nutrient runoff, water pollution, and shoreline erosion. Buyer beware!
Volumes could be written on why wetlands are important.They are genius by design and the varied services and provisions provided for the mere cost of being stewards to the wetlands. It is estimated it would cost trillions of dollars to replicate the services provided and it would be impossible to duplicate many.
The ecosystem services wetlands provide make life possible! We depend on healthy ecosystems to sustain our way of life. Moving forward we should be very much focused on wetland conservation and management and build on land already designated for development.
Please leave the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) as is and Focus on wetland conservation instead of destruction.

72509,/comment/72509,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s proposal to amend the Conservation Authorities Act. I am writing to you in response to Bill 23, the More Homes Built Faster Act.
I understand and agree that there is a housing supply and affordability issue in Ontario that needs to be pragmatically addressed, and therefore support the government’s commitment to reducing unnecessary barriers to development and streamlining processes. That said, I have several concerns and recommendations with the proposed amendments and therefore offer the following comments for your consideration in amending the Conservation Authorities (CA) Act and any associated documents.
Ontario Wetland Evaluation System Classification Changes
Wetlands play a critical role in a healthy, functional environment. Changing the classification system will mean further wetland loss and may result in serious flooding, putting the safety of communities at risk. Wetlands are a natural, cost-effective strategy for protecting downstream properties from floods, adapting to climate change, and retaining water to lessen drought impacts. By changing the classification system, existing Provincially Significant Wetlands could lose their status and un-evaluated wetlands are unlikely to meet the standard for additional protection.  This could lead to wetlands  being filled in, resulting in loss of habitat and numerous species, decreased storage area for water resulting in decreased flood storage but increased potential for erosion, and poorer water quality. These losses will have detrimental effects on tourism and recreation industries. Loss of wetlands will also result in the necessity of more stormwater ponds which require more maintenance and monitoring than wetlands. The government must be prudent when considering changes like offsetting, which could negatively affect the ability of wetlands to reduce flooding and confuse roles in wetland management and protection between municipalities and CAs.
I recommend that:
•	The province re-engage the multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group and work with the working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and develop better alternatives, prior to proceeding with current proposed amendments.
Potential Loss of CA Lands
Minister of Natural Resources Graydon Smith has told media outlets that conservation authorities are “the second largest landowner after the Crown” and have been asked to “evaluate” their land in order to identify areas for housing development. In most instances, these lands have been acquired for specific purposes; typically, lands are purchased to protect the public from flooding and erosion or the lands are left through estate donations to the Conservation Authority by members of the public who wished their private lands stay natural. The development of these natural spaces will have numerous negative implications on the natural environment and a community’s ability to adapt to climate change. Further, the local tourism and recreation industries that rely on these spaces will feel the effects as will individuals of the public of who could experience negative social, mental & physical health impacts.
I recommend that:
•	The province focus efforts on building up urban areas instead of urban sprawl outwards;
•	Municipal Official Plans continue to be followed as written; and
•	Lands identified as natural hazards be maintained as open space.
Prohibition of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Review Agreements
It is unclear how this proposed change will benefit taxpayers.  Conservation Authorities have demonstrated for decades these services can be delivered efficiently, without lengthening the approval process, and is a cost-savings measure for municipalities who can share the cost of this review amongst all CA member-municipalities, rather than hiring staff at each municipality.  As proposed, the consequence appears to be either an increase in taxes as municipalities hire additional staff, a longer review process resulting from municipalities coordinating with neighboring municipalities, the cost of consultants needed for peer-review and the loss of land use plan review and comments provided on a watershed basis. Although the logistics of how this change will occur are unclear, one thing for certain is that this proposed change will also likely result in loss of jobs: Many staff at Conservation Authorities across the province will no longer be required. While currently unclear, if these reviews are no longer required, further job losses can be anticipated for municipal staff, engineers, and consultants who prepare various reports. Another negative implication of this proposed amendment is that studies, such as Environmental Impact Statements, now required to be completed by qualified consultants, could be overlooked or that staff at the municipal level will not have the expertise or capacity to review and comment on report submissions.  It is important to note that Conservation Authorities support smart development.
I recommend that:
•	Municipalities should retain the option to enter into MOUs with CAs, with clearly defined terms, timelines and performance measures, as allowed under Section 21.1.1 (1) of the CA Act;
•	Development should be limited to municipal urban boundaries; and
•	The Province re-engage the multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group and work with the working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and to develop guidance for commenting where a CA has entered into an agreement or MOU.
Low Risk Development Permit Exemptions
It is currently unclear how the proposed exemption of a permit requirement for low-risk development will benefit the people of Ontario. Details are lacking to determine whether the purpose is to transfer this permit responsibility from CAs to municipalities or whether development considered ‘low-risk’ will be exempt from requiring a permit all together.  As currently proposed, this amendment results in a lack of protection for the people of Ontario and a lack of watershed oversight.  I feel it is important to mention that CAs do not exist to hinder development, rather their role is to protect the people of Ontario and their properties. Therefore CAs ensure development is done in a manner to afford this protection. This proposed amendment has many negative implications for the people of Ontario as it quashes the core function of a CA and fragments the CA role in protecting the people of Ontario from natural hazards.
I recommend that:
•	This proposed amendment be repealed to keep all hazard-related responsibilities with the CA.
Fee Freezing
The details of the proposed amendments remain unclear at this time. It is important to note that current fees were established according to provincial direction, and were intended to recover costs, so as to decrease municipal levies.  Freezing fees will impose additional costs to municipalities, meaning taxpayers will end up paying these development costs. Another negative implication of this proposed change is created when fee revenues are used to pay wages.  Without a cost recovery system in place, the staff compliment required to perform application reviews becomes unaffordable to CA’s as fee revenues would be used, in part, to pay wages.  This will ultimately slow down the approvals process in these times of increased development.
I recommend that:
•	This proposed amendment be repealed to allow CAs to charge fees according to their internal cost-based analyses; or
•	This proposal be further amended to require CAs to demonstrate fees do not exceed the cost to deliver the program and have the ability to freeze fees when cost recovery exceeds 100 percent.
To ensure the most effective implementation of this Bill, I believe it is crucial that the government halts the proposed changes and meet with CAs to clarify and consider more effective alternatives. This consultation is imperative to safeguard the best possible outcomes for the people of Ontario.

They are doing so to feed these sensitive areas to developers under the guise of providing more housing. More housing is definitely needed, but not at the cost of our environment. They can and must build these houses in unused or vacant properties that lie within the municipal boundaries. There are plenty of these areas readily available to them. They must also look at creating more dense developments and halt further urban sprawl.
In this legislation, the government proposes “to allow for further streamlining of development decisions by removing the requirement for the ministry to review and confirm wetland evaluation results.” In other words, they propose to remove the ministry’s ability to assess wetlands prior to decisions being made to allow development. This is absolutely unacceptable. Keep the ministry reviews in place, do not allow developers to make decisions that they lack the knowledge to make.
Under the proposed changes to Owes evaluation document is this one:
“All wetland units that were previously evaluated as part of a wetland complex do not need to be re-evaluated at the same time. There is no requirement to update the wetland evaluation that applied to an entire wetland complex. The evaluation is considered a point-in-time document used to assign a status (significant or not) to each wetland that the evaluation covered (i.e., all wetland units that had previously been complexed together). Previous wetland evaluation documentation can be used as a source of information when re- evaluating a formerly complexed wetland unit.”
This is particularly disturbing as it then allows a previously assessed wetland system to be attacked and possibly developed bit by bit. It is an attack of attrition that will lead to diminishing wetlands as urban areas encroach ever closer to the heart of every wetland system.
Immediately following this proposal is another that is equally disturbing:
“Mapping updates to previously evaluated wetlands: Wetlands are dynamic natural systems and the outer boundary of a wetland can be updated if new information becomes available or if the extent of the wetland on the land changes. A mapping update can be undertaken without undertaking a re- evaluation. Evaluations are point-in-time assessments to determine a wetland’s status (significant or not) and are not to be ‘updated’. At times decision makers may require a re-evaluation of the wetland to confirm its status.
As wetlands are, as said, dynamic and have ever changing boundaries it seems inconceivable to allow reassessment of their boundaries because what is really being said is the government wants to shrink those boundaries when urban sprawl meets them.”
Further on in the document another proposed change is puzzling:
“Although site visits are an important part of any wetland evaluation, it is not expected that a wetland evaluator will traverse the entire wetland. Existing information prepared from earlier field visits allow the evaluator to utilize information collected about the site
_____________________________________________________________________ Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System 2022-10-25
                                  10
by others.”
Who are “others?” If, by others, the government is referring to third parties paid by developers, then this action is not acceptable. Leave the evaluation process as it is to maintain impartiality.
Soon after this change was proposed, the government stated that a completed evaluation must be considered an open file. In other words, no matter what the evaluation, a wetland will never be safe from developers. It is a totally unacceptable position and one that assures continued urban encroachment.
In my reading of this document, it is blatantly apparent that the government has declared open season on wetland protection in favour of uncontrolled development. Housing at any cost is irresponsible and will cause wide reaching and irreversible damage to the environment that we depend on for our existence.

72515,/comment/72515,"What are the Key Issues and Concerns?
1.	MNRF’s Role in Administering OWES will be Severely Reduced or Eliminated
MNRF developed the OWES method and has administered it since 1983. It is uncertain if the MNRF will continue to have a role in issuing updates to the OWES manuals and in overseeing the training course and exam which are required for individuals to be deemed qualified practitioners, as this has not been explicitly stated.
That said, the MNRF will no longer review each wetland evaluation produced in the province and will no longer have a jurisdictional role in designating wetlands as ‘provincially significant.’ MNRF will also no longer be the authority on interpretation of the OWES. Instead, qualified evaluators will use their professional judgement to interpret the OWES and to determine if a wetland is provincially significant or not.
The ERO posting states that the removal of MNRF’s role in reviewing and confirming wetland evaluations is to streamline development decisions. This will “better recognize the professional opinion of wetland evaluators and the role of local decision makers (e.g., municipalities)”.
Implications
Loss of MNRF Central Repositories of Completed Wetland Evaluations
Under the proposed changes, MNRF district offices will no longer be the repositories for completed wetland evaluations, instead storage would be downloaded to the local decision maker (e.g., municipality) receiving the completed evaluation. It is expected that most, if not all, completed evaluations will be received as part of a development planning process, and that they would be stored with their respective planning file. Without central repositories, use of wetland evaluations for land use planning will be more difficult.
Loss of MNRF Wetland Evaluation ‘Open File’ Approach
The MNRF will no longer maintain an open file for each wetland evaluation which currently allows new information to be added to the file, and a wetland’s score and significance to be determined at a point-in-time without consideration for previous evaluations. Any updates to scoring and significance would require a complete re-evaluation. This places an extra cost burden on the person or organization completing the re-evaluation, as well as the municipality or other decision maker reviewing and commenting on the re-evaluation. Further, undertaking a re-evaluation and reviewing a completed re-evaluation takes time, undermining the goal of the province’s proposed changes, which is to reduce bureaucratic complexity and fast-track development applications.
Loss of MNRF Expertise and Access to Information
Having developed the OWES system and administered it for nearly 40 years, the MNRF has the most experience and is most qualified to review and comment on OWES submissions to determine whether a wetland is provincially significant or not. Further, the MNRF has direct access to natural heritage information and connections to natural heritage experts. As the OWES uses a scoring system which relies partially on compiling and assessing background and secondary source information (such as species records), this access to information results in more accurate scoring and increases the likelihood that a wetland that should qualify as PSW, does qualify as PSW. Further, under the proposed changes, the MNRF is no longer be a resource for questions on the interpretation and application of OWES, with these decisions left solely in the hands of evaluators.
Loss of the MNRF Wetland Evaluation Approval Process
Under the current approach, the MNRF reviews and approves wetland evaluations after which they are deemed ‘complete.’ Under the proposed approach, wetland evaluations will be deemed ‘complete’ upon submission. This strongly infers that wetland evaluations will no longer require approval by a regulatory agency. Clarity is required on the roles and responsibilities of the municipality or other local decision maker receiving the completed wetland evaluation. If qualified evaluators are solely responsible for determining a wetlands significance and the physical extent of the wetland with no oversight, then this will lead to inconsistency in outcomes and reduce public confidence that the evaluation has been completed under an objective process.
Under the current approach, MNRF makes the final determination on provincial significance. The removal of MNRF’s role in designating provincially significant wetlands will result in a loss of consistency on wetland designations. Qualified evaluators will be solely responsible for determining a wetland’s significance. This introduces uncertainty and inconsistency into the process which does not align with one of the province’s two stated goals for the proposed changes, namely, to “provide greater certainty and clarity related to how significant wetlands are assessed and identified.”
2.	The Completion of Wetland Evaluations will Shift from Regulatory Agencies to the Private Sector
Currently, wetland evaluations are primarily completed by the MNRF and Conservation Authorities and are used for planning at a provincial, municipal, and watershed scale, including the review of development proposals. This is a proactive approach that feeds into land use planning at all levels of government. For example, it informs natural heritage system planning at the municipal and watershed level, informs land acquisition activities, secondary plan development, and built infrastructure planning.
Under the proposed changes, wetland evaluations will shift from being primarily completed by regulatory agencies for land use planning, to a process driven by development proposals with wetland evaluations completed by environmental consultants. Though not explicitly stated, given the scope of changes to OWES that largely remove MNRF’s role in administrating it, and given the reframing of the OWES as primarily a tool for municipalities to review development applications (per page 4 of proposed revisions), we expect MNRF staff will no longer undertake new wetland evaluations or re-evaluations. Likewise, given proposed changes to the Conservation Authorities Act aimed at restricting the role of Conservation Authorities to their ‘core mandate’, we anticipate that they may no longer undertake new wetland evaluations or re-evaluations.
Implications
Cost Shifting to Development Proponents
Under the proposed changes to OWES and other proposed changes under Bill 23, we anticipate that the completion of wetland evaluations will largely shift from regulatory agencies (primarily MNRF and conservation authorities) to development proponents. These effectively shifts the costs for completing wetland evaluations to development proponents.
Loss of Coordinated Jurisdictional Wetland Knowledge
Under the proposed changes, wetlands will primarily be evaluated as part of the development approvals process. Therefore, wetlands will generally be studied on a property-specific basis without the ability to collect data for an entire wetland that may span multiple properties. Currently, where wetland evaluations are completed by the MNRF or a conservation authority, wetlands are often assessed over multiple adjacent properties which results in more complete wetland data, for a larger area, and with potential cost efficiencies (i.e., lower cost per each evaluated wetland). A planned, strategic approach to wetland data collection and evaluation results in a more accurate evaluation of the wetland and better informs jurisdictional land use planning than uncoordinated individual wetland evaluations.
Loss of Consistency in Evaluating Wetlands and Determining Significance
Under the proposed changes, based on our assessment, the completion of wetland evaluations is likely to shift from regulatory agencies to environmental consultants engaged by development proponents. As there will not be consistency in the person or company conducting the evaluations, or any apparent approval process for the completed evaluations, the quality of the wetland evaluations will vary, and correspondingly, scoring to determine provincial significance will vary. Private industry consultants may not have the same resources, expertise or ability to undertake a thorough background and secondary source review to locate species records and other information that could increase the total wetland score. This directly contravenes one of the province’s two stated goals for the proposed changes, namely, the proposed changes are to “provide greater certainty and clarity related to how significant wetlands are assessed and identified.”
Loss of MNRF and Conservation Authority Oversight of Wetland Boundary Delineation
Under the proposed changes to OWES and the Conservation Authorities Act under Bill 23, the MNRF and conservation authorities will no longer have jurisdiction to verify wetland boundaries that have been delineated by qualified evaluators. Mapping the outer boundary of wetlands will be the responsibility of the qualified evaluator (as the evaluation will be deemed “complete” upon submission). Furthermore, it is unclear if the approving municipality will have the ability from a planning jurisdiction perspective to review wetland evaluations. Moreover, most municipalities, in particular lower-tier municipalities, lack the expertise to review and approve an Environmental Impact Study that includes a wetland evaluation/re-evaluation.
3.	Changes to Wetland Complexing and Species at Risk Scoring Will Result in a Reduction in the Number of Wetlands Designated as Provincially Significant, Leaving Most Wetlands Without protection
Under the proposed changes, evaluators will no longer have the option to evaluate individual wetlands as a ‘wetland complex’ (i.e., as a group). Further, individual wetlands that are currently part of a wetland complex can be re-evaluated and rescored on a stand-alone basis. If the individual wetland does not meet the scoring threshold to be provincial significant on its own, then it will be ‘downgraded’ to a wetland without provincial significance (a.k.a., a non-PSW).
Under the proposed changes, special scoring for habitat of Species at Risk will be eliminated.
Implications
Loss of Wetlands Through Development Approvals
Under existing Ontario legislation at the provincial, regional and municipal levels, provincially significant wetlands are prohibited from development and site alteration. The de-listing of some PSWs will remove protection for these wetlands and have an impact on the water resources system, and more broadly the natural environment system. Currently, PSWs are protected under the PPS and all wetlands are protected in accordance with the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Greenbelt Plan. However, non-PSWs are not protected by the PPS, and non-PSWs outside of the Growth Plan area, including within settlement areas, may not be protected by upper or lower tier municipal official plans which do not include policies that protect non-PSW wetlands. Many municipalities have omitted policies protecting non-PSW wetlands from their official plans to minimize overlap with conservation authority policies and regulations for non-PSWs. With the updates to the Conservation Authorities Act removing wetlands from the regulations under CA jurisdiction (unless they are considered a flood hazard), this leaves non-PSW wetlands without protection. This may lead to a loss in wetland area, and the important function wetlands play from an ecosystem services perspective, as well as habitat for wildlife that supports biodiversity and other important ecological functions.
Wetland loss will be most pronounced in southern Ontario where wetland cover is lowest.
Wetland loss will be greatest in southern Ontario where existing the Province has directed growth due to a desire for more homes in these areas and where jobs are more abundant. Southern Ontario has seen the greatest loss of wetlands due to historical clearing for agriculture and development of cities and associated infrastructure. The remaining wetlands in southern Ontario are generally small, and where identified as PSW are part of wetland complexes. Thus, southern Ontario will see the greatest wetland loss to development pressure.
Reductions to Land within Natural Environment Systems
Over the past two decades natural heritage planning in Ontario has moved from a feature-based approach for identification and protection, to a systems-based approach that recognizes the important interdependencies and landscape-level interactions that form a robust and resilient natural heritage system and the need to maintain and create connections (i.e., linkages). More recently the Provincial Policy Statement (2014 and 2020) has required municipalities to identify a natural heritage system, and moreover, the province identified a natural heritage system for the Greater Golden Horseshoe with associated policies to protect, restore, and enhance natural heritage systems. In addition, the PPS requires the identification of a water resource system that consists of wetlands (including PSWs) and that the quality and quantity of water be protected using the watershed as the ecologically meaningful scale for integrated and long-term planning. Collectively, the natural heritage system (which includes PSWs) and the water resource system can be considered the natural environment system. PSWs are provided with a high-level of protection through the PPS where development is prohibited. Loss of their PSW designation may result in their removal from a jurisdiction’s natural heritage system (either directly, if a given natural heritage system only protects wetlands that are provincially significant, or indirectly, as wetlands that lose their PSW status may subsequently be lost to development), thus resulting in a loss of resiliency for the natural environment system as a whole.
Increased Costs to Approval Authorities for Development Review and Land Use Planning
Increased costs to approval authorities, particularly lower-tier municipalities, are expected if the proposed changes are passed.
Wetland evaluations/re-evaluations will be completed on potential development properties where there are individual wetlands that are currently part of provincially significant wetland complexes. These will be submitted to lower tier municipalities as part of the development approvals process. As wetland complexes are ‘broken up’ and re-evaluated, land information mapping will require updating at the lower tier, upper tier, watershed, and provincial levels to reflect the removal of wetlands from wetland complexes, and the designation of the re-evaluated wetlands (i.e., provincially significant or not).
Additional staffing levels and expertise will be required, especially as the province has also proposed to eliminate the option for municipalities to have Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with conservation authorities to assist with the natural heritage component of development reviews. It is anticipated there will be increased pressure on planning departments and GIS departments, with resultant increases in costs to municipalities.
What are the Cumulative Implications to Natural Environment Planning?
The proposed changes to OWES and other proposed changes under Bill 23 have numerous implications to natural environment planning. It should be recognized that changes to other legislation (e.g., the Conservation Authorities Act and the Planning Act) have an interactive additive implication as it relates to the identification and protection of wetlands which are not being discussed here. The following implications are directly related to proposed changes to OWES, with consideration to other changes under Bill 23.
Lower Tier Municipalities Will Have More Planning Authority, More Responsibility, and More Staffing Pressures
Under the proposed Planning Act changes (ERO#019-6163) the province has proposed specifically to remove upper tier municipalities from the planning policy and development approvals process. Moreover, under ERO#019-6141 it has proposed to restrict the current role conservation authorities have in development review under the Planning Act to matters within their “core mandate as currently set out in the Mandatory Programs and Services regulation (O. Reg. 686/21, made under the Conservation Authorities Act”. As such, lower tier municipalities in larger urban areas of southern Ontario will have more responsibility for review and approval of development within their jurisdiction.
However, the planning departments of lower tier municipalities will experience staff pressures. They will be expected to have more expertise in-house and will not be able to rely on local conservation authorities for comments on development applications (though conservation authorities will still have a commenting role on matters within their ‘core mandate’). Moreover, they will now be expected to review and comment on wetland evaluations which will require expertise and a probable investment in staff training and hiring of more staff. Wetland evaluations are complex and their review is time consuming. Many planning departments are already experiencing staffing issues from a barrage of macro-pressures (e.g., retirements, Covid-19) and are ‘at-capacity’.
Due to these pressures on lower tier municipalities, they will need to identify ways to manage an increased case load. This may mean some combination of a) accepting less development applications (i.e., refusing incomplete applications) b) reducing non-planning budgets to redirect these funds to planning departments c) hiring additional planning staff, requiring planning staff to work longer hours, and/or outsourcing development reviews, and/or d) increasing property taxes.
Suggestions for Consideration
•	Prior to making revisions to OWES, the Province should engage in more consultation with a range of experts in ecology, hydrology, hydrogeology and water resource engineering. The consultation should include experts from conservation authorities, municipalities and the consulting industry to ensure a range of voices from different agencies and sectors are heard.
•	Wetland complexing should not be removed from OWES. There is strong scientific justification for using complexing to include individual wetland units within a PSW complex. No scientific rationale has been provided to justify the removal of complexing from OWES.
•	If the MNRF will no longer administer OWES, Conservation Authorities should be given the authority to completed and review wetland evaluations to ensure consistency and efficiency in the review process that can support the goal of achieving more homes “faster”.
•	Special Feature scoring for habitat of Endangered and Threatened species should not be removed from OWES. Wetlands are one of the most threatened habitats in the Province which in turn means those species that rely on wetlands include threatened and endangered species (i.e., Species at Risk). It is imperative that wetlands which support Species at Risk are deemed as PSWs which can aid the Province in protecting Species at Risk and their habitats.
•	If the proposed changes to OWES is carried forward by the Province, the Provincial Policy Statement should be updated to include ‘wetlands’ (i.e., all non-PSW wetlands in addition to PSWs) as a natural heritage feature and area in addition to a component of the water resource system. All wetlands, including those in urban/settlement areas, should be protected from development, unless through an environmental study it can be demonstrated there will be no negative impact to the feature and associated ecological functions.
Concluding Statements
Natural environment systems, and in particular wetlands, should not be seen an obstacle to affordable housing. In fact, effective integration of the natural environment in urban areas is needed for southern Ontario communities to remain healthy and resilient as the impacts from climate change become more evident.
We believe that there are opportunities to revise OWES that incorporates a science-based defendable approach while improving other aspects of the planning process that ensures the expertise and resources are available to review and approve wetland evaluations. Moreover, any changes to OWES or other aspects of natural environment planning cannot move forward in a way that puts the natural environment systems at risk and undermines the progress that has been made over the past 40 years. We are confident that such opportunities can be identified through fulsome engagement with a range of experts in land use and natural environment planning. We hope the Province takes our comments into consideration and would reach out to us for further engagement to find opportunities to improve the natural environment planning framework and processes that can achieve the goals of protecting the natural environment while building more homes faster.

I have reviewed the 64 page document and have a number of concerns. First, I am a member of the public with no conflict of interest related to these changes. I have a strong relationship with nature and a passion for learning.
My concerns include:
- removing the ministry to review and confirm wetland evaluation results
- ""better recognize professional opinion"" - you are weakening the conservation authorities and MNR involvement - they are the professions in watershed management - who will be paid to give Ford the results he wants?
- removing consideration of wetland complexes
- removing acknowledging the upper habitat and how this contributes to ta wetland and the animals within
- ignore wetlands smaller than 5 acres - this will help the Ford government after they fragment a bunch of Greenbelt and land for the 413 .. it's just 5 acres... just 5 acres..
- removing consideration of species at risk, endangered species, winter cover and breeding ground as important considerations
Shame on this government.
These changes benefit the Ford government and his agenda to benefit developers. He has zero relationship with nature and with health.  Halton region created ROPA 49 - a sound pan to accommodate population growth within the urban boundary. Build in backyards, high and mid density - don't build on wetlands, don't fragment wetlands, don't build on farmlands needed for food security.

72535,/comment/72535,"Stop this politically-driven unscientific legislative destruction of wetlands.
After reviewing Ontario's adjustments to the provincial Wetland Evaluation System, it is clear this government continues to REFUSE to recognize science-based assessments. Wetland assessment is a job for qualified scientists, such as are hired by Conservation Authorities, while Ontario once had very reputable forestry and wetland scientists and hydrogeologists on staff at the Ministry of Natural Resources. Instead of relying on science, this government wants politicians and municipal planners to assess wetlands,
Municipal planners understand where to place buildings AFTER the Conservation Authorities identify areas where flooding and erosion will occur. Conservation Authorities are the agencies who MUST CONTINUE to identify floodplains where roads and buildings should NOT be built. Wetland evaluation is not a job for municipalities, especially when wetlands and floodplains cross municipal boundaries.  There has been significant flooding in the west end of Toronto since the City of Vaughan has paved so much of its landscape, thereby transforming wetlands and floodplains into fragments.
From the human perspective, wetlands are very important for flood control, water filtering, and groundwater recharge and discharge. They also provide ideal habitat for animals and fish who depend upon wetlands for the natural food web, represented with myriad systems of aquatic life.
Let's consider the REAL value of wetlands, and why they should receive priority attention from Conservation Authorities and scientists who are able to advise politicians who lack such qualifications.
Wetlands benefit communities by helping to mitigate floods, purify drinking water, control erosion, sequester carbon, provide wildlife habitat and much more. A 2009 study commissioned by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry conservatively valued wetland benefits at over $161,000 per hectare per year in urban settings. In 2022, that translates into $217,350, and their increasing scarcity will only drive those costs higher. With over 72 percent of wetlands already destroyed in southern Ontario, we simply cannot afford to lose any more.
Governments must make the effort to understand how watersheds work because water always flows from the upper portion of the watershed down to the lowest level; as an example, let's consider the water from the Duffins Creek, which enters Lake Ontario at Duffins Marsh in Ajax, though Pickering decided to terminate Ajax's participation in negotiations regarding the MZO issued to the developer. How could Ajax be excluded from talks when it will clearly be impacted by this huge new development?
This is the folly of politically-motivated site-by-site approvals, instead of proper science-based watershed planning. This creek's tributaries include Stouffville Creek, Reesor Creek, West Duffins Creek, Wixon Creek, Mitchell Creek, East Duffins Creek, Major Creek, Whitevale Creek, Urfé Creek, Brougham Creek, Ganatsekagon Creek, and Millers Creek. Count how many municipal boundaries are crossed in this case.
A fundamental principle of watershed science and planning is that upper watershed wetlands, and middle watershed floodplain areas, provide critical storage of rain and snowmelt, thereby slowing the flow of water moving downstream, thereby assisting in the retention of sediment and nutrients, as they provide a natural filtering service. When politically-motivated decisions remove or damage such wetlands and floodplains, or disconnect them from associated streams or tributaries, we lose their natural storage capacity. As a result, run-off moves swiftly downstream, in turn producing elevated and flash flood peaks. These degraded conditions already exist across much of the GTA and contribute to many of southern Ontario's more frequently-occurring and expensive water management problems. There have been enough recent cases of serious flooding, thanks to unwise filling and paving of landscapes in the upper levels of Lake Ontario's surrounding watersheds in York, Durham, Peel and Halton Regions
I was stunned when your Ministry ""worked with"" (against?) the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and the Pickering Council to circumvent policy protections for two large wetlands within the provincially significant Lower Duffins Creek Wetland Complex, when issuing an MZO and seeking to downgrade the status of the wetland complex. I believe a court case brought by Ecojustice against that MZO in July 2021 resulted in the return of protections for this wetland complex:
https://ecojustice.ca/pressrelease/lower-duffins-creek-wetland-is-final…
MMAH and MNRF must recognize that wetlands in the upper parts of a watershed may form in low-lying spots on the land. These wetlands capture, store, and slowly release runoff from rain and snowmelt. Not all of them may always look like ONE large integral wetland, though several may form a single Wetland Complex —they may be wet in the spring and dry by late summer—and often, they might not even appear to be connected to streams or rivers, but their connections are critical. Individually, these wetlands may appear to be small and 'disconnected', but they can and do form a significant local wetland complex together. As such, they retain a lot of water, slowing the rate of flow, and allowing the water to permeate into the ground. This reduces erosion and flood peaks and helps protect downstream roads and neighborhoods.
Wetlands in the middle portion of a watershed form along rivers and creeks, giving their banks room to accommodate the swell of higher water flows during storm events. They are most commonly known as floodplain wetlands.
Finally, the waters from the upper watershed reach wetlands in the lower parts of a watershed, such as Ajax's Duffins Marsh, where rivers empty into a larger body of water, such as Lake Ontario. Where rivers flatten out, the current disperses, and the river drops its cumulative load of sediments and nutrients. This makes the water entering the lake cleaner and clearer, and that means better fishing, swimming, and boating -- not to mention the replenishment of nutrients for various aquatic and dependent species in the wetland food complex.
This foolishly-issued politically-motivated non-scientific MZO would have put all of this watershed's ecological services at risk, which  are already threatened by so much encroaching politically-motivated urban development. Those who accept the responsibility of government have an obligation to either learn the science of watersheds, OR accept the findings of science-based assessments done by Conservation Authorities. In this case, I would accept the TRCA's science-based decision over Ontario's politically-motivated desire to please yet another developer who is a generous donor to conservative political campaigns.
Let's not forget that 72% of southern Ontario's wetlands have already been drained, and it certainly shows up in all the costly flooding events that occur, even during periods of relatively normal rainfall, though climate change has been exacerbating and strengthening storms.
Since Ontario seems to be lagging in assessing the real value of its wetlands since 2018 under this Conservative government, let's look to some older examples from the USA where the US-EPA found in 1990 that the Congaree Bottomland Hardwood Swamp in South Carolina, removes a quantity of pollutants that would be equivalent to that removed annually by a $5-million waste water treatment plant. Another study of a 2,500-acre wetland in Georgia, indicated that it saves $1-million in water pollution abatement costs annually. What would those same savings be worth in 2020 dollars?
As for the size of a complete wetland complex, consider the US-EPA's finding that: ""In addition to improving water quality through filtering, some wetlands maintain stream flow during dry periods; others replenish groundwater. Many Americans, of course, depend on groundwater for drinking. The Floridian aquifer system, for instance, is one of the more productive ground water sources in the United States. It occurs ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE of Florida, and INTO southern Georgia, and portions of South Carolina and Alabama. This huge subsurface reservoir produces some of the cleanest water in the nation. Its primary source is rainwater that filters through hundreds of feet of sand and rock. One calculation for a 5-acre Florida cypress swamp recharging groundwater was that, if 80 percent of swamp was drained, available ground water would be reduced by an estimated 45 percent."" Think of all the human activities that rely on groundwater for drinking, agriculture, fishing -- we cannot afford to lose such services.
When Ontario's government dismisses the value of wetland complexes, such as it did in Vaughan to allow the bull-dozing and paving of a large area for yet another warehouse, this time for a WalMart Distribution Centre, Ministers at MMAH, MNRF, and the Premier obviously had NO IDEA what was being obliterated because they cannot see the totality of the complex, much of which remains in unseen 'underground' connections. So many ecological services are at work below the ground and out of sight.
The risks of flooding in the city of Toronto are very real, and they were studied and explained by engineering researchers at UBC and the University of Windsor in 2017, then published in the Journal of Cleaner Production in 2018, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.066
The engineering team found that urbanization has profoundly altered the Toronto's land cover.
Urban catchment basins have very low permeability and high rainfall runoff conversion rates. These changes affect the hydrology that determines flood hazard. Drainage infrastructure capacity, type and condition are other key factors influencing the occurrence of pluvial floods.
Urban drainage infrastructures are composed of two sub-systems: minor and major systems.
The minor system refers to an underground sewer network while the overland flow route is called the major system. These infrastructures have to be in good condition and perform according to their design requirements to prevent pluvial flooding. Therefore, not only design capacity has
to be considered in flood vulnerability assessment, but also the current condition and performance.
Here is ONE of the conclusions from the study:
""Understanding the main cause of basement flooding in an area is a crucial step towards flood risk mitigation and adaptation planning. In this study, a novel approach using GIS applications and
Bayesian Belief Network-BBN is proposed to diagnose the main factors influencing basement flooding and to predict Flood Variability Index - FVI. The case study revealed that climate variations have the least impact on the disproportional number of basement floodings reported by different areas across Toronto. Whereas, population density followed by land cover related parameters are the most influential factors.
Therefore, the city of Toronto should focus their resources on land cover related parameters to improve the water retention capacity of the soil and decrease impervious areas. This can be achieved by promoting green development like green roof constructions, encouraging the use of pours pavement materials that allow water infiltration, increasing proportion of green areas in new development projects and so on.
The main advantage of the proposed methodology is that it can be adopted in any urban area, based on its characteristics and data availability and it has the ability to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making process.""
NOW, note the Insurance Bureau of Canada is promoting wetlands as ""natural infrastructure"".
IBC insists a Real Estate Climate Risk Score must be instituted across Canada by 2025, to indicate a property’s susceptibility to catastrophic loss  based on known risk factors. The Index  would form the basis for managing and reducing household, community and municipal climate risk.
Craig Stewart, V.P., IBC Climate Change and Federal Issues, stated: “We simply can’t wait until 2050 to be climate compatible in the housing sector. Immediate action must be taken to protect homeowners and communities, or catastrophic loss to homes and communities will continue to increase in severity and cost, year after year.”
Withdraw Bill 23 and reinstate scientific oversight responsibilities to the Conservation Authorities.

Moreover, there is nothing guaranteeing that heavily subsidized housing won’t be snapped up by corporate landlords and speculators.
We are not stupid.  We can see what you are doing.
If you were serious about addressing the housing and affordability crisis, you would immediately do the following:
1)	Get the estimated $30 billion of dirty money circulating every year out of Ontario’s housing market.

The BC government estimates that money laundering in real estate is responsible for a 5% price increase:

https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019FIN0051-000914
2)	Deliver 50,000 public and not-for-profit long-term care beds.  There are almost 40,000 seniors waiting for long-term-care who no longer want to live in their homes.  Moreover, many of their spouses are living alone in the family home because there are no spaces for them to live with their life-partner, even though it is promised by the LTC act.  Providing seniors with the care they need and deserve would release thousands of homes into the housing market.
3)	Implement a Province-wide vacancy tax.  Combined with the Foreign Buyers Tax, the BC speculation tax saw 20,000 previously empty condo units in Vancouver come back onto the market.  This tax also generated money to fund affordable housing.
Speculation and vacancy tax will help housing affordability in new communities.
https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2022FIN0028-001137
4)	Give municipalities the power to impose permit expiry limits.
You’ve stacked things so that municipalities have to deliver within certain timeframes.  How about developers?  If developments aren’t completed within a given timeframe, then the approval should expire.  There are hundreds of projects across the province which have been approved, but never built.
Bill 23’s approach to wetlands is reckless and dangerous.  You can’t destroy a wetland and “offset” it elsewhere.  Wetlands play a critical role in controlling the flow of water and the recharge of aquifers.   Allowing developers to fill in or reposition wetlands will have unknown impacts on water flow and recharge and accelerate the mass species extinction already underway.
The removal of “complexing” of wetlands is completely anti-science.  You are intentionally putting the blinders on municipalities by specifically preventing them from looking at the big picture.  This is manipulative and dishonest.
And then there will be the muppet homebuyers who get stuck with a 24-hour sump pump running in their basement because their house was built on a wetland.

1.	Wetlands (swamps, marshes, bogs and fens) are home to many species of wildlife, some quite rare and unique to the area;
2.	Every food chain or food pyramid has a link to a wetland dependent species;
3.	Wetlands provide flood control by absorbing the vast volume of water that can be suddenly released from rainfall or snowmelt;
4.	Wetlands prevent erosion of streambanks and roadsides by slowing down the velocity of this flash flood rainfall;
5.	Wetlands filter out just about everything from chunky debris to excess nutrients that flow in with dirty water from parking lots and hard surfaces… the outflow water is remarkably clean;
6.	Wetlands cool the water as it seeps underground before being released downstream, and cool water supports life better than warm water (high oxygen levels and no algae);
7.	Wetlands recharge groundwater supply, thus ensuring wells don’t have to be drilled deeper and deeper;
8.	The production of biomass (every living thing considered as one lump) within a wetland equals a rainforest: a lot of plants means lots of oxygen released to the air, and equally a lot of carbon sequestered from the air;
9.	Wetlands attract human users, who pay good money to go hunting, fishing, birdwatching, paddling and to do nature photography (not just in their gear, but buying gas, staying at resorts and hotels, and picking up food). No wetland means no visitors which means no money added to local economy.
10.	Wetlands are recognized for their aesthetic value to our society. They are fun places to visit, they provide a boost to both our physical and spiritual needs. They are pleasing to look at and appreciate. Viewing a sunset over a sea of residential rooftops just isn’t the same as that sun viewed setting over acres of cattails.
Withdraw Bill 23 now.

72590,/comment/72590,"Comment on Bill 23 – Ontario Wetlands Evaluation System
Provincially Significant Wetlands enjoy the highest level of protection against development and any other alterations. The Ontario Wetlands Evaluation System is used to determine if a wetland is provincially significant or not. Bill 23 proposes a number of changes to this evaluation system.
If the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) go ahead, here is what will happen.
Rather than evaluating a wetland complex as whole, existing provincially significant wetland complexes will be broken apart, with each small wetland re-evaluated separately.
The threshold for significance remains the same, so an individual wetland must attain the same score as the much larger wetland complex to remain significant.
It will be almost impossible for these individual components of large wetland complexes to be evaluated as provincially significant.
As a result, Provincially Significant Wetlands will be gradually dismantled and will lose their protection.    It will then be possible to drain and fill them, making them available for development, thus leading to their eventual disappearance.  This is an unacceptable ecological cost to bear, causing great harm to local ecosystems, populations and economies.
We demand that wetland complexes be mandatorily evaluated as a whole and not piece-meal as proposed.
Further, if implemented as proposed, the Province will have no role in reviewing or approving wetland evaluations, will no longer keep wetland evaluation files nor maintain significant wetland mapping or provide information for use in wetland evaluations.
These responsibilities will be delegated to the municipalities, without additional budgets or provincial   assistance, and the municipalities will have NO authority to review and approve wetland evaluations submitted by landowners.
The wetland evaluator will only be accountable for the objectivity and accuracy of the wetland evaluation to the person paying for it.
As consequence, the property owner or developer seeking to remove the significant wetland designation will be the only authority determining if the wetland evaluation is valid. This is intolerable from an ethical and democratic perspective.
We demand that the Province maintain a role in the management of Provincially Significant Wetlands and that, if not the province, then the  municipalities be given the authority to review and approve wetland evaluations.

RE: Proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (ERO:019-6160)
As a Wetland Biologist with over 15 years of professional experience, I have a number of concerns with the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES). Ontario’s wetlands play a critical role as a natural filter of nutrients and pollutants protecting water quality, as flood storage areas that protect people and property from floods, as recharge areas for groundwater, and in providing habitat for wildlife including many Species at Risk. Ontario’s wetlands also provide an abundance of tourism and recreation opportunities. If the proposed changes to OWES are implemented, existing Provincially Significant Wetlands will lose their status and un-evaluated wetlands are unlikely to meet the standard for additional protection.  This will lead to wetlands being destroyed and lost, resulting in loss of habitat and numerous species, decreased flood storage and increased erosion, poorer water quality in our rivers and lakes, and the loss of tourism and recreation.
Ontario has a housing supply crisis, not a shortage of buildable land. Access to housing that is affordable is necessary and important, but that is possible without making changes to the OWES that would remove environmental protections and encourage the destruction and removal of the remaining wetlands in Ontario.  The proposed changes are not supported by science and will erode decision makers ability to protect wetlands and their functions.
My specific concerns with the changes include:
-	The removal of the MNRF, and its varied and essential roles, from the manual.
o	This leaves no oversight system in place and no identified replacement.
o	This will result in a significant loss of knowledge base since the MNRF has been the administering body for this system since its inception.  This will result in a significant need for additional resources and administration capacity that will be lost.
o	Unclear who will be responsible for administering OWES.
o	Unclear who will oversee OWES evaluator training and certification.
o	Unclear who can be contacted for further details and support.
o	Unclear who will be responsible for making final decisions or determining outcomes if there is a disagreement between evaluators.
o	Unclear who will be responsible for training and certifying evaluators.
o	Unclear who will be responsible for overseeing and housing wetland files and how this will be done.
-	Addition of “A Complete Evaluation” section.
o	Unclear who a ‘decision maker’ is and how they will be looking at evaluations.
o	Unclear who will be responsible for updating and maintaining the provincial wetland database and mapping information.
o	‘Complete once it has been received’ provides no oversight to ensure that the evaluation was completed properly.
-	Conservation Authorities removal from the manual. Conservation Authorities require tools and data including the information generated through OWES to continue to focus on natural hazards management and fulfill their core mandate.
-	Changes to enable re-evaluations and mapping updates, and the removal of wetland complexes.
o	Unclear what ‘closely grouped wetlands’ means.
o	Wetlands do not function independently of one another, they collectively provide significant ecological functions and services, and should continue to be complexed.  Removing wetlands from the complexes in which they have been identified fails to recognize how wetlands function on the landscape. It will result in the vast majority of wetlands not meeting significance criteria and becoming unprotected.
-	Removal of 4.1.2.1 Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species and 4.1.2.2 Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species
o	Wetlands are an incredibly important ecosystem for many of Ontario’s Species at Risk. Wetlands support these species by providing reproductive, feeding and hibernation habitat for residents as well as migratory species. Without the wetlands that support them many of these species will become at risk of extinction. The removal of these criteria for scoring will result in the vast majority of wetlands not meeting significance criteria and becoming unprotected.
I recommend that:
•	The role of the MNRF in the administration of OWES be retained.
•	The complexing of wetlands be retained.
•	The scoring of Endangered and Threatened species be retained.
•	The province engage with a multi-stakeholder working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and develop scientifically sound alternatives, prior to proceeding with the current proposed amendments.

72619,/comment/72619,"Muskoka Watershed Council (MWC) is a community-based not-for-profit corporation. Since 2001, we have developed sound, science-based policy advice on effective conservation and management of the rich natural capital of this region, providing guidance to municipal councils and their staffs, and to the wider public, on the intrinsic links between a resilient, sustainable environment and the local economy. We are committed to the enhancement of the health and sustainability of the entire Muskoka River Watershed, from its headwaters in Algonquin Park to its outlets to Georgian Bay, as well as those parts of the Black-Severn River Watershed and the Georgian Bay shoreline and islands that lie within The District Municipality of Muskoka.
Muskoka Watershed Council wishes to register its concerns regarding the proposed changes to the regulation and financing of development in Ontario contained in Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, which received second reading October 26th, and the various related postings on the Environmental Registry of Ontario, October 25, 2020, coincident with First Reading. We are very concerned about the broad implications for Muskoka and many Ontario municipalities. While we recognize that much of the bill is focussed on southern Ontario, the Green Belt and urban areas of the Greater Toronto Region, we recognize that:
•	The proposed changes will diminish the ability of many communities to address any negative impacts of new development and redevelopment on the environment and to mitigate and respond to our changing climate;
•	Bill 23 was tabled when the election cycle has left municipalities between previous and newly elected governments. This impairs their ability to provide comment on the proposals,
many of which will have a direct bearing on planning and environmental management in Muskoka. Specific examples are provided below;
•	other proposals within Bill 23 could be applied to Muskoka in the future; and
•	the effects of the urban sprawl and destruction of carbon sequestering wetlands in southern Ontario on greenhouse gas emissions that will be facilitated by Bill 23 will add to the problems of a warming climate that we already see in in Muskoka – problems such as invasive species and harmful algal blooms in our lakes, which will impair the natural attributes which support our economy and our enjoyment of life. The damage and destruction to wetlands facilitated by Bill 23 will greatly impair their ability to sequester and store carbon dioxide emissions and to act as buffers against flooding.
Through Bill 23 and the related regulatory and policy changes, the Provincial Government has set forth what is probably the largest change in local government planning and environmental management in Ontario in decades. It appears to MWC, however, that many aspects of the Bill could have significant negative consequences on public safety and our natural environment by directly threatening important processes and protective policies.
While our submission concentrates on matters that we feel directly relate to the watersheds in Muskoka, we are also very concerned about the broad implications for many Ontario municipalities. The proposed changes will diminish the ability of many communities to address any negative impacts of new development and redevelopment on the environment and to mitigate and respond to our changing climate. We add that the measures in Bill 23 appear to apply to all lands in Ontario regardless of suitability for housing. This opens the door to development that will do nothing to further the goals of Bill 23 and which could alter the nature of Muskoka.
The Housing Crisis
The stated intent of Bill 23 is to address the Province’s housing supply and affordability issues. We also recognize these as significant problems in Ontario. While Ontario needs to build more affordable houses, Bill 23 reduces municipal abilities to manage new development and encourages urban sprawl and destruction of the Green Belt. Bill 23 removes sound environmental stewardship and regulation behind an assumption that this is necessary to build more homes. In fact, Ontario can presently accommodate its needs for more housing within established municipal areas, where densification can take advantage of existing municipal services such as transit, sewage treatment and schools, making homes more affordable, while avoiding further fragmentation and destruction of our natural areas and agricultural lands.
As an example, we are said to have a crisis of affordable housing in Muskoka, in spite of the fact that, within The District Municipality of Muskoka, there are a total of 5,843 draft approved housing units, 5,424 of which are located in our serviced Urban Centres. Approximately half of these units have been draft approved for more than 10 years yet no building has proceeded. Instead, we see requests to extend draft approval being the most common Planning Act application processed by the District of Muskoka Planning Department. In Muskoka, we can accommodate our planned growth within existing approvals and urban lands. This is also true in southern Ontario, where wise planning could increase the density of urban development without the urban sprawl facilitated in Bill 23.
Site Plan Control
Bill 23 proposes to amend the Planning Act to limit the use of site plan control only to sites with more than ten units. This is particularly important along Muskoka’s shorelines where development almost entirely consists of ten or fewer units and where site plan control is the strongest planning tool available to maintain the health of our waterways. Loss of site plan control would remove the ability of Muskoka’s municipalities to impose stormwater management requirements to control the quantity and quality of runoff from smaller sites. Measures for erosion control and the retention of natural features on-site also become unenforceable. Muskoka has experienced three episodes of flooding in the last decade that damaged private and public lands and key infrastructure. Some of the impacts of flooding can be managed through sound land use planning and mitigative activities. Muskoka’s municipalities need to be able to implement site plan control and control landscaping to protect lands at risk of flooding - including waterfront lands that form the economic engine of the region. Muskoka Watershed Council supports the District of Muskoka’s Lake System Health program and related District and local Official Plan policies, which were developed with broad stakeholder and community support, and which are primarily implemented at an area municipal level through site plan control. Removing site plan control as a planning tool will result in uncontrolled development on our shorelines – with no increase in the number of homes built and no improvement to the housing crisis.
Upper Tier Municipalities, Conservation Authorities and Planning Authority
Bill 23 proposes that the Province could suspend the planning authority of upper tier municipalities such as the District of Muskoka or of conservation authorities by regulation. This is of grave concern. These bodies have the resources and broader geographic jurisdiction, as well as the site-specific knowledge necessary to address watershed-wide issues, including flood-control, by providing support and co-ordination for local municipalities and servicing responsibilities. The importance of municipal management is heightened by the substantial reductions in both the resources and the ability of the provincial ministries to comment. We have witnessed these reductions, for example in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, in the past 20-30 years.
Development Charges
Bill 23 proposes to reduce the development fees that fund the necessary roads, sewage treatment infrastructure and parks that must accompany new development. Who will pay for these if they are not funded by development charges? Removing development charges may stall the building of critical infrastructure and shift the financial burden of growth-related infrastructure onto existing municipal taxpayers. The lower tier municipalities in Muskoka are small, without the staff capacity of larger centres. The goal of increasing the supply of homes means that more municipal resources are required, not fewer. New development should shoulder its own costs and not pass them on to existing ratepayers.
Wetland Protection
The changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) that are proposed as part of Bill 23 threaten Ontario’s wetlands and their valuable functions and are not an appropriate component of any housing strategy. Housing can be located in a variety of areas with no threats to natural heritage - wetlands, however, must be protected where they are. Wetlands are essential parts of the natural ecosystems that support, protect, and enrich human life. They provide habitat for a vast array of life, help to clean our air and water, provide oxygen, store carbon, and act as giant “sponges” that moderate droughts and floods by storing excess water during wet periods and releasing it slowly during dry spells.
All of these functions are critically important to human life; but we wish to draw particular attention to the ability to moderate droughts and floods. Muskoka experienced historic flooding in 2013, 2018 and 2019. There is near certainty that we will experience more severe flooding, or serious drought and forest fires in the future. In Muskoka, we will be evaluating numerous possible solutions, some man-made, and some that exist naturally, to help us deal with future flooding and droughts. The protection or enhancement of natural wetlands will always be less costly and more effective than man-made solutions such as dams and reservoirs. It is therefore critical to protect them.
The OWES, and related legislation introduced years ago, recognizes the need to protect wetlands and provides for the designation and protection of Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSW) through a scoring system based on natural heritage criteria. In the proposed changes, some scoring criteria have been removed from the OWES, yet wetlands must still meet the same OWES score to be considered provincially significant. This makes it much harder for wetlands to reach PSW status, meaning that fewer wetlands will be protected and will have increased potential to be slated for development.
•	For example, many wetlands in Ontario are grouped together in complexes – this includes wetlands big and small that are less than 750 metres apart. This is important for fish and wildlife that live in wetlands, as the entire complex makes up their habitat and each component provides water storage. The proposed legislation changes will no longer apply OWES to such complexes but will evaluate each wetland as an independent entity. Smaller wetlands are less likely to meet the criteria for PWS status, and thus be more susceptible to development.
•	The proposed changes would also eliminate the presence of endangered species as an OWES criterion, reducing OWES scores and thereby diminishing the likelihood that a wetland would attain PSW status and consequently be protected from development. Most turtles in Ontario are endangered or species of special concern, mainly due to habitat loss. Thus, the threat to habitat resulting from proposed changes to OWES is a threat to the survival of endangered species, including, but not limited to, turtles.
•	The existing OWES seeks a balance between agricultural use and wetland protection - if a landowner plowed a field containing a wetland, especially if it was a PSW, it would continue to qualify as a PSW unless crops were successfully grown on it. The proposed changes would mean that the land would cease to be considered a wetland, and thus lose any protected status, as soon as it is plowed, even if it was never used for crop production.
•	The Province has produced a white paper entitled “Conserving Ontario’s Natural Heritage”, in support of Bill 23. The paper proposes the “creation” of new habitats to offset removals of wetlands, woodlands, and wildlife habitat. Such approaches ignore what wetlands are, how they have developed and how they function in an ecosystem. It is highly unlikely that a man-made wetland will replicate the ecological roles of a natural wetland. Such “offset” approaches have been proven to fail in other jurisdictions.
•	The roles of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, and of conservation authorities, in reviewing wetland evaluations have been greatly reduced. These roles have been re-directed to municipalities and the private sector. Municipal staff generally do not have expertise in evaluating wetlands, so the responsibility is effectively shifted to the private sector. Thus, a knowledgeable and objective third party may be absent from these critical evaluations.
Each of these proposed changes significantly reduces the protection afforded to wetlands. Collectively, they are of major concern. Therefore, we urge the provincial government to reconsider the proposed changes to the OWES, and to undertake, in consultation with a full range of stakeholders, measures to strengthen protection for Ontario’s vital wetlands.
Consultation
The scope of the proposed changes to legislation, regulation, and policy in Bill 23 raises our concerns with the apparent lack of pre-consultation with significant stakeholders and the very short timeline for the submission of comments at a time when newly elected municipal councils have not yet been sworn in. The government’s approach and the general lack of information on the details of implementation mean that many of the proposed changes would result in significant negative consequences for the wellbeing of Muskoka’s natural environment and of the residents of and visitors to Muskoka, and to the people of Ontario.
Conclusion
Muskoka Watershed Council respectfully urges the Provincial government to pause, reconsider and work with all stakeholders to explore the scope and implications of Bill 23 and amend its many flaws before it becomes law. We also wish to register our concern regarding proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) as posted on the Environmental Registry of Ontario, October 25, 2020, in support of Ontario’s Housing Supply Action Plan 3.0.

72621,/comment/72621,"Building more houses by opening development on wetlands is not a solution to the housing crisis. The looming climate crisis already puts hundreds of thousands of Canadian's homes at risk of damage from more severe weather and flooding. Wetlands not only mitigate flooding but they are sinks of greenhouse gases. Draining them to build homes would further exacerbate climate change as well as the housing crisis. Ontario absolutely needs more homes - but more importantly we need affordable homes. This plan suggests removing environmental oversight, stripping Conservation Authorities of their ability to advise, and allowing wetland boundaries to be remapped. Allowing consultants hired by developers to recommend if wetlands should lose protected status is a conflict of interest. Removing endangered species from the scoring system in determining significant wetlands is extremely irresponsible. Allowing developers to carve pieces out of protected wetlands and flood other areas to “compensate” the damage is extremely irresponsible. Removing OMNRF oversight is deplorable.

The Historic Saugeen Métis are among the indigenous peoples who have lived in, cared for and relied on the traditional Saugeen territory for generations. It is the responsibility of the Historic Saugeen Métis Council to ensure a sustainable environment for current and future Métis families claiming Section 35, Canada Constitution Act (1982) aboriginal rights in the traditional Métis Saugeen Territory. The Historic Saugeen Métis supports development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs, specifically where it relates to our ability to continue traditional harvesting practices, rights and interests.
The Historic Saugeen Métis strongly opposes the Bill 23, More Holmes Build Faster Act 2022.
Bill 23 is an inadequate response to the need for greater housing as it devalues the environment and our unique cultural places. The proposed Bill 23 will reduce critical natural environments like wetlands and greenspaces that support our way of life, interests and rights. It also threatens important heritage and cultural spaces by removing protections and potentially allowing development in areas of sacred importance.
The Historic Saugeen Métis community has not been properly consulted regarding Bill 23 which is a violation to our rights and interests.  We are deeply concerned that the Ontario government is failing to protect nature, climate and communities. The Historic Saugeen Métis asks that Bill 23, More Holmes Built Faster Act 2022, Schedule 2 and the proposed related legislative amendments / additions be repealed to allow for adequate consultation.
We look forward to a response and the opportunity to contribute to solutions that will improve housing opportunities while protecting our fragile natural environment and communities.
Your truly,
Jenna McGuire
Vice President

I oppose this bill. In terms of conservation, the wetlands is home to diverse flora and fauna. If the government goes through with this, these habitats and species will be destroyed. This will have a negative impact on our ecosystems and our climate.
This land also belongs to the Indigenous peoples. It is their decision to make whether they want to move forward with this development, and most tribes vehemently oppose it because of the damage it will do.
Lastly, I live near the greenbelt. It's beautiful and one of the last greenspaces we have in the GTA and Ontario. It's so wrong to repeal the protections for this land. I also used to live in a housing community that was built on wetlands. The houses had very poor construction and were in dire need of repair. This kind of environment is not suitable for residential or commercial zoning.
I propose that, instead of destroying the Greenbelt for more houses, we look at those who own multiple properties or who are absentee landlords. If these properties were freed up, people could either buy them OR these single-family homes could be rebuilt to support multi-generational or multi-family households.
There is no need to create more single-family homes when those properties already exist. Honestly, re-purposing the land that is already ready for residential and commercial use just makes more sense!
If the government goes through with this, more life and communities will be destroyed. Please do not pass this bill.

Yes Ontario needs to build more housing, but doing so by changing the policies that protect our important wetlands is not the way to do it. Removing environmemtal oversight, stripping Conservation Authorities of their ability to advise, and allowing wetland boundaries to be remapped is foolish and irresponsible.
Furthermore, allowing consultants, hired by developers, to recommend if wetlands should lose protected status is a conflict of interest.
Removing endangered species from the scoring system in determining significant wetlands is extremely irresponsible.
Allowing developers to carve pieces out of protected wetlands and flood other areas to “compensate” the damage is extremely irresponsible.

Our wetlands provide critical support and habitat to species at risk, which are already under increasing threat from development elsewhere in the province. This threat is felt especially strongly in southern Ontario, where the bulk of our province's (and country's) biodiversity is concentrated.
Housing is a critical issue for our growing population and must not be ignored. I urge the provincial government to take a closer look at the multitude of ways in which we can increase density in already-developed and less sensitive areas.

Re: Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (ERO 019-6160) and Conserving Ontario’s Natural Heritage Discussion Paper (ERO 019-6161)
Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the above noted Environmental Registry of Ontario postings regarding the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) and the Natural Heritage Discussion Paper outlining a proposed ecological offsetting policy for wetlands, woodlands, and other wildlife habitat.  Please note that the following comments are provided by Region of Peel staff and may be considered by Regional Council for endorsement. If additional or differing comments are provided through a Council resolution, they will be forwarded to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) for consideration.
General Comments
The Region of Peel appreciates the Province’s efforts to increase the housing supply and improve affordability. These are important issues that require integrated solutions.  We also welcome the Province’s interest in addressing wetland, woodland and wildlife habitat loss and the need for better policy to protect, restore and enhance natural systems, features and areas.  Updating the provincial wetland evaluation system and providing an offsetting policy for planning and permitting approvals, are important initiatives that can help address current challenges, provided that outcomes remain focused on protecting, restoring, and enhancing natural systems in the communities and watersheds where they are needed.
Comments and recommendations are provided with the goal of meeting housing needs while still ensuring communities have healthy and natural systems.
Guiding Principles for Consideration
The strong framework of environmental and watershed planning in Ontario and the systems approach for climate, natural heritage and water resource planning have been a cornerstone of the Peel Region’s work to manage growth in collaboration with the local municipalities and the Province.  The provincial policy-led planning system recognizes the inter-relationship among environmental, economic and social factors and the importance of a comprehensive and integrated approach to planning.  Municipalities have relied on the provincial framework of policy, criteria, and guidance to develop and implement consistent standards of protection for natural heritage systems, features and areas that growing communities need to be healthy and sustainable.
There is concern the proposed changes in Bill 23 will negatively impact the integrated, systems and science-based approaches currently being implemented by municipalities. The integration of environmental and growth planning informed by science is critical to achieving healthy, safe, sustainable communities that all development, including housing, depend on to be successful.
Natural systems, parks and open space are fundamental to building complete, sustainable communities as they support ecosystem functions, recreational opportunities, physical and mental health, and also provide effective solutions for managing flood and erosion risk.  Not only that, natural systems, features and areas directly support provincial climate change, biodiversity and water management objectives and targets by moderating temperatures, flooding and stormwater runoff, providing habitat and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Municipalities need healthy, functioning natural systems and nature-based solutions to address the impacts of growth and the added stress of a changing climate. Natural systems in urban communities will be at risk of further degradation if their protection, restoration and enhancement are not supported.
A.	Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES Manual) (ERO Posting 019-6160)
Wetland protection in southern Ontario is important as wetland habitat is under continuous pressure from urbanization, invasive species and climate change. Estimates suggest that 72 per cent of the wetlands originally present in southern Ontario were lost by 2015.    Wetland loss has been greatest in southwestern Ontario, parts of eastern Ontario, Niagara and the Toronto area, where it is estimated over 85% of the original pre-settlement wetlands have been converted to other uses. In Peel, significant wetlands comprise close to 3% of the Region’s total area. The protection, restoration and enhancement of wetlands is a shared objective of both municipalities and the Province.
The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) has worked well in conjunction with provincial policy over many years to ensure the most significant wetlands are identified and protected. Changes to the system for wetland evaluation and the associated policies for wetland protection should ensure the system’s criteria and methodology remains science-based and that appropriate standards of protection are afforded to both provincially and non-provincially significant wetlands.
1. Proposed Removal of the Concept of “Wetland Complexes” and Changes to the Criteria to Identify Provincially Significant Wetlands
The OWES Manual (Manual) is proposed to be amended to remove the concept of grouping smaller wetlands as a “wetland complex” for the purposes of evaluating them and determining if the wetland is significant.  Under the revised manual, we understand wetlands will only be grouped if they are within 30m of each other and that the presence of endangered or threatened species habitat would no longer be considered in the evaluation. The current distance in the Manual is 750m.
Individual wetland units not meeting the new definition and criteria would now be required to qualify as “significant” independently and not as part of their contribution to a larger grouping of wetlands and the presence of endangered and threatened species will not contribute to determining their value and protection.
The proposed change means that many of the smaller isolated tableland wetland units that currently form part of larger provincially significant wetland complexes in Peel will most likely be re-evaluated to be non-provincially significant.
This places locally significant wetlands at risk as there is currently no strong protection standard for non-provincially significant wetlands in provincial planning policy outside of the Greenbelt.
Although flexibility is needed to allow for some removal of wetlands in limited cases, the proposed approach of redefining significant wetlands has potentially significant consequences for the protection of Ontario’s most important wetland habitat.
There does not appear to be a clear rationale or basis for the proposed changes to the OWES Manual.
Recommendations
The proposed OWES Manual should retain a science-based approach to evaluating wetlands, including consideration of the presence of endangered and threatened species habitat, and a requirement for “wetland complexing” (e.g., by retaining the current wetland complexing distance of 750m in jurisdictions with very low wetland cover below specified thresholds).
Provincial policy should also be updated to provide strong protection for all wetlands and allow for some wetland removals in limited situations where justification can be demonstrated and subject to strict offsetting requirements as part of a net gain mitigation hierarchy policy.   Wetland removals should only be permitted in limited cases, subject to compensation that results in a net gain of wetland habitat both in terms of size and function.
2. Provincial Oversight and Approvals
It is proposed that wetland evaluations and mapping would no longer require MNRF approval.
Recommendation
MNRF should continue to provide oversight to approve science-based wetland evaluations and mapping to ensure a consistent standard is applied across Ontario. MNRF should also continue to be the recipient and holder of the OWES data and mapping information to reduce duplication of work at the municipal level.
B.	Conserving Ontario’s Natural Heritage - Proposed Ecological Offsetting Policy  (ERO Posting 019-6161)
Offsetting policies provide an opportunity to achieve important conservation gains if designed carefully and implemented with appropriate criteria and oversight. ,   There is also the potential that a policy could significantly compromise the protection of natural systems and result in further losses, especially in municipalities undergoing urbanization. If compensation for removals are offset in other municipalities, the impact is compounded.
Compensation and offsetting should only be considered in very limited circumstances, subject to a net gain mitigation hierarchy policy in conjunction with high protection standards for significant natural heritage features and areas.  In these cases, natural heritage system protection, restoration and enhancement should be the goal with some limited flexibility to offset losses where appropriate in situations where losses cannot be avoided in urbanizing areas (e.g., permitting offsetting for smaller, poorly functioning habitat patches, to accommodate essential infrastructure).
Recommendations
The development of a provincial offsetting policy under the Planning Act should be subject to further consultation with municipalities, Indigenous communities, and stakeholders to clarify appropriate governance, roles, and responsibilities and inform development of the proposed framework elements, limitations, criteria, and implementation that would be needed.  Details of the proposed policy are unclear and additional consultation is needed.
If a provincial offsetting policy is developed under the Planning Act, it should set out clear policy restrictions and limitations to define thresholds and/or features that would be ineligible for offsetting and subject to high standards of protection. It should also enable municipalities to develop policies that are more restrictive than the minimum requirements in the provincial framework.
Considerations for the design of the offsetting framework should:
•	Ensure offsetting is based on a net gain mitigation hierarchy policy requirement and only used in limited circumstances subject to justification and demonstration that avoidance and mitigation are not appropriate or feasible options;
•	Include limitations for use of offsetting, and require consideration of the irreplaceability, vulnerability and significance of the feature or area;
•	Ensure that net gain compensation requirements consider equivalency factors (e.g., like-for-like habitat type, area and function of the habitat being replaced);
•	Ensure that any replacement or compensation be provided in as close proximity as possible to where the removal is proposed (i.e., within the same municipality, watershed or adjacent watershed);
•	Include appropriate performance standards, implementation requirements and compliance monitoring; and
•	Provide for appropriate oversight and enforcement.
Further research and analysis should be undertaken before a provincial offsetting policy or program is created.  Should further consideration be given, prior to any policy or program, the Province and municipalities should have a thorough understanding of the potential impact and implications of the policy.
Conclusion
We trust that the Region’s comments will be helpful as the Ministry considers the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) and a proposed ecological offsetting policy for wetlands, woodlands, and other wildlife habitat.
The Region is committed to continuing to work with the Province, local municipalities, and key stakeholders towards meeting our shared objectives of increasing the housing supply. In addition, ensuring communities have healthy, natural heritage systems by providing strong protection for all wetlands and limiting wetland removals and offsetting. I would be pleased to provide any clarifications or further comments on these matters.

Dear Minister Smith,
RE: Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
Comments on the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
Established in 1995, Ontario Streams is an environmental charity dedicated to the conservation and rehabilitation of streams and wetlands through education and community action. Since our inception, we have worked closely with numerous communities, landowners, corporations, and school groups to develop lasting partnerships in education and environmental stewardship.  With 27 years of experience, Ontario Streams has continued to demonstrate leadership in aquatic ecosystem rehabilitation. Many Ontario Streams projects have occurred in and around the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), where the need for rehabilitation has been greatest.  In addition to the restoration projects that Ontario Streams continues to champion, our organisation has also been involved in the development of several programs, studies, and information-sharing projects. Ontario Streams also coordinates outreach and stewardship programs to foster environmental stewardship in the communities we work in. In 2018, Ontario Streams released its report on the State of the Wetlands (SOW) in the Lake Simcoe Watershed. This work has been continued with SOW in the City of Toronto (2021) and SOW in the Regional Municipality of York (2022) reports and hopes to continue this work guiding our understanding and preservation of this important natural heritage feature.
Background
The Province has estimated that by 2015 we had already lost 72% of our wetlands in southern Ontario compared to baseline data from Ontario’s Biodiversity Report (2015). For example, in the southern GTA wetlands only cover 2% of our landscape compared to historical coverage of 7%. Wetlands are critical to the health of our watersheds. They help to reduce downstream flood events, help to recharge our aquifers, protect groundwater, control erosion, and clean our waters of pollutants. Their organic soils and vegetation store vast amounts of carbon and are critical to retain if we want to meet our climate targets. Many of the province's animals and plants, including multiple species at risk, are dependent on wetlands for all, or part, of their life cycle. Wetlands and their adjacent woodlands and meadows, when protected, become new public natural areas for the enjoyment of our citizens. Our existing natural areas are suffering greatly from overcrowding since the public has rediscovered them during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In recognition of the importance of wetlands, provincial wetland scientists developed the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System manual, or OWES for short. This science-based evaluation system was first devised in 1982 and has been updated and expanded over the years as we have gained more knowledge on the ecological functions and value of wetlands. The OWES manual provides a scoring system, based on rigorous assessment against criteria that are used to assess whether a wetland, or a grouping of wetlands known as a wetland complex, is provincially significant and thus protected from development. There are biological scores (the more diverse and productive the wetlands the higher the score), social scores for how much a wetland is used by the public for hunting, fishing, and nature enjoyment, scores for hydrology (how much the wetlands aid in flood attenuation, erosion control, and protecting aquifers) and special features scores (the presence of rare species or communities, and fish and bird habitats). The scores are added up to see if they meet the provincial significance threshold. Over the past 40 years thousands of wetland complexes have been evaluated, with most of them being designated as provincially significant. It is estimated that the majority of the wetlands in southern Ontario have been evaluated.
Our organization does not support the proposed changes proposed to the OWES manual. The OWES manual and its scoring system is based on sound ecological principles and on the accumulated scientific knowledge we have acquired on the ecological importance and function of wetlands in maintaining healthy watersheds and Ontario's biodiversity. The changes being proposed are not supported by science. The drastic changes will result in downloading responsibility for wetland management to municipalities which lack the expertise. We recommend rejecting these proposed changes. We want our existing wetlands, whether contiguous or complexed, protected and we need to strengthen efforts to restore wetlands to ensure that we have healthy watersheds and more public natural areas for everyone to enjoy.
The proposed changes will in essence gut the manual. It will invalidate most of the thousands of evaluations that have been completed over the past 40 years. This is being done without consulting all the wetland experts that worked on this manual over the years. These changes will result in consultants for developers being able to downgrade the status of most wetlands that are currently provincially significant to non-significant and unprotected so that they may be destroyed forever and available for development. This will also impact all the private landowners that currently get a municipal tax reduction through the Conservation Land Tax Incentive Programme (CLTIP) for having a provincially significant wetland on their property. With the proposed changes, an adjacent owner or developer can get a consultant to downgrade their wetland status so they become ineligible for the tax reduction. The landowner has no recourse when this happens because the Province will no longer review and approve wetland evaluations. The evaluation and conservation of wetlands is a provincial responsibility for the people of Ontario.
This responsibility has been acknowledged by the Wetlands Conservation Partner Program (WCPP), a program in Ontario’s Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. The Province has committed to $30 million in capital funding over five years for wetland restoration and enhancement to address concerns for stormwater management using natural wetland infrastructure. The Ministry has identified wetland needs as improving their functionality and connectivity and conserving existing wetlands and their features and functions. These objectives contradict the proposed changes to the OWES manual and wetland evaluations any actions taken through this program will be wasted if the proposed changes go forward.
Specific Comments
Wetland Complexing
The current manual treats and scores a grouping of wetlands or a wetland complex as though it is one wetland. This is because wildlife research shows that numerous species visit many wetlands on the landscape, moving between wetlands and also utilizing the surrounding intervening upland woodlands and meadows. For example turtles such as the provincially threatened Blanding’s Turtle will travel and utilize many wetlands over the course of a year for feeding and hibernating. Woodland frogs breed in wetlands, but spend the rest of the year in surrounding woodlands to feed. The current manual says that wetlands within a maximum of 750 metres from each other and in the same watershed can be scored together as part of a wetland complex. This 750 metre distance covers the ability of wildlife to make such movements between wetlands. The update to the manual removes all mention of wetland complexes. Sections of the manual referencing wetland complexes are removed from pages 9, 15, 16, 26, 27, 29, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39 and 40. The only wetland complexing allowed in this proposed update (see page 20) is for small wetlands that are within 30 metres of each other in a woodlot or those within 30 metres of each other along a river or lake. There is no scientific basis to restrict wetland complexing to wetlands that are a maximum of 30 metres apart. This new cut-off of 30 metres will invalidate most of the thousands of existing evaluation wetland complexes that have been done over the past 40 years. This proposed change will lead to catastrophic consequences.  The proposed changes to the manual will allow an evaluator to take out a single wetland from a complex, evaluate it on its own, and down-grade it to non-provincial status without any scrutiny through a qualified peer review or government validation. Most wetlands on their own would not score as provincially significant unless they are very large and diverse wetlands. But because they are part of grouping of wetlands in a complex they do score as provincially significant due to the cumulative values of all the intrinsic wetlands. In conclusion, it does not make ecological sense to only score one wetland in isolation. In fact, if wetlands are only going to be scored individually it would result in most wetlands losing their provincially significant designation.  The existing wetland complexing rules need to be retained. Ontario Streams does not support this proposed change.
Scoring for endangered and threatened species
The proposed update to the manual no longer scores a wetland if it supports an endangered or threatened species (see changes on page 52). The manual currently makes a wetland or wetland complex that supports occupied habitat for a Species at Risk provincially significant and gives a high score for traditional migratory, feeding, and hibernation habitat used by these species. This scoring is in recognition of the fact that endangered and threatened species are facing provincial extinction if present trends continue. By scoring them in the manual you are protecting their wetland habitat or their traditional wetland feeding, migration, or hibernation areas. The existing scoring for endangered and threatened species needs to be retained.  Ontario Streams does not support this proposed change.
No standardization of wetland evaluations and no public repository for wetlands
Currently, wetlands are overseen by wetland experts at the MNRF and in areas that have Conservation Authorities (CA), these authorities regulate wetlands. MNRF is responsible for ensuring that all wetland evaluations and wetland boundary delineations meet the standards set out in the OWES manual. The Ministry also keeps a repository of all the approved wetland evaluations that are available to the public free of charge and also keeps up to date a digital database on the Province's wetlands that is freely available on the Ministry's website. The proposed update to the manual eliminates all mention of the roles of MNRF and CAs in wetland protection. MNRF wetland experts will no longer review or approve them nor will they continue to be the repository for all evaluations. A consultant for a developer with little field experience can now take the five-day accreditation wetland course and then evaluate wetlands on their own with no one ensuring they meet basic standards. The Ministry will no longer get a copy of the evaluation to keep in its public repository of wetland evaluations and will no longer be able to update its provincial wetland database. The public will no longer know what wetlands have been evaluated, what wetlands have been downgraded to non-provincially significant status, or what wetlands have had their boundaries changed or been totally eliminated due to development. The Province will no longer be able to assess the state of its wetlands (i.e. how many have we lost, how many have been restored). It will thus not be able to issue State of Biodiversity reports as required by the United Nations or know if it is meeting climate change targets in regards to wetland carbon sequestration.
Final thoughts
Ontario is home to approximately 25% of all wetlands in Canada and 6% of all wetlands in the world. The Province and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) acknowledged their role and responsibility in protecting these wetlands for future generations in their 2017 Wetland Conservation Strategy for Ontario 2017-2030. These features provide an economic value estimated at $17 billion annually through recreational benefits, helping aid soil retention and water purification, protection from and reducing the impacts of water contamination, and flood retention. Flood mitigation benefits alone are estimated at reducing economic costs of flooding by 38%. Additionally, Ontario has agreed to the protection and enhancement of wetlands, and the species they sustain, through numerous international agreements, including the Ramsar Convention and the Great Lakes Water Agreement. These have guided current Provincial wetland evaluation and management policies and continue to aid our strategies to protect these vital features.
The OWES manual in its current form, along with the role the MNRF plays in ensuring the integrity of wetland evaluations and managing the files, help to maintain and enhance our resiliency for the future. Removing these safeguards will pose threats to the Province both ecologically and economically. The Province needs to retain the existing rules and scoring for wetland complexing and significant species, and continue to review and approve wetland evaluations and boundary delineations and the CAs need to continue to regulate wetlands. Ontario Streams supports the ongoing comprehensive management of wetlands at the provincial level as the responsibility of the Government of Ontario.

We are writing to express our significant concerns regarding the extensive suite of changes proposed under ERO 019-6160 of Bill 23 or the More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022. We believe the proposed changes will harm native Ontario wildlife species and their habitats and will undermine the province’s commitments and accomplishments for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation and adaptation. We urge the Government of Ontario to provide cities, towns, and rural communities with a mix of ownership and rental housing types that meet the needs of all Ontarians without implementing the changes proposed in ERO 019-6160. We strongly oppose nearly all of the proposed changes under ERO 019-6160.

72672,/comment/72672,"The proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) are alarming for many reasons. Wetland complexes must be evaluated as a whole and NOT on a piece-meal basis. Also, he Province must maintain a role in the management of Provincially Significant Wetlands and if not, municipalities must be given the authority and resources to review and approve wetland evaluations.
First, under these proposed changes, wetlands complexes will no longer be evaluated as a whole and instead will be be broken up. As the threshold for significance remains the same, individual wetlands will have to attain the same score as the much larger wetland complexes to remain significant. This will make it almost impossible for  individual components of large wetland complexes to be evaluated as provincially significant.This will lead to the dismantling of Provincially Significant Wetlands, and their destruction. The severity of ecological impacts of this are unforeseeable, but will harm ecological communities, human communities and the economy.
Further, if these changes are implemented, the Province will not review or approve wetland evaluations, will no longer keep wetland evaluation files and will not maintain significant wetland mapping or provide information for use in wetland evaluations.
These responsibilities will be delegated to the municipalities, without additional budgets or provincial   assistance, and the municipalities will have NO authority to review and approve wetland evaluations submitted by landowners.
The wetland evaluator will only be accountable for the objectivity and accuracy of the wetland evaluation to the person paying for it.
As consequence, the property owner or developer seeking to remove the significant wetland designation will be the only authority determining if the wetland evaluation is valid. This is intolerable from an ethical and democratic perspective.
It is complete ecological madness to threaten wetlands in this way, as they are extremely important ecosystems that provide homes to biodiverse ecological communities, and they provide essential services that humans depend on. As the climate crisis accelerates, wetlands play an incredibly important role in carbon sequestration.

72679,/comment/72679,"Overall, I do not support the proposed changes to the OWES, and I do not think this is an appropriate step in addressing Ontario's housing crisis. First, I find the removal of detailed descriptions on what should be included in evaluation files, and the process of collecting such information to be problematic. This leaves the OWES open for taking shortcuts or conducting data collection and analysis incorrectly. In my experience as a researcher attempting to streamline the research and evaluation process, particularly in providing details on what data needs to be collected and how it should be collected will always compromise the integrity of the resulting report and findings. I do not see how removing these processes will continue to protect Ontario's wetlands, which is concerning given that it is well known protecting wetlands is essential in order to maintain local ecosystems and environments. On that note, I also find it troubling that most of the information around wetland complexes is being removed, especially considering if it is already known and explained why it is important to consider wetland complexes in evaluations. Again from my experience as a researcher, you cannot simply ignore complex systems, as changing or impacting one small part of a system can have unintended and sometimes catastrophic results in other parts of the system. It is a misstep to remove this from the current OWES and I suggest keeping that and all of the previously laid out data collection and reporting requirements. I understand that sometimes we need to streamline processes, but on the flip side we also need to ensure due diligence is taken and sometimes that requires a longer and more detailed process. As we are navigating a global climate crisis, updating the OWES to remove the details I discussed above appears to be a misstep by the Ontario government and will only lead to much more significant problems in the future. I would rather the government takes steps to address the housing crisis in a way that does not threaten or compromise our environment.
On a more personal note, I hope you take my suggestions seriously, as of late I have not felt my government is representing or considering my needs and the needs of my fellow Ontarians. If this government continues to remove and gut systems like the OWES I honestly don't know if continuing to live here makes sense.

72681,/comment/72681,"The South Shore Joint Initiative of Prince Edward County strongly opposes the proposals regarding wetland classification and administration
Wetlands play a critical role in a healthy, functional environment. Changing the classification system will mean further wetland loss and may result in serious flooding, putting the safety of communities at risk. Wetlands are a natural, cost-effective strategy for protecting downstream properties from floods, adapting to climate change, and retaining water to lessen drought impacts. By changing the classification system, existing Provincially Significant Wetlands could lose their status and un-evaluated wetlands are unlikely to meet the standard for additional protection.  This could lead to wetlands  being filled in, resulting in loss of habitat and numerous species, decreased storage area for water resulting in decreased flood storage but increased potential for erosion, and poorer water quality. These losses will have detrimental effects on tourism and recreation industries. Loss of wetlands will also result in the necessity of more stormwater ponds which require more maintenance and monitoring than wetlands. The government must be prudent when considering changes like offsetting, which could negatively affect the ability of wetlands to reduce flooding and confuse roles in wetland management and protection between municipalities and CAs.
I recommend that:
•	The province re-engage the multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group and work with the working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and develop better alternatives, prior to proceeding with current proposed amendments.

You are proposing to delegate responsibility to local planning authorities such as municipalities. Yet the municipalities will have no authority to review and approve wetland evaluations.
The changes, as proposed, say explicitly that a wetland evaluation will be considered ""complete"" when it is ""received"" by a planning authority.
The wetland evaluator will only be accountable for the objectivity and accuracy of the wetland evaluation to the person paying for it.

72688,/comment/72688,"I am a Canadian citizen and Ontario resident and taxpayer opposed to the Ontario government’s Proposed Update to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (019-6160).
Wetlands do not need to be sacrificed to provide housing. We can build new homes AND conserve the environment. The 2022 report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force stated, “… a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem. Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts.”
The proposed update to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System would result in only a few wetlands being deemed provincially significant, leaving existing Provincially Significant Wetlands vulnerable to losing that designation and therefore open to destruction.
Wetlands are vitally important to prevent flooding and natural areas offset climate change and support species at risk. We cannot recreate an extinct species. We cannot reproduce a wetland ecosystem. A September 2022 article in The Narwhal stated “Another ecosystem service that we can look at is greenhouse gas storage. So wetlands can sequester and store greenhouse gasses like carbon, whereas stormwater ponds don’t really do that in the same way.”
Ontarians need to not only have roofs over their heads, they need the security of knowing policies are being implemented to protect wetlands that help prevent flooded basements and expensive repairs. They will remember how they lost their right to oppose developments in their neighbourhood. Their children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, the voters of tomorrow, are relying on the Ontario government to protect the province’s future by wisely conserving Ontario’s environment.
The Ontario government can “Get It Done” without jeopardizing irreplaceable wetlands, priceless wildlife, and natural areas.

72690,/comment/72690,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES).
The OWES has been an important tool in identifying significant wetland features throughout the Province of Ontario.  We note that the proposed iteration of this system would devalue these wetlands in all instances except as part of the municipal planning process (Page 4, paragraph 6).
Based on the consultation guide provided, we have significant concerns with the changes proposed.  These concerns include the following:
1. It is unclear who the ultimate approval authority will be for changes to wetland designations and boundaries under various pieces of legislation (Planning Act, EAA, ARA, NEPDA, etc.).  We strongly recommend that this role remain with MNRF.
2. It is unclear who the ultimate holder of the wetland data will be.  We strongly recommend that this role remain with MNRF or another appropriate Provincial service.
3. It is unclear how many times a wetland can be re-evaluated and which re-evaluation is the appropriate one.
4. This new system removes the watershed lens and may result in impacts that extend outside of a municipal boundary, with no Provincial or conservation authority oversight to review the bigger picture.  We are opposed to this change in governance for the systems and believe that it will have negative consequences for natural hazard and natural heritage management in Ontario.
5. The removal of the wetland complex concept will serve to dramatically reduce wetland features on the landscape, increasing flood and drought risk, and reducing habitat, biodiversity and ecosystem services.  We are opposed to this change and believe that it will have negative consequences for natural hazards and natural heritage in Ontario.
6.  It is unclear if the guide is suggesting that the recent or future elimination of a wetland for agricultural purposes (Page 9) would cause a wetland to not be considered such any longer.  It is also unclear if such changes would allow for the removal of wetlands in advance of Planning Act applications under the guise of agriculture.
7. MNRF has a long history of natural resource management.  It is unclear why the consultation guide is proposing to remove all references to MNRF as a source of data for undertaking wetland evaluations.  We are opposed to MNRF being removed from a role here as it will negate decades of experience and corporate knowledge.

72705,/comment/72705,"Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation (ERO# 019-6160):
It is the firm opinion of NSERA (North Shore Water & Environmental Resource Advocates Inc.) that the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System will pose significant threats to ecosystems, farmland, surface water and groundwater.
Wetlands provide numerous critical benefits, particularly as we face the threats of climate change and biodiversity loss. They are productive ecosystems that provide refuges and movement corridors for numerous plants and animals,and are habitat for 20% of Ontario’s Species at Risk. Wetlands protect and purify water, control erosion, help prevent flooding, and maintain surface water flow during dry periods. They are popular places for recreational activities, which are key to maintaining both physical and mental health. They are a draw for nature tourism. This translates into employment,and helps support communities in rural and remote areas. Wetlands are one of the best free ways of trapping carbon and locking it into the soil; and the potential for wild foods and medicines should not be under-valued.
According to mapping by Ducks Unlimited, the province has lost between 50 and 90% of historic wetland habitat; to date, Southern Ontario has lost over 70% of its wetlands. In 1983, the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) was put into place in an effort to protect rapidly disappearing wetlands from development and, in turn, helped increase awareness of their importance. It was a system that was put into place for a reason!
Filling in wetlands is short-sighted and irresponsible. Due to their very nature, they do not easily support development. Filling in a wetland will permanently alter the hydrology that runs below ground. The cumulative impacts of permanent loss of habitat and changes to the behaviour of water in the watershed will result in flooding and drought damage, nutrient runoff, pollution, shoreline erosion, etc.
The proposed changes to OWES, summarized in ERO #019-6160, will mean the following:
1.	Removing the consideration of species-at-risk.  (This makes no sense at all! We are in a bio-diversity crisis!)
2.	No longer recognizing wetland complexes. ( Many wetlands are interconnected, and their functions contribute to the health of the whole.)
3.	Eliminating provincial oversight.  (So, consultation with MNRF will no longer occur and they will have no authority. Conservation Authorities will have been silenced. Approval authority will be handed to municipalities with little or no expertise, or a wetland evaluator hired by a proponent who stands to benefit will be responsible for evaluation of a development.)
If these proposed changes are adopted, before long, all of Ontario’s wetlands will have disappeared for the benefit of developers. Wetlands have enormous value and should be protected! Science-based information is needed to protect the environment. Politicians need to be made aware of the economic benefits of wetlands, and what the consequences of continued wetland destruction will mean. Or, do they know and simply not care?

72708,/comment/72708,"I am submitting the attached comments on behalf of the City of Ottawa.
The City of Ottawa believes that the proposed changes to the OWES would lead to a dramatic loss of wetlands and harm to their benefits in Southern Ontario. This would be on top of the historical loss of wetlands, which reaches more than 90% in some counties.  The changes contradict well understood wetland science.  They would undermine decades of planning decisions, with adverse effects on natural heritage and municipal plans.  They are intended to solve a problem that does not exist.  Finally, they are unnecessary, because the Community Infrastructure and Housing Accelerator already provides a valid mechanism to address site-specific instances of conflict between Provincial planning priorities of growth and wetland protection.
The City makes 10 recommendations in its submission.  The main recommendation is as follows:
Recommendation 1:  the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System should be withdrawn and a multi-stakeholder working group, including municipalities and Conservation Authorities, struck to consider and recommend any necessary updates to the system.
",comments-33.json
72710,/comment/72710,"The Long Point Region Conservation Authority (LPRCA) supports the government’s commitment to streamlining processes and reducing unnecessary barriers to development. However, we are concerned that the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) may have unintentional, negative consequences for public safety and water supplies.
1.	The critical role of wetlands in mitigating floods and maintaining water supplies on a watershed basis should be highlighted in considering changes to the Provincial Policy Statement and the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.
The Long Point Region Conservation Authority is concerned about the proposal to allow single wetland units in existing wetland complexes to be re-evaluated, potentially undervaluing their importance. Large wetlands and their adjacent satellite wetland features are fundamentally important in maintaining plant communities, wildlife populations, natural hydrology, watercourse health, irrigation resources and food production in the Long Point Region watershed.  Small adjacent satellite wetlands and their associated riparian habitat provide important wildlife production, including the production of amphibians that wouldn’t reproduce nearly as well in the main wetland due to the more permanent water and associated predators.  This primary production provides important food resources for species found in the main wetland.  Additionally, plant communities found in these adjacent seasonal and vernal wetlands are important in providing food and nursery habitat for wildlife that migrate to the more permanent open water wetlands as they develop.
In addition to wetlands’ well-recognized natural heritage roles, wetlands mitigate floods and maintain water supplies. The loss of the wetlands in the Long Point Region watershed that is likely to result from the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System and the off-setting provisions proposed in the Provincial Policy Statement will increase flooding and decrease water supplies including the supplies that support specialty crop production in the important Norfolk Sandplain region.
In the LPRCA watershed, many wetland complexes are found on the Norfolk Sandplain.  The Norfolk Sandplain is characterized by having a shallow unconfined aquifer that is seasonally recharged by precipitation, filling both the main and smaller satellite wetlands.  As the season progresses, the surface and groundwater from the smaller satellite wetlands moves through the sandy soils feeding the main wetland and the downstream watercourses.  The proposed elimination of wetland complexes will put these smaller adjacent wetlands at risk of being evaluated as less important, and without protection, the volume of both surface and groundwater storage will be impacted, impacting the hydrology of the main wetland and decreasing the volume of both surface and groundwater discharge, fundamentally important for maintaining the flows in downstream watercourses.  Without sufficient flows in the downstream watercourses there will be negative impacts on the natural ecosystem, recreation and tourism, irrigation and associated food production in the Long Point Region Watershed.
2.	The OWES requirement to access existing data sources should be strengthened.
As written, the proposed changes to the OWES suggest but do not require that evaluators consult existing data sources, increasing the likelihood that important data including species at risk observations and seasonal wetland hydrology fluctuations and associated habitats will be missed.
3.	The Hydrology Component of the OWES should be strengthened given the cumulative importance of wetlands in flood attenuation, erosion control and groundwater recharge, i.e. in mitigating floods and maintaining water supplies.
The Hydrology Component of the OWES 3.2 manual is oversimplified for “ease of assessment by non-hydrologists”. The cumulative importance of wetlands is admittedly under-valued, even negatively valued. Without consideration of complexing, an individual wetland cannot score well, i.e. be considered important, based on its hydrology function.
4.	Given the recognized importance of isolated wetlands for flood mitigation, Section 28(25) “wetland” (b) of the Conservation Authorities Act, that restricts the definition of wetlands to those that have a hydrologic connection to a watercourse, should be removed.
Section 28(25) of the Conservation Authorities Act that provides the definition of wetlands that applies to CA permitting includes a condition that the wetland:
(b)  directly contributes to the hydrological function of a watershed through connection with a surface watercourse.
Given the recognized importance of isolated wetlands for flood mitigation and the maintenance of water supplies, the CA Act definition of wetlands should include isolated wetlands, i.e. wetlands that are not connected to a watercourse. The history and reason for this limitation is outdated and the definition should be rethought.
5.	There must continue to be a central repository for wetland evaluations so that the collective knowledge of wetland attributes is recoverable.
With the proposals to drop the concept of evaluation updates and for evaluations to be submitted to the municipality and not the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), there is a risk that the collective knowledge about the attributes of wetlands will be lost. New knowledge will be disbursed among municipal planning files. Even if MNRF ceases to review evaluations, the evaluations must be copied to a central repository so the knowledge is recoverable when the need arises.
We request your thoughtful consideration of the proposed changes in this submission to identify solutions to stream development approvals without jeopardizing public safety. Sincerely,
Judy Maxwell, General Manager

72715,/comment/72715,"I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Westland Evaluation System (OWES) Manual….
Southern Ontario has lost over 70% of it’s wetlands already.
Wetlands serve a multitude of important biological, hydrological and social functions including;
•	Reducing downstream flooding
•	Carbon sequestration
•	Habitat for plants and wildlife
•	Habitat for endangered and threatened plants and wildlife
•	Highest biodiversity of any land type found in Ontario
•	Recharging groundwater supplies
•	Filter surface and groundwater supplies of pollutants
•	Control downstream erosion
•	Natural areas for public enjoyment
OWES Manual
Was developed by experts based on scientific principles that recognized the important biological, hydrological and social functions that wetlands perform.  For the government to ‘gut’ the manual (which will inevitably lead to the further destruction of wetlands), without any scientific rationale, and for the sole purpose of advancing economic development (guised as ‘required to provide more housing’) is extremely short-sighted and self serving.  I implore you to do the right thing, for the long-term betterment of Ontarians and rescind the proposed changes to the OWES manual.  We as a society, need more wetlands on our landscape, not less.
The proposed changes to the OWES manual and subsequent removal of wetland protection, which will lead to fewer wetlands on the landscape is in contradiction, directly and indirectly, to a number of mandates, policies, commitments, obligations, etc. that the Ontario government is subject to;
•	Science and evidence-based decision making
•	Implement Ontario’s Flooding Strategy to make Ontario more resilient to flooding in the long term. (Protect people, property and communities from forest fires, floods and droughts.)
•	MNRF Strategic Plan
•	Vision: Ontarians benefit from the health and wealth of the province’s natural resources, today and in the future.
•	Mission: To sustainably manage and promote the responsible use of our natural resources.
•	Sustainable Resource Management-Goal Statement: Maintain healthy and diverse natural resources and ecosystems that are resilient to change.  Using science and consultation to help inform decision-making. We also want to ensure our natural resources and ecosystems are resilient, so they can withstand and recover from potential changes and impacts. Healthy and diverse natural resources contribute to our overall health and well-being and provide valuable ecosystem services, including things like flood mitigation, climate regulation and pollination.
•	Ontario’s Biodiversity Strategy
•	The vision of this Strategy is a future where biodiversity loss is halted and recovery is advanced. People value, protect and enhance biodiversity and the ecosystem services essential for human health and well-being.
•	Three goals define the conservation path proposed in this Strategy:
•	Goal 1: Mainstream biodiversity by incorporating biodiversity considerations into decision making across the province, in different sectors and in our homes, workplaces and schools.
•	Goal 2: Protect, restore and recover Ontario’s genetic, species and ecosystem diversity and related ecosystem functions and processes.
•	Goal 3: Use Ontario’s biological assets sustainably
•	Ontario’s Climate Change Strategy
•	Carbon sequestration.  If wetlands (carbon sequestration) is reduced, emissions will need to be reduced equally simply to maintain status quo (targets).
•	wetlands can provide effective storm water management services and help mitigate the impacts of extreme weather on infrastructure such as storm sewers.
•	Ontario will continue to take action to reduce the vulnerabilities and strengthen the resilience of natural systems. The strategy will build on existing measures such as managing and restoring wetlands, increasing green spaces and managing diverse forests.
Please be a responsible, science informed, government that will do the right thing, for the long term, for the health and well-being of Ontarians and rescind the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System manual.

72718,/comment/72718,"The proposed reevaluation of Ontario's wetland protections is a TERRIBLE idea.
Firstly, wetlands are not the right place to build more housing. There is plenty of undeveloped land already available that's close to existing infrastructure. That's how you make housing affordable: by building up, not out.
And secondly, wetlands are some of the most important, precious, and vulnerable habitats, homes to thousands of species, including threatened and endangered. You cannot simply put a wetland elsewhere; these habitats take centuries to develop and cannot be replaced. Wetlands are crucial to combatting climate change, and destroying them will be disastrous not only for plant and animal species, but for us humans as well, as this will leave us in greater danger of environmental disasters such as flooding.
Chipping away the protected wetlands will set a dangerous precedent and leave everyone worse off.

RECOMMENDATION NO. 1: CELA recommends that MNRF apply an equity lens in crafting the OWES.
RECOMMENDATION NO. 2: Sections of the OWES dealing with wetland complexes should not be removed.
RECOMMENDATION NO. 3: Sections of the OWES which provide for consideration of reproductive habitat and migration, feeding or hibernation habitat for an endangered or threatened species during the evaluation of a wetland should not be removed.
RECOMMENDATION NO. 4: The Ministry should remain the approval authority for all wetland evaluations completed under the OWES.
RECOMMENDATION NO. 5: The section of the OWES dealing with “locally important wetlands” should not be removed.
Plus, OLTA proposes the following:
Removing wetland complexes, and consideration of reproductive habitat and migration, feeding or hibernation habitat for an endangered or threatened species, during the OWES evaluation process will result in changes to lands that are currently identified as eligible under CLTIP. This will likely result in smaller areas of land trust lands being eligible for CLTIP, and increased taxes for land conservation charities, which could cripple these local community organizations.
Changes to OWES must ensure that the ability of land trusts and other landowners to conserve conservation lands is not negatively impacted. The Conservation Land Tax Incentive Program is an essential program for land trusts providing tax relief to conservation organizations focused on private stewardship of provincially important natural areas. These areas provide essential ecosystem services to local communities.
ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION: Any changes to the OWES should ensure that the value of existing conservation lands is not eroded.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s proposal to amend the Conservation Authorities Act. I am writing to you in response to Bill 23, the More Homes Built Faster Act.
I understand and agree that there is a housing supply and affordability issue in Ontario that needs to be pragmatically addressed, and therefore support the government’s commitment to reducing unnecessary barriers to development and streamlining processes. That said, I have several concerns and recommendations with the proposed amendments and therefore offer the following comments for your consideration in amending the Conservation Authorities (CA) Act and any associated documents.
Ontario Wetland Evaluation System Classification Changes
Wetlands play a critical role in a healthy, functional environment. Changing the classification system will mean further wetland loss and may result in serious flooding, putting the safety of communities at risk. Wetlands are a natural, cost-effective strategy for protecting downstream properties from floods, adapting to climate change, and retaining water to lessen drought impacts. By changing the classification system, existing Provincially Significant Wetlands could lose their status and un-evaluated wetlands are unlikely to meet the standard for additional protection.  This could lead to wetlands  being filled in, resulting in loss of habitat and numerous species, decreased storage area for water resulting in decreased flood storage but increased potential for erosion, and poorer water quality. These losses will have detrimental effects on tourism and recreation industries. Loss of wetlands will also result in the necessity of more stormwater ponds which require more maintenance and monitoring than wetlands. The government must be prudent when considering changes like offsetting, which could negatively affect the ability of wetlands to reduce flooding and confuse roles in wetland management and protection between municipalities and CAs.
I recommend that:
•	The province re-engage the multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group and work with the working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and develop better alternatives, prior to proceeding with current proposed amendments.
Potential Loss of CA Lands
Minister of Natural Resources Graydon Smith has told media outlets that conservation authorities are “the second largest landowner after the Crown” and have been asked to “evaluate” their land in order to identify areas for housing development. In most instances, these lands have been acquired for specific purposes; typically, lands are purchased to protect the public from flooding and erosion or the lands are left through estate donations to the Conservation Authority by members of the public who wished their private lands stay natural. The development of these natural spaces will have numerous negative implications on the natural environment and a community’s ability to adapt to climate change. Further, the local tourism and recreation industries that rely on these spaces will feel the effects as will individuals of the public of who could experience negative social, mental & physical health impacts.
I recommend that:
•	The province focus efforts on building up urban areas instead of urban sprawl outwards;
•	Municipal Official Plans continue to be followed as written; and
•	Lands identified as natural hazards be maintained as open space.
Prohibition of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Review Agreements
It is unclear how this proposed change will benefit taxpayers.  Conservation Authorities have demonstrated for decades these services can be delivered efficiently, without lengthening the approval process, and is a cost-savings measure for municipalities who can share the cost of this review amongst all CA member-municipalities, rather than hiring staff at each municipality.  As proposed, the consequence appears to be either an increase in taxes as municipalities hire additional staff, a longer review process resulting from municipalities coordinating with neighboring municipalities, the cost of consultants needed for peer-review and the loss of land use plan review and comments provided on a watershed basis. Although the logistics of how this change will occur are unclear, one thing for certain is that this proposed change will also likely result in loss of jobs: Many staff at Conservation Authorities across the province will no longer be required. While currently unclear, if these reviews are no longer required, further job losses can be anticipated for municipal staff, engineers, and consultants who prepare various reports. Another negative implication of this proposed amendment is that studies, such as Environmental Impact Statements, now required to be completed by qualified consultants, could be overlooked or that staff at the municipal level will not have the expertise or capacity to review and comment on report submissions.  It is important to note that Conservation Authorities support smart development.
I recommend that:
•	Municipalities should retain the option to enter into MOUs with CAs, with clearly defined terms, timelines and performance measures, as allowed under Section 21.1.1 (1) of the CA Act;
•	Development should be limited to municipal urban boundaries; and
•	The Province re-engage the multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group and work with the working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and to develop guidance for commenting where a CA has entered into an agreement or MOU.
Low Risk Development Permit Exemptions
It is currently unclear how the proposed exemption of a permit requirement for low-risk development will benefit the people of Ontario. Details are lacking to determine whether the purpose is to transfer this permit responsibility from CAs to municipalities or whether development considered ‘low-risk’ will be exempt from requiring a permit all together.  As currently proposed, this amendment results in a lack of protection for the people of Ontario and a lack of watershed oversight.  I feel it is important to mention that CAs do not exist to hinder development, rather their role is to protect the people of Ontario and their properties. Therefore CAs ensure development is done in a manner to afford this protection. This proposed amendment has many negative implications for the people of Ontario as it quashes the core function of a CA and fragments the CA role in protecting the people of Ontario from natural hazards.
I recommend that:
•	This proposed amendment be repealed to keep all hazard-related responsibilities with the CA.
Fee Freezing
The details of the proposed amendments remain unclear at this time. It is important to note that current fees were established according to provincial direction, and were intended to recover costs, so as to decrease municipal levies.  Freezing fees will impose additional costs to municipalities, meaning taxpayers will end up paying these development costs. Another negative implication of this proposed change is created when fee revenues are used to pay wages.  Without a cost recovery system in place, the staff compliment required to perform application reviews becomes unaffordable to CA’s as fee revenues would be used, in part, to pay wages.  This will ultimately slow down the approvals process in these times of increased development.
I recommend that:
•	This proposed amendment be repealed to allow CAs to charge fees according to their internal cost-based analyses; or
•	This proposal be further amended to require CAs to demonstrate fees do not exceed the cost to deliver the program and have the ability to freeze fees when cost recovery exceeds 100 percent.
To ensure the most effective implementation of this Bill, I believe it is crucial that the government halts the proposed changes and meet with CAs to clarify and consider more effective alternatives. This consultation is imperative to safeguard the best possible outcomes for the people of Ontario.

72734,/comment/72734,"We strongly urge that the wetland identification and mapping program by MNRF must continue. It’s extremely valuable for understanding surface hydrology, groundwater and water quality factors. It’s critical to understand and be informed of all hydrologically associated landscape features if Ontario is to be successful at providing safety and protection of property from flooding.
Wetlands are critical carbon storage sinks. If disturbed, a lot of carbon will be emitted back into the atmosphere, setting us backwards on the essential path of needing to address climate change.
Wetlands are an essential part of natural heritage systems across Ontario. They also provide economic opportunities by way of protecting fisheries and attracting tourists. Changing the OWES and re-defining wetlands will downgrade their significance and contribute to wetland loss.
Losing wetlands will also produce or contribute to many of the water pollution and hazard conditions the historical statutory mandate of Conservation Authorities was designed to avoid.
Ontario has worked hard for decades to find the balance between development and protecting the environment, recognizing also benefits for human health, safety and personal enjoyment. Changes to the OWES will compromise all of this. It also places biodiversity and species at great risk. There is simply no justification for building on the limited few wetlands that remain in Southern Ontario in particular given there are other lands much better suited, serviced and accessible for development for the housing needed.
It is important to understand that draining a wetland will not prevent water from finding its way to that same location. If construction takes place on the site of a former wetland, there will be great risk and liability to the property owner. Insurance may not even be available to them given the known risks.
The function and service natural wetlands provide is invaluable and contribute greatly to province wide efforts to mitigate flooding, safety of life and property damage. It is imperative that we continue to leverage the value of such critical natural infrastructure as that provided by natural wetlands in these fiscally challenging times. Wetlands are also critically vital in the face of mitigating and adapting to climate change.

72742,/comment/72742,"1.) There is no need to degrade wetland protection in the name of providing housing. New housing should not be built on wetlands. It should be built in areas that already have infrastructure and are not prone to flooding.
From your own study, Report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force, February 8, 2022, (page 10) it is clear that there is enough land elsewhere currently available for housing :
""But a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the [housing] problem. Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts.""
""Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture.""
2.) Wetlands provide ecological services that are crucial to Ontarians and thus should be protected at the highest level.
A 2021 study of water filtration provided by southern Ontario wetlands showed a $4.2 billion/year service rendered.  Replacing this service by expanding current wastewater treatment capacity would cost the province $164 billion/year.
Wetlands also mitigate flooding and erosion which is key as we see more extreme weather events.
""By storing water and releasing it slowly, wetlands and deltas are important to Canada’s freshwater availability. Under certain conditions, wetlands can alleviate floods, maintain groundwater levels and streamflow, filter sediments and pollutants, cycle nutrients, and sequester carbon"" (Federal, Provincial and Territorial Governments of Canada, 2010.) CCCR Report 2019
3.) There is no need to weaken wetland protection by removing OWES from MNRF oversight. It is troubling that the proposed update removes this passage:
""The local MNR office has a detailed understanding of the natural heritage features and functions of the area, has access to current and historic reports, may be aware of relevant information and reports not readily accessible to others, and has connections with other organizations that gather natural heritage information."" (page 7)
Why should this expertise a not be accessed?  Many municipal governments lack just such expertise to critically assess best practices for wetland protection/development.
Downloading responsibility of OWES to municipal governments will also remove the ability to see a full picture of wetland protection and health in the province.
4.) Also very troubling in this proposed update is the removal of the term ""wetland complex.""
Wetland complexes occur where two or more wetlands (termed wetland “units”) separated by a non-wetland area are functionally linked. Functional linkages include wildlife usage (e.g., migration corridors, forage areas), and surface water and groundwater connections. Most wetlands in Ontario are complexes. Ignoring this ecological reality is unwise and short-sighted.
Fragmentation of wetland complexes further allows for potential piecemeal development without an eye to the health of the entire system.
5.) Also questionable is the removal of the term ""open file"" for the term ""complete"" on wetland evaluation files.
Currently OWES recognizes wetlands as dynamic systems that can change over time (due to natural succession, changes in hydrology, etc) and thus the wetland evaluation files maintained by MNRF District Offices are considered “open files”. These files can be amended from time to time as new information becomes available.
Labelling a wetland assessment ""complete"" fundamentally ignores the dynamic and changeable nature of wetlands. A mere snapshot assessment during a single season, month or year does not capture the complexity of an ecosystem but could potentially allow development where it previously would have been disallowed.
The proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation are not needed by Ontarians to improve housing. We need wetlands to provide clean water, carbon sinks, areas for recreation and tourism and flood mitigation. Wetlands are not appropriate areas for housing development.

The Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke (MCK) is writing to share our views on Ontario’s “Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System”, “Proposed Updates to the regulation of Development for the Protection of People and Property form Natural Hazards in Ontario” and “Legislative and Regulatory Proposals Affecting Conservation Authorities to Support the Housing Supply Action Plan 3.0” documents posted on the Environmental Registry of Ontario website. We recognize that these are just three of many proposed changes to legislation and regulation impacting Planning and Natural Heritage within Ontario and our comments below are relevant to and interact with these other proposals. As a resource limited community, the shear volume of proposed changes issued simultaneously overwhelms our capacity to conduct a thorough review of all of the documentation, and certainly does not align with a good faith effort to consult Indigenous communities on these matters that will greatly impact the Traditional Territory of many Indigenous Nations.
The traditional Territory of the Mohawk Nation extends from southern Ontario along Lakes Erie and Ontario, beyond Quebec City along the St. Lawrence River, and south into New York State. Typically, MCK defers to our sister communities of Akwesasne, Tyendinaga, and Six Nations of the Grand River for consultation matters within the jurisdictional boundary of Ontario, however the egregious nature of the proposed modifications to the wetland evaluation system, coupled with other proposals impacting the Green Belt in Ontario, the role of Conservation Authorities, and other legislative changes convinced us that a direct response was required.
The Mohawks of Kahnawà:ke exercise hunting, fishing, and gathering rights within many parts of Ontario, including along the St. Lawrence River, within the Bay of Quinte, along the Grand River and elsewhere within our Traditional Territory. We also hold stewardship rights and responsibilities associated with protecting the biodiversity of all living things within our Territory. In this regard, we are guided by the Ohén:ton Karihwatéhkwen (the words that come before all else); an environmental and spiritual code based on our traditional laws and practices. It encompasses principles that lead us to carefully consider intricate ecological connections that may not be readily apparent when evaluating a single area, species or activity. The application of the Ohén:ton Karihwatéhkwen serves as an expression of our custodial rights as Onkwehonwe, and demonstrates to all the importance of human responsibility in ensuring that relationships with all living beings are well balanced and all environmental aspects are considered.
Based on our review of the documentation provided, several major concerns with the proposals have been identified:
Elimination of oversight, standardization, and comprehensive record keeping and the downloading of responsibilities to municipalities
The proposed changes eliminate the role of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry in implementing the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES), instead downloading this responsibility to municipalities.
It is unclear to the MCK how municipalities could be expected to have the necessary resources to appropriately review and approve these evaluations. More significantly, downloading these responsibilities eliminates the ‘duty to consult’ trigger that a provincial authorization necessitates (the provincial and federal governments are required to consult with Indigenous communities whereas municipalities do not have the same legal obligation). This leaves Indigenous communities with a significantly reduced role in the review and determination of wetland significance within the province. This is an unacceptable result. A mechanism to ensure consultation with Indigenous communities is required.
Similarly, by eliminating the use of wetland evaluations for any purpose beyond municipal planning, Ontario is eliminating a significant repository of information concerning the status of wetlands within Ontario. This data is of significant interest to Indigenous communities as another knowledge source to assess with planning and management of traditional Territories.
Reductionist approach to wetland protection through the elimination of appropriate consideration of wetland complexes
Wetlands are complex systems with extensive surface water and groundwater connections. Understanding these linkages are key to wetland health and preservation. The proposed changes virtually eliminate any consideration of these interactions by removing all wording associated with wetland complexes and narrowly defining a series or wetlands as those within 30 m of one another (versus an existing definition that considers up to a 750 m separation). These wetland complexes can now be re-evaluated as isolated units, with the expected outcome being lower scores and less protection for these features. Eliminating one wetland within a complex will have direct and indirect impacts on other wetlands within the complex and over time, even wetlands that originally maintain a provincial designation will be degraded. Future re-evaluations could then lower their scores as this degradation process continues. The government of Ontario is clearly ignoring the established science around the important interactions between wetlands in their effort to unlock all of Ontario for development.
Wetlands play a crucial role in improving water quality, absorbing rainfall and moderating river flows, and as spawning and feeding areas for fish and wildlife. The inevitable loss of wetland protections and subsequently wetlands associated with these changes will reduce water quality, impact fish and reduce biodiversity. The Mohawks of Kahnawà:ke rely on wetland habitats in Ontario both in the direct exercise of rights within our traditional Territory and also indirectly to enhance water quality in the St. Lawrence River including as it passes alongside our community.
Removal of existing significant weighting for habitat for threatened and endangered species
The proposed changes eliminate very significant scoring for breeding and use by threatened and endangered species (up to 250 points / endangered species breeding in a habitat). Instead, threatened and endangered species are grouped with ‘provincially tracked species’ and receive far lower weight in the scoring system. Given a score over 600 is considered provincially significant, this change alone will likely eliminate provincially significant status for many of Ontario’s wetlands. This is critically important given the biodiversity crisis globally, which includes many species at risk found within southern Ontario in particular. Reducing these weightings is a grave error, particularly without any compensating reduction in the overall score required to qualify as a provincially significant wetland.
While MCK believes that the existing OWES approach may be overly prescriptive and does not sufficiently consider the full intrinsic value of wetlands and ecosystems as a whole as highlighted above through the Ohén:ton Karihwatéhkwen, this proposed change removes the scientific basis for this scoring element in favour of a political agenda, with biodiversity loss the inevitable result.
Elimination of the designations of Local or Regionally Significant Wetlands
Another significant change to the OWES is the elimination of Local or Regionally Significant Wetlands. These make up a significant portion of the protected wetlands currently in Ontario and their elimination represents another example of the provincial governments intention to develop regardless of the cost. One rationale for a regionally significant wetland designation is the use of the wetland by Indigenous land users. Eliminating this provision is another example of Ontario’s disrespect and disregard for Indigenous Peoples and will directly impact the exercise of rights on traditional Territory.
Removal of “bonus scoring” for use of wetlands by Indigenous hunters
In the existing OWES, bonus points are allotted for areas that are used by Indigenous hunters. While the overall OWES document requires additional enhancements to better recognize the role of Indigenous communities in stewardship of their Territories, the proposed changes eliminate the only two specific references to Indigenous Peoples within the document.
A revision to the OWES system must more directly consider the role of Indigenous Peoples in the stewardship of natural heritage. Explicit consultation with impacted Nations must be added as a requirement of the evaluation, particularly if Ontario maintains its position of downloading its duty to consult to the municipalities. Similarly, the use of wetlands by Indigenous land users must be more heavily weighted in the evaluation process, not eliminated. Impacts of the potential loss of wetlands that are being used must be considered and accommodated to the satisfaction of the impacted users. Vague guidance suggesting evaluators may reach out to Indigenous communities are insufficient to meet the obligations of the government and must be strengthened in consultation with Onkwehonwe.
Conclusion
The proposed changes are unacceptable to the MCK as they will significantly reduce wetland and other natural heritage protections in the province leading to the elimination of many of these critically important features. They also reduce the level of consultation required with Indigenous communities in the wetland evaluation process. The roles of wetlands in enhancing flood protection, ground water recharge, water quality, erosion control, and as habitat for wildlife including many at risk and culturally significant species are well-known, and indeed have been outlined within the OWES document. Ignoring the valuable benefits of wetlands and other natural heritage features will lead to significant additional costs in the future and are not the answer to eliminating housing shortages.
Particularly at a time when the government of Canada is working on ambitious conservation goals (25 % of lands by 2025, 30 % of lands by 2030), it is disheartening to see Ontario moving in the opposite direction. In this era of significant biodiversity loss and climate change, natural heritage features are ever more critical as refuges for wildlife including migratory species, and to shelter our communities from the impacts of increased storms, drought, pollution, and other extremes.
Prior to moving forward with any of these changes, the MCK requires direct consultation with the government of Ontario in order to respond to our concerns raised above, and to discuss how the proposals can be modified to prevent the devastation of wetlands and other natural habitats in Ontario.

72762,/comment/72762,"The Frontenac Arch Biosphere Network is a not-for-profit organization working to promote sustainable livelihoods and strengthen the conservation of biodiversity in Eastern Ontario. Effective conservation is vitally important because biodiverse ecosystems attract tourism, an industry that provides the basis for commerce and jobs in this region. However, this biodiversity is increasingly threatened by habitat loss, especially the wetland habitats of species at risk.
We are following expert guidance developed by Canada's Pathway to Target 1 initiative (see link) to assess the effectiveness of conservation measures in our region. Through this process, we have identified that the Provincially Significant Wetland designation provided by the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) is crucial to the protection of wetland habitats on which our biodiversity depends.
The proposed removal of criteria for the “Provincially Significant Wetland” designation such as:
•	hydrologically connected wetlands or “wetland complexes” and
•	species at risk
 would severely undermine the effective conservation of these vitally important habitats.
Municipalities in our region use the Provincially Significant Wetland designation as the basis of their natural heritage frameworks to inform planning decisions.  Our assessments have determined that the official plans and zoning by-laws of municipalities provide a very important layer of protection for ecosystems, especially when they are reinforced and supported by policies and legislation from other levels of government.  If wetlands in our region lose the Provincially Significant designation and new wetlands are not added to it, our municipalities will lack the required information and policy mechanisms to effectively conserve these important habitats and water sources.

72767,/comment/72767,"Please find attached detailed comments from Save Ontario Wetlands pertaining to ERO 019-6160. Below is a summary of key concerns and recommendations:
On behalf of the over 70 Ontario aquatic scientists and practitioners that joined the Save Ontario Wetlands grassroots initiative, we submit comments pertaining to the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES). For the record, these comments and recommendations were completed under a remarkably short review period (30 days), and thus are mainly focused on key proposed changes that we are most concerned about.
Summary of main concerns and recommendations:
The proposed changes to OWES described in the ERO posting # 019-6160 undermine the wetland report card in 6 key ways:
1.	Insufficient review timeline (30 days) to assess, evaluate, and comment on the extensive proposed changes to OWES.
We recommend extending the review and comment period until at least Dec. 30th, 2022 to allow a robust review and consideration of all the implications of these proposed changes.
2.	Removal of key oversight responsibilities of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF) in the OWES process.
We recommend that related OMNRF staff maintain an integral role in wetland evaluation and assessment to ensure wetland expertise and sufficient oversight is part of the evaluation process.
3.	Creation of a piece-meal and under-resourced wetland evaluation process by apparently downloading this important work to municipalities with little to no wetland expertise on staff and no additional resources.
We recommend OMNR remain the custodians of OWES files and continue to train professionals in the implementation of OWES. Amendments must retain clear lines of responsibility and afford validation and quality control of OWES evaluation files to protect the integrity of the evaluation process.
4.	Removal of counting the value of a wetland for threatened and endangered species in the Special Features category.
We recommend that wetland value as habitat for threatened and endangered species remain in the Special Features category. Alternatively, the scoring thresholds for consideration as Provincially Significant should be dramatically lowered. Given 32% of species at risk in southern Ontario rely on wetland habitat and yet 60-90% of historic wetlands have already been destroyed, it is a safe assumption that all wetlands remaining in southern Ontario provide significant support for species at risk.
5.	Removal of wetland complexing in spite of the mountain of scientific evidence that geographically isolated wetlands are ecohydrologically connected and interdependent.
We recommend that wetland complexing remain in the OWES to allow interconnected wetlands to be evaluated as an integrated whole.
6.	The introduction of “re-evaluations” of previously evaluated and designated Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSW).
We recommend that the amendments concerning “re-evaluations” be removed from OWES given the process already treats evaluations as “open files” and encourages updates. The addition of “re-evaluations” is redundant and wasteful given only a fraction of the wetlands remaining in Ontario have undergone a single OWES evaluation.

As an individual who believes in living a healthy and connected lifestyle, pedestrian and cyclist oriented cities and towns are the ideal socially responsible way to go about building our cities. Sprawl encourages car dependency and also results in the destruction of farmlands and wetlands which play important roles in the lives of human and animals and guarantee food supply and biodiversity.
We need to maintain the wetlands that we currently have and any proposed changes to the OWES to make it easier for developers to build on top of established wetlands should not proceed. Especially shocking among these proposed changes is the suggested removal of sources of information of agencies containing useful ecological or biological info on wetlands that could be useful for planning committees.

72778,/comment/72778,"If Bill 23 is passed as it currently stands, I personally I will be ashamed to be an Ontarian and even more so to be an ecologist. With passing this bill, it will show how Ontario no longer values the protection of clean drinking water, nor the protection of people and property from hazards and other impacts, especially in the face of climate change. It will also demonstrate the short-sighted planning Ontario has set-out with no scientific justification that will be detrimental for generations to come.
The welfare of citizens, present and future, and our natural ecosystems (i.e., natural heritage) should be the utmost importance to the Ontario government. Bringing more business to Ontario will be irrelevant when our land is inhospitable and no longer able to support healthy communities. While this may not be something today's adults experience, planning for the long-term is essential for protecting people and the natural environment. It has been widely shown, that healthy, intact ecosystems support thriving and healthy communities. Related, now more than ever citizens want access to nature and green spaces. All Ontarians should be able to have access to green spaces, however, this requires proper planning and likely the addition of green space, not as proposed, removing green spaces to build more homes.
It is estimated that Ontario has already lost approximately 75% of wetlands on the landscape and we cannot afford to lose more. Wetlands play a vital and necessary role in mitigating flooding, erosion, as well as improving water quality and quantity. Aside from the many important benefits of ecosystem services that wetlands provide, wetlands support countless rare plant and wildlife species including numerous Species at Risk. In Southern Ontario, we should be protective and proud of the rich biodiversity Ontario supports, not searching for ways to weaken the protection of species and their habitat.
I am deeply concerned about many of the proposed changes, including removing the ability to complex wetlands without any scientific justification. The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) could be updated and improved; however, the updates should be as of a result of meaningful discussion and received input from relevant professionals and experts, which has not occurred presently.
The narrative of lack of land in Ontario is a falsehood. We have enough land to increase affordable housing without compromising the integrity of our natural heritage systems. Ontarians do not want more urban sprawl, what we need is densification of housing. The fear felt by many individuals is that these proposed homes won’t be affordable by average Ontarians, instead these proposed houses will be luxury homes.
Removing Conservation Authorities from the equation will result in lost local knowledge and significant loss of protection for people and structures from natural hazards. Conservation Authorities should not be seen a barrier to housing, but rather a very important planning partner.
Suggestions voiced by others that I as a citizen I support include protecting natural heritage systems for the long-term in balance with addressing the housing affordability problem. As well as recognizing and supporting the important role of conservation authorities and upper-tier municipalities in providing knowledge and support in land use planning at a watershed, regional, and local scale. To remove either of these parties will put an unnecessary burden and strain on lower-tier municipalities that are not equipped, nor property staffed to support these changes. Lastly, I support building upon the current systems approach to natural environment planning. Specific examples put forward include continued support of green infrastructure to aid in building affordable communities which will be more resilient to climate change.

The issue with housing has nothing to do with availability and it has everything to do with cost. By removing protections from many wetlands with your re-evaluation to create new homes, you will not only be destroying the homes of wildlife but adding extra insult to injury by constructing homes that only the wealthy can afford. I say this as a dual-citizen who has been wishing to move into Ontario from the United States for several years. Even the low quality housing is unaffordable in Ontario, and destroying the environment will not change that.
Addressing the solution to the problem you are trying to solve can easily be done without destroying the country's most valuable ecosystems, especially when so many of them are already at risk. The issue is cost, not availability.

72784,/comment/72784,"From Town of Halton Hills Planning Staff:
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. The Town conducts wetland evaluations and assessment according to the OWES and reviews/ utilizes any available evaluations completed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Conservation Authorities as part of Scoped Subwatershed Studies in support of Secondary Plan processes. In addition, through development applications, the completion of wetland evaluation using OWES may be required as part of site-specific Environmental Impact Studies. The OWES is used by trained wetland evaluators when undertaking an evaluation and the Town agrees that ensuring a streamlined process is beneficial and can assist with expediting the planning approval process. It is also important though that key natural heritage features and functions continue to be protected as part of an overall systems based approach. Below please find the Town of Halton Hills’ comments:
Changing the approval of evaluations from the MNRF
The Town has concerns with this proposal. It is not clear which decision maker will be transferred the responsibilities previously assigned to the MNRF, including confirming provincially significant wetlands. It is important that there be oversight and review of the OWES submissions that are included as part of a complete development application. It is anticipated that if the responsibility is now assigned to municipalities, the municipalities may be required to hire third-party reviewers to review and evaluate OWES submissions that are part of a complete development application.  Given most municipalities are not appropriately resourced to complete these tasks, the additional time required to have the submissions peer-reviewed may further delay the planning approval process. The CAs would be a logical candidate to assist in this regard subject to appropriate MOUs setting out clear expectations and deliverables.

The proposed updates are entirely inadequate to meet the stated objectives of streamlining the building of more homes.
There are no suggestions of changes relative to the complexities of building homes while maintaining or improving the wetland contributions for healthy and sustainable life in an era of population growth and climate change. There should be updated methodology for measuring the contribution of wetlands in any proposed developments. There should be expanded provincial expertise in assessing wetlands, including their importance in resilience to ever increasing changes in water flows under climate change. There should be expanded consideration of the scale of wetland, and the interconnectedness of wetlands in evaluation systems. Current standards for provincial significance do not reflect the importance that wetlands have in highly populated areas in which small, interconnected wetlands may be crucial.
The ministry should be expanding its level of expertise and playing a role along with municipalities in planning for improvements in housing along with improvements in wetlands, not simply assuming it necessary to deplete one of life's essentials to expand the amount of shelter available.

72811,/comment/72811,"On behalf of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA), please find attached our submission with respect to ERO # 019-6160 (Proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System).
OFA is not in favour of removing the requirement for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) to review and confirm wetland evaluation results. We believe a no-cost appeal process should exist for landowners who firmly believe that the feature identified on their farm as a wetland is, in reality, not a bona fide wetland, and we believe that MNRF is the appropriate body to do this.
OFA is pleased to see this proposal includes notification in writing to “landowners of the property of properties containing the wetlands… of any new wetland evaluation or amended wetland evaluations…” (p.8). However, we believe that this does not go far enough. Notification should be provided to any potentially impacted landowner and tenant which may include neighbours who could be impacted by buffers or species-at-risk restrictions around the wetland that do not respect property boundaries. It is also essential that both landowners, tenants and neighbours receive notification before the feature has been designated as a wetland in the Official Plan.
OFA insists that the definition of wetlands is incomplete in the OWES system and manuals. The definition used should be the complete definition found in the 2020 Provincial Policy Statements (PPS). OFA recommends that in both OWES manuals, the definition of a wetland should be expanded to include wording from the second paragraph found in the 2020 PPS’ Wetlands definition: “periodically soaked or wet lands being used for agricultural purposes which no longer exhibit wetland characteristics are not considered wetlands for the purposes of this definition”
OFA believes wetland evaluators should be required to  notify landowners and tenants that an evaluation is being undertaken on their property prior to accessing private property. OWES evaluators and any other persons helping an evaluator on field visits must strictly abide by all relevant biosecurity and health and safety protocols in place on any farm. OFA is in favour of field visits during evaluations as a means of ground truthing. The timing of visits is important to ensure that simply wet lands are not erroneously classified as wetlands.
OFA strongly recommends that instances of decisions being based upon the professional judgement of the wetland evaluator must be clearly detailed in all documentation and include factors and/or assumptions that may been considered to reach that decision.

Hon. Graydon Smith, Minister
Natural Resources and Forestry
Whitney Block, 99 Wellesley St W,
Toronto ON M7A 1W3
RE: ERO Posting 019-6160 Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation Systems (OWES)
Dear Minister Smith,
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the above noted Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) posting.
The OWES is a science-based system that outlines process and criteria to determine the relative significance and importance of wetlands. The system was developed in the 1980s in recognition of a need to understand wetlands, and to protect the most significant wetlands, regardless of ownership, through the land use planning process. Recognizing the valuable conservation role that private landowners can play in conservation, the province has supported private stewardship of wetlands through its administration of programs like the Conservation Land Tax Incentive Program.
The existing OWES, in which responsibility for administration of provincially-significant wetland boundaries rests with MNRF, has faced challenges related to the precision of original mapping, its subsequent digitization, and with the resource levels assigned by the province to maintain this system. In some cases, local Municipalities have been challenged in the face of landowner opposition to delineate provincially significant wetlands in planning documents.
The proposed changes remove MNRF from the administrative function, without indicating a clear replacement to support municipalities. It appears that the intent is for municipalities to assume this role. Bruce County and its local Municipalities do not have the resources or capacity to assume this role. Further, distributing this role across 400+ municipalities will be neither efficient nor yield consistent stewardship of provincially-significant wetlands.
The proposed changes define an evaluation as ‘complete’ when it is ‘received by a decision-maker addressing a land use planning and development or resource management matter.’ The evaluation must include a field visit, and landowner permission must be obtained for the field visit to occur. Opportunities to complete evaluation using other data sources are removed. Presence of threatened or endangered species within a wetland is removed as a scoring criteria.
While Wetlands provide essential flood management functions, the biodiversity values associated with wetlands would fall outside of the core mandate of Conservation Authorities. Changes proposed in Bill 23 would preclude their role in stewardship of the OWES.
The proposed changes premise that wetland evaluators have the competence and the professional judgement to definitively evaluate wetlands, but presumably not enough competence to evaluate their complexity – as the current manual notes, “the grouping of wetland areas into a complex should only be done by experienced evaluators [emphasis added].” The concept of connected wetland “complexes” appears to be incompatible with an approach that relies entirely upon individual evaluators.
The only contemplation of wetlands that are not entirely contiguous is within the ‘Wetland Edges Bordering of Lakes and Rivers Section’ which references wetlands within 30 metres ‘interspersed with small pockets of upland forest’ and ‘wetlands along a river of [sic] lake that are separated by 100 feet or less. The content doesn’t fit the title, the units don’t match and regardless the distance is new, arbitrary, and prone to interruption from previous human activities – for example, shoreline alterations, or infrastructure along lakes and rivers.
The proposed changes are described in the Environmental Registry of Ontario as a “removal of duplication and streamlining.” None of the changes appear to streamline the process for protecting vulnerable wetlands from development or for recognizing the increased importance of wetlands that are home to species that may be under increased threat of extirpation or extinction as habitat loss continues.
Rather these changes facilitate the breaking up of wetland complexes into units that can be refined out of significance and ultimately removed from the landscape. The changes streamline the process for removing visible and effective zoning protections for wetlands, eliminating the “duplication” with provincial legislation around species at risk that relies upon (1) identification; and (2) enforcement, resources for both of which are lacking at the provincial level.
The proposed changes seemingly shift responsibility from the MNRF in order “to better recognize the professional opinion of wetland evaluators”; however, there does not appear to be any oversight or peer review function, which is the standard for professional evaluation. Also, aside from the one-time 50-hour certification, the OWES training has no code of ethics for evaluators, and no continuing education component or re-certification requirement.  These are all aspects of the MNRF's Ontario Tree Marking program for certifying silvicultural practitioners on Crown Land which is an excellent archetypal example.  We strongly recommend that the province put in place a similar program to ensure a high standard of training and accountability for wetland evaluators in Ontario.
Wetlands are an essential part of our natural legacy and provide critical climate change mitigation and adaptation functions. Reducing wetland protections will increase risks to life and property from natural disasters and require more infrastructure that is costly to develop and maintain, saddling the next generation of Ontarians with greater debt.
Bruce County recommends that the province not proceed with the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, and that it consult with stakeholders to better address the procedural issues and consider which agency or level of government can most efficiently and effectively administer wetland stewardship.

The proposed changes to the OWES, including the removal of wetland complexes and the re-evaluation of previously evaluated wetlands, will lead to a more fragmented and degraded wetland
system. Wetlands play a critical role in Ontario by providing protection from impacts such as
flooding, drought and other effects of climate change while also providing rich, biodiverse features
for local fauna and flora. The loss of smaller wetlands, previously captured under the wetland
complex or as provincially significant wetlands, will result in a significant loss of functions and
services, leading to degraded water quality, more flooding, loss of species, habitat and
biodiversity, etc. These changes may exacerbate future climate change impacts. The proposed
changes to the OWES may also result in the loss of species, particularly endangered and
vulnerable species. Based on the new evaluation, the number of points designated for the
presence of endangered species has been significantly reduced, making it easier to remove the
wetland.
The City has concerns around the lack of oversight and changes to the wetland evaluation
process. Previously, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) was responsible for leading and
providing oversight of the OWES. With the removal of MNR and Conservation Authority
involvement, as well as limiting the ability for municipalities to review completed documents, there
are concerns around the lack of oversight, expertise, and quality control of these evaluations,
particularly when consultants (hired by the developers) are conducting wetland evaluations. As
noted in the proposal, once the evaluation is submitted to the municipality, it is ‘deemed complete’,
removing all ability for the municipality to comment on or provide oversight to the
evaluation. Additional comments pertaining to the evaluation process include:
Consultants will not be required to stake the entire wetland, raising concerns that the
evaluation will not accurately capture its significance.
There will be no proper standard or limit for re-mapping of a wetland, allowing re-mapping
to be triggered for any reason. This can lead to abuse of the process, purposeful impact
to the wetland system, and wasteful use of resources.
Municipalities do not have expertise to provide the technical review required that was
previously undertaken by the CA’s and MNR. Municipalities will need additional resources,
funds and policy support to be able to undertake the proposed changes in Bill 23.
Based on the proposed changes to the OWES, there are concerns over a lack of a
centralized file system previously completed by MNR. Without a centralized system to
store wetland evaluation files, this may limit the information available to the City on
wetlands and would make it more difficult to have access to the information.
Overall, the proposed changes will result in a reduction in protection of provincially significant
wetlands and other wetlands in Brampton. The changes will remove any oversight of the wetland
evaluations and standardizations, relying on developers and their consultants to conduct the
evaluation and submit what is assumed (without basis) to be appropriate and reliable
documentation. It downloads the remaining responsibilities to municipalities. These changes will
result in a conflict of interest for consultants and more work, time and effort for municipal staff to
oversee. These changes will require additional staff in the City who are knowledgeable in
technical matters with regards to biology, ecology and hydrogeology.
Recommendations:
To address these concerns, we recommend the following amendments to the proposed
legislation:
Appoint a Conservation Authority or municipality as the approval authority for
assessments;
Allow approval authorities to review and comment on assessments once complete;
Require mandatory credentials for those undertaking assessments to ensure quality
control;
Provide a transition period to allow municipalities the time to adjust to these changes;
Commit to developing a policy statement that clearly states there will be no net loss of
wetlands in Ontario;
Maintain wetland complexes to ensure smaller wetlands are maintained and protected;
Provide guidelines on when remapping of PSW wetlands is appropriate; and
Rescind the reduction of points for endangered species to ensure that provincially
significant wetlands are protected.
The City of Brampton would like to thank the Province for the opportunity to provide feedback
and comments on the proposed changes.

72863,/comment/72863,"WSP Ecology supports the initiative to revise the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) and appreciate the effort that has been expended; however, we recommend that a more transparent and thorough OWES review process be completed prior to posting on the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO).
The key areas where we request additional clarification are the following:
1)	the process leading to the revised OWES
2)	clear rationale for each of the proposed changes
3)	the removal of Provincial oversight and administration of the OWES process and the capability of municipalities to effectively take on a review and approval role in a timely manner
4)	removal of wetland complexes
5)	removal of references to other existing natural heritage policies (e.g., PPS)
Each of these five areas are expanded upon below, including our recommendation for each point.
1. OWES Revision Process
Although there are two somewhat ambiguous intent statements on ERO 019-6160 regarding clarity of assessment / identification and streamlining of development decisions, it is unclear how those objectives were set and how they are to be achieved with the proposed changes. Further, there is a lack of transparency with respect to the process leading the proposed changes, namely the credentials of those who completed the revisions.
Recommendation 1: Form a committee to review the current OWES manual, consisting of experts and interested stakeholders; update and revise the manual, then post for input on ERO.  Other proposed changes included in Bill 23 should be considered in an integrated manner as input to the updated OWES.
2. Rationale & Objectives
Aside from the intent statements listed on ERO 019-6160, there is no rationale provided for the changes in the manual.  ERO 019-6160 notes that “The OWES has been in place since 1983. Over the last decade in particular, we have heard practitioners voice concerns and recommendations for improvements to how Ontario’s significant wetlands are assessed and identified.”  Those specific concerns and recommendations and how they informed the proposed changes in the OWES manual have not been provided.
Recommendation 2: Through the process recommended in Recommendation 1, provide clear rationale for each proposed change to the OWES manual.
3. Lack of Provincial Oversight & Administration
Currently, OWES is a province-wide system administered by a Provincial ministry.  As such, wetlands are considered at a watershed- or natural heritage system level with the intent that they are assessed consistently across Ontario.  With the proposed changes, it appears that there will be no Provincial oversight or administration of the OWES at a process or technical level.   Rather, it appears that municipalities will be responsible for reviewing and approving OWES evaluations as the bodies that ‘generally implement Ontario’s planning process’ (per p.3, paragraph 4 of the revised manual).
This could create potential concerns with:
1)	potential lack of consistency in review / approvals across the province based on local municipality objectives and expertise
2)	removal of technical oversight which is currently undertaken by the MNRF’s Wetland Evaluation Technical Team (WETT)
3)	uncertainty with respect to housing of wetland evaluations and ability for practitioners to access those data
4)	uncertainty regarding future updates to OWES and the manual
5)	process for municipalities to review evaluations
6)	capability of municipalities to review evaluations (e.g., staff capacity and/or technical expertise)
7)	objectives and priorities of municipalities
While we recognize that there have been inconsistencies with how MNRF districts, regions and staff interpret and apply OWES, full removal of provincial oversight will only serve to increase the potential for inconsistent approaches by municipalities.
Recommendation 3: Establish a provincial body to provide technical oversight and review of OWES evaluations (e.g., WETT or analogous group) and ensure consistency within MNRF, and provide clarity regarding the future housing, administration and control of OWES data.
4. Wetland Complexes
The concept of wetland complexes as functionally connected features whereby individual wetland areas contribute to the overall significance, function and quality of the complex is based on ecological theory.  With proposed changes, references to ‘wetland complexes’ have been deleted and wetland complexes are no longer considered.
Recommendation 4: Provide more clarification on how the decision was made to remove wetland complexes completely rather than improve/clarify the criteria for wetland complexing.
5. Removal of Other Policy References
References to other legislation have been removed, specifically the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS), Planning Act and Conservation Authorities Act (p. 4/5, Sections 1-4).  No rationale is provided for this deletion.
Recommendation 5: Continue to reference related policy, where applicable (e.g., PPS, Planning Act, Conservation Authorities Act).

72866,/comment/72866,"The proposal to change how Significant Wetlands are evaluated will leave these wonderful natural engineering features unprotected in the context of their watersheds. Eliminating responsibilities of the Ministry for Natural Resources and Forestry to provide provincial oversight, fragments any management plan for these water resources, that provide filtration, flood protection, and resilience to the extremes of climate change we will experience in the next decade. Municipalities lack the resources and expertise to evaluate impacts of development projects on Wetlands, labelled significant or not. Further, removing wetland complexes from consideration doesn't follow the science that connects these resources functionally. Natural habitats function as holistic networks to provide the services like water filtration, flood and drought control and ultimately water quality, agriculture and drinking water. Watershed  boundaries are not the same as municipal boundaries. Fragmenting decision making, without recognition of the value of wetlands sabotages the natural defences they provide to climate change and will reduce biodiversity. The wonder and beauty of a living wetland where it is cannot be swapped or rebuilt by humans in a different place.

72867,/comment/72867,"Wetland Complexes
The proposed updates have removed all references to wetland complexes. Under the current system, wetlands that were separated by upland ecosystems, but within 750m and related to each other can be grouped into one wetland complex. The removal of wording regarding complexes indicates that, in future evaluations, wetlands separated by upland ecosystems must be evaluated separately.
Complexes are a vital aspect of determining significance, as wetlands within them are biologically, socially and hydrologically connected (e.g., animals often move from one wetland to another within a complex). Furthermore, impacts on one wetland may affect another within a complex.
Removing complexes from the evaluation system will have deep implications for scoring and the ability to protect dispersed wetland pockets. A wetland complex can encompass a larger area and a diversity wetland types, therefore increasing the number of scoring components and total score. If each wetland within a complex is assessed separately there is a strong likelihood that each wetland will score lower than they would as a complex. This is concerning, as wetlands do not provide benefit in isolation.
Furthermore, the ability to re-evaluate individual wetlands within wetland complexes separately could result in the widespread, piecemeal down listing of PSWs.
Removing complexing and opening past complexes to individual assessment will result in artificially low scores in re/evaluations, which are not based on ecological sound assessments. We strongly urge that the proposed updates maintain the ability to complex wetlands that are demonstrably interrelated. We would suggest that if complexes have become over cumbersome, that the distance of 750m be reduce, not eliminated.
Endangered and Threatened Species
The proposed updates have removed Section 4.1.2.1 Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species and Section 4.1.2.2 Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species. These sections outline the scoring significance for Endangered (END) and Threatened (THR) species.
Under the current system, an END or THR species reproducing in the wetland would result in a PSW designation. This is because END or THR reproductive habitat is assigned 250 points for the biological component, and if a wetland scores above 200 in any component, it is considered Significant. Migration, feeding or hibernation habitat currently scores 150 points for the first species and 75 points for each additional species.
Under the new system, END and THR species will be scored under Sections 4.1.2.3 and 4.1.2.4 Provincially Significant Animal and Plant Species, which score points for any Species at Risk or species of Special Concern using the wetland for any part of its life cycle. However, species in this section receive fewer points and on a decreasing scale (50 points for the first species, +30 for the second, +15 for the third, +10, +5… etc.).
These changes will dramatically reduce their importance to the wetland score, and thus the protection a wetland may receive.  We believe that, by the nature of their status, habitat of END and THR species should continue to trigger greater significance and protection. We strongly urge that the proposed updates maintain separate scoring protocol for the habitat of END and THR species. We would suggest that if END and THR habitat currently receives too high a score, that their scores be reduced, but not to the same level of other provincially significant species.
Agency Review
All references to input, guidance or decision making from MNRF or CAs have been removed in the proposed edits. This is concerning as these agencies have a wealth of knowledge regarding wetlands and their evaluation.
It also makes the evaluation process more ambiguous. Having one evaluating agency, (i.e. MNRF) previously meant that there would be consistency in the decisions made. The proposed changes have “decision makers” (i.e. municipalities) as the final recipients of wetland evaluations. Each municipality will have a different level of expertise. This means an evaluation system that was previously employed with consistency will have uneven application.
Furthermore, MNRF would previously update wetland mapping. If evaluations are considered complete once they are submitted to a municipality, will the municipality update the provincial mapping?

72876,/comment/72876,"As a Conservation Ecologist with over 19 years of experience, I am gravely concerned about the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES). Ontario’s wetlands play a crucial role in our environment and our lives.  As green infrastructure, they act as flood attenuation and storage areas that protect people and property; they are recharge areas for groundwater, which provides a drinking water source for many Ontarians; they protect water quality by filtering nutrients and pollutants; and they provide wildlife habitat for a vast number of species, including those designated as at-risk by the Province.  Our wetlands also support tourism and recreation.  Anglers and hunters use these areas, and their adjacent habitats as key resource areas.  And the tourism industry benefits from people who visit natural areas with wetlands to witness the beauty and fascination of nature.
Should these proposed changes to OWES be implemented, existing Provincially Significant Wetlands will lose their status and un-evaluated wetlands are unlikely to meet the standard for additional protection.  This will result in wetlands being destroyed and lost, along with all the benefits they provide.  This means a loss wildlife habitat and reduction or loss of wildlife populations, decreased flood attenuation and storage, increased erosion, poorer water quality, and the decreased of tourism and recreation, and the revenue those activities bring to communities.
To be clear, Ontario has a housing supply crisis, but does not have a shortage of developable land. Affordable housing is needed and important, but that is possible without removing environmental protections that make Ontario a great place to live in the first place.  Gutting the OWES will result the destruction and removal of the remaining wetlands in Ontario.  Southern Ontario has already lost at least 70% of historic wetlands and we cannot afford to lose any more. These proposed changes are not supported by science and will erode decision makers ability to protect wetlands and their functions.
Specifically, I am concerned about the following elements of this proposed changes:
1.	The removal of the MNRF as an oversight body:
•	This leaves no oversight system in place and no replacement identified.
•	There will be a significant loss of knowledge since the MNRF has been the administering body for this system since its inception.  This will result in a significant need for additional resources and administration capacity that will be lost.
•	Unclear who will oversee OWES evaluator training and certification.
•	Unclear who can be contacted for further details and support.
•	Unclear who will be responsible for making final decisions or determining outcomes if there is a disagreement between evaluators.
•	Unclear who will be responsible for training and certifying evaluators.
•	Unclear who will be responsible for overseeing wetland files and how this will be done.
2. Addition of “A Complete Evaluation” section.
•	Unclear who a ‘decision maker’ is and how they will be looking at evaluations.
•	Unclear who will be responsible for updating and maintaining the provincial wetland database and mapping information.
•	Complete once it has been received’ provides no oversight to ensure that the evaluation was completed properly.
3.	The removal of Conservation Authorities from the manual. Conservation Authorities require tools and data including the information generated through OWES to continue to focus on natural hazard management and fulfill their core mandate.
4.	Changes to enable re-evaluations and mapping updates, and the removal of wetland complexes.
•	Unclear what ‘closely grouped wetlands’ means.
•	Wetlands do not function independently of one another, they collectively provide significant ecological functions and services, and need to be complexed in order to protect these functions.  Removing wetlands from the complexes in which they have been identified fails to recognize how wetlands function on the landscape. It will result in the vast majority of wetlands not meeting significance criteria and becoming unprotected.
5.	Removal of 4.1.2.1 Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species and 4.1.2.2 Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species
•	Wetlands are a vital ecosystem for many of Ontario’s Species at Risk. Wetlands support these species by providing breeding, nursery, foraging and overwintering habitat for residents, as well as migratory species. Without the wetlands that support them many of these species will become at risk of extirpation and even extinction. The removal of these scoring criteria will result in the vast majority of wetlands not meeting significance criteria and becoming unprotected.
I strongly urge you to reconsider this Bill:
•	The role of the MNRF in the administration of OWES be retained.
•	The complexing of wetlands be retained.
•	The scoring of Endangered and Threatened species be retained.
•	The province engage with a multi-stakeholder working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and develop scientifically sound alternatives, prior to proceeding with the current proposed amendments.
If these changes are adopted the very essence of Ontario will be threatened.  I fear that the consequences of this proposal will be far-reaching and cannot be undone once wetlands are drained, filled and developed.
This is a province of varied and rich ecosystems and natural resources, and these changes undermine the very foundation of what makes Ontario special. We can achieve more, affordable housing without destroying our ecosystems, and I implore the province to protect our environment.

Re:	South Nation Conservation comments on “Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System” (ERO 019-6160)
To whom it may concern:
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on “Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System” (ERO#019-6160).
South Nation Conservation (SNC) – one of Ontario’s 36 conservation authorities – is a committed partner of its member municipalities, the development sector, and the province; sharing the goal of increase housing supply in Ontario. We have been supporting sustainable growth in our jurisdiction for more than 75 years.
Conservation Authorities (CAs) regulate development and other activities for the purpose of natural hazard management, including requiring permission for development activities in areas related to natural hazards, such as wetlands. As outlined in the current version of the OWES manual, CAs use the results of OWES evaluations in a number of ways. Primarily, CAs may use the results of OWES evaluations to advise decisions on applications for development or alteration activities, including making use of information outlining provincial significance of a wetland, delineation of wetland boundaries, and more. CAs may further use the OWES and completed evaluations to develop watershed plans or studies at the request of municipalities, or to delineate and evaluate wetlands on the lands they own or control.
Many CA lands contain natural heritage features such as wetlands (evaluated and unevaluated) that are protected for their many benefits and ecosystem services (e.g., flood and drought control, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration and more). Moreover, many CA staff are qualified wetland evaluators in Ontario and are included in the Government of Ontario’s “Wetland Evaluators List”.
Proposal Summary & General Comments
Recommendation #1:
Establish a “user” working group to discuss and review changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System prior to finalizing changes.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is proposing updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) in support of Ontario’s Housing Supply Action Plan 3.0. A number of key changes are identified, including, but not limited to: changes to how wetlands are re-evaluated and how wetland boundaries are updated,
the ability to evaluate wetland complexes, changes in scoring criteria and attributes, and administration of the OWES.
While SNC is generally supportive of the province undertaking a review of evaluation procedures such as the OWES to identify opportunities for streamlining and reducing duplication, we are concerned that many proposed changes will result in fewer wetlands being evaluated and designated as provincially significant. Further, proposed changes would allow for wetlands previously designated as provincially significant to be re-evaluated (particularly those part of previously identified wetland complexes), which may result in a gradual fragmentation and loss of provincially significant wetlands.
Wetlands provide several benefits and ecosystem services such as flood control/ attenuation, drought control, shoreline stabilization, water purification, groundwater recharge and discharge areas, carbon sequestration and habitat for diverse species (including endangered or threatened species). When protected in a connected natural heritage system, wetlands are a natural and cost-effective tool to mitigate impacts of flooding, erosion, and drought, particularly in the face of a changing climate, which put people, property and built infrastructure at risk. For all these reasons, the protection of wetlands remains critical in Ontario.
SNC supports the provincial government’s commitment to increase the supply of housing while continuing to protect the environment, prime agricultural areas and public health and safety. In doing so, land use planning tools such as OWES must remain robust and based on the best-available science to ensure that provincially significant wetlands can be identified and protected, and evaluations of all wetlands are accessible to users. As such, SNC recommends that a ‘user’ working group with representatives from all those involved in administering/implementing OWES (municipalities, government agencies, conservation authorities, academia, NGOs, and Indigenous Communities) should be formed to discuss and review the proposed changes to the OWES prior to finalization.
SNC offers the following comments and recommendations based on the proposed changes, focused on ensuring that the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System remains robust, comprehensive, accessible, and based on best-available science for the protection of wetlands on our landscape.
Wetland Complexing
Recommendation #2:
Retain the section of the OWES Manuals titled “Wetland Complexes” as well as all references to wetland complexes / complexing.
Under the current OWES (2014), wetland complexes are recognized as groupings of wetlands that are commonly related in a functional way and tend to have complementary biological, social and/or hydrological functions. OWES currently provides that, where a wetland complex is recognized, evaluators must score the entire complex as one wetland, and ensure that all individual wetland communities in the complex are mapped. The ability for evaluators to consider wetland complexing is significant, as considerations such as the “topography of the landscape in which these wetlands occur, the short distances between some of the wetlands, and the density of wetlands per unit of areal landscape may be so complex that delineation of the wetland units into individually recognized wetlands would not be an ecologically or functionally sound process” (OWES 2014, p. 39).
The proposed changes to the OWES manual would remove the section titled “Wetland Complexes”, as well as all references to wetland complexes / complexing (except for a new section titled “Wetland Re-evaluations and Mapping Updates”). If the proposed changes are finalized, wetland evaluators would no longer be able to evaluate an entire wetland complex as a single wetland. This will result in wetland units being evaluated individually, without consideration to their values across a network of interconnected features. This change may result in lower scoring wetlands, with fewer achieving scores to designate them as provincially significant.
SNC is concerned with the proposal to remove considerations for wetland complexes from the OWES manual. As discussed in the current manual, wetland complexes should be considered due to the functional relations between individual units and based on an understanding that impacts to a single unit in the complex may affect ecological and hydrological functions of other wetlands in the complex. Consideration of wetland complexes is a significant tool to mitigate potential impacts from natural hazards, as all individual units in a wetland complex may work together to provide services such as flood control/attenuation or shoreline stabilization. As such, SNC strongly recommends that the section titled “Wetland Complexes” as well as all references to wetland complexes / complexing remain in the OWES manual, to continue to require evaluators to score the entire recognized complex as one wetland.
SNC would be pleased to work with the province to review the OWES criteria for complexing and scoring to ensure that these considerations remain effective, to eliminate any uncertainty or lack of clear direction for complexing wetlands, and to ensure that scoring continues to be based on a scientific approach.
SNC further notes that an addition to the “Wetland Edges Bordering on Lakes and Rivers” section is proposed that would require evaluators to evaluate some instances of “very closely grouped wetlands” as a single unit (e.g., wetlands within 30m from each other, or wetlands along a river of a lake that are separated by 100ft or less). Clarity is required in the OWES to confirm that evaluators may evaluate “closely grouped wetlands” as a single unit in all landscapes, (e.g., not bordering on lakes and rivers), provided the wetlands are within 30m from each other with small pockets of upland forest.
Furthermore, the size and density of wetlands in an area are key triggers for undertaking an evaluation. OWES currently recommends that wetlands greater than 2 hectares in size be evaluated, thus, leaving a gap in the evaluation of small wetlands. Small wetlands are generally best valued when considered as part of an interconnected and functionally related network. As such, wetlands of various sizes that make up a complex have generally been identified for evaluation given their cumulative size and scale on the landscape and their collective hydrological and biological functions.
Removing the ability to evaluate wetland complexes will result in many wetlands remaining unevaluated, resulting in a potential loss of protections for these wetlands (through a provincially significant or locally important designation). In addition, there will be a broad-scale devaluation of wetland functions at a landscape scale, and a loss of information obtained from evaluations which are used by many agencies and organizations, including CAs, to assist with land use planning and regulatory processes. The risk is considerable, particularly in areas where small wetlands dominate the landscape and development pressures are the greatest.
Wetland Re-Evaluation and Mapping Updates
Recommendation #3:
Amend the proposed “Re-evaluation of previously evaluated wetland complexes” subsection to state that re-evaluation of wetland complexes may only occur through a complete re-evaluation of all units in the existing wetland complex at the same time, and that the status of a wetland complex (e.g., significant or not) may only change based on such a re-evaluation of the complete wetland complex.
Recommendation #4:
Limited circumstances should be clearly outlined for an individual wetland – that is part of a complex – to be re-evaluated on its own to avoid confusion or misapplication of the manual.
Under the current OWES (2014), evaluated wetland files are “open files” that are responsive to real-world changes in order to remain scientifically current and accurate. Evaluators may periodically review files to document and append any changes to the original file. Further, the current OWES manual outlines a process to amend or update wetland evaluation files for wetlands which were evaluated using earlier editions of the OWES through a “desktop update”.
The proposed revisions to the OWES manual would see the removal of references to wetland evaluations being considered “open files” (p. 9, 14, 119), as well as removal of the section titled “Updating First and Second Edition OWES Files to the Third Edition”. A new section is proposed titled “Wetland Re-evaluations and Mapping Updates”. The proposed section states that wetlands which have been evaluated may be re-evaluated or a wetland boundary updated. All wetlands would retain their current status until such a time as a
re-evaluation occurs, and mapping updates could be undertaken without conducting a full re-evaluation. The section also states that single wetland units which were previously evaluated as part of a complex (with the exception of “closely grouped wetlands”) can be individually re-evaluated without requiring a complete re-evaluation of the complex.
Although the proposed section notes that there is “no requirement to update the wetland evaluation that applied to an entire wetland complex”, SNC is concerned that this addition would result in the fragmentation of previously evaluated wetland complexes in Ontario.
As noted above, impacts to a single wetland unit within an evaluated wetland complex may affect the ecological, biological, and hydrological functions of “downstream” wetlands in the complex. Given the understanding that wetland complexes are related in functional ways, SNC restates the text from the current OWES manual, which reads that for wetland complexes, the “delineation of the wetland units into individually recognized wetlands would not be an ecologically or functionally sound process” (OWES 2014, p.39).
The evaluation of complexed wetlands reflects the significant interconnection between these adjacent features on the landscape, with wetland complexes having a greater likelihood of meeting the scoring criteria for provincial significance. The ability to re-evaluate and potentially remove individual wetlands from a previously evaluated complex does not reflect the significance of a wetland complex as an interconnected functioning unit.
SNC is supportive of the OWES manual acknowledging that wetland re-evaluations may be required to reflect the changes which may occur to wetland features over time and outlining a process for re-evaluations. However, it is strongly recommended that any
re-evaluations for previously evaluated wetland complexes apply to the entire wetland complex, rather than single wetland units as part of the complex. At minimum, very
limited circumstances under which a single wetland unit as part of the complex may be
re-evaluated on its own should be very clearly outlined, consistent with the recommended retention of wetland complexing but with greater direction and clarity provided in this regard. Criteria for re-evaluation in these limited circumstances should be developed in collaboration with users of the OWES, including Conservation Authorities.
Lastly, the proposed changes further state that “previous wetland evaluation documentation can be used as a source of information when re-evaluating a formerly complexed wetland unit”. SNC notes that, while previous evaluations should be considered to identify and document any changes to the wetland and resulting evaluation score, many of these previous evaluations are dated, and should only be used to collect background information. A field assessment will be required to confirm changes to any details from these previous evaluations.
Consideration and Scoring for Habitat of Endangered or Threatened Species
Recommendation #5:
Retain sections 4.1.2.1 (Reproduction Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species) and 4.1.2.2 (Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered of Threatened Species) in the OWES manual to signal the high importance of these attributes when evaluating or re-evaluating wetlands. Retain or re-evaluate the current evaluation scores for these attributes.
Under the current OWES (2014), the “Special Features” component brings together certain biological and ecological attributes of wetlands for consideration, such as the geographical rarity of wetlands, species occurrence and habitat quality. Under the “rarity” subcomponent, consideration for habitats of endangered or threatened species, specifically, reproductive habitat (4.1.2.1) and migration, feeding or hibernation habitat (4.1.2.2), is provided. Scores for wetlands that provide such habitats for endangered or threatened species are high, with wetlands containing reproductive habitat for such species automatically receiving the highest value possible for a component of the OWES (250 points). The inclusion of high values for attributes such as endangered and threatened species habitat signal the importance of these attributes when evaluating wetlands. It should be noted that a score of 200 or greater in the “Special Features” component meets the requirements for designation as a PSW.
The proposed revisions to the OWES manuals include the removal of sections 4.1.2.1 and 4.1.2.2, signaling that reproductive, migration, feeding or hibernation habitat for endangered or threatened species would no longer be considered when evaluating a wetland in Ontario.
SNC recommends that consideration for these attributes as part of the “Special Features” component of the OWES be retained. Upon review of the proposed changes, there are no other proposed scoring changes related to “Special Features”, resulting in lower cumulative scores for this component of the OWES (where the habitat of endangered and/or threatened species is present). Without the true, overall value of the wetlands in supporting species at risk being accounted for, many wetlands evaluated or re-evaluated under an updated OWES may fall short of the criteria for designation as a PSW. Within the PPS 2020, provincially significant wetlands receive protection from development for site alteration activities.
While SNC appreciates the province’s efforts to remove duplicate requirements and streamline the evaluation process, there is a concern that the amendments would facilitate a net loss of established habitat for endangered or threatened species in Ontario. Therefore, SNC strongly recommends that the province maintain the considerations for habitats of endangered and threatened species in the OWES, and review (and if needed, re-evaluate) the evaluation scores to effectively capture the values of wetlands that support endangered or threatened species in Ontario.
Approval Authority, Oversight and Access to Evaluations
Recommendation #6:
Amend the OWES Manual to state that a “wetland evaluation, re-evaluation or mapping update will be considered “complete” once it has been received by a decision maker addressing a land use planning and development or resource management matter and has been submitted to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry District or Area office in which the wetland is located”.
Recommendation #7:
Clarify who a “decision maker addressing a land use planning and development or resource management matter” is to provide greater clarity on when wetland evaluations may be undertaken and who they should be submitted to, and to assist external agencies and private landowners with navigating the process of obtaining completed wetland evaluations.
Under the current OWES (2014), wetland evaluations are undertaken by trained evaluators who have successfully completed a Ministry-approved wetland evaluation course. Though the requirements for evaluators is proposed to be retained in the updated OWES, the proposed updates are unclear as to who the approval authority is for final evaluations, whether the province will have any oversight of OWES administration and interpretation of evaluations, and how agencies such as Conservation Authorities and landowners may access the results of such evaluations.
Currently, all wetland evaluations must be submitted to the biologist/ecologist at the local MNRF District or Area office in which the wetland is located. All wetland evaluations must be reviewed and approved with a sign-off by the MNRF to be considered complete and “official”. The proposed revisions to the OWES manual include the removal of the “Approval of the Wetland Evaluation” and “The Wetland Evaluation File” sections and propose a new section titled “A Complete Evaluation”. The proposed amendments remove reference to the information needed in a complete wetland evaluation file, and no longer requires MNRF submission, review and sign-off. Instead, the proposed “Complete Evaluation” section states that a “wetland evaluation, re-evaluation or mapping update will be considered ‘complete’ once it has been received by a decision maker addressing a land use planning and development or resource management matter”, and further states that evaluators must ensure landowners of the property(ies) containing the wetland are to be made aware of the new or amended evaluations.
For greater clarity, SNC requests the province identify who “decision makers” may be within the updated OWES manuals, including municipalities and conservation authorities (where applicable), as well as resource management decision makers.
It is understood that the proposed changes would remove much of the Ministry oversight for the OWES, effectively making wetland evaluators the approval authorities for evaluations. While SNC is supportive of recognition for the ability of qualified evaluators to undertake wetland evaluations, the proposed changes make it unclear what materials will be required as part of a complete OWES evaluation, and who will provide oversight to ensure that evaluations submitted to decision makers are completed by certified evaluators and contain accurate and sufficient information based on a complete understanding of the natural environment.
For OWES to be defensible and practical, decisions makers should be afforded an opportunity to review evaluations, scrutinize results, request a peer review, and accept or reject an evaluation based on an established set of criteria. With removal of many references and the ability to consult with the MNRF on evaluation components, evaluators would be responsible for addressing any uncertainties with interpreting and applying components of the OWES. This lack of provincial oversight will result in ambiguity in interpretation and application of OWES and create challenges for many decision makers who lack capacity or expertise to respond to wetland evaluations. The results could amount to considerable delays in decision making and associated costs.
Furthermore, additional clarity is required with the proposed changes as to where records of wetland evaluations will be maintained with the removal of the Ministry as a review and approval authority. Since the results of OWES evaluations may be used by many different agencies and individuals, including conservation authorities, these evaluations must remain accessible for use in the broader land use planning process, as well as with regulatory administration.
The proposed amendments suggest that wetland evaluations would remain with the “decision maker addressing a land use planning and development or resource management issue”, rather than centralized in MNRF Area or District offices. Without centralizing these evaluations with the MNRF in the area where the wetland is located, the process of obtaining these evaluations will be significantly more challenging. In addition, there will be considerable challenges in managing and storing wetland data for those wetlands that cross municipal boundaries. SNC therefore recommends that in addition to submitting wetland evaluations to “decision makers”, wetland evaluators forward the notice of submission and completed evaluation to the local MNRF Area or District office, or other publicly accessible platform.
It is noted that the updated OWES is largely geared towards decision makers involved in the land use planning process. However, little is offered by way of evaluations submitted to resource management decision makers and for what purposes. References to watershed plans, resources management plans and even the PPS are proposed for removal from OWES. It is recommended that the OWES manual retain such references (e.g., users of evaluations, pg. 2, OWES 2014) and provide more clarity on all circumstances where evaluations may be carried out and applied, and the associated decision makers. The OWES manual should also consider the circumstances under which landowners undertake a wetland evaluation for reasons beyond land use planning, for instance those seeking to obtain grants or tax-exemptions (e.g., Conservation Land Tax Incentive Program).
Locally Important Wetlands
Recommendation #8:
Retain the section of Appendix 1 that speaks to “locally significant wetlands” to provide transparency of process for municipalities to designate and protect wetlands that do not meet the criteria for a “provincially significant” designation (i.e., “locally important wetlands”).
Under the current OWES (2014), Appendix 1 speaks to the definition of and process for determining a wetland as “provincially significant”. In this Appendix, it is noted that some municipalities may choose to determine that other wetlands (not deemed provincially significant) are significant on a local scale and may decide to protect them. “Locally important wetlands” include wetlands that are evaluated and are not identified as provincially significant, and/or partially evaluated and unevaluated wetlands that have been confirmed as wetland habitat and mapped using the OWES methodology or interpretations of remote-sensing imagery.
The proposed revisions to the OWES manual includes the removal of all references to locally important wetlands, as well as the removal of this portion of Appendix 1. It is SNC’s understanding that the determination of locally important wetlands is a municipally driven process, with protections for such wetlands often provided through designating the land as “Environmentally Protected” zones in municipal Official Plans. Though it is our understanding that the OWES manual is not the mechanism through which municipalities are enabled to protect “locally important wetlands”, SNC recommends that references to locally important wetlands, including this section in Appendix 1, be retained in the manual to allow municipal governments to protect non-PSWs and to provide clarity and direction on how these locally significant wetlands should be consistently identified.
Though the ultimate purpose of the OWES is to determine whether a wetland is provincially significant, the system also provides a process of “rating wetlands relative to each other and also provides information about why one wetland is more important than another” (OWES, 2014). As such, despite not being designated as provincially significant, municipalities may take the final scores of evaluated wetlands into consideration when determining whether to protect these features as “locally important wetlands”. Given that many of the proposed changes may result in lower scoring wetlands, it is important to retain references to “locally important wetlands” in the OWES to signal the importance of all wetlands and the ability of a municipality to protect non-PSWs.
Conclusion
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the “Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System” (ERO#019-6160).
Wetlands provide a myriad of ecosystem benefits and tools to mitigate impacts of natural hazards on communities across Ontario (e.g., flood attenuation, shoreline stabilization, drought control, etc.). While the OWES is the process for evaluating these features, the evaluations undertaken provide the information necessary to understand the roles these features play in the natural landscape and allow for an assessment to determine whether a wetland is provincially significant.
As discussed, prior to finalizing changes to the OWES, SNC recommends that a working group be established to discuss and review any changes to ensure the evaluation system remains robust, comprehensive, accessible, and based on best-available science.

Re: Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (ERO No. 019-6160)
To the Public Input Coordinator,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) as part of Bill 23, the proposed More Homes, Built Faster Act, 2022.
We submit these remarks in our capacity as conservation scientists on behalf of Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Canada. WCS Canada (www.wcscanada.org) is a national non-government organization with a mission to save wildlife and wild places in Canada through science, conservation action, and by inspiring people to value nature. WCS Canada scientists have been leading research and policy development in the far north in Ontario for two decades. Our expertise is in land use planning, impact assessment, and conservation and science research focused on intact forests, freshwater, and peatlands, and the wildlife and fish that rely on these ecosystems. We are affiliated with global WCS programs in more than 60 countries in the world and active at the science-policy interface in Canada and internationally.
We have co-signed a letter to Minister Smith outlining our major issues with the proposed updates to the OWES, and append a copy of this letter for your consideration.
The proposed changes to the OWES are highly unlikely to meet the stated purpose by Ontario of increasing housing in Ontario. According to the ERO posting, “streamlining” the wetland evaluation process is necessary to support the construction of 1.5 million new housing units. However, a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the housing shortage in Ontario .
Further, it is critical to understand and acknowledge that Ontario has already lost much of its wetland heritage, with over 70% of wetlands in southern Ontario having already been destroyed . Perhaps even more concerning is that the rate of wetland loss is accelerating – the rate of wetland loss between 2011–2015 was considerably higher than the rate for the decade between 2000–2011 . And yet, remaining wetlands in southern Ontario alone still provide an estimated $19 billion in ecosystem services per year , ranging from habitat for waterfowl and sport fish to pollution removal and increased resilience to climate change through flood control. The protections that have been provided to provincially significant wetlands under the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) support not just our wildlife and natural heritage, but also healthy cities and farms and are essential under emerging “One Health” approaches . Wetland protection under the PPS is been a cornerstone of sustainable development in Ontario, and the OWES has been upheld in Ontario Courts and adjudicative tribunals, including the Ontario Municipal Board.
Draining wetlands to build houses therefore will not address the housing shortage and will leave residents living in southern Ontario facing increasing costs to compensate for the loss of ecosystem services that these functioning wetlands were providing, including facing increasing damages from flooding and other extreme weather events. As the population of Ontario grows, we need policies to halt and reverse the decline of wetlands, and not to facilitate their continued loss.
Our other major concerns relate to the proposed changes themselves. First, we are concerned that under the proposed changes, wetland complexes will no longer be considered during wetland evaluation. Wetlands are inherently connected systems , and ignoring that basic hydrological connectivity has no scientific basis, and will surely invite the piecemeal disassembly of wetlands in Ontario. Second, the decision to abandon consideration of endangered and threatened species habitat during wetland evaluation will lead to further habitat losses for species that are already the most vulnerable and already in decline. Third, the removal of provincial oversight and coordination will decentralize and obfuscate training, certification, and designation processes for wetland evaluations, which will largely be left to wetland evaluators, who are often hired by proponents.
While the proposed changes to the evaluation system are focused on southern Ontario, there are also consequences of such modifications to the OWES system for northern Ontario, including the far north in Ontario.
The far north in Ontario contains vast wetlands, including the majority of the Hudson Bay Lowland, the largest wetland complex in North America, and the second largest peatland complex in the world . These wetlands provide globally, nationally, and provincially significant ecosystem services, including as a globally important carbon stock , and offsetting a third of Ontario’s annual emissions . The peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowland are estimated to store ~30 to 35 billion tonnes of carbon, which is ~128 billion tonnes of CO2, or around 175 years of Canada’s current annual reported GHG emissions. These peatlands have contributed to an overall net global cooling effect since their initiation ~8000 years ago and are active carbon sinks, that are predicted to remain carbon sinks in the future, in all but the worst climate warming scenarios . These wetlands also provide critical habitat for endangered species such as caribou and comprise vital stopover habitat and breeding grounds for shorebirds (including numerous species at risk) and endemic plants. They are also the homelands of many First Nations under Treaty No. 9 and as such support the inherent, Aboriginal and Treaty rights of Anishnabeg and Cree Nations across northern Ontario.
These wetlands in the far north in Ontario require special consideration and were already ignored under the current OWES and other relevant Ontario environmental legislation including impact assessment under Ontario’s Environmental Assessment Act and the Far North Act, 2010. The vast majority of the largest wetland complex in North America is not adequately mapped and has never been assessed under the current OWES.
Given the provincial, national, and global importance of these wetlands, as well as the development being contemplated in the Ring of Fire region, these wetlands require an evaluation system that honours Indigenous Knowledge systems, is grounded in science, and includes the many values of wetlands for people, wildlife, and the climate. These wetlands also require an evaluation system that informs proactive watershed-level planning. This planning would establish thresholds for values that are important to First Nations, as well as globally important values like carbon stocks and wildlife habitat, and would set targets for Indigenous-led protection in advance of industrial development and in consideration of climate change.
By taking the opposite approach, and weakening the OWES to remove protection for provincially significant wetlands, to remove consideration as habitat for endangered species, and to remove consideration of wetland complexes, the government has made OWES entirely ineffectual for these provincial and globally significant wetlands in the far north in Ontario.
In summary, the consequences of these changes for the far north of Ontario, and the lack of transparency and lack of adequate public consultation in this process are both alarming. These represent sweeping and far-reaching changes to environmental protections for the entire province, disingenuously embedded within legislation intended for the purpose of accelerating housing development primarily in southern Ontario.
We recommend that the proposed changes to the OWES be rescinded immediately. We further recommend that the province develops an evidence-based approach to address the housing needs in this province – without dismantling critical wetland protections and functions, and without leaving the people in Ontario to shoulder the cost of paying for the loss of the many services and benefits that wetlands are providing under a changing climate.
We would be happy to discuss these comments further.

72907,/comment/72907,"I register my strongest objections to the changes proposed in Bill 23 to change the protection for wetlands by removing the need to evaluate a series of wetlands as complexes.  Evaluating them as individuals will almost certainly mean that the evaluator (paid for and reporting only to the person who paid her or him) will find that the wetland does not meet the criterion of ""Provincially Significant"".  Mr. Premier, wetlands are critical to the current and future of Ontario's safe water supply - surely you understand that.  Building over wetlands will do little to increase housing supply but will increase the profits of developers.  I also object to the fact that the province proposes to have no further role in reviewing or approving wetland evaluations, will no longer keep wetland evaluation files and will no longer maintain significant wetland mapping capability, or provide information for use in wetland evaluations.
These responsibilities will be delegated to the municipalities, without additional budgets or provincial   assistance, and the municipalities will have NO authority to review and approve wetland evaluations submitted by landowners.    This is unacceptable and undemocratic and so Bill 23 must be withdrawn.  There is only one taxpayer - the current system, while not always perfect, has worked well to protect these ecologically significant ;lands - keep it that way

72910,/comment/72910,"This submission responds to proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) discussed in Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) posting number 019-6160. The ERO posting states that the purpose of the proposed changes is to support the province’s Housing Supply Action Plan and the government’s commitment to support the construction of 1.5 million new housing units over the next ten years, and specifically, to remove duplication of requirements and streamline the evaluation process.
Dougan & Associates Ecological Consulting & Design (D&A) is a well-established and award-winning ecological consulting and design firm based in Guelph, Ontario. Our firm has over three decades of providing ecologically driven design services to the public and private sectors. We are supportive of initiatives to improve availability and affordability of housing; however, wetlands are legacy assets that should not be viewed as an obstacle to housing development. Their effective protection and integration as a critical part of the landscape is essential for southern Ontario communities to remain healthy and resilient into the future. This is particularly relevant now as the frequency and intensity of flooding, heat, drought, and other extreme weather events is clearly increasing.
Where proposed changes to OWES are intended to expedite land-use planning and development approvals, they should clearly demonstrate the intended/expected benefits to wetland form and function, and they should be science-based. On these grounds, we are opposed to the proposed updates to the OWES as they do not clearly articulate benefits that will be achieved, have not been rationalized from a scientific perspective, and are unlikely to result in a streamlined approvals process.
Some of the specific proposed changes of concern include:
1.	Downloading the responsibility of confirming wetland status onto local municipalities, and termination of key provincial roles and expertise in wetland evaluation matters.
In our experience, very few municipalities have staff with the necessary technical training and background to review wetland evaluations. The withdrawal of ministry governance, downloading responsibility onto local area municipalities, and limiting Conservation Authority input will result in a fragmented and inconsistent application of OWES evaluation protocols. Contrary to the conclusion in the province’s regulatory impact analysis, it is our opinion that the proposed regulatory changes will have the unintended consequences of complicating the existing process and extending development approval timelines.
2.	Removing the Wetland Complexing section from the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System with no system-based mechanism to assess cumulative hydrologic and biodiversity benefits of isolated wetlands.
The current concept and method for wetland complexing provides a mechanism to incorporate isolated wetlands into the evaluation process; this is a critical component of OWES as, individually, such features may not meet criteria for significance, but collectively, they are integral to maintaining healthy natural heritage and hydrologic systems. Across Ontario, small, isolated, wetlands frequently occur due to physiographic conditions such as moraines and clay plains, where in addition to natural heritage functions, they play important roles in groundwater recharge, flood storage, and purification of surface runoff.
The proposal to remove wetland complexing and at the same time introduce a re-evaluation process that endorses compartmentalizing the assessment and re-mapping of wetlands as individual units, will shift the emphasis from a robust systems-based understanding of the value of these wetlands to a naïve and narrowly focused understanding. Ultimately, this will compromise the ability to evaluate the collective natural heritage and hydrologic benefits and services that these wetlands provide, resulting in the removal of many small, isolated, wetlands from the landscape. The unintended consequences of this policy regime change will be continued degradation to the ecological and hydrologic function of already stressed wetland systems, reduced capacity to recharge ground water systems, and decreased capacity for flood storage.
3.	The proposed changes to scoring devalue Endangered/Threatened Species at Risk which often utilize wetlands.
Many wetlands in Ontario provide habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species at Risk (E/T SAR). Under the existing OWES system, where reproductive habitat and migration, feeding or hibernation habitat for Endangered or Threatened species occurs, wetlands are almost certainly determined to be a Provincially Significant Wetland (PSW). Removing this provision will therefore put many existing PSWs at risk of having their current status downgraded where habitat for E/T SAR is one of the main reasons for designating a wetland as PSW. In our opinion it would be better to integrate wetland policy conformity with Endangered Species Act policies and habitat regulations so that direction to municipalities is consistent and unambiguous.
4.	The proposed changes remove the need to consult with MNRF and other agency staff with respect to the evaluation of Significant Features and Habitats.
With the proposed changes to OWES, evaluators would be directed to use the guidance provided in the province’s Significant Wildlife Habitat Criteria Schedules. While we do not necessarily have concerns regarding the direction to use these Schedules, it is our experience that a) the Schedules are often misinterpreted or selectively applied, and  b) the Schedules currently identify MNRF as the agency responsible for the identification of some significant features, such as winter deer yarding areas. Contrary to the expectation that this change will help to streamline development decisions, we anticipate municipal planning staff will need extensive training and resources to competently review and approve this component of the OWES process.
A clear and qualified governance model for OWES is essential to ensure consistency of wetland evaluations across Ontario. OWES evaluations should be fully integrated within the natural heritage systems approach to environmental planning envisioned under the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS). In our experience, despite OWES having been in place since 1984, there are many isolated wetlands in proximity to settlement areas that still have not been evaluated. Addressing such gaps should be required under new or updated comprehensive plans, to reduce delays in planning and approving site-specific developments.
As experienced wetland evaluators, we foresee that: a) the proposed changes to OWES, b) downloading of major responsibilities for wetland study, protection and management to local area municipalities, c) removal of long-standing provincial guidance, and d) curtailment of Conservation Authority roles, puts sound wetland management in jeopardy of ‘free-fall’. These changes would unfortunately occur at a time when wetland protection and enhancement are key tools to mitigate climate change impacts. It also risks a quantum step backward since Conservation Authorities have spearheaded leading initiatives such as headwater drainage feature assessment, wetland water balance study protocols, and wetland restoration strategies which have emerged in the past decade, that realistically should be recognized and integrated within the OWES. In our own planning work for major municipalities over several decades, Conservation Authority leadership has been of paramount importance.
Our interpretation of the proposed regulatory changes affecting business is that there will be a new learning curve required, lasting several years or longer. It is one thing to modify OWES procedures and scoring; it is quite another to totally revamp its governance and pass responsibility to municipalities who are largely the least equipped to manage the technical evaluation system. Delays will also result from a more fragmented implementation of OWES, resulting in less certainty and clarity related to how significant wetlands are assessed and identified across municipalities. Costs and delays associated with training/onboarding municipal planning staff with the nuances of the OWES process, coordination with other municipalities with shared watershed boundaries, and the potential for accelerated degradation of wetland systems should not be underestimated. If municipalities opt to outsource this work, cumulative costs and time required to ramp up this option should be clearly considered.
We believe that there are opportunities to streamline the current policy framework and to shorten timelines for planning approvals while ensuring that wetland resources are consistently evaluated and documented in a timely manner without putting natural environment systems, including wetlands, at greater risk.
We would be happy to meet and discuss the areas of concern presented in this submission.

72914,/comment/72914,"Regarding wetlands in Ontario, it is vitally important to retain existing functional wetlands especially in southern Ontario, due to the important functions wetlands perform in sequestering carbon, absorbing excess water during major rainfall events and retaining moisture during periods of drought.  In addition wetlands are an integral part of eco-systems providing water, habitat and food resources for a wide number of plant and animal species.  Southern Ontario has lost a large proportion on once existing wetlands over the past 200 years due mainly to past agricultural practices and development of roads and communities.
Wetland complexes are integrated eco-systems with various units supporting the health and vitality of the entire wetland complex and adjoining lands.  Evaluations need to continue to look at the whole wetland complex and the inter-relationships.

Many municipalities do not have the resources to provide this expert oversight in planning.  In my observations Conservation Authorities have been efficient in providing thorough evaluations.

It will destroy habitat for all types of wildlife, including species at risk. So your bill is actually in contradiction of the species at risk and the endangered species act. Not to mention valuable farmland. This farmland is needed to provide food for Ontario.
Another issue is that there are not enough workers (skilled trades) to build theses houses. Young people are not going into the trades so no matter what you do to entice young folks, they are not going into this type of work. Therefore your plan will not work in the timeframe you anticipate.
You already have enough land set aside for construction waiting ti be developed. The landholders are just waiting until just before their permits expire to build so these properties increase in value before they build, so they’ll make the max amount of money. Ask your municipalities about this, they know!
You’re about to destroy conservation authorities and now this wetland destruction legislation. So in summary between the changes in these two pieces of legislation, you will destroy wetlands and forests, put more properties and lives at risk from flooding and erosion and raise insurance rates significantly for all in Ontario.

72927,/comment/72927,"I am extremely concerned about the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation system and I urge the government to reconsider before proceeding with these changes.
Firstly, I am concerned about the change that would see small individual wetlands evaluated separately rather than as complexes. As an ecologist, I am attuned to the interactions amongst all parts of our environment, and the study of ecology has proven time and time again that we cannot truly understand the value and functions of an organism, population, or even ecosystem (such as a wetland) in isolation - rather, we must look at each element in the context of the broader whole. Treating small wetlands individually when they are clearly connected to other nearby wetlands, both in terms of hydrology and ecology, completely disregards that wetland complexes are more than the sum of their individual parts. This will lead to devaluing of wetlands and the loss of biodiversity and valuable ecosystem services such as climate change adaptation and flood mitigation, to the detriment of the people of Ontario.
Furthermore, I am concerned that the province and even local municipalities will no longer play a meaningful role in reviewing and approving wetland evaluations. This introduces clear bias into the evaluation system when evaluators are only accountable for their evaluations to clients who often have motives that would not support the protection of wetlands. I am concerned that the province is also relinquishing its duty to maintain files, mapping and information on wetlands, as these are extremely valuable resources for the conservation of wetlands and their biodiversity and are used by many stakeholders working for the protection of wetlands in the province.
Finally, I am concerned by the potential to move away from the protection of wetlands and towards offsetting. While offsetting can be useful in certain circumstances, restoration should not be used to justify destruction of habitat or an abandonment of conservation. My training in ecology and practical experience in ecosystem restoration, along with a vast quantity of scientific literature have shown that restored ecosystems very rarely replicate original ecosystems in terms of their biodiversity and functions and even if they do achieve true restoration, this occurs on long time scale - too long to sustain species that have lost habitat in the meantime and communities that rely on their functions! Given the importance of wetlands for maintaining water quality, flood mitigation and numerous species at risk, assuming offsetting will replace naturally occurring wetlands is not a gamble worth taking!
I am grateful for the ability to provide my feedback on this matter and I urge the government to truly consider this feedback and that of many concerned citizens before moving forward with these changes.

72930,/comment/72930,"Wetlands provide several benefits and ecosystem services such as flood control/ attenuation, drought control, shoreline stabilization, water purification, groundwater recharge and discharge areas, carbon sequestration and habitat for diverse species (including endangered or threatened species). When protected in a connected natural heritage system, wetlands are a natural and cost-effective tool to mitigate impacts of flooding, erosion, and drought, particularly in the face of a changing climate, which put people, property and built infrastructure at risk. For all these reasons, the protection of wetlands remains critical in Ontario.
Please, consider the following recommendations:
1. Establish a “user” working group to discuss and review changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System prior to finalizing changes.
2. Retain the section of the OWES Manuals titled “Wetland Complexes” as well as all references to wetland complexes / complexing.
3. Amend the proposed “Re-evaluation of previously evaluated wetland complexes” subsection to state that re-evaluation of wetland complexes may only occur through a complete re-evaluation of all units in the existing wetland complex at the same time, and that the status of a wetland complex (e.g., significant or not) may only change based on such a re-evaluation of the complete wetland complex.
4. Limited circumstances should be clearly outlined for an individual wetland – that is part of a complex – to be re-evaluated on its own to avoid confusion or misapplication of the manual.
5. Retain sections 4.1.2.1 (Reproduction Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species) and 4.1.2.2 (Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered of Threatened Species) in the OWES manual to signal the high importance of these attributes when evaluating or re-evaluating wetlands. Retain or re-evaluate the current evaluation scores for these attributes.
6. Amend the OWES Manual to state that a “wetland evaluation, re-evaluation or mapping update will be considered “complete” once it has been received by a decision maker addressing a land use planning and development or resource management matter and has been submitted to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry District or Area office in which the wetland is located”.
7. Clarify who a “decision maker addressing a land use planning and development or resource management matter” is to provide greater clarity on when wetland evaluations may be undertaken and who they should be submitted to, and to assist external agencies and private landowners with navigating the process of obtaining completed wetland evaluations.
8. Retain the section of Appendix 1 that speaks to “locally significant wetlands” to provide transparency of process for municipalities to designate and protect wetlands that do not meet the criteria for a “provincially significant” designation (i.e., “locally important wetlands”).

72932,/comment/72932,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System as outlined in ERO 019-6160 and as related to Bill 23, the proposed More Homes Built Faster Act.
As noted in our November 16th submission to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy on Bill 23, the Ontario Public Health Association (OPHA) fully supports the need for Ontario to find more affordable housing opportunities for its residents and create healthy, equitable and climate-resilient communities. At the same time, it is vital that these processes, including legislative changes, are undertaken in a manner that reduces the risk of inadvertent harms and inequities to the health and climate resiliency of communities.
Public health agencies have long recognized the connections between healthy environments and population health, and thus the importance of healthy public policy across all sectors to strengthen health protection and equity. This includes policies related to housing, the built and natural environment, land-use planning, climate-resiliency including mitigation and adaptation, and ecosystem protection.
OPHA supports action to create more rental and ownership types of housing that prioritizes affordable, healthy and environmentally sustainable housing. This encompasses housing that is resilient to the impacts of climate change through measures such as wetland protection. Increasing housing supply through actions such as intensification, higher density and transit-oriented development can be health and equity promoting, without compromising other vital attributes required for healthy and equitable communities including: protection of wetlands, access to, and protection provided by, parkland and other greenspace; access to affordable, sustainable and active transportation; and healthy, energy-efficient housing units.
OPHA urges the Government of Ontario to pursue affordable housing opportunities through measures other than changes to wetland protection, and to:
1. Refrain from weakening the Wetland Evaluation System process. This is a misguided effort to increase housing supply.
2. Maintain wetland protection as a means to protect current and future housing stock from natural and climate related hazards including flooding.
3. Allow additional time for municipalities, conservation authorities and other stakeholders to thoroughly review and provide meaningful feedback on changes to the Wetland Evaluation System.
4. Rely on the scientific evidence that has established the vital importance of wetland units of all sizes, and as part of wetland complexes, to Ontario’s natural heritage system, human health and climate-resiliency.
OPHA is extremely concerned that the Government of Ontario is considering changes to wetland protections as a means to increase housing supply. Wetlands are part of the natural ecosystem and perform vital services that are essential to human health including regulating air and water pollution, flood protection, erosion control, carbon sequestration, provision of nutritious food and clean water, surface temperature regulation, and several cultural, recreational, physical and mental health benefits.
OPHA does not support changes to the Wetland Evaluation System that weakens wetland protection. This will have negative impacts from a climate resiliency and health perspective, increasing health risks and disproportionately impacting equity-deserving groups who have less adaptive capacity to flooding and climate-related risks. The proposed changes to wetland and other natural heritage policies that emphasize growth expansion and rural residential development will result in the loss of diverse and mature ecosystems. This will have immediate and long-term environmental impacts. In addition, a decrease in the amount of wetlands represents a decrease in the amount of impervious services, putting direct and immediate strain on municipal stormwater management infrastructure, increasing flood risks and increasing exposure to climate-related health hazards.
OPHA is concerned that the short 30-day ERO opportunity for comment does not allow adequate time for the public, agencies and other stakeholders to consider the implications of changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, and how these changes may weaken wetland protection in terms of environmental and human health protection. For example, removing statements from the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System text that acknowledges that “certain information, particularly about the presence of rare species and about hydrological functions, may be lacking even after the evaluation is completed”, and the subsequent recommendation that “more information should be obtained before making decisions about the types of land uses in the vicinity of evaluated wetlands” seriously risks the ability of municipalities, conservation authorities and other stakeholders to make evidence-informed decisions for ecological protection and health protection. This can have the added consequence of increasing financial liability when wetland degradation leads to climate-related flood impacts.
As noted in the Independent review of the 2019 flood events in Ontario report commissioned by the Government of Ontario the first core component of emergency management is prevention, which includes “… actions taken to prevent flood-related emergencies or disasters from occurring, and includes land use planning and regulatory restrictions to keep development out of the floodplains and other hazardous areas. While we cannot prevent flooding from occurring, keeping people and property out of flood-prone areas helps ensure naturally occurring flood events do not result in local emergencies.”   With clear evidence that climate-related heavy rainfall events will continue to increase, it is counter intuitive to remove wetland protections that allow development to occur in these sensitive areas.
OPHA is also concerned that changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System related to wetland complexes will further erode ecosystem protections for human and environmental health. Given that wetland complexes are a group of wetland units that are functionally linked to one another,   it is important that re-evaluation of single wetland units considers the entire wetland complex. OPHA is very concerned that the definition of “wetland complex” is proposed to be removed from the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, and that smaller, vital wetlands will lose their protection.
Recent research examining wetland loss and stormwater management ponds in southern Ontario found that many lost wetlands have been replaced with stormwater management ponds of smaller total area and with reduced overall ecological function, pointing out that the latter “are designed to manage urban stormwater and contaminants, but only provide limited ecosystem services.”  Given their critical ecosystem function, including flood mitigation, this study emphasized the need for greater protection for wetland ecosystems in urban and peri-urban areas, and to conserve wetlands that still exist in growing municipalities, especially smaller wetlands.
OPHA does not support the proposed removal of wetland complexing or the inability to re-evaluate existing complexes. These changes would expose provincially significant wetlands and wetland complex lands into consideration for urban boundary expansion. Partnered with the described, but not yet outlined, changes to the Provincial Policy Statement, the proposed changes could significantly exacerbate local flooding, erosion issues and biodiversity loss.
Greater consideration of the scientific evidence, including direct and indirect human health impacts, must be incorporated into the decision-making process affecting natural ecosystems including wetlands. These essential natural features work together to promote the development of healthy and complete communities; protecting natural heritage, water, and agricultural systems; and promoting a culture of conservation. They can help the province meet its climate change targets by providing a carbon sink and helping buffer against flooding.
OPHA urges the Government of Ontario to take action to increase rather than water down wetland protection, and to use current scientific evidence to effectively assess this protection. This evidence includes the importance of wetland units of all sizes, and as part of wetland complexes, to Ontario’s natural heritage system, human health and climate-resiliency. We encourage the province to prioritize building in existing designated development areas and increasing density to increase housing stock more effectively with co-benefits for health, environment and economy.
OPHA appreciates efforts to encourage the supply of affordable housing including affordable rental housing; however, this must not be at the expense of wetland protection. This is counter to the equity-promoting and environmental justice measures that Ontarians expect from climate adaptation planning, and the government of Ontario’s commitment to strengthen the province’s resilience to the impacts of climate change and keep communities healthy and safe.
Thank you for considering our concerns and recommendations with respect to proposed changes to the Planning Act as outlined in ERO 019-6160. We would welcome the opportunity to meet with the government to discuss the proposed changes and solutions that address concerns related to this proposed legislative change.

72934,/comment/72934,"I am extremely against this proposal as it puts the health of Ontarians and the environment we live in at higer risk. Wetlands are an extremely important ecosystem in Ontario and destruction of them negatively affects flooding, water purity, species diversity (which affects things like hunting and fishing), and carbon sequestration which increases pollution and smog.
Protecting wetlands and especially the ones that are still intact is a necessity. Removing requirements for the proposed reason is unethical and goes directly against the state of natural resources report which states that the Ontario ministry is actively working towards stronger protections of our ecosystems and biodiversity.

72940,/comment/72940,"I have reviewed this proposal, and have a number of concerns about the nature of these changes, and their implications for sustainable ecosystem management in Ontario. Firstly- by reducing the MNRF's role in the review of proposed changes to wetland boundaries, you are eliminating any form of oversight to these changes- effectively allowing development to proceed without any check or balance. A consultant being paid by a client to obtain a particular result (eg. approve the boundary adjustment) is not in a fair position to make an unbiased or scientific decision about the actual wetland boundary.  Whereas, the role of a non-partisan government agency, is to implement a process without an agenda- and make decisions based on facts, not desired outcome. The elimination of MNRF's role in this system creates a high risk situation for the protection of sensitive, irreplaceable features, and simply doesn't work to meet the objectives of the OWES system. Secondly- why would you evaluate wetlands as individual units, when structurally and functionally, these systems are connected?. By virtue of this connection, any change to a part of these complexes, will have impact and influence on other parts of the connected system. Scoring them individually does not make sense in practical application, OR, to support sustainable development. This change seems to be aimed at purposefully driving the wetland score down, to remain below the significance threshold, much more than ""reducing administrative boundaries"" or streamlining the review process. Finally-- the willful omission of species at risk (endangered and threatened) doesn't make sense, and again, seems targeted at specifically creating barriers to a wetland to ever be scored as significant. Many of Ontario's SAR species reside in, or adjacent to, wetlands- thus, protection of the wetland also serves as protection of SAR. Failing to acknowledge the value of these systems to protect rare species and communities, does not appear to have any scientific merit, and should be stripped from this proposal.

72941,/comment/72941,"from my understanding the Ontario government currently wants to drastically overhaul the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, ensuring that very few wetlands would be deemed provincially significant in the future and that many if not most existing Provincially Significant Wetlands would be vulnerable to losing that designation, leaving them open to destruction.

We must protect WETLANDS they are the filter for clean water, act as a sponge for huge rainfalls which have been happening more , provide wildlife habitat.  Wetlands are crucial to our delicate eco system and we must protect the last remaining few. They are precious. Why is the Lower Duffins Wetland located in Pickering ON being tilled right now >? This was suppose to be protected, due to the fact a group of concerned citizens created so much publice alarm about a proposed AMAZON Wearhouse going up  Triple properties and AMazon *pulled out of the project. So why are the wetlands being protected more not less? We need to give the Conservation Authority back its power so it can do its job , I am not the expert they are. I just know common sense tells me if you pave over all the wetlands ,who pays the bill for flooding?the taxpayer, who pays the bill for more water filtration plants - the taxpayer who cannot find clean ground water if a well needs to be built- may be another citizen. We need to smarten up and protect our WETLANDS.

72944,/comment/72944,"As an educator and having my students conduct a Wetland Evaluation, allows the students to see the broad scope of criteria assessed during an evaluation. The list of ecosystem services that wetlands provide, notably in populated areas, is vast.
With respect to proposed updates to the OWES, I am concerned most regarding 1) approval of a wetland evaluation and 2) elimination of wetland complexes.
1) proposed to be struck from OWES manuals: “Completed evaluations must be forwarded to the biologist/ecologist at the local MNR District or Area office in which the wetland is located. MNR will review and approve the evaluation. A wetland evaluation is not considered to be complete and official until MNR has signed off on the file.“
Leaving the responsibility of wetland evaluation reviews to municipalities will not likely be objective as municipalities are responsible for development. Municipalities most likely will not have individuals knowledgeable enough to make informed decisions regarding review of a wetland evaluation.  Furthermore, many wetlands cross municipal boundaries. There will not be an objective “arm’s-length” review.
2) The proposed changes will no longer allow wetlands to be identified as a complex, thus treating each wetland on its own. The following statement from OWES manuals proposed to be struck is self explanatory: “… the short distances between some of the wetlands, and the density of wetlands per unit of areal landscape may be so complex that delineation of the wetland units into individually recognized wetlands would not be an ecologically or functionally sound process. Such groupings of wetlands are referred to as wetland complexes.”

72946,/comment/72946,"This proposal is anti-science and anti-wetlands.  I fully support the comments and recommendations submitted by Save Ontario Wetlands.  Regarding the removal of oversight of the MNRF: what does this Ministry even do anymore? other than shill for extractive industry??
The proposed changes to OWES described in the ERO posting # 019-6160 undermine the wetland report card in 6 key ways:
Insufficient review timeline (30 days) to assess, evaluate, and comment on the extensive proposed changes to OWES.
We recommend extending the review and comment period until at least Dec. 30th, 2022 to allow a robust review and consideration of all the implications of these proposed changes.
Removal of key oversight responsibilities of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF) in the OWES process.
We recommend that related OMNRF staff maintain an integral role in wetland evaluation and assessment to ensure wetland expertise and sufficient oversight is part of the evaluation process.
Creation of a piece-meal and under-resourced wetland evaluation process by apparently downloading this important work to municipalities with little to no wetland expertise on staff and no additional resourcing.
We recommend OMNR remain the custodians of OWES files and continue to train professionals in the implementation of OWES. Amendments must retain clear lines of responsibility and afford validation and quality control of OWES evaluation files to protect the integrity of the evaluation process.
Removal of counting the value of a wetland for threatened and endangered species in the Special Features category.
We recommend that wetland value as habitat for threatened and endangered species remain in the Special Features category. Alternatively, the scoring thresholds for consideration as Provincially Significant should be dramatically lowered. Given 32% of species at risk in southern Ontario rely on wetland habitat and yet 60-90% of historic wetlands have already been destroyed, it is a safe assumption that all wetlands remaining in southern Ontario provide significant support for species at risk.
Removal of wetland complexing in spite of the mountain of scientific evidence that geographically isolated wetlands are ecohydrologically connected and interdependent.
We recommend that wetland complexing remain in the OWES to allow interconnected wetlands to be evaluated as an integrated whole.
The introduction of “re-evaluations” of previously evaluated and designated Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSW).
We recommend that the amendments concerning “re-evaluations” be removed from OWES given the process already treats evaluations as “open files” and encourages updates. The addition of “re-evaluations” is redundant and wasteful given only a fraction of the wetlands remaining in Ontario have undergone a single OWES evaluation.

•	Remove consideration of species at risk.
	Twenty percent of Ontario’s species at risk depend on wetlands for all or part of their life cycle and the OWES provides a basis for securing long-term protection of their habitat by identifying and maintaining wetland features, functions and inter-relationships.
•	No longer recognize wetland complexes.
	Most wetlands are hydrologically connected to the surrounding landscape, which underscores the importance of recognizing significant connections and including them as part of wetland complexes.
•	Eliminate provincial oversight.
	Wetlands require provincial oversight to ensure wetland representation on a provincial scale, wetland evaluator certification and consistency in OWES approach; and to minimize local-level bias.
Southern Ontario has lost over 70% of its original wetland area despite the many valuable services wetlands provide to human settlements including flood attenuation, water purification, erosion control, carbon storage, and recreation and tourism opportunities. Depending on habitat size and quality, wetlands can offer significant cost savings to municipalities.
The changes proposed in Bill 23 are quite shocking. They will result in major losses of wetlands, and will leave municipalities with decreased wetland services at a time when these services are critical for reducing the growing impacts of climate change. While the stated purpose of Bill 23 is to accelerate the provision of housing, Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force in their 2022 report stated that land is available for housing without resorting to development in environmentally sensitive areas.

In reality, this is a proposal to deregulate the damage of wetlands. The proposed changes to the OWES would cause fewer wetlands to be listed as Provincially significant. Thus, the purpose of these changes are not to improve the wetland evaluation system, but to develop in new areas, that would otherwise be protected by PSW.
Southern Ontario has already lost at least 72% of its wetlands. Wetlands are important for flood risk management, carbon storage, and as natural heritage strongholds. Given the precipitous declines in wetland abundance and the existential threat of climate change, it would be utterly irresponsible to continue the destruction of wetlands.
I think the government should re-evaluate its priorities when it comes to housing. The current strategy seems to be to produce endless urban sprawl across Southern Ontario. This strategy is unsustainable and will irreparably harm the ecological integrity of the most biodiverse region of our province.
Instead, we should be intensifying development in urban areas. The solution is to build up, not out into our farmland, forests, and provincially significant wetlands.

https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/cli…
Nature and biodiversity
Canada’s natural environment includes land-based ecosystems such as grasslands and forests, freshwater ecosystems such as rivers, lakes and wetlands, as well as coastal and marine ecosystems. Some of these ecosystems are part of highly managed landscapes, such as farms or urban areas, while others experience less human activity. Biodiversity is an essential part of each of these ecosystems, and support how it functions.
In addition to having intrinsic value, the natural environment also provides critical ecosystem services and solutions to address the hazards of a changing climate. For example, if selected for their resilience to climatic extremes and protected, shade trees can provide relief during heatwaves and wetlands can absorb water and reduce flooding.
In order for the natural environment – including people – to thrive in the face of climate change, we need to shift our perspective to see people as part of and active participants in nature, and embrace stewardship approaches. Our efforts to halt and reverse nature loss should prioritize solutions that help the natural environment to respond to and recover from current and future climate events.
Goal: Biodiversity loss has been halted and reversed and nature has fully recovered allowing for natural and human adaptation, where ecosystems and communities are thriving together in a changing climate, with human systems existing in close connection with natural systems.
Objectives
The objectives in this system aim to reflect both the need to support the resilience of ecosystems with a focus on those most affected by climate change, and the power of nature to provide adaptation solutions.
Human activities are transformed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, and enhance ecosystem connectivity and resilience.
First Nations, Métis Nation, and Inuit governments, organizations, and communities have the opportunities and means to pursue self-determined priorities for ecosystem stewardship initiatives to adapt to climate change.
The use of nature-based solutions is accelerated to increase resilience and maximize co-benefits such as reducing stress on grey infrastructure and increasing social benefits of nature.
The ecosystems most affected by climate change are monitored, restored and managed to ensure their continued viability and adaptive capacity.

72964,/comment/72964,"Re: Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
Wetlands are a crucial component of our ecosystems - they serve an important role in nutrient cycling, filter water, moderate stormflows, and provide critical habitat for threatened or endangered flora and fauna. Unfortunately, wetlands are also one of the most heavily impacted natural heritage features in Ontario with approximately 72% of wetlands lost in southern Ontario between pre-European settlement and 2002 (Ducks Unlimited Canada, 2010). Regionally, the loss of wetlands has been staggering - Essex and Kent in southwestern Ontario have lost upwards of 98% of wetlands (Ducks Unlimited Canada, 2010). As a society, we should be doing everything we can to preserve the few functioning wetlands we have left in southern Ontario. The proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) do the exact opposite and will only serve to accelerate the loss of wetlands. I take issue with several of the proposed changes to the OWES:
•	Approval of Wetland Evaluation (Southern Manual pg. 6) – the need for any type of oversight regarding a wetland evaluation by the MNRF has been removed and a completed wetland evaluation or re-evaluation only needs to be forwarded to the decision maker involved with the land use decision. Many municipalities and other decision makers lack staff with the necessary expertise to properly review a wetland assessment for accuracy and completeness. With the MNRF removed from the process, there will be little to no checks within the system to ensure a wetland evaluation is conducted accurately and rigorously. This opens the door to land use decisions being made based on poorly conducted wetland evaluations that mis-classify wetlands as not significant. A wetland evaluation may be insufficient because of a lack of knowledge on the part of the environmental consultant or due to the inherent conflict of interest that incentivizes them to provide a favourable wetland evaluation for the developer. Regardless of why there may be problems with a wetland evaluation, the only way to prevent poor evaluations from inflicting environmental harm during the land use decision process is to have knowledgeable oversight that provides final approvals. The MNRF provides the crucial oversight needed in the system to prevent the permanent loss of our most attacked natural heritage feature. The MNRF needs to continue providing final approvals.
•	Removal of all reference to contact MNRF – the proposed document removes almost all reference about contacting the MNRF, whether it be for data or information about the OWES. I see this as a mistake because the MNRF can prevent the submission of poorly conducted wetland evaluations by serving as a contact for questions regarding the OWES. Who is an environmental consultant to contact when they are unsure of what to do or how to score a given category? Without a contact for help, you have opened the door to the submission of poorly conducted wetland evaluations. Further, we want wetland evaluations to be conducted with the most complete and accurate data available and I cannot understand why you have removed the MNRF as a data source. MNRF staff are some of the most knowledgeable people in the province regarding our natural resources because that is their job. There is no rational reason to remove all reference to the MNRF as a source of data for a wetland evaluation or information about the OWES.
•	Re-Evaluation of Previously Evaluated Wetlands – it is proposed that “with the exception of closely grouped wetlands, single wetland units that are part of a previously evaluated wetland complex can be re-evaluated (re-scored and re-mapped) without requiring a complete re-evaluation of all units in the existing wetland complex”. Allowing individual units to be re-evaluated separate from the overall complex opens the door to the piecemeal destruction of a wetland complex through the gradual removal of individual units. There is no ecological reasoning why you would ignore adjacent wetland units that are ecologically and hydrologically connected to the unit under evaluation. There is a provision requiring the evaluation of close wetland systems as one unit; however, close wetland systems have a very restrictive 30 meter cut-off distance between individual wetland units. The definition of a close wetland system does not reflect how species interact and use wetland complexes. For example, amphibians regularly move amongst habitat units beyond 30 metres and are capable of traversing distances greater than 1 kilometre (Smith and Green, 2005). Turtles are also capable of long-distance movements (Millar and Blouin-Demers, 2011). The original OWES definition of a wetland complex (wetland units within 750 metres) was more consistent with the ecology and should stand. It is clear the proposed reduction in wetland complex protection is an attempt to save developers money during the environmental assessment process and provide a loophole for the slow destruction of wetland complexes. Wetland removal is permanent, and we all lose when the ecosystems functions wetlands provide are lost from the landscape. Any evaluation of a wetland unit within a complex (i.e., within 750 metres of each other) should automatically result in the whole wetland complex being evaluated because that is the ecological context within which the wetland unit operates.
•	Wetland Evaluation File – a wetland evaluation file should continue to be submitted to the MNRF for archiving and public access, regardless of what oversight role MNRF has in the wetland evaluation process. Wetlands are a crucial natural heritage feature and the information that is used to justify their destruction should be deposited in a centralized location. Under the current proposal, a wetland evaluations will be submitted locally preventing any sort of broadscale quality control or analysis to inform later policy development and decision making at the provincial level. This is just poor planning by the current government, and it is clear the government is trying to make it difficult to closely track wetland evaluations in the province.
•	Removal of the Reproductive Habitat for Endangered and Threatened Species and Migration, Feeding, or Hibernation Habitat for Endangered and Threatened Species sections – the proposal removes the scoring of a wetland based on whether an endangered or threatened species uses the wetland for reproduction, migration, feeding, or hibernation. The endangered and threatened species scoring was included to help ensure that a wetland supporting an essential life function for an endangered or threatened species is preserved. The vast majority of species are endangered or threatened because they lack the essential habitat needed to support a thriving population. The government has clearly signaled that they care little about preserving the biodiversity of Ontario because they are happy to directly contribute to the extirpation of endangered and threatened species for a few homes that could very well be built on less ecologically important land. The proposal does capture endangered and threatened species in with Provincially Significant Animal and Plants Species scoring; however, the protection afforded to wetlands that support endangered and threatened species are much less as a result. The scoring for the reproductive, migration, feeding, and hibernation habitats of endangered and threatened species needs to be restored.
Wetlands are not some sort of “red tape” for you to remove for development. Instead, they are an integral component of our ecosystem that provide much needed ecosystem services we take for granted everyday. We have destroyed most of our wetland ecosystems in Ontario and now we need to do everything in our power to preserve what we have left.
I ask that you please reconsider your proposal for the OWES because it does not serve Ontario’s best interest. Our wetlands deserve better.

72965,/comment/72965,"The government is proposing to amend the 2014 version of the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) by eliminating the concept of a “wetland complex” and eliminating the role of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) in identifying wetlands as provincially significant (PSWs).  Wetlands are undeniably invaluable natural features for both a natural heritage benefit and natural hazard mitigation functions.
1. Wetland Complexes have been a fundamental part of wetland protection policy since the original Wetlands Policy Statement of 1992. In my experience they have been an accepted part of wetland evaluation science since the first wetland evaluation system of 1983.  Wetland Complexes also achieve another fundamental Planning Act purpose to protect ecological systems.
I do not see the justification of such changes to the OWES. Our wetlands are vital, and their protection has been supported by 30 years of successful science and policy. The effect of eliminating wetland complexes, combined with opening the door to re-evaluating existing units within such complexes, inadvertently adds costs as well as uncertainty to the development process.
The government should not make this change or otherwise at least pause this measure to undertake a science-based evaluation and full cost accounting of this proposed change to ascertain impacts.
2. Role of MNRF – the role of the Ministry for the classification of wetlands to Provincially Significant and the confirmation of boundaries should remain with the Province as these are natural features of Provincial significance and thus are of utmost interest at a Provincial level.  The confirmation of boundaries and the acceptance by the Province is necessary due to the very nature of natural features, which could change over time since the initial evaluation.  Removing the role of the Province to identify what is to be Provincially significant is an abdication of Provincial responsibility that becomes even more critical when wetlands cross municipal boundaries.
This change presents further challenges as many municipalities lack the expertise or capacity to take on this role. This is compounded by other proposed changes to Municipalitys' ability to rely on Conservation Authorities for this technical expertise. This could very well result in further delays to the approvals process.
MNRF’s decision based on scientific grounds has been final until now. Being that this is a science based administrative decision, it becomes unclear who would be the best final arbitrator on the boundary and could lead to unnecessary differences across the Province.
It is recommended that the government revoke this proposed change and retain MNRF’s current role in identifying PSWs.

By conservation authorities as an aid in implementing regulations under the Conservation Authorities Act. Conservation authorities for purposes of public safety, natural hazard prevention and management, regulate wetlands for flood attenuation, natural storage capacities and for preventing shoreline erosion. Conservation authorities also regulate areas around wetlands that may interfere with the hydrologic function of the adjacent wetland including in general areas within 120 metres of all PSWs and areas within 30 metres of all other wetlands. Many conservation authorities evaluate wetlands; MNR retains authority to identify PSWs.	pg 5
…single wetland units that are part of a previously evaluated wetland complex can be re-evaluated (re-scored and re-mapped) without requiring a complete re-evaluation of all units in the existing wetland complex.	7	This statement expresses superficial understanding of what a wetland complex is.  If brick-and-mortar thinking is required here, then think of a wetland complex as an infrastructure for critical ecological services, e.g., runoff and flood control, filtering of excess nutrients and pollutants.  To reassess one wetland unit with the possibility of removal is equivalent to removing a hydro substation or transformer, or removing a set of water mains that supply potable water to households.  This mindset makes broke, more broke and more expensive to mitigate.  The scenario given in the update is a costly misrepresentation of the values of wetlands.
Evaluations are point-in-time assessments to determine a wetland’s status (significant or not) and are not to be ‘updated’. At times decision makers may require a re-evaluation of the wetland to confirm its status.	8	An ‘evaluation’ is not an ‘assessment’.  These are quite different things.   The former implies value analyses, the latter is a data collection and profile based on a set of criteria.   The human values we express regarding wetlands, and what have been scientifically shown to be critical, as contributors to flood management, pollution control, human health and well-being.   What should be updated is the rigor and criteria not to include wetland units.
The evaluation is conducted at a point in time. Hence, it is the conditions described and facts noted at that time that are assessed within the context of all available information. the evaluation always remains as an open file, subject to change as more information becomes available or as a consequence of changes to the wetland itself. Where information is not available, this should be noted; the WEDSR should be updated as information becomes available, making certain that all copies of the evaluation are simultaneously updated as well.	15-16	This section represents transparency, a belief in open data, conduct of the process so due diligence is implemented.  Why was this section removed?
Contour information is available on all OBM mapping and is most useful in physiographic areas of Ontario with relatively significant relief…	19	If anything of the OWES manual needed to be updated, it seems like this description should have been a simple task.  OBM’s (paper and digital copies) exist now in the Ontario Archives, so only there publicly available.   Contours are available as a Land Information Ontario spatial data class through the Provincial Open Data GeoHub website.  Should the author of these manual updates feel embarrassed by this oversight, or do they just not care?  Both undermine the credibility of these changes.
wetlands along a river of lake that are separated by 100 feet or less	20	…were these changes proofread?  There is a typo in this statement:  “…along a river or lake…”.  Is this another expression of an attitude that says:  “don’t care”?
In the case of wetlands that are one contiguous area, this variable pertains to all wetlands within 4 km. in the case of wetland complexes, proximity pertains to the distance from the outer boundary of the wetland complex to the closest adjacent wetland and not to units within the wetland complex.	38	So much effort has been made to remove the concept of wetland complex in these updates, for reasons that are not clear and what appears to be an additional level of complexity and even bureaucracy to evaluating wetlands.  Removing this proximity scenario seems to then require that each wetland unit be evaluated according to proximity, rather than a complex that has been defined as ecologically and hydrologically integrated.   Again this undermines the credibility of these changes and any rationale for streamlining the process rationale and coherent land-use planning.
Method for calculating Interspersion: 1. Determine the longest distance between outside boundaries of a wetland a single wetland or wetland complex, i.e. find the widest portion of the wetland. This may require several measurements and comparisons. Draw a straight line between the two outer most points of the wetland.	39	Same comment about this strikethrough here of wetland complex as in the previous comment.
Locally Important Wetlands………..	63	The strikethrough of this whole section is disturbing.  It undermines a consistency in approach by the Province to support and encourage municipalities to manage their wetlands for the values stated:  ground water discharge; hydrology; social value; and aboriginal values/cultural heritage.  Local definition is important but the evaluation process and rationale to have these values expressed throughout the Province should be consistent.  A wetland doesn’t less a functional value for land-use planning purposes in one location compared to another.  This notion of conservation authorities working in conjunction with municipalities is the critical mechanism in our Province now to uphold consistency of scientifically- and expert-based management of the wetland and waterway resources.

As a certified wetland evaluator under the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES), I have several concerns about the proposed changes to Ontario's Wetland Evaluation Manual, that I ask the Ontario Government to take into consideration.
Removal of MNRF as the administrator of the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
Many of the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation Manual are focused on removing MNRF's role as the administrator, source of technical expertise and interpretation, and reviewer/approver of wetland evaluations. With no alternative, objective body identified to fill these roles, the proposed changes will significantly reduce certainty and clarity related to how significant wetlands are assessed and identified, which is counter to the stated intention of the proposed updates. I have several specific questions and concerns as to how the wetland evaluation program will be implemented moving forward without MNRF filling these roles.
Training of new wetland evaluators: In the past, most of the instructors for the wetland evaluation course have been MNRF employees. If MNRF no longer has a role in administering the wetland evaluation system, who will be responsible for delivering the course? If private consultants are brought in to teach the course, who will cover the cost of hiring these individuals? If no new wetland evaluators are trained, this will prevent the evaluation (or re-evaluation) of wetlands that may or may not be provincially significant, particularly under proposed changes to the system.
Consistent application of the system: The OWES system is based on scientific criteria, however there is significant room for variation in interpretation amongst evaluators, depending on Natural Heritage and other information available at the time an evaluation is completed, and judgement calls of the individual evaluator. If there is no regulatory body responsible for reviewing and approving wetland evaluations, and evaluators are not encouraged to confer with their local MNRF office for the most up-to-date information, this will lead to significant inconsistencies in how the manual is applied across the province.
Interpretation of updates to the wetland evaluation manual: With significant changes proposed to the wetland evaluation system, it can be expected that evaluators will have questions about how to interpret and apply the newly updated manual. If MNRF is no longer the authority on the wetland evaluation system, it is unclear who an evaluator can turn to for advice on how to interpret and apply changes to the manual.
Technical information and expertise: MNRF district offices have in the past been an important source of information on natural heritage, social, and economic values associated with wetlands. As they are no longer listed as a recommended source of information, this will make it more challenging for evaluators to obtain all the information needed to adequately evaluate the significance of a wetland, while maintaining professional integrity. Counter to the stated intention of the proposed changes, this may lead to delays in development decisions, as evaluators struggle to compile all the information needed to complete the evaluation without support from MNRF.
Removal of Wetland Complexes from the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
The manual has also been updated to remove wetland complexes from the evaluation system. As described in the current version of the Southern Ontario Wetland Evaluation Manual:
""Wetland complexes are commonly related in a functional way, that is, as a group they tend to have similar or complementary biological, social and/or hydrological functions. Much of the wildlife in the area of the complex is variously dependent upon the presence of the entire complex of wetlands, with each wetland unit contributing to the whole.""
The manual is clear that not all closely grouped wetlands should be treated as complexes, only those that, when considered together, have a cumulative importance in functions such as ground water recharge, water quality improvement, flood attenuation, and erosion control.
As such, removal of wetland complexes from evaluations moving forward, and the proposed change to allow individual wetland units to be re-evaluated without considering other units within the complex, may have significant consequences for ground water recharge, water quality, flood attenuation, and erosion control, as well as the wildlife that depend on wetland complexes in their entirety such as provincial Species at Risk including Blanding’s Turtle. The potential for development to impair the function of wetland complexes will introduce new sources of liability for municipalities, developers, and the province, and uncertainty for prospective homebuyers about the safety and sustainability of new homes built in the vicinity of any wetlands, if this and other proposals related to Bill 23 are approved.
In addition, the proposal lacks the background documentation to explain the move away from evaluating complexes to instead only considering grouped wetlands that occur within 30 metres of each other or within 100 feet or less along a river or lake. The absence of supporting ecological and scientific rationale for this change does not inspire confidence in the proposed updates, when compared to the comprehensive reasoning within the existing manual.
Change to “Documentation of wetland features not included in evaluation""
While this change succeeds in reducing the workload associated with producing a wetland evaluation, the loss of continuity is worrisome and far outweighs the potential benefits. The documentation of wetland features ensures continuity of information going forward and replicability of results if professional opinions are ever challenged or requested. Loss of this documentation may bring professional judgement into question, while inclusion ensures the information can be built upon and referenced in the future.
Removal of ""Habitat for Threatened or Endangered Species"" from the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
The significance of some wetlands as habitat for certain species at risk is recognized in the current version of the wetland evaluation manual by automatically providing very high scores to wetlands that provide reproductive habitat for an endangered or threatened species, and high scores for wetlands that provide feeding, migration, or hibernation habitat for endangered or threatened species. As no rationale is provided for removing these sections, in seems at face value that the primary intent of this update is to ensure fewer wetlands meet the threshold for Provincial Significance.
Summary
Overall, it is disappointing to see MNRF propose such sweeping changes to the wetland evaluation manual that have no clear ecological or scientific basis. This proposal shows blatant disregard for the importance that wetlands provide to biodiversity, flood attenuation, and social and cultural values. The intent is clear: to limit oversight, reporting, and the ability for wetlands to achieve PSW status, in order to facilitate development in these provincially sensitive habitats.

72988,/comment/72988,"1. Establish a “user” working group to discuss and review changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System prior to finalizing changes.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is proposing updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) in support of Ontario’s Housing Supply Action Plan 3.0. A number of key changes are identified, including, but not limited to: changes to how wetlands are re-evaluated and how wetland boundaries are updated,
the ability to evaluate wetland complexes, changes in scoring criteria and attributes, and administration of the OWES.
Wetlands provide several benefits and ecosystem services such as flood control/ attenuation, drought control, shoreline stabilization, water purification, groundwater recharge and discharge areas, carbon sequestration and habitat for diverse species (including endangered or threatened species). When protected in a connected natural heritage system, wetlands are a natural and cost-effective tool to mitigate impacts of flooding, erosion, and drought, particularly in the face of a changing climate, which put people, property and built infrastructure at risk. For all these reasons, the protection of wetlands remains critical in Ontario.
I am are concerned that many proposed changes will result in fewer wetlands being evaluated and designated as provincially significant. Further, proposed changes would allow for wetlands previously designated as provincially significant to be re-evaluated (particularly those part of previously identified wetland complexes), which may result in a gradual fragmentation and loss of provincially significant wetlands.
2.Retain the section of the OWES Manuals titled “Wetland Complexes” as well as all references to wetland complexes / complexing.
Under the current OWES (2014), wetland complexes are recognized as groupings of wetlands that are commonly related in a functional way and tend to have complementary biological, social and/or hydrological functions. OWES currently provides that, where a wetland complex is recognized, evaluators must score the entire complex as one wetland, and ensure that all individual wetland communities in the complex are mapped. The ability for evaluators to consider wetland complexing is significant, as considerations such as the “topography of the landscape in which these wetlands occur, the short distances between some of the wetlands, and the density of wetlands per unit of areal landscape may be so complex that delineation of the wetland units into individually recognized wetlands would not be an ecologically or functionally sound process” (OWES 2014, p. 39).
The proposed changes to the OWES manual would remove the section titled “Wetland Complexes”, as well as all references to wetland complexes / complexing (except for a new section titled “Wetland Re-evaluations and Mapping Updates”). If the proposed changes are finalized, wetland evaluators would no longer be able to evaluate an entire wetland complex as a single wetland. This will result in wetland units being evaluated individually, without consideration to their values across a network of interconnected features. This change may result in lower scoring wetlands, with fewer achieving scores to designate them as provincially significant.
Consideration of wetland complexes is a significant tool to mitigate potential impacts from natural hazards, as all individual units in a wetland complex may work together to provide services such as flood control/attenuation or shoreline stabilization.
I believe the section titled “Wetland Complexes” as well as all references to wetland complexes / complexing should remain in the OWES manual, to continue to require evaluators to score the entire recognized complex as one wetland.
Removing the ability to evaluate wetland complexes will result in many wetlands remaining unevaluated, resulting in a potential loss of protections for these wetlands (through a provincially significant or locally important designation).
3. Amend the proposed “Re-evaluation of previously evaluated wetland complexes” subsection to state that re-evaluation of wetland complexes may only occur through a complete re-evaluation of all units in the existing wetland complex at the same time, and that the status of a wetland complex (e.g., significant or not) may only change based on such a re-evaluation of the complete wetland complex.
4. Retain sections 4.1.2.1 (Reproduction Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species) and 4.1.2.2 (Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered of Threatened Species) in the OWES manual to signal the high importance of these attributes when evaluating or re-evaluating wetlands. Retain or re-evaluate the current evaluation scores for these attributes.
Under the current OWES (2014), the “Special Features” component brings together certain biological and ecological attributes of wetlands for consideration, such as the geographical rarity of wetlands, species occurrence and habitat quality. Under the “rarity” subcomponent, consideration for habitats of endangered or threatened species, specifically, reproductive habitat (4.1.2.1) and migration, feeding or hibernation habitat (4.1.2.2), is provided. Scores for wetlands that provide such habitats for endangered or threatened species are high, with wetlands containing reproductive habitat for such species automatically receiving the highest value possible for a component of the OWES (250 points). The inclusion of high values for attributes such as endangered and threatened species habitat signal the importance of these attributes when evaluating wetlands. It should be noted that a score of 200 or greater in the “Special Features” component meets the requirements for designation as a PSW.
The proposed revisions to the OWES manuals include the removal of sections 4.1.2.1 and 4.1.2.2, signaling that reproductive, migration, feeding or hibernation habitat for endangered or threatened species would no longer be considered when evaluating a wetland in Ontario.
I urge consideration for these attributes as part of the “Special Features” component of the OWES be retained.
I believe its important that the province maintain the considerations for habitats of endangered and threatened species in the OWES, and review (and if needed, re-evaluate) the evaluation scores to effectively capture the values of wetlands that support endangered or threatened species in Ontario.
5. Retain the section of Appendix 1 that speaks to “locally significant wetlands” to provide transparency of process for municipalities to designate and protect wetlands that do not meet the criteria for a “provincially significant” designation (i.e., “locally important wetlands”).
Under the current OWES (2014), Appendix 1 speaks to the definition of and process for determining a wetland as “provincially significant”. In this Appendix, it is noted that some municipalities may choose to determine that other wetlands (not deemed provincially significant) are significant on a local scale and may decide to protect them. “Locally important wetlands” include wetlands that are evaluated and are not identified as provincially significant, and/or partially evaluated and unevaluated wetlands that have been confirmed as wetland habitat and mapped using the OWES methodology or interpretations of remote-sensing imagery.
The proposed revisions to the OWES manual includes the removal of all references to locally important wetlands, as well as the removal of this portion of Appendix 1.
I feel that references to locally important wetlands, including this section in Appendix 1, should be retained in the manual to allow municipal governments to protect non-PSWs and to provide clarity and direction on how these locally significant wetlands should be consistently identified.
Given that many of the proposed changes may result in lower scoring wetlands, it is important to retain references to “locally important wetlands” in the OWES to signal the importance of all wetlands and the ability of a municipality to protect non-PSWs.

72989,/comment/72989,"As a certified Ontario Wetland Evaluator and wetland scientist with many years of experience evaluating wetlands and delineating wetland boundaries in Ontario, I am left dumbfounded by the currently proposed changes to the current OWES manual and instructions.
The proposed changes represent a complete disregard for wetland science and best available knowledge and progress made on the conservation of wetlands.
I need not explain here the numerous and proven benefits of preserving wetlands on the landscape. There is NO argument contrary to this fact.
The section of the OWES Manuals titled “Wetland Complexes” as well as all references to wetland complexes / complexing must be retained in the manuals. To remove complexing would certainly spell disaster for wetlands in Ontario and wetlands which do not meet the scoring criteria to be considered significant on their own. These smaller wetlands would surely be destroyed by development without provincial protection without any sort of cumulative impact analysis taking place. The implications of this change have most certainly not been fully considered, and the implications of this change have most certainly not been fully and transparently communicated to the people of Ontario. As far as I can interpret, the 700m distance for complexing is being replaced with a much smaller 30m distance. The risk of this change is considerable, particularly in areas where small wetlands dominate the landscape and development pressures are high.
Furthermore, the removal of consideration of the breeding habitat for species at risk in scoring is absurd. Species at Risk in Ontario benefit from wetland conservation and preservation and in many cases rely on wetlands for their continued survival in Ontario. These habitats are already rare causing these species to be rare. Species at Risk habitat must be considered a valued function of wetlands in Ontario and must contribute a significant portion of the scoring of a wetland under OWES. Conservation of landscapes, ecosystems, species, and ecological function depends on legislation, mechanisms, and tools that overlap and have redundancy. Removal of this redundancy is a step backwards.
A working group must be established that includes wetland scientists and OWES practitioners that have actual experience applying the OWES manual. These are the people that should be suggesting potential changes to the manual. Not people who have no idea of the ramifications of their proposed changes to the manual.
In conclusion, I do not agree with the proposed changes to the OWES manual. Once again, the changes appear to be made in favour of development in Ontario at the expense of existing wetlands and the existing people of Ontario.
At what point does the science saying 'climate crisis' get taken seriously? It is time to think about future generations instead of benefitting ones self today.

Getting rid of provincial oversight, wetland complexes and consideration for species at risk would lead to many of our wetlands being unprotected and therefore developed. We need wetland complexes to help mitigate the increased record-breaking storm and flood events caused by climate change. I urge you to: 1) consult with conservation authorities, which are the organizations most knowledgeable on mitigating floods, 2) reinstate provincial oversight through the MNRF, and 3) keep wetland complexes in the OWES.
Damaging or even changing our wetlands will set the stage for disaster.

72997,/comment/72997,"The proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) are not so much about housing as they are about gutting wetland protections. The OWES has been in place since 1983 and has served the province well, providing a clear picture of which pockets of Ontario we need to protect in order to maintain a well-balanced and healthy ecosystem that can continue to provide not just fresh drinking water to millions but also the natural infrastructure necessary to sustain all life. We are a part of nature; we do not stand apart from it. We rely on it. Sometimes we need to remind political parties of this fact of life, and now is one of those times.
The proposed changes to OWES seem to arise from an erroneous assumption that wetlands are somehow a barrier to increasing Ontario’s housing supply, affordable or otherwise; therefore, encroaching on existing identified wetlands by re-assessing their status and their boundaries has become necessary.
Wetlands are not the problem. A shortage of land isn’t either. Neither are bottlenecking the supply of housing in Ontario. Ontario’s own Housing Affordability Task Force has explained as much in its 2022 report. For example: the amount of greenfield land already designated for development and added to municipal settlement boundaries (but still undeveloped) far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets. And that includes the more than 86,000 acres within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area alone.
One of the most egregious aspects of the proposal is the removal of Ministry oversight. To quote the exact wording, “Make changes to better recognize the professional opinion of wetland evaluators and the role of local decision makers.”
To virtually unravel any wetland oversight that currently exists is as baffling as it is ill-conceived. Is the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) actually proposing to remove itself from any involvement in Ontario’s wetland evaluation process? Will there be no central body assigned to coordinate or approve evaluations? Or to ensure that information about wetland designation is publicly accessible? And who are these new “evaluators” and “local decision makers”?
Well, municipalities for one. Offloading approval authority to municipalities is not wise. They do not and will not have the decades-long expertise or experience of MNRF staff in making assessments, offering guidance or understanding the full impact of their decisions. Combine this with the fact that due to Bill 23’s proposed limitations to the input of our 36 Conservation Authorities in matters relating to approvals, wetlands will be even more vulnerable to detrimental development.
Furthermore, if this also leads to developers bringing in their own evaluators (as would be the case for wetland units formerly part of a Provincially Significant Wetland complex but re-evaluated individually, as I understand it), is that not tantamount to inviting the fox into the henhouse? And who will be able to intervene on behalf of the public – the citizens of Ontario - regarding an evaluation of questionable merit?
The proposed changes to OWES will leave confusion and chaos in their wake thanks to the lack of coordination and oversight with no comprehensive protective plan for wetlands in Ontario, a patchwork mess that could lead to a complete failure of wetland stewardship in our province, unravelling decades of hard work by dedicated professionals.
For all of the above disturbing aspects of the proposal to revamp the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, I would suggest that it be paused, revisited and re-evaluated. It is a devastating, damaging document that will have terrible consequences for generations to come. And it will not lead to more houses any time soon.
As for the monetary value of intact wetlands, a recent study out of the University of Waterloo (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.14442) has assessed just one of the free services wetlands provide: water purification. If we continue to dismiss the importance of wetlands, we will need to invest billions in alternative methods to clean water. Billions. Those Great Lakes we love so much? They rely on the health and quality of our wetlands too. I don’t think I need to mention flood mitigation as another critical reason for maintaining our remaining wetlands. This is something that we should all be well aware of by now.
I have firsthand knowledge of what it means to care for a wetland. I know that less than 30 per cent of our original wetlands remain in southern Ontario. (Where I live.) In the Niagara and Greater Toronto Area that number drops to 10 per cent. The rate of wetland loss between 2011–2015 alone (1,825 ha per year) is considerably higher than the rate of wetland loss previously assessed for the decade between 2000–2011 (615 ha per year). These statistics and others can be found on the Ontario Biodiversity Council website. Smaller wetlands not designated Provincially Significant are already disappearing at an alarming rate due to development. If we are already losing small wetlands in Ontario to development, should we not ensure that we protect all others in view of the amount of scientific evidence that substantiates their critical importance to our communities?
A study published in the Journal of Environmental Management (May 2022) recommended that “protections be strengthened for wetlands of all sizes, in turn protecting communities by retaining the important ecosystem services that are vital for biodiversity as well as human health and wellbeing, which wetlands provide.”
Ontario is clearly going in the wrong direction for the future with its proposed changes to OWES. Let us pause to consider a better way, but by working together, all citizens.
I respectfully urge the government to rethink the sweeping plan to amend OWES. It will not effectively add more “houses,” but it will seriously impair the home we all share – our province.

These comments are submitted on behalf of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario.
Preamble
The Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) is a non-profit, non-partisan association that represents municipal governments across Ontario. Together with our members, we address common challenges facing our residents and provide advice to the government about solutions to them. AMO has been actively involved in housing and homelessness advocacy for years, as Ontario’s 444 municipal governments are responsible for building strong, complete communities, of which housing – both home ownership and rentals – is a key component.
Housing affordability and building supply is a challenge all Ontarians share. There is much that can be done collectively by working together to increase housing supply, diversify the mix and increase affordability. Solving the housing crisis will require an all-of-government approach by all three orders of government.
Introduction
The Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on consultations related to Bill 23 – More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022.
Municipal governments are committed to working with the Government to increase the supply of housing and to improve housing affordability in Ontario. That is why we provided a written submission to Bill 23 despite not being selected to speak at the Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy.
Overall AMO is concerned with the timing of the bill being introduced the day after municipal elections. This has significantly curtailed the ability for municipal councils to provide comments on what will undoubtedly change the development and approvals process in Ontario.
Preliminary analysis of the Bill indicates the transfer of up to $1 billion a year in costs from private sector developers to property taxpayers without any likelihood of improved housing affordability. Similarly, the bill’s provisions designed to reduce environmental protection will benefit developers in the short term, with costs to the public and homeowners that cannot be calculated. By doing so, the government is effectively socializing the costs of new housing development.
We are appealing to the provincial government that solutions to the housing crisis can be found in collaboration, cooperation, and innovation. It is time for Ontario to work with all of its housing partners towards advancing in land use planning and taking an integrated approach to environmental, social and economic policy that allows Ontario to take its place ahead of competing jurisdictions.
Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (ERO 019-6160)
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) include but are not limited to: changes to how wetlands are re-evaluated and how wetland boundaries are updated, the ability to evaluate wetland complexes, changes in scoring criteria and attributes, and administration of the OWES.
AMO shares concerns from conservation authorities (CAs) and other stakeholders that many of these proposals will result in fewer wetlands being evaluated and designated as provincially significant. Further, that they would allow for wetlands previously designated as provincially significant to be re-evaluated (particularly those part of previously identified wetland complexes), which may result in a gradual fragmentation and loss of provincially significant wetlands across Ontario.
Wetlands provide a number of benefits and ecosystem services such as: flood control/attenuation, drought control, shoreline stabilization, water purification, groundwater recharge and discharge areas, carbon sequestration and habitat for diverse species (including endangered or threatened species). When protected in a connected natural heritage system, wetlands are a natural and cost-effective tool to mitigate impacts of flooding, erosion and drought, particularly in the face of a changing climate, which put people, property and built infrastructure at risk. For all these reasons, the protection of wetlands remains critical in Ontario.
Without amendment, these changes will significantly impact the municipal resources required to fill the gaps in natural heritage planning services currently provided by the CAs. Therefore, AMO recommends that key stakeholders including municipalities be consulted on how these changes will impact their communities from a liability perspective and be given sufficient time to adapt to the proposed changes to the Conservation Authorities Act that are made under Schedule 2 of Bill 23.
Conclusion
On behalf of municipal governments across Ontario, thank you for your consideration of the comments provided in this submission.

73009,/comment/73009,"Wetlands are and will become an increasingly important buffer from worse and worse flooding caused by climate change and more and more of the landscape being covered by developments - especially impermiable developments.  It is important to keep as many wetlands intact as we can - especially provincially significant ones.  Building on floodplains and filling wetlands for building will not only cause irreparable damage it will Ontario taxpayers huge costs in damages and escallating insurance costs.  What is the point of building more homes if they will high risk financially to homeowners and the province (expect liability costs) and have high ecological costs as well?  These provisions only benefit a few already wealthy developers connected with the Conservative Party.
The provisions proposed for the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System along with the spawl development of Bill 23 will destroy Ontario - we'll become a have not province.  I am a knowledge worker and have flexibiliy in where I work and live.  The implications of Bill 23, especialy to OWES, building on the green belt and greenlighting sprawl instead of doing the important work to stimulate smart compact cities (as per the provincial policy statement  - PPS - that your government put in place in 2020) are making me reconsider living in Ontario.  I am not the only one.  Who wants to live in a polluted, concrete covered wasteland that is not climate resilient and thus expensive and unsafe.  Stop and throw this hastily conceived boondoggle for developers and come up with a plan that makes Ontario an attractive and liveable place in future.
The provisions of OWES that are objectionable and need to be thrown out:
- Breaking the evaluation of wetland complexs up into small wetlands.  This will result in the gradual dismantling of wetlands with all the consequant impacts on our climate resilience, economy, homeowner costs, liability of province, and ecological systems on which we depend for clean water, air and lands.  Wetland complexes must be mandatorily evaluated as a whole and not piece meal as proposed.
-    The Province will have no role in reviewing or approving wetland evaluations, will no longer keep wetland evaluation files and maintain significant wetland mapping, or provide information for use in wetland evaluations. These responsibilities will be delegated to the municipalities, without additional budgets or provincial   assistance, and the municipalities will have NO authority to review and approve wetland evaluations submitted by landowners.  There will be no stewards for these provincially significants lands and they will be left to deteriorate.  They are provincially signifcant for a reason, and just cause some developers want to do cheap and easy development on them, doesn't make them no longer provincially significant.  It makes the Ford government culpable in destroying provincial crown assets.
- the fox guarding the hen house approach for evaluation of wetlands, whereby the person who pays for evaluation of a wetland (the developer) is the only one with the authority to say its value.  This is a serious conflict of interest, and unacceptable from an ethical and democratic perspective.
I demand that the Province continue its role in the management of Provincially Significant Wetlands and that municipalities be given the authority to review and approve wetland evaluations.
Eastern Ontario resident - who will NEVER vote PC again if this bill and the strong mayor bills pass.

73010,/comment/73010,"The government must realize that the use of wetlands throughout Ontario by species at risk is not an unimportant factor in protecting these habitats from development. Wetlands are extremely biodiverse habitats that serve as essential breeding grounds, hibernation sites, migratory stopovers for many species. To disregard the ecological, social, and economic importance of Ontario's wetlands as they are now (that is to say, as undeveloped protected lands), is wildly irresponsible. Efforts should be made to maintain these protected areas and create housing where it is needed in existing residential zones. Using residential zones more efficiently would mean that our wetlands do not have to be compromised. I'm outraged to discover that this proposal makes light of value of these areas and the threatened species that use them, as if they are no longer important. Our wetlands are important and if we protect them, will last much longer than the quickly-built housing that threatens to destroy them now.

Data from the 2021 Census of Agriculture suggests Ontario is losing 319 acres of farmland daily, equal to the loss of one average family farm per day.
Also when the world is facing a climate crisis, urban sprawl is the worst option to combat this issue.
Given how the good chain has been interrupted by the war in Ukraine and the climate has the world on the brink of disaster, i urge the Ontario government to stop bill 23 and find another solution to the housing crisis I. E. High density housing, rather than paving over wetlands.

Future generations deserve the protection wetlands offer. Don’t make them pay the price of destroying the environment and the fallout that comes from that.
Protecting wetlands and especially the ones that are still intact is a necessity. Removing requirements for the proposed reason is unethical and goes directly against the state of natural resources report which states that the Ontario ministry is actively working towards stronger protections of our ecosystems and biodiversity.
While housing is another important issue in Ontario- it should not come at the expense of our wetlands. Once the wetlands are damaged and gone, we can’t get them back. We should be striving to protect more ecosystems and the environment.

73017,/comment/73017,"Hello,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES). I am a resident of Grey County with a young family - we were lucky enough to buy a house this year, but I know so many could not. We are certainly in a housing crisis, and increasing supply is one part of the puzzle for sure, but there is no evidence to suggest that these changes to OWES are needed to increase affordability.
I use the OWES frequently in my professional life as a planner. The OWES has been an important tool in identifying significant wetland features throughout the Province of Ontario. The system could certainly use some work, I recognize that aspects may be outdated as it is from the 80's. However, if you truly believe that, you need to consult and to studies to find out how to improve it. To come forward with these changes would devalue these wetlands. We know that you are just doing this to facilitate the kind of development that we don't need right now.
Based on the consultation guide provided, I have significant concerns with the changes proposed. These concerns include the following:
1.	It is unclear who the ultimate approval authority will be for changes to wetland designations and boundaries under various pieces of legislation (Planning Act, EAA, ARA, NEPDA, etc.). You have not presented any evidence why this shouldn't remain with MNRF.
2.	It is unclear who the ultimate holder of the wetland data will be. I strongly recommend that this role remain with MNRF or another appropriate Provincial service.
3.	It is unclear how many times a wetland can be re-evaluated and which re-evaluation is the appropriate one.
4.	This new system removes the watershed lens and may result in impacts that extend outside of a municipal boundary, with no Provincial or conservation authority oversight to review the bigger picture. I am opposed to this change in governance for the systems and believe that it will have negative consequences for natural hazard and natural heritage management in Ontario.
5.	The removal of the wetland complex concept will serve to dramatically reduce wetland features on the landscape, increasing flood and drought risk, and reducing habitat, biodiversity and ecosystem services. I am opposed to this change and believe that it will have negative consequences for natural hazards and natural heritage in Ontario.
6.	It is unclear if the guide is suggesting that the recent or future elimination of a wetland for agricultural purposes (Page 9) would cause a wetland to not be considered such any longer. It is also unclear if such changes would allow for the removal of wetlands in advance of Planning Act applications under the guise of agriculture.
7.	MNRF has a long history of natural resource management. It is unclear why the consultation guide is proposing to remove all references to MNRF as a source of data for undertaking wetland evaluations. I am opposed to MNRF being removed from a role here as it will negate decades of experience and corporate knowledge.
Wetlands are beautiful. You could measure them in terms of flood protection in the face of a changing climate, biodiversity, number of species at risk, water purification, among others. Or, you could just go outside with your family, breath deeply, and know that some things are just worth protecting. I welcome a fulsome approach to updating OWES with these goals in mind, but I do not feel that is what the intent of this government is at the moment.

73020,/comment/73020,"Comments on proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
*pages refer to Proposed updates document
•	General: If MNRF is taken out of the OWES process, clarity will be required on who will provide training (which is already backlogged) and certification (both of which must continue to be standardized)?
Page 3, first paragraph (existing text, not a proposed change, but affected by proposed changes):
Current text, “one of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s (MNRF) mandates is the protection and sustainable management of the province’s natural heritage features, including wetlands.”
•	As wetlands (including units of current PSW complexes) are re-evaluated and submitted to local decision makers rather than to the MNRF (for review/approval and for record keeping in a centralized location), the Ministry will either lack information or collecting this information for the purposes of protecting and managing wetlands at a provincial scale will be an inefficient, time-consuming endeavour
•	Information on provincially significant wetlands is essential to this mandate
Page 4 – Text removed:
•	Land use planning decisions should not be made in the absence of information on the presence of rare species and about hydrological functions
Page 4 (last paragraph) and 5:
•	Page 4 – reference to protection under the PPS removed, CA Act
•	Text removed includes how the wetland evaluation system is essential to the wetland policies of the PPS and Planning Act and CA Act, all currently under review
•	The cumulative negative impact proposed changes to the CA Act, Planning Act, and PPS, in addition to OWES, will have on wetland protection in Ontario is unclear but is expected to be wide-ranging and significant.
Page 6 - Text removed and added:
•	An evaluator should be able to access the ministry that has administered and been the repository for wetland evaluations for decades. They should have access to historic reports.
Page 7 – text removed :
•	If evaluations no longer being sent to MNRF, who will be the repository of this information and what access will there be to the information? If a consultant evaluates a wetland on behalf of an applicant, does the evaluation become a public document when submitted to a decision maker, or is it private? Who can see the document? Will there be a wetland evaluation file?
•	This information should be kept on file, by municipalities if not by MNRF, such that it is accessible to decision makers and the public
•	Lack of contact with organizations and agencies who may have information relevant or essential to evaluation of the wetland may affect the credibility/validity of the evaluation
Page 7 – Text added, Wetland Re-evaluations and Mapping:
•	Allows for wetland units that are part of PSW complexes, to be evaluated as stand-alone wetlands without consideration of their function as part of a larger wetland ecosystem. This would allow for wetland complexes to be chipped away at over time, likely eroding the significance of the remaining wetlands in the former complex.
•	allowing for the re-evaluation of individual wetland units without consideration of their function as part of a larger ecosystem leaves vast amounts of wetland without strong protections, rendering them at risk of removal from the landscape.
•	There are currently 66 provincially significant wetlands in the LSRCA watershed. Of these, 41 are wetland complexes. The removal of wetland complexes would put 62% of our provincially significant wetlands at risk.
•	lack of clarity about meaning of “mapping update” – if it is to include wetland boundary delineation for the purpose of establishing sufficient buffers to wetlands, risk of leaving this up to one person hired by applicant means that there is motivation to obtain most favourable outcome for client
•	unclear if there would be any oversight, agency/municipal involvement in any mapping update. Mapping updates should be documented and kept on file with evaluation and in a central database with public access
•	If there is no file and no documented mapping updates, valuable information about wetlands will be lost and not accessible to agencies or organizations that steward, manage or protect wetlands in Ontario
Page 8 – new section “Complete Evaluation”
•	suggests that an existing PSW can be re-evaluated at any time, without agency involvement or oversight, relying on the evaluation undertaken by consultant without peer review by any agency:
o	Evaluations should not be considered complete when received by a decision maker if critical information is missing or the system was erroneously applied
o	Who is decision maker? Needs clarity
o	Means that the significance of a wetland is determined by a single individual, regardless of the quality of the evaluation. If any portion of the evaluation is done incorrectly, or missing available information, there is no opportunity for it to be peer reviewed and amended.
o	It is prudent also to consider that a client hires a consultant to undertake a wetland re-evaluation as part of the development application process. This relationship puts, as a priority, the most favourable outcome of an evaluation for the applicant and represents a conflict of interest.
o	Peer review (currently through submission of evaluations to MNRF for approval) serves as quality control. The protection of critical habitats and ecological functions hangs on this quality control
Page 9, text removed:
•	In addition to a decision maker having to accept an evaluation, re-evaluation or mapping update as complete, the list of items that make up a complete wetland evaluation file is completely removed from the document (i.e., no guidance is provided on what is to be included). These removed items include important pieces of documentation, including data and scoring record, catchment mapping, wetland boundary and vegetation mapping, air photos, field notes.
Page 11, text removed:
•	“Contact with appropriate organizations and agencies, outlined below, is vital to the credibility of the evaluation and of the Special Features component in particular.” Remains valid and should be left in
•	Why have important information sources been removed from the manual? No Information Available can be entered in the WEDSR without any oversight on whether information was indeed available/requested
Page 15, Field Visits, text added:
•	The wording is not clear whether all field work can be conducted by an untrained assistant and then reviewed by a certified OWES evaluator, or if the evaluator would be on site. The evaluator needs to attend the site.
Page 20, text added:
Wetland Edges Bordering on Lakes and Rivers
•	should use meters rather than feet
Page 22, text removed:
•	Updates to reflect changes in technology (e.g. removing mention of disks) is supported
Page 23, Catchment Basin Map, text removed:
•	how will hydrology be scored without this map?
•	supportive of update based on change in technology (i.e. tablets/phones may be used in field rather than print outs), but the data listed should be used in the field and additional information recorded
Page 24, Completing the Wetland Evaluation Data and Scoring Record, everything removed apart from wetland size (moved to its own section):
•	will there be a wetland record? What will be included? Clarity is needed here.
Page 26, Wetland Complexes, all text removed
•	the previous version of the manual text stated, “Much of the wildlife in the area of the complex is variously dependent upon the presence of the entire complex of wetlands”. The proposed version removes the concept of complexes and with each wetland unit contributing to the whole. How can this be reconciled? The dependency of Wildlife is still dependent on the complex whether these are recognized or not has not changed, only the text, and impacts to wildlife can be expected if these individual wetland units are evaluated in isolation and thus receive less protection than if they were recognized as part of a complex
•	Protection for small wetlands that provide “important ecological benefits” as described in the current manual is weakened by the proposed changes
Page 46, 4.1.2 Species:
-not a comment on a proposed change but suggest adding community science databases (i.e., eBird, iNaturalist) as alternative sources of information
Sections 4.1.2.1 and 4.1.2.2 - complete removal of scoring for Endangered/Threatened species, though these would be scored as tracked species (which would receive fewer points)
•	Devalues the importance of wetland habitat for essential lifecycle processes of species at risk species
•	Protection of wetland as PSW vs. protection of habitat under ESA
o	Example Least Bittern – no habitat regulation yet, critical habitat only defined in recovery strategy for breeding habitat, not post-breeding dispersal, foraging, or migration stopover habitat. Removal of Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species in scoring could put wetland habitat for these lifecycle processes at risk. Wetland destruction and degradation is identified as being a high threat to Least Bittern in the recovery strategy.
Page 62 Wetland Evaluation Data and Scoring Record:
•	Proposed changes to the Wetland Evaluation Data and Scoring Record section should be provided for comment. Currently there is only a note saying that the section will be “edited to reflect many of the above changes”.
Page 63, text removed, Locally Important Wetland:
•	The removal of the text, “The wetland evaluation system for northern and southern Ontario is designed to identify important wetlands on a provincial scale. However, all wetlands have value, both to society and intrinsically” does not change the worth and importance of these wetlands at the local scale. This section should remain in the manual.
•	Removed text includes reference to municipalities deciding to protect locally important wetlands. As municipalities have been identified in the added text as being generally responsible for implement Ontario’s planning process in the introduction (page 3), there doesn’t appear to be rationale for removing this section.

There is little to no consideration given within this proposal to the municipalities who voiced their opposition to expanding urban boundaries for development. Explicit preference was stated for building on undeveloped land within existing urban boundaries and I fail to understand why this government did not honour or even explore that possibility.
The only benficiaires are the individuals who suspiciously purchased the specific lands this proposal suggests should be rezoned for development.

73031,/comment/73031,"The area where I live, the Quinte region, currently has 100 Provincially Significant Wetlands throughout the watershed.  According to staff at Quinte Conservation, changes to the wetland evaluation system would mean that there would only be 1 Provincially Significant Wetland remaining, representing a 99% loss to Quinte region’s wetlands.
In Prince Edward County, part of the Quinte region, we need to protect our wetlands, especially our Provincially Significant wetlands.
The entire County of Prince Edward has been identified as a Highly Vulnerable Aquifer in the Quinte Region Source Protection Plan – that means our drinking water is at risk and highly susceptible to contamination from development and industry. Our wetlands are our best protection against this as they get water into our aquifers while filtering out its contaminants.
During the months of May through August, Prince Edward County has the lowest average precipitation of any county in Ontario.  Those are the months when demand for water peaks – for agriculture for the growing season and for the height of tourism when our population expands enormously.
Due to climate change, Prince Edward County is experiencing increasing weather volatility; wind storms; frequent ice storms; unpredictable thaws and extraordinary flooding events; unpredictable long-term effects of longer droughts; soil erosion and greater risk of fire.
Concretely, these effects have caused in recent years:
-	$1.7 million in County expenses related to flood disaster;
-	More than $7.5 million for crop insurance claims due to drought;
-	Unknown losses to under –insurance costs;
-	100 % increase in hauling water costs for farmers and residents;
-	Extreme flooding in 2017 and 2019.
Our inland Provincially Significant and other wetlands pull water into the ground so it is there when we need it. As they do so they filter out contaminants, protecting our drinking water, especially in rural areas where we have no built infrastructure.   Our few remaining Provincially significant coastal wetlands protect our highly vulnerable shoreline during storm surges. Our wetlands play a huge role in flood prevention, drought mitigation and erosion control. They also store an enormous amount of carbon. They are extremely beautiful and provide habitat for our exceptional biodiversity, a big draw for tourists to our area.  Our wetlands are our best defence against climate change and are important economic drivers for our largest industries, agriculture and tourism. And they do it all for free.
In recognition of this fact, Prince Edward County mandated a 50 m setback from ALL wetlands in their new Official Plan. To address our problems with drought and shortage of groundwater, our Official Plan only allows a single subdivision in rural areas. We need the 120 m setback to protect our PSWs, all of whose protection depends on the evaluation points gotten by providing Endangered and Threatened Species habitat. The presence of those species lets us know which wetlands are working best to recharge our ground water and protect us from flooding and erosion.
The costs listed above during extreme weather years (flooding and drought) were incurred with the existence of 26 PSWs in Prince Edward County, including some potential PSWs not yet identified. Imagine what would have  happened  had they all been denigrated or filled in by development. We need more protections for our wetlands to support the growing population of Prince Edward County.
By changing the O.W.E.S. classification system, our existing Provincially Significant Wetlands could lose their status and protections, and our un-evaluated wetlands are unlikely to meet the standard for additional protection without the points for Endangered and Threatened Species.  The proposed changes are not scientifically based and will devaluate the wetlands we desperately need to protect.
Loss of wetlands will impact wildlife, climate change, water quality/quantity, tourism and recreation, and will result in the need for more infrastructure through the creation of stormwater ponds which will require more maintenance and monitoring, necessitating the need increase to municipal taxes yet again and negatively affect the ability of the wetlands to offset flooding.
Prince Edward County has wetlands that do a lot of this costly work for them. We are at risk of losing this precious natural infrastructure if the proposed changes to the O.W.E.S are implemented as our wetlands will no longer qualify for optimal protection.
I imagine the same is true for other parts of Ontario. We need to keep and protect our existing wetlands which have taken a long time to evolve to do the work they do.
Recommendation: That the province re-engage the multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority (CA) Working Group and work with the working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and develop better alternatives, prior to proceeding with current proposed amendments.

- Communities have realized the value of green spaces as a result of the COVID pandemic.  We have learned green spaces, whether wetland or not, support mental and physical health.  Especially in the vicinity of urban areas, more protected green space is needed, not less.
- Corridors and habitat for wildlife and other living creatures must be maintained.  Evaluation of wetlands on an individual basis without considering connecting features and functions disregards ecological importance of these connections, such as wetland complexes.

Protecting Escarpment Rural Land (PERL) is a volunteer, non-profit, community-based organization based in Burlington and incorporated in 2005. We are dedicated to the protection and enhancement of the Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve that is internationally recognized for its remarkable landscapes and biological diversity. We have primarily focused on land-use issues on Mount Nemo in North Burlington, and have intimate knowledge of the Provincially Significant Grindstone Creek Headwater wetland complex located there. Our work supports the Niagara Escarpment as a continuous natural corridor across Southern Ontario.
PERL is writing to state our opposition to Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, and associated policy proposals that would weaken environmental protections and undermine public involvement in land use decision-making. Bill 23 threatens to lessen our hard-fought democratic rights, and diminish our ecological and economic health. Most importantly, as affordable housing advocates across the province have been saying for weeks, this legislation would not, on the whole, improve access to affordable housing. In fact it would likely make truly affordable housing less accessible. It would also greatly exacerbate the biodiversity and climate change crises for Ontarians.
We are frankly appalled that the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetlands Evaluation System (OWES) would declassify wetland complexes and open them up to destruction. The declassification of wetlands, wetland complexes, and associated woodlands, would lead to the destruction of vital ecosystems and Species-at-Risk habitats. It is a dereliction of government’s stewardship obligations to lessen existing protections for Species-At-Risk.  Lowering existing scores for Endangered Species is the epitome of irresponsibility.
Wetlands are a necessary for our existence. They are the workhorses of our environment. They clean and filter pollutants from our drinking water. They control flooding. Wetlands capture essential soil moisture and recharge groundwater that feed innumerable stream and creeks. They sequester carbon dioxide from our atmosphere and sustain the fungal networks needed to break down organic matter. Nature provides these vital services, and more, for free. Moreover wetlands are home to precious rare and endangered plants and animals.
Our agricultural crops and flowering plant species require pollinators to produce seeds, fruits and vegetables. Without pollinating insects our food crop yields will decrease, threatening our food supply at a time when a global food crisis is imminent. Wetlands, woodlands and grasslands provide habitats for these essential pollinators.
As the government’s own biologists know, many wetlands in Ontario, big and small, are grouped together in complexes. These complexes are necessary for the wildlife that live there, as the entire complex makes up their habitat. The wetlands work together as an integrated ecosystem. Biodiversity and genetic mixing ensure long-term health of all species. Isolated habitats do not survive.
The “Natural Heritage Systems” approach was taken to help sustain the interconnected and interdependent biomes vital to healthy ecosystems, and life itself. Nature evolved and works as a balanced system. It has thrived for millions of years and it works. Ontario Bill 23 would revert back to an individual, fractured, features-based view of the natural world. This bill would set back 40+ years of scientific progress. The result would be the increased destruction of the very systems that sustain life.
The proposed legislative changes would disregard established science and no longer allow wetlands to be grouped together, instead would treat each wetland as its own entity. Smaller wetlands, even those containing Species-At -Risk would most likely not meet the newly proposed criteria to be Provincially Significant, or even “wetlands”, and would be open for destruction. Once our wetland systems are removed, they are gone forever. Despite what the OSSGA (Ontario Sand Stone and Gravel Association) or others private development interests may claim about “designing habitat”, we know of no long term successful examples of artificially created wetland systems that replicate the form and function of those that occur naturally.
As mentioned, the Ontario Wetlands Evaluation System is a science-based approach to measure and assess wetlands, their associated streams and woodlands. The total biological composition of these ecosystems must be calculated in the OWES scoring. A total watershed landscape lens must be applied. Personal and political objectives have no place in ecological assessment.
Bill 23 proposes to allow wetlands to be destroyed with so-called “offset” compensations.
The program to offset development pressures on wetlands that is being considered would require a net positive impact on wetlands. The language appears to contemplate that wetlands can be developed if a net positive impact is demonstrated. However, there is no mechanism to determine the ecological value of an existing wetland and its artificial construct, to arrive at a valid “net positive impact”. The notion of biological offsets is not based on science. It represents an arrogance of industry and their consultants.
Wetlands are complicated ecosystems that develop over long time periods. Experts within Ontario’s Conservation Authorities and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry have shown proven success protecting species habitats and recovering Species At Risk. They have worked to limit invasive species, re-introduced native species, installed flood, landslide and erosion infrastructure, etc. These Agencies perform crucial roles in ensuring the long-term sustainability of our ecosystems. They must be allowed to continue their work, even when their work is not always “popular” with citizens and developers. The greater long term ecological good must prevail over short-term shortsighted selfishness.
The Ontario government is using the housing crisis as an excuse to bulldoze our important lands and democratic rights. This is egregious. The fact that there are over 80,000 acres of planned, approved, zoned lands ready for development, but have been put on hold by developers, is scandalous. As Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report, we do not need to sacrifice environmental protection to address the housing crisis. That’s because “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem.” (p.10) There is a vast supply of land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries.
Developers must be required to build needed housing and employment facilities on already approved lands. Land banking by development and aggregate interests is not in the public interest. It actually prevents housing from being built, and results in higher housing costs.
The proposed omnibus Bill 23 and its associated policies and legislative changes are an extreme threat to our environment, our democratic society, and our economy.
In the face of unprecedented and accelerating biodiversity loss and the ever-worsening climate crisis, it is vital that your government do its utmost to protect the farmland, wetlands, forests, rivers, groundwater, and other natural areas that sustain us and all other living beings.
Bill 23 should be shelved, or substantively amended.
We urge you to:
1)	Withdraw all amendments likely to weaken the protection of Ontario’s natural heritage systems; and
2)	Retain and uphold the role of the public, MNRF bioogists, Conservation Authorities, and municipalities in environmental planning and decision-making.
Yours truly,
Roger Goulet and Sarah Harmer

I am strongly against the proposed revisions in the OWES because it will result in a major reduction of PSW wetlands, which are vital for flood control, and the preservation of many endangered species.
In southern Ontario, 85% of the wetlands have already been lost. Let's not take it further.
There is plenty of land available within built up areas and other lands where density can be increased, density that would support good public transit.
We could bury the power lines along the 407, opening up much needed land for housing.   We could convert some of the hundreds of small strip malls to multi-residential buildings, with a commercial ground floor and underground parking.
Please review all the options for housing. Get creative.

Wetlands are undeniably essential features to have on the landscape for the ecosystem services they provide to humans (which are valued at billions of dollars in Ontario), and their role in maintaining a functioning ecosystem and biodiversity. The purpose of the wetland evaluation system is meant to assess which of these wetlands hold exceptional value far as wetlands go (they are all valuable) and afford them the appropriate protections and consideration accordingly. As such this system of designation of provincially significant wetlands is extremely important to protecting a plethora of environmental, social and economic values in Ontario, values which enhance our quality of life enormously.

73046,/comment/73046,"During the past few months, I have had the privilege of not only studying wetlands and learning more about these essential and fascinating ecosystems, but visiting them in person. The peatlands that I've set foot in are like no other place I've been to - the ground is spongy and lush with Sphagnum mosses, the water that wells up through the peat smells acidic and crisp, and the plants that grow in these bogs and fens, like the pitcher plant, are beautiful and unique in both form and function. Visiting wetlands like these is becoming more difficult - in the present, less than 30% of Ontario's wetlands still exist, and encroaching development, the kind encouraged by the proposed changes to the Southern Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, sees what remains as nothing more than an obstacle standing in the way of continued sprawl.
I recently completed a project evaluating the Southern Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, and doing so has allowed me to better understand how the process works and its importance in guiding sustainable and holistic planning. In reading through the proposed changes to the evaluation system, several alterations gave me cause for concern:
- The removal of requiring more information to be gathered about rare species and hydrological functions in a wetland before deciding what adjacent land uses are appropriate
- The complete gutting of how evaluation results can be used, restricting the wetland evaluation system to be nothing more than a tool for municipal planning and undermining its roles in land use planning, conservation regulations, watershed planning, and the conservation and stewardship of fish, wildlife, land, and other natural resources
- The removal of any reference to wetland complexes, which have complex hydrological and biological functions - one part of a wetland complex cannot be affected without the others following suit (in fact, the very sections removed through the proposed updates explain why wetland complexes are so important!)
- The inability of a wetland evaluator to provide details on observed human disturbances, which, as stated, would be useful ""in the future to help set evaluation or enhancement priorities""
- The removal of references to specific sources that can help in finding ""popular articles and unpublished government reports"" to understand the research and studies within a wetland
- The removal of reference to understanding why and how wetland-dependent species may use upland habitats, which undervalues the scientific study of this topic
- The absolutely unacceptable removal of endangered/threatened species' reproductive, migratory, feeding, and hibernation habitat as a marker of wetland value and significance
- The removal of locally significant wetlands, which undercuts how ""all wetlands have value, both to society and intrinsically,"" and the removal of reference to how old wetland boundaries are to be used for planning until a new evaluation of these boundaries can take place
In a province where seven of our eight turtle species are at risk, where 68% of our wetlands were lost by the 1980s (mostly as the result of land conversion), where sparse suburb developments and car-dependent infrastructure spring up ad nauseam, the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System will not, and cannot, be the answer to the housing crisis. Though I have just one voice, there's no doubt in my mind that it joins a chorus of others in speaking for the lands, waters, plants, and animals, as well as social, cultural, emotional, mental, and spiritual values, that are threatened by what's been brought to the table here. A house is not inherently a home, and Ontario is not Ontario without its wetlands.

73048,/comment/73048,"Revised November 24, 2022
Proposed changes to Ontario Wetland Evaluation System are a dramatic shift away from historic wetland protection. Damage to wetlands is not easily reversible. I ask that the principle of wetland complexes be retained, that the scoring criteria be retained, and that an arms length adjudicating body be put in place in wetland classifications.
In Ontario, wetlands are very important for flood control, water filtering, and groundwater recharge and discharge. When there is a lot of rain or snowmelt, wetlands absorb and slow flood waters, helping to alleviate property damage and even save lives. In the face of climate change, these wetlands are ever more important as we experience more extreme storm events.
Wetlands are diverse and delicate ecosystems that provide important habitats for plants and animals. These include many familiar species, such as great blue herons, turtles, muskrats and beaver.
Currently, Ontario’s wetlands are scored for importance through the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. Wetlands that receive a higher score are considered provincially significant and are heavily protected. In the Nottawasaga watershed, for example, these include the Minesing Wetlands, Osprey Wetlands, Wasaga Beach Wetland Complex, Midhurst Wetland Complex, Silver Creek Wetlands and Copeland-Craighurst-Guthrie Complex.
The Ontario government's proposed changes to the evaluation system in support of Bill 23, the More Homes Built Faster Act, fail to recognize the importance of  the interdependence and
 interconnectedness of wetland bodies within a complex. Like any a complex organism, destroying its discreet components will significantly weaken the organism as a whole, with dire consequences.
In the proposed changes, some scoring criteria have been removed, yet wetlands must still meet the same score to be considered provincially significant. This makes it much harder for wetlands to reach provincially significant wetland status, meaning many have the potential to be slated for development.
Many wetlands in Ontario are grouped together in complexes — this includes wetlands big and small that are less than 750 metres apart. This is important for fish and wildlife that live in wetlands, as the entire complex makes up their habitat.
The proposed legislative changes will no longer allow wetlands to be grouped together, treating each wetland as its own entity. Smaller wetlands will most likely not meet the criteria to be provincially significant and may be open for development.
It is important for wetland evaluations to be reviewed by arm’s-length agencies with an objective view. The proposed legislation is not allowing the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry or conservation authorities to review wetland evaluations, leaving it to municipalities.
If municipalities are responsible for development, as well as preserving natural heritage like wetlands, where do they find the balance? Many wetlands cross municipal boundaries. How will the different municipalities determine the level of importance for the wetland?
Ontario has legislated habitat-protection laws for good reason. Since the 1970s, waterfowl populations have bounced back thanks to wetland protection. Species that did not enjoy the same habitat protection, such as grassland birds, have seen a significant decline within this same period.
How an important Orillia wetland was ruined.
Moreover, in the context of the climate emergency, with more frequent and severe weather events, flooding and erosion protection afforded by wetlands is more important than every. Yet these proposed changes will only reduce the increasingly important environmental services provided by wetland complexes.
It takes generations for wetlands to become viable, sustainable and ecological communities. The removal or damage to wetlands is not easily reversible, and many species may not be able to recover from this loss.
I urge the government to bolster protections of wetlands so that the new housing it plans to facilitate will be both protected from flooding and other hazards while fostering healthy communities that include respect for nature.

73053,/comment/73053,"Wetlands provide a myriad of ecosystem benefits and tools to mitigate impacts of natural hazards on communities across Ontario (e.g., flood attenuation, shoreline stabilization, drought control, etc.). While the OWES is the process for evaluating these features, the evaluations undertaken provide the information necessary to understand the roles these features play in the natural landscape and allow for an assessment to determine whether a wetland is provincially significant.
Prior to changing the OWES, a working group should be established to discuss and review any changes to ensure the evaluation system remains robust, comprehensive, accessible, and based on best-available science.
We have already lost so many of our historical wetland cover. Ontario cannot afford to lose more significant wetlands.

If the justification for streamlining this overhaul is to enable more land to be allocated to housing projects, this does not seem supported by data about our current housing land that is available - we should be building mixed density residential areas, not expanding urban sprawl into new areas. I am also concerned that responsibility for evaluating Ontario's wetlands will be downloaded to municipalities and proponents of housing projects should the MNRF remove itself from this process. Cities do not have the expertise to do this in a robust way (especially if they cannot work alongside conservation authorities) and it doesn't enable a watershed-scale perspective on the role of connected wetland complexes that span jurisdictions. Wetlands serve a critical ecological function, and I think this overhaul damages the safety and sustainability of our water resources for future generations.

Re proposed updates Ontario wetlands evaluation
This evaluation was specifically made for the purpose of protecting these wetlands for all of us, including those that are trying to destroy these wetlands.
Once the wetlands are destroyed they can not be retrieved.

73060,/comment/73060,"The overhauling of the Ontario Wetlands Evaluation cannot and must not result in very few wetlands deemed provincially significant.The wetlands we have now must be protected and so designated, especially those connected hydrologically. Further , species at risk must be recognized and  protected because they are of provincial significance.The evaluation process must have provincial government oversight to coordinate and approve evaluations and insure information about PSW is available to the public.
This government should know full well the importance of wetlands and protect them from development . Wetlands aid in filtering our water, help in flood control, provide habitat for a diversity of species including endangered species and are treasured green spaces to view and enjoy. They are  treasured  for our birds and birders . Wetlands  are becoming even more important as habitat because farmers are destroying their fence rows and hedgerows to make more arable and the contiguous habitat they would otherwise provide will be gone, putting an even greater burden will be on wetlands to provide habitat and animal and plant transportation corridors.
Further, has the government consulted with our First Nations regarding these changes?
Deregulating wetlands will surely be their demise. The cannot happen. No one should be building on wetlands for housing or otherwise. This is unstable land, a water source and necessary habitat. We know there are 86,500 acres outside of the Greenbelt and wetlands,  already zoned for development and enough for the next 30 years. To make wetlands buildable is very costly and unnecessary and a poor foundation for buildings.

You cannot buy more living wetlands later, once wildlife habitat has been paved over and its species have been literally doomed to extinction, to say nothing of the effects these changes can have on our climate. The short sightedness of the proposed plan reveals that our planet's destruction is being hastened in the service of the kind of 'progress' that got us into this mess in the first place.

73075,/comment/73075,"All wetlands provide ecological services that immeasurable value and not easily replaceable by any other ecosystem or any proposed restoration. In addition to providing unique habitats for native flora and fauna, including the at risk species swamp rose mallow, Blanding's turtle, and king rail waterbird, wetlands provide water and waste filtration, manage flooding and erosion, and are effective carbon sinks, trapping excess carbon from the atmosphere. By developing over these ecosystems, even parts of the ecosystem, such ecological functioning could be less effective or even compromised, resulting in later investment by municipal or provincial governments to compensate for the lack of natural functions, such as investment in infrastructure to manage flooding, expensive upgrades to building, continues projects to accommodate for climate change, etc. The very existence of wetlands are helpful in achieving our targets for climate action due to their climate regulation capabilities.
This proposal continues perpetuates the unsustainable approach for land use planning that has resulted in the staggering loss of ecological land in recent decades, the consequences of which we are well aware of, the decrease in native flora and fauna, decrease in air and water quality affecting human health, rise in invasive species, negative impacts on agriculture, etc. ""Streamlining"" or quickening the process of consultation and evaluation does not allow the proper time and consideration needed to evaluation such sensitive and significant ecosystems.
As opposed to pursuing polies and regulations that would address the root of the housing crisis or encouraging sustainable building approaches, such as multi-family homes on already available land, this proposal is specifically intending to ensure that designations around wetlands can be reduced in order to build onto current lands that are protected due to the wetland significance status. These ""duplicate"" regulations are in place to ensure that the proper measures are taken so that lands that provide such significant ecological service and unique habitats are not disrupted before their true ecological contributions can be understood. Such regulations exists for a reason, to protect these lands for often unaccountable development that does little to accommodate for the destruction of the ecosystems post development. Importantly, proposed ""restoration"" projects post development often do little to compensate for the actual loss of a wetland because we cannot simply ""recreate"" ecological function that often take hundreds or even thousands of years to establish and wildlife cannot simply move to another habitat once theirs is lost.
Affordable housing can be pursued, but it should not come at the expense of ecosystems that we know are of great ecological significance. Furthermore, opposing proposals such as these can help us begin to move away from shot term planning and invest in long term solutions that accommodate for the economic, social, and ecological well being of our communities.

73078,/comment/73078,"The Upper Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA) thanks the Province of Ontario for the opportunity to review the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetlands Evaluation System (OWES).
As of October 25, 2022, the Province has proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System 3rd Edition, Version 3.3 (2014) (ERO 019-6160) that will negatively impact the future of wetlands in Ontario. Throughout the document the proposed updates include significant removals and changes. The current updates use language that is vague and subjective, leaving an evaluation open for interpretation, which is to be submitted to a decision maker that may have predetermined conclusions.
The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System is a science-based system that outlines a process, and a set of criteria to define, identify, and assess the functions and values of wetlands in Ontario. The proposed changes are not science-based and are anticipated to result in a significant loss of wetlands in the Province of Ontario. It is recognized that some updating needs to occur, however; the complete removal of entire sections and scoring which are integral components of the evaluation will leave very little room for recognition of wetlands in Southern Ontario for the purposes of land-use planning or application of other wetland conservation policy.
Conservation Authorities rely on this proven scientific methodology as an aid in implementing regulations under the Conservation Authorities Act. This information is used for making decisions for the purposes of public safety, natural hazard prevention and management; regulate wetlands for flood attenuation, natural storage capacities and for preventing shoreline erosion. The Upper Thames River Conservation Authority has identified significant concerns with the following proposed changes to OWES which are summarized below:
1.	Wetland Complexing has been entirely removed from OWES. Upon re-evaluation, each wetland unit must qualify as significant individually. This is unacceptable as many wetlands within the urban and suburban landscape are composed of complexed wetlands consisting of separate individual units (e.g., discontinuous units in close proximity to one another but separated by roads). Together, the wetland complex meets the criteria to be identified as a PSW, but individually, the units may not themselves meet the score to be considered significant. This removal of complexing will result in individual wetland units within a complex being re-evaluated and found to no longer qualify as provincially significant and therefore developable. This is unacceptable as this will result in huge losses of wetlands across Ontario where wetland complexes exist.
2.	The determination of whether or not a wetland is provincially significant is no longer based on an OWES evaluation that has been approved by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF). It is simply based upon the “professional opinion” of a wetland evaluator who submits an evaluation, re-evaluation or mapping update to a “decision maker” (i.e., Planning Authority or Municipality). Without MNRF consultation and oversight in administering, reviewing, verifying or approving of the proper application of OWES, the system will no longer be a credible evaluation system. Without any oversight, it will be subject to abuse and this will result in many PSWs across Ontario being “re-evaluated” and scored as no longer provincially significant. This will in turn lead to the loss of these wetlands from the landscape.
3.	Reproductive Habitat and Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species sections and scoring has been entirely removed. Scoring was weighted to protect habitat. No consideration or scoring weight adjustments have been added for this section. The weighted scoring matrix no longer evaluates all criteria against weighted factors.
4.	The proposed changes indicate that wetland re-evaluations are ‘considered “complete” once it has been received by a decision maker’ and removes language requiring wetland records to be completed accurately and completely. The results of these changes mean that there will no longer be a standardized approach for wetland re-evaluations. All references to the Conservation Authorities Act, the Provincial Policy Statement and the Planning Act have been removed from this proposed update.
5.	It is unclear from the posting who will maintain an appropriate mapping inventory of wetland classifications, particularly non-Provincially Significant Wetlands. Conservation Authorities have been maintaining data inventories of wetlands for many years and would be well suited to takeover this role with respect to OWES evaluated wetland mapping. This information is vital for municipal decision-making and is well-suited to the CAs resource management agency role.
6.	The proposed changes remove language around Locally Important Wetlands (LSWs). These wetlands could be evaluated, partially evaluated or unevaluated. Sometimes they are known as non-PSWs, LSWs, or other wetlands. If these wetlands have been evaluated as non-PSWs, once a re-evaluation of these wetlands occurs, there is no mechanism to identify or preserve it. Therefore 100% of evaluated Non-PSWs could be removed from the landscape. Additionally, any wetlands that have been partially evaluated or unevaluated will also have the potential to 100% be removed from the environment.
The Upper Thames River watershed is located within the agricultural heartland of southwestern Ontario. It is 5,285 km² in area and more than half a million people reside in the watershed. From its headwaters near Tavistock, the river flows 279 km southwest before reaching its outlet into Lake St. Clair and, ultimately, into Lake Erie.  The watershed currently has approximately 4.6% wetland cover, and only about 1.6% is currently considered Provincially Significant Wetland. With the changes proposed to OWES, the percentage of PSW within our watershed would drop to 1.3% which equates to an approximately 20% reduction in area considered PSW.  It is significant to note that both the Sifton Bog and the Dingman Creek Fen Wetland Complex would both lose PSW status with the proposed changes, and bog and fen habitats are extremely rare in southern Ontario.
In the Federal Government document How Much Habitat is Enough?, it is recommended that at minimum, the greater of (a) 10% of each major watershed and 6% of each subwatershed, or (b) 40% of the historic watershed wetland coverage, should be protected and restored. Since we are below this threshold, we cannot afford to lose any of our existing wetlands, and removing scientifically-based criteria for evaluating the significance of wetlands, and the policies to protect the remaining wetlands on the landscape, puts our area at risk.
In the Federal Government document How Much Habitat is Enough?, it is recommended that at minimum, the greater of (a) 10% of each major watershed and 6% of each subwatershed, or (b) 40% of the historic watershed wetland coverage, should be protected and restored. Since we are below this threshold, we cannot afford to lose any of our existing wetlands, and removing scientifically-based criteria for evaluating the significance of wetlands, and the policies to protect the remaining wetlands on the landscape, puts our area at risk.
According to Ontario’s Wetland Conservation Strategy (2017), southwestern Ontario has already lost over 85% of historic wetland cover. Some of the recommended actions included in the strategy to combat wetland losses are:
•	Support the development of policy tools to improve the conservation of all wetlands, including provincially significant, coastal wetlands and other locally and regionally important wetlands.
•	Develop conservation approaches and policy tools to prevent the net loss of wetlands in Ontario, focusing on areas where wetland loss has been the greatest.
•	Review provincial laws, regulations and policies, with the goal of strengthening Ontario’s wetland policies.
•	Develop and ensure that adequate policy guidance is available on incorporating wetland protection strategies in local planning (e.g. natural heritage system planning, consideration of wetlands in the development of land use policies addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation and planning for natural hazard management).
The proposed changes to OWES appear to directly contradict what is recommended in the Province’s own strategy document for the protection and preservation of wetlands.
The Upper Thames River Conservation Authority has historical information pertaining to homes that have been built on existing wetland features. Those homes are now dealing with issues involving regularly flooded basements, cracked foundations, sump pump(s) continually running, black mold and reduced market value. Wetlands and their area of interference, whether they are provincially significant or locally significant, are irresponsible places to develop, and need to be protected.
The Upper Thames River Conservation Authority urges the Province to consider the following key recommendations:
•	Reconsider the proposed changes to the Wetland Evaluation System, and consult with CAs and other science-based organizations to quantify the impact of the proposed changes on the landscape. Maintaining wetlands on the landscape is a cost-effective measure to help combat the effects of climate change and the associated extreme weather events, in addition to safeguarding against the rapid loss of biodiversity.
•	Instead of eliminating the OWES complexing and scoring criteria, work with conservation experts such as CAs to amend the OWES criteria for complexing and scoring using a scientific approach.
•	Should the Province remove MNRF as the decision-maker, clearly identify who is responsible for determining if an OWES evaluation has been conducted properly. In the absence of MNRF, we recommend that CAs should be identified as the decision-maker to ensure that a consistent standard for OWES evaluations is maintained.
•	CAs should be tasked with maintaining the mapping of OWES evaluated wetlands for decision-makers.
In summary, unaccompanied by the multitude of other provincially proposed changes, the changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System will contribute to an extremely drastic reduction of wetlands in the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority’s watershed. Combine the OWES changes with the array of provincial government decisions that are currently anticipated, and it is highly likely that there will no longer be any wetlands left within the UTRCA’s watershed.
The documentation on the Environmental Registry notes that the anticipated impacts of the policy proposal on business are neutral to positive. In reality the impacts to the environmental features and their associated functions on a watershed scale (including water quality, flood attenuation, etc.) will be negative. With the removal of the Provincial level oversight of the evaluation or re-evaluation of significance of wetlands, there will be less certainty and clarity, and more potential for inconsistent application of the guidelines, and ultimately loss of more wetland features from the landscape.
We urge the Province to reconsider the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, and to consult with Conservation Authorities and other science-based organizations to quantify the impact of the proposed changes on the landscape. Maintaining wetlands on the landscape is a cost-effective measure to help combat the effects of climate change and the associated extreme weather events, in addition to safeguarding against the rapid loss of biodiversity.

The Upper Thames River Conservation Authority

I am writing to express my deep concern about proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.  I live and work in Norfolk County, in the heart of the Carolinian Zone, the location of Ontario’s first Priority Place for Conservation, home to many Provincially Significant Wetlands and large wetland complexes.  This County supports some of the highest biodiversity in Canada.  Our wetlands are very important to the health of many Species At Risk; they also support a wide range of recreation and tourism; they are an important natural water recharge and purification system, they support pollinators our extensive farms need, and they have an important place in the history and culture of Norfolk.
The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System is a very technical document, researched and written by wetland ecology experts with the MNRF. It helps protect some of our most fragile Species At Risk in Ontario, which require very specialized wetland habitat to survive.  We are facing ongoing and accelerating species extinction across Canada and around the world.  Our Species At Risk require habitat to breed in, live, and migrate.  Without wetlands to support these life stages, we risk losing many of these species forever.  Southern Ontario is within the Carolinian Zone of Canada, and has some of the highest biodiversity in Canada.  We need to be looking at ways to support this incredible natural heritage, not reasons to change areas which are not suitable for housing or any development in the first place, and which give us so many “ecosystem services” in return. I don’t understand why these changes are being made under the guise of assisting in the building of homes - good planning does not include intentionally developing wetlands.
The proposed changes that concern me include:
Seriously downgrading the evaluation of individual wetlands,
Removing local and traditional references and sources of species knowledge (a lot of naturalists are species experts by training or interest),
Removing the role of expert MNRF staff to help the Ontario Government and municipal/county governments to protect these very complex and important natural habitats.
Removing references to wetland complexes.  The science relating to the importance of wetland complexes hasn’t changed - why are these sections being deleted?
Here are some reasons why we should be maintaining and strengthening the current Wetland Evaluation System:
Wetlands are irreplaceable habitats, providing homes to Provincially and Federally Endangered and Threatened reptiles, amphibians, birds, insects (including pollinators) and plants. Wetland complexes are important for natural water control, and for the survival of species that use the entire complex. Our reptiles and amphibians in Ontario depend on wetlands for part or all of their life cycle.
 It is our responsibility, and by extension, yours, to be good land stewards of wildlife and plant life in wetlands, and not endanger the survival of several vulnerable species through poor planning or greed.
Wetlands sequester carbon, helping to mitigate climate change in the communities where they are located.
Wetlands buffer communities from flooding. They work with existing natural waterways, ponds and lakes to naturally control water in times of high rainfall and snow melt.
Wetlands are an important source of passive and active recreation.  Since the COVID pandemic, citizens of Ontario have realized how important natural areas are to their mental and physical health.  Naturalists, hunters, fishers, canoeists, kayakers, wild foragers, and artists all value wetlands for their constant source of inspiration, wildlife, and plant life.
These are the actions I am asking you to take, in the name of good science:
Withdraw the proposed amendments that change the nature and effectiveness of the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.
Simply make the “housekeeping” changes needed to keep up with correct current terminology and other minor edits. This does not include removing whole sections or changing the intention or effectiveness of the Wetlands Evaluation System.
Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force outlined in its 2022 report that we do not need to sacrifice environmental protection to address the housing crisis. That’s because “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem.” (p.10) There is a vast supply of land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries. You don’t need to weaken the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System in order to build houses, or for any other reasons.  Please make a commitment to protect our wetlands - we need them now and will need them more in the future.  For many of our Species At Risk, wetlands are already their homes.

73091,/comment/73091,"I am completely against the government's proposal to update the OWES.  While I can appreciate the need for more housing in the future, I think revising OWES as a way to avoid red tape and enable development in wetlands is extremely short-sighted and irresponsible.  I think there are other options to address the housing crisis.
Wetlands are critically important for mitigating flood risks, 'cleaning' overland flows, providing habitat for sensitive species and proving groundwater that feeds our streams and rivers.  Wetlands also contribute to our natural heritage systems that are important for maintaing mental and physical health.
Revisions to OWES including inability to complex wetlands and reduced scoring for sensitive species will result in wetland scores that fail to meet PSW level resulting in lack of protection.  Wetlands by nature are often individual pockets that act cumulatively to control hydrology in an area. The complexing is a critical piece of OWES that is based on science and should not be changed.
In the last few years Ontario has seen more and more examples of extreme flooding resulting in extensive property damage and billions of dollars in insurance claims...wetlands are needed to help reduce these impacts.  With the added frequency of climate-related hazards, wetlands are going to be needed more than ever.
Although planning process that prevent development in wetlands appear to be additional 'red tape' these processes are also in place to protect the home owners from potential flooding, flooded basements and unstable foundations.. .as they likely aren't aware that their house was built in or near where a wetland used to be.
MNRF and planning agencies should also have some way of reviewing an evaluation and ensuring that it was done correctly and only by certified evaluators.
OWES and the planning process around wetlands should not be changed.

73096,/comment/73096,"In reviewing the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, I was deeply concerned by the removal of numerous passages in the draft. Specifically, I am troubled by:
- The removal of all mention of Conservation Authorities and working with such authorities in assessing wetlands. Local authorities would, by definition, have a better understanding of local water systems; information that would be useful in evaluating wetlands.
- The removal of re-evaluation criteria when new surveys are conducted near, or overlapping with older evaluations. As the draft itself notes, wetlands are constantly changing. Re-evaluation should be a normal procedure to reflect this fact.
-The removal of contact with other agencies as a normal part of the evaluation process. Specialized agencies and the information they can provide would only enhance the quality of a wetland evaluation. to limit consultation with such specialized bodies is to degrade the work carried out under the OWES.
- The removal of all reference to wetland complexes. Water systems are, by nature, complex. It is logical that wetlands should be considered part of the wider complexes they form, particularly as changes in one part will affect a whole system. The removal of wetland complexes as a term in the draft suggests that the new version will promote the piecemeal evaluation of wetlands without considering them in their proper context, and thus allowing the gradual dismantling of larger (and thus more ecologically important) wetland complexed.
- The removal of assessment criteria for ""Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species,"" as well as for ""Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species."" Are these species no longer a concern of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry? As these species rely on wetlands, including these considerations in the assessment criteria is vital.
- The removal of locally important wetlands from the assessment terminology. Much like the removal of local conservation authorities and wetland complexes, this omission seems to strip wetlands of their immediate context. A wetland in isolation from a complex, is just as misunderstood as a wetland divorced from its local importance.
Ultimately, these removals paint a picture of an evaluation criteria that has been significantly undermined. Local consultation and relevance has been removed. Consultation with other agencies or the consideration of migratory species has been removed. The context of complexes or local dynamics have been removed, as has the possibility of accounting for change over time. All of these omissions serve to limit the data available in the Wetland Evaluation System. It seems likely that these omissions will result in wetlands with far lower OWES scores than they would receive under the original criteria, and thus, far fewer ""significant"" wetlands to conserve. What is the purpose of such evaluation criteria, if it is designed to be ineffectual?

The more they are developed and destroyed, the more we need built storm-water infrastructure, which is costly, not as reliable, and does not come with the biodiversity and carbon sink benefits of protecting existing quality habitat.

73101,/comment/73101,"Dear ERO official,
I am an ecologist, a naturalist and a resident of both southern and northern Ontario for nearly 50 years.  I have spent much time throughout my life visiting wetlands for both work and recreation and I have great respect for their beauty, their bounty of biodiversity and for all the ecosystem services they provide for humans and wildlife alike.  I have also lived and worked in the ""Greater Golden Horseshoe"" area and have witnessed first-hand the negative impacts of urban sprawl on southern Ontario's precious wetlands.  I am concerned that the proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES), ERO 019-6160, will result in loss of protection for wetlands, thereby furthering the degradation and/or loss of these vital natural areas by opening them up for development.  I know that we do not need to open up wetlands for development to solve Ontario's housing supply crisis - according to the 2022 report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force, a shortage of land isn't the cause of the problem. Furthermore, filling in wetlands for development is costly to undertake and results in many more long-term costs for immediate neighborhoods by reducing flood control and water purification.  With the notable increase in severe weather events, we must ensure that these natural buffer areas are protected, for everyone's sake. There are other solutions to helping solve Ontario housing crisis.
My biggest concerns with the proposed updates to the OWES are:
- The apparent removal of the MNRF from the evaluation and approval process.  MNRF has subject-matter experts that can provide valuable unbiased support to an evaluator, and it will be difficult to access support like this elsewhere.  Also, without MNRF overseeing evaluations, what will be the process to verify information and approve evaluations?  Although all evaluators are trained at performing wetland evaluations, there should be an objective process for approving scores and designations without the bias that could (intentionally or unintentionally) be introduced by consultants and decision-makers with a vested interest in a specific wetland's final designation.
- The lack of clarity regarding who the decision-makers are that will receive and act upon completed evaluations.
- The apparent lack of any process (whether by MNRF or another group) to review, verify and approve completed evaluations.
- The removal of the consideration of Wetland Complexes from the evaluation system, thus allowing individual wetlands within a complex to be re-evaluated and potentially considered no longer significant.  This idea conflicts with the concept (described in the Southern Manual pages 39-41, but slated for removal) that ""Wetland complexes are commonly related in a functional way, that is, as a group they tend to have similar or complementary biological, social and/or hydrological function. Much of the wildlife in the area of the complex is variously dependent upon the presence of the entire complex of wetlands, with each wetland unit contributing to the whole"".  I don't believe the science on this has changed, so I believe this proposed change will endanger critical wetland systems along with all the functions they provide.
- The removal of any scoring to be applied for identified habitat for Endangered and Threatened species.  Many of southern Ontario's wetlands support important (and in some cases the only) habitat for these species at risk of extirpation or extinction and they should be recognized (and scored accordingly) for this critical role they play.  We are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis and any actions that make our rare species more vulnerable to loss cannot be tolerated.
Please consider the wide-reaching long-term ecological, financial and social implications of these proposed changes.  Wetlands contribute billions of dollars in economic benefits to Ontario each year; they are more valuable to our overall economy when left alone versus when they are filled in and developed.  It does not seem prudent to spend time (and money) re-evaluating wetlands to see which ones can be destroyed for development under these new rules.  Keep the existing protections in place, as they are there for good reasons.  Look within our existing serviced urban land areas for property to support more housing.
Thank-you for your time and consideration.

73104,/comment/73104,"The stated purpose of the proposed OWES overhaul is to support the construction of 1.5 million new housing units over the next ten years by streamlining the wetland evaluation process. This purpose is misguided and misleading, given that a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the housing shortage, as Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report. The amount of greenfield land already designated for development and added to municipal settlement boundaries, but still sitting unbuilt far exceeds what is needed to meet long range housing targets.
Bill 23, the “More Homes Built Faster Act” will not create affordable housing. It will create sprawl. It will facilitate the destruction of wetlands, worsen climate change, and endanger biodiversity. It will put people and property at greater risk from flooding and pollution.
Naturally existing wetlands help prevent flooding, purify water, recharge aquifers, support endangered species and trap and store carbon. Wetlands provide these ecosystem services for free, and when we build on wetlands, we put people and property at risk. Taxpayers and homeowners have to pay more. This makes housing less affordable, not more.
Bill 23 proposes to allow more wetlands to be destroyed with so-called “offsets.” Recent research has revealed that even the most rigorous and well-established wetland offsetting programs (i.e., the United States’ wetland offsetting under the Clean Water Act) have been unsuccessful in achieving no net loss. Wetlands are complicated ecosystems that take decades to centuries to develop. Most ""restored"" wetlands never reach the biodiversity of natural ones, and most species at risk can’t just move.
The attached scientific paper demonstrates how the water filtration services of *existing* wetlands in Southern Ontario is worth billions of dollars. Attempting to build offsets will cost the province billions more. This is on top of additional billions of dollars in services gained from climate mitigation, biodiversity, recreational activities, etc.
For the overall well-being and safety of Ontarians, please do not move forward with this proposal.

As it stands the OWES should not be modified prior to convening a working group of all those involved in the implantation and administration of the OWES including municipalities, conservation authorities, NGO’s, Indigenous Communities, academia and government agencies.
Since industrialization, Ontario has lost the majority of wetlands due to development. Now we are at a time where we understand that wetlands are an integral part of a healthy ecosystem (and let’s not forget that humans are part of this same ecosystem and depend on it completely) amongst many things wetlands filter and purify water, sequester carbon dioxide, provide habitat for many species including species deemed at risk, attenuate flood waters, recharge and discharge groundwater and stabilize shoreline.
The proposed changes to the OWES seem to clear a pathway for wetland fragmentation and destruction. Particularly concerning is the reevaluation and removal of wetland complexing, removal of scoring for endangered and threatened species and the removal of reference to locally important wetlands. In addition changes seem to remove any oversight for the use of the tool.
Globally and locally we are in a climate crisis where effects on our communities are becoming more extreme and damaging.  Now is the time to enhance and create a robust evaluation tool based on sound science and good consultation,  which further advances wetland protection and preservation.

73110,/comment/73110,"There is no question Ontario is experiencing a housing crisis. Urgent action is required to provide more housing but there is no need to do so in the manner proposed by Bill 23 the More Homes Built Faster Act. Bill 23 is an attack on the environment, on existing environmental safeguards, and an affront to citizens’ right to participate in planning decisions in their own municipality. Under cover of addressing a truly pressing need, this Bill instead profoundly threatens Ontario’s wetlands, watersheds, and our already-dwindling supply of farmland. The timing of this Bill is dire. Since 1971, the world has lost fully one half of all species and wildlife habitat. This figure should terrify us. The upcoming COP15 in Montreal is urgently addressing this situation.  The climate crisis is here – flooding and drought already breaking records. Rather than threatening the environment, this government ought to be increasing our climate crisis preparations, it ought to be working to protect species and habitat loss. It ought to be responsive to its citizens facing a cost of living and housing emergency. Instead the Bill makes all of these things profoundly worse-off.
Housing in Ontario is in a crisis, and this Bill and its provisions miss the opportunity to address a truly pressing problem while causing profound harm elsewhere. Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force stated in its Report that the housing crisis is best addressed, in part, by increased density. And that while there is a dwindling supply of farmland, there is no shortage of land for development, both within built up areas and in places beyond the Greenbelt.
By making Greenbelt lands newly available to development, despite this government’s promise not to, this Bill does not address the crisis faced by Ontarians, but serves instead to profit a select group of developers. How will municipalities be able to deny any other developers to build inside the Greenbelt and extend the harm? This question does not seem to concern this government. It should.
In what can only be seen as an effort of divide and conquer, with changes to the Planning Act and the gutting of Conservation Authority’s  function, citizens of this province and their municipalities will be powerless to protect its wetlands, watersheds, farmlands and municipal planning functions from any developers who have no intention to avoid environmental harm.
The bill proposes to change the function of the Conservation Authorities
- they cannot enter into an MOU with municipalities
- they are directed to review their land holdings for surrender to developers for development
This drastic reduction of the CA’s function will remove municipalities’ ability to assess the environmental impact of development proposals before them.
The Bill proposes to change the Ontario Wetlands Evaluation System (OWES) and to alter the Provincial Policy Statement to remove from it consideration of natural heritage systems and protecting habitats found in wetlands and woodlands. As a result, existing protected wetlands will lose their protected status. The possibility of designating new provincially significant wetland protections will be practically zero. The species at risk that would otherwise be included as part of the environmental evaluation process will lose their protection as the provincially significant wetlands will no longer be required to be considered for development application approvals. Ontario will no longer have any meaningful oversight to ensure the public are notified and kept informed about the protection of wetlands under the application and approvals processes.
Wetlands must be protected, not removed because of the critically important services they provide:
-wetlands provide habitat in the face of catastrophic habitat and species loss experienced globally and in Ontario
-wetlands play a critical role in flooding control at a time when municipalities are already dealing with increased instances of flooding due to the climate emergency
- wetlands play a vital role in regulating the quality of water in the local watershed
The loss of wetlands will mean taxpayers will have to pay for water quality and flood management services that are currently performed free by wetlands
The Bill proposes to “offset” the wetlands lost to development by creating new wetland areas elsewhere. This proposal is preposterous on its face. If the wetlands could be sited someplace better, there would already be a wetland over there at that superior site. Why take away a successful habitat if your stated intention is to create successful habitat? Leave it where it is.
The bill proposes changes to the Ontario Planning Act which represent a serious affront to democratic participation of citizens in their municipal government:
- the public will no longer be required to be informed of proposed development plans
- the public will no longer have the right to appeal municipal planning decisions
- the Minister would be given increased powers to unilaterally override the municipal planning decisions and thereby leave the public with zero say in developments in their own municipality
- the planning power of entire regions is to be removed, to be devolved to lower-tier municipalities. These are: Halton, York, Peel, Durham, Simcoe, Niagara and Waterloo. This move would gut the effectiveness and coordination of planning across regions particularly in the Golden Horseshoe, leaving farmland, Greenbelt, watersheds, wetlands, and wildlife habitat open to piecemeal development without due consideration of the overall holistic health of these region-wide systems.

73112,/comment/73112,"ERO 019-6160 Comments re Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
General Observations:
The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) is one of many tools that are used to help to make Ontario livable. Wetlands provide vital recreation opportunities, employment, protection and filtration of potable water, act as carbon sinks with their abundant vegetation, provide erosion control, do nutrient cycling, recharge groundwater, conserve the flora and fauna that cannot speak for themselves, and are environments for our future citizens to enjoy.
It is sobering to note that Ontario has lost about 70% of its wetlands in the last 100 years and 20% of Ontario’s Species At Risk survive on those same lands. OWES has and is a vital tool to use for reserving, conserving, and preserving Ontario’s remaining wetlands.
Here’s what will happen if the vital tool of the OWES is altered to suit outside interests:
1) Under the proposal, significantly changing the OWES for Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSW) means that in near future very few wetlands will be designated as provincially significant;
2) Therefore, many of the present PSWs might lose their protective designation potentially exacerbating the already great loss of this landform;
3) No recognition or consideration of wetland complexes (i.e., wetlands that are connected hydrologically) a benchmark by which many wetlands - especially small ones - are determined to be provincially significant;
4) Wetland boundaries can be arbitrarily remapped without having to re-evaluate the whole wetland;
5) No recognition of Species At Risk in the evaluation process, a benchmark which is currently a key reason in the determination of provincial significance;
6) Removal of provincial government oversight of the evaluation process, with no central agency assigned to actually coordinate, approve evaluations, and ensure that information about PSW designation is publicly available.
Here are some recommendations:
a) The OWES must be left as is to help in the designation of wetland types in Ontario;
b) Use OWES in its present form as a useful tool to help Ontario to adapt to Climate Change
and its effects;
c) The government must be responsible to the people of Ontario – not outside interests. Hence, it can ensure that the province’s wetlands are properly evaluated by the OWES.
d) It must be remembered that there are many types of wetlands. Some wetlands exist as part of a complex, some in conjunction with rivers and lakes, and some by themselves. One cannot simply call them all “wetlands”. There are wetlands and wetland complexes.
e) No size limit should be put on wetlands.
f) Wetlands that are left in Ontario, provide vital environments for Species At Risk.  So, they must not be altered in any way. You cannot just recreate a wetland that has taken hundreds or thousands of years to develop. Wetlands MUST be left as they are without the interference of humans.
g) Consultation with Indigenous Peoples is not apparent in this process. These Peoples have a knowledge base dating back more than 50 000 years to before they came to North America from Asia via the Bering Strait. Their view of the environment is valuable. They can provide insight into how wetlands can be protected.
Conclusion:
I see no reason to alter the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System. It is not an impediment to the building of residential infrastructure. The desire to alter large portions of OWES is an expedient to cater to outside interests which do not have the welfare of ALL Ontario citizens at heart. As a reminder, it is the responsibility of the provincial government to represent the people of Ontario and not outside interests. OWES is a fine tool, AS IS, to be used to reserve, conserve, and preserve the Wetlands of the province of Ontario now and into the future.
Thank you for the opportunity to express these thoughts.

To this day, Indigenous peoples have always and continue to hold respect, love and gratitude for all of creation.  We are all interconnected and must consider our human impacts upon all of our relations now and seven generations ahead.  Water is life. All living beings need clean healthy waters to survive and thrive. We have teachings about the waters and the responsibilities of being in a respectful and reciprocal relationship with all kin.  Mother Earth continues to be greatly harmed by colonial and capitalist systems. Reparations and ""reconciliACTION"" also needs to happen with the lands, waters, and all beings.  It is time to think of our future instead of economic development.  These wetlands are priceless.  All species of turtles in Ontario are at risk.  This will destroy their habitant and will have devastating impacts as we are all interconnected to one another.
Development upon wetlands will increase risks of floods especially as the climate crisis worsens.  What happened in BC in 2021 is a perfect example.  That area was a lake that was drained and is now prone to flooding.
When will people realized the consequences of their actions?  Probably when it's too late.  Indigenous peoples are less than 5% of the world's population yet protect 80% of the world's biodiversity by being in relationship with the Earth.
It is important to remember these are Indigenous lands.  Consultation and collaboration with Indigenous peoples is an important step in reconciliation.

Is this our legacy?)  …future generations deserve and the people of Ontario deserve the right to visit wetlands to have wetlands protecting us for free , to see species they would not see otherwise …what child doesn’t delight in seeing a turtle basking in the sun or see a frog jumping across a lily pad or tree branch…children and everyone of all ages deserve have the constitutional right to be able to see this …
Wetlands are priceless , provide priceless protection ..offer priceless enjoyment and beauty and it’s not just my feelings it’s also based on science and facts …trillions of dollars would not replace what wetlands give what nature gives ….please leave the wetland evaluation system alone not only for the species that call it home or use it during migration but for future generations..for your children , for your nieces nephews cousins grandchildren ..friends … what do you want to be remembered as ? The ones who destroyed or the ones who were heroes/had the intelligence and character to be real leaders  … if you don’t care about any of that then do you want to be re-elected at all?  Destroying wetlands costs more money, and our health and during this climate crisis the planet is in I thought being a so called global leaders we should be saving that which saves us for free.
Please look inward and do the right thing. You will be remembered with honour. Thank you.

73124,/comment/73124,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposal. I have serious concerns about the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System and the impact these changes will have on the wetlands Ontarians depend on. I have reviewed the comments prepared by the Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA) and supporter them completely. The proposed changes to the OWES will have negative effects on natural habitats, wildlife, species at risk and the human communities that depend on the ecosystem services provided by wetlands such as flood prevention, carbon sequestration, water filtration and more. As we face a climate emergency, conserving wetlands is one of the most important actions we can take. At a time when we need nature the most, this proposal is opening up lands we depend on for safety and security to destruction and conversion to other land uses. Ontario has lost many wetlands, particularly in southern Ontario (""Approximately 70 per cent of wetlands have been lost in southern areas of Canada—and up to 95 per cent in densely populated areas."" Ducks Unlimited, https://www.ducks.ca/stories/wetlands/whats-happening-to-canadas-vanish…). We cannot afford to lose any wetlands and maintaining their status as Provincially Significant helps protect them from those losses.
Please follow the recommendations provided by CELA:
RECOMMENDATION NO. 1: CELA recommends that MNRF apply an equity lens when updating the OWES.
RECOMMENDATION NO. 2: Sections of the OWES dealing with wetland complexes should not be removed.
RECOMMENDATION NO. 3: Sections of the OWES which provide for consideration of reproductive habitat and migration, feeding or hibernation habitat for an endangered or threatened species during the evaluation of a wetland should not be removed.
RECOMMENDATION NO. 4: The Ministry should remain the approval authority for all wetland evaluations completed under the OWES.
RECOMMENDATION NO. 5: The section of the OWES dealing with “locally important wetlands” should not be removed.
As a private landowner with a provincially significant wetland, I am opposed to these changes that may affect the designation of wetlands in my care and all wetlands across Ontario. Please consider the next generations of Ontarians who need these lands to remain conserved so they can have a vibrant, healthy, productive life in Ontario. Do not borrow from the future for short terms gains right now.
Thank you.

73127,/comment/73127,"Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES)
Environmental Registry Posting 019-6160
In reviewing the proposed revisions to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES), I observe that while review of and updates to OWES to stay relatively current with current modern inventory data and scientific analysis is appropriate, those submitted to date with this proposal are largely retrograde.
The removal of MNRF from the administrative and oversight role, positing replacement with local decision makers (e.g. municipalities - page 3) results in the partitioning of administration across political rather than hydrological or watershed boundaries that typify the scope and scale of regional watershed and wetland function and analysis. That the OWES was developed to serve (in part) the needs of the land-use planning process is accurate: reframing this as being generally implemented by municipalities is disingenuous by not providing the context that this is facilitated across lower and upper tier municipal boundaries by Conservation Authorities, who serve to coordinate the feature-based management of the resources across the physiographically arbitrary political boundaries. This focus on municipal management of wetlands is reiterated by the removal of mention of other users of this system such as MNRF and Conservation Authorities, which is both inaccurate and an error (or otherwise) of omission. The partitioning of administration across political boundaries has the potential to result in inconsistent practice between decision-makers (e.g. municipalities), and poor
coordination of management of shared wetlands between neighbouring decision-makers (e.g. municipalities). There are further implications of this decentralizing of wetland administration, with implicit separate data-sets and reports managed by individual decision-making bodies, and not centralized and coordinated from both the data and resource management perspectives.
The removal of MNRF from the review of, and potential assistance with, wetland evaluations is problematic. The result of the removal of regulatory review without replacement by another form of review by subject matter experts, either an approval authority or peer reviews, is predictable and demonstrated in areas where such regulation has been downloaded to non-specialists or subject to self-regulation, like water quality. Given that the primary lesson (reduction in standards of work and conservation outcomes) has been repeatedly learned by the Province in recent decades, it appears that the secondary lesson acquired in these experiences is being applied, and the reduction in standards of work and conservation outcomes is the desired result. The lack of review for such wetland work is confirmed by the assertion that an evaluation, re-evaluation or mapping is considered complete once it has been received (and not reviewed or approved) by a decision maker. This direction is reinforced by the removal of criteria used to identify a wetland file evaluation as being complete, the provision of detailed primary and secondary information sources, and instructions on completing and evaluating wetland scores.
On the reevaluation of wetlands, there is some rationale for their scoping to portions of wetland complexes where warranted by the rationale of project or impact scale. However, there is misunderstanding evident in the ""point of time"" perspective ascribed to such evaluations or reevaluations, as performing due-diligence in these analyses and evaluations encompasses prior conditions, and a span of time gathering data for the re-evaluation, to place the most recent data
in temporal context and provide for interpretation and trend analysis. Point in time evaluations without considering contextual data are facile.
The removal of the definition of ""wetland complex"" is almost matched the nearly complete expunging of the term throughout the document. If this concept is to be denied in this new guidance, either the term should be expunged wholly, along with the definition, or the definition and use of the term in the document should remain. As it is with the proposed draft, without a definition the reader is left to wonder what the term ""wetland complex"" means where it remains used in this draft document, and by way of search engines can determine that it is a real thing. If the intent is to deny the existence and role of a ""wetland complex"", better to remove the term from this document altogether: I would not advise
this, and would suggest re-incorporation of much of the material dealing with this topic (including the definition) to provide for a more complete and defensible wetland evaluation terminology, if not standards, guidance or quality control (see above). Along these lines, it woudl be enlightening to have a rationale for the removal of guidance and standards for data collection and documentation on endangered or threatened species (SAR), other than the removal of MNRF as a source for data and background information and agency report to. Arguments for the removal of the sections identifying and describing locally important wetlands (as distinct from provincially significant ones) and planning boundaries (particularly as may be used by municipalities as, presumably, decision-makers) are not provided.
In closing, it seems appropriate that, as detailed on page 62 (re: appendix I), the note that revisions to the manuals are periodically necessary to reflect advances in science has been removed, which appears to reflect the new approach to this OWES guidance material. It would be useful to provide a replacement rationale supporting this proposed amendment, and presumably subsequent ones, where the argument for updates is found outside of scientific advances.

73128,/comment/73128,"The proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) indicates that a Provincially Significant Wetland (PSW) under these amendments must achieve the same score. The scoring system of the OWES system is a science based ranking system that considers different values and their respective functions. However, this proposal removes the considerations that often designate as a wetland as significant. Southern Ontario more specifically than other parts of Ontario has contributed to the loss of wetlands over the past century and has not entirely considered the ecological services that these wetlands provide. Municipalities in the GTA are constantly measuring natural hazard risks and assessing costly solutions for them - as public safety is a clear and sound priority. The increasing risk of natural hazards should include utilizing these natural wetlands in compliment to the risk management solutions.
It is important for wetland evaluations to be reviewed by arm's length agencies with an objective view. The proposed legislation is not allowing the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry or conservation authorities to review wetland evaluations, leaving this responsibility to municipalities. By removing aspects of the current scoring system of OWES, this means that the organizations that have decades of specialized in reviewing and conducting these evaluations will be removed. Assigning this responsibility to municipalities introduces further risks.
If municipalities are responsible for development, as well as preserving natural heritage like wetlands, where do they find the balance? Many wetlands cross municipal boundaries. How will the different municipalities determine the level of importance for the wetland?
Ontario has legislated habitat protection laws for good reason. Since the 1970s, waterfowl populations have bounced back thanks to wetland protection. Species that did not enjoy the same habitat protection, such as grassland birds, have seen a significant decline within this same time period.
Many wetlands in Ontario are grouped together in complexes – this includes wetlands big and small that are less than 750 metres apart. This is important for fish and wildlife that live in wetlands, as the entire complex makes up their habitat. There is also plenty of benefits to humans, the existing catchment area, and the adjacent watershed.
The proposed legislation changes will no longer allow wetlands to be grouped together, treating each wetland as its own entity. Smaller wetlands will most likely not meet the criteria to be provincially significant and may be open for development. Offsetting is not the solution, the natural functions of wetlands, more specifically Provincially Significant Wetlands cannot be replicated.
Additionally, purpose of the proposed OWES changes are to support the construction of 1.5 million new housing units over the next ten years by streamlining the wetland evaluation process. Yet, this purpose is misguided and misleading, given that a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the housing shortage, as Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report. It is unclear that this explanation has not been emphasized enough given that the amount of greenfield land already designated for development and added to municipal settlement boundaries, but still sitting unbuilt far exceeds what is needed to meet long range housing targets. That includes, for example, more than 86,000 acres within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area alone.
It appears that approval authority will be downloaded to municipalities, many of which have little expertise and would no longer be able to consult with conservation authorities (due to proposed Bill 23 amendments to the Conservation Authorities Act). Instead, the onus would be on the wetland evaluator (working in most cases for the development proponent) to inform the municipality and landowners in writing about the outcome of the evaluation or re-evaluation.
MNRF would:
Be unaware of wetland evaluations and outcomes
No longer ensure wetland evaluations were accessible to the public through Land Information Ontario
Have no authority to intervene on behalf of the public regarding an evaluation of questionable merit
The proposed changes to the OWES are going forward at the same time as Bill 23 and other proposed law and policy amendments that will negatively impact wetland conservation in Ontario. The broad scope of the proposals and the speed with which they are being pushed forward severely compromises the public’s ability to comprehend and respond.
I am urging the consideration and consultation of the public. It is agreeable that more homes are needed to be built to solve current housing issues and population growth. However, the potential fragmentation, removal and proposal to offset wetlands as needed neglects not only the environment and human safety but also removes the recreational and scientific uses of these complex systems. The pandemic has shown that there is a great desire to increase current greenspace and has generated interest in the natural beauty of Ontario.

73129,/comment/73129,"I am urging the Ontario Government to remove all proposed amendments to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.
These amendments, in the future, will ensure that only a few wetlands in Ontario will be classified as provincially significant and thus protected from development. These amendments could also be used to remove the provincially significant designation of wetlands that currently are protected.
Wetland complexes must continue to be recognized and considered for provincially significant designation. Species at risk must still be considered in the evaluation process for determining provincially significant wetlands. The provincial government must maintain oversight of the evaluation process for determining provincially significant wetlands.
Wetlands provide important ecosystem services and are vital for the future.

73130,/comment/73130,"I am strongly opposed to the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.  I view them as reckless with regard to human life and property, and showing wilful disregard for the needs of other life forms, particularly those already identified as species at risk. Humanity as a whole is the poorer when a species is lost in Ontario or, worse, is lost to the world through extinction.
I believe the proposed changes will diminish wetlands across Ontario by:
-	reducing or eliminating the role of MNRF and the conservation authorities in oversight and tracking of wetland evaluations
-	no longer recognizing wetland complexing
-	no longer recognizing species at risk in the evaluation process
-	downgrading locally significant wetlands
I do not believe the changes will assist in the construction of affordable housing close to infrastructure and accessible to public transportation.
I believe wetlands are critically important to the natural world, of which we are part and to which we owe a duty of stewardship - to migrating birds that cross the continent, to rare plants that are not able to move when habitat is lost or degraded, to our children and grandchildren and future generations that will not enjoy our unique Ontario natural heritage.
The proposed update notes that the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System has been in place since 1983. The implication is that this is an outdated document. There's no mention of updates by MNR's Wetland Evaluation Technical Team and its Biodiversity Policy Section in 1993/1994, 2002, 2008 and 2013. It is certainly incumbent on the government to keep OWES current and living. But the proposed changes will ensure it becomes increasingly detached from reality and science.
The alleged reason for the changes is to
-	provide greater certainty and clarity related to how significant wetlands are assessed and identified
-	allow for further streamlining of development decisions by removing the requirement for the ministry to review and confirm wetland evaluation results
Both of these reasons are spurious.
The system envisaged by the government provides less clarity, because decisions are being downloaded to municipalities while denying them the expertise of presently available from MNRF and Conservation Authorities. They will have to hire consultants at their own cost or will have to rely on the expertise of evaluators hired by development proponents, which will clearly not be independent, as is the case with MNRF and the CAs.
The idea that a decision to allow development in or near a wetland should be streamlined is alarming. Wetlands are dynamic places, the dangers they present to human occupation are many, it’s important that maximum expertise be brought to the decision-making process. There are areas of Simcoe County where insufficient caution has been exercised and residents of recently built housing struggle with flooding basements and mould. That will become more common with these irresponsible policy changes.
I oppose the practice of offsetting – there is no evidence that this is a successful strategy.
The OWES manual describes MNRF as the steward of Ontario’s natural resources, with duties that include protection and sustainable management of wetlands. Yet these changes REMOVE MNRF from that responsibility, REMOVE it from a role of oversight, and REMOVE it as a source of data. That is insane.
Species at risk – both fauna and flora are of major importance to me, and we know that wetlands are productive and essential sources of biodiversity. Their role in migration is crucial. Unfortunately the time allowed for comment does not permit me to carefully evaluate the consequences of the changes being proposed.
But I am extremely concerned. How can 30 days of public comment be sufficient for a decision of this importance? I note that the deadline for comment on a number of proposals in the Bill 23 package were extended as late as YESTERDAY, the day before the due date for comment – but not on this one, arguably the one with the longest-lasting impact on the future of our province.

73133,/comment/73133,"Three things concern me very much about the proposed changes.
1. Lack of control over the quality of wetland evaluations.
2. Loss of ecosystems, populations and economies. Provincially significant wetlands will be broken into such tiny pieces that they can no longer be protected under the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.
3. Loss of information and knowledge about wetlands.
1.  The proposed changes will  result in poor quality, even sham, wetland evaluations.
Your stated purpose in updating the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System is to ""make changes to better recognize the professional opinion of wetland evaluators and the role of local decision makers (e.g. municipalities)""
Yet, nowhere do you explain who can claim to be a ""professional"" wetland evaluator.  At the very least the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System should establish criteria for determining when and why the ""professional opinion"" of self-described wetland evaluators deserves to be ""better recognized"".
OWES needs to make it clear to the public that the wetland evaluator whose professional opinion the public is being asked to respect deserves that respect.  As the proposal stands, I could claim to be a professional wetland evaluator, even though I have never studied ecology, biology or indeed any scientific subject!!
This glaring omission is compounded by removing all effective oversight or review of the wetland evaluator's professional opinion.  The proposed changes remove oversight by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and by Conservation Authorities and leave oversight entirely up to municipalities, which may, or may not, but most likely will not, have any staff with knowledge of wetlands and wetland evaluation.  Many municipalities, especially smaller municipalities, are unlikely to have any staff with any scientific knowledge or background.   And even if the snow plow operator once studied ecology in high school or university, there is nothing to suggest the municipality would or should ask her advice rather than relying on the municipality's planning director who rigorously avoided science throughout her entire post-secondary education and career.
It is a mistake to remove oversight and review of wetland evaluations by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and by Conservation Authorities, as these organizations have, at least currently, knowledgeable staff who could effectively review the wetland evaluator's reports.
The public needs to be assured that wetland evaluations are legitimate and done in good faith, that property owners and developers are not hiring charlatans.
The public needs to be assured that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, as ""steward of Ontario’s natural resources"" is taking seriously its mandate of ""the protection and sustainable
management of the province’s natural heritage features, including wetlands.""
The public might be partially reassured if the professional, educational, experience and/or accreditation requirements of ""professional wetland evaluators"" were included in the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES).
But better than simply stating qualifications -- which can document what people studied, vs what they actually learned --  OWES should call for a review of wetland evaluations by knowledgeable entities, such as Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry staff, and Conservation Authorities staff.  Though here too, there needs to be some requirement that the review is done by appropriate and knowledgeable staff.  (I am thinking of a situation where Conservation Authorities, for example, lay off all their wetland experts due to provincial government cutbacks, and the financial comptroller, say, ends up doing the review of the wetland evaluation.  This would tick off the box of ""review by Conservation Authority"" but would certainly not fulfill MNRF's mandate to  protect and sustainably manage the province’s natural heritage features, including wetlands.)
If the responsibility to review the ""professional opinion of wetland evaluators"" is left up solely to municipalities, then there must be a requirement for each municipality to annually assure the Ministry that the municipality has the capability to understand and evaluate these professionals' reports. This capability could be achieved through its own staff or through a citizens' committee.
The bottom line is that the protection of wetlands is crucial for the province of Ontario.
As Richards Education Award winner David Hawke puts it, the arguments put forth in favour of protecting wetlands are tenfold:
1. Wetlands (swamps, marshes, bogs and fens) are home to many species of wildlife, some quite rare and unique to the area;
2. Every food chain or food pyramid has a link to a wetland dependent species;
3. Wetlands provide flood control by absorbing the vast volume of water that can be suddenly released from rainfall or snowmelt;
4. Wetlands prevent erosion of streambanks and roadsides by slowing down the velocity of this flash flood rainfall;
5. Wetlands filter out just about everything from chunky debris to excess nutrients that flow in with dirty water from parking lots and hard surfaces… the outflow water is remarkably clean;
6. Wetlands cool the water as it seeps underground before being released downstream, and cool water supports life better than warm water (high oxygen levels and no algae);
7. Wetlands recharge groundwater supply, thus ensuring wells don’t have to be drilled deeper and deeper;
8. The production of biomass (every living thing considered as one lump) within a wetland equals a rainforest: a lot of plants means lots of oxygen released to the air, and equally a lot of carbon sequestered from the air;
9. Wetlands attract human users, who pay good money to go hunting, fishing, birdwatching, paddling and to do nature photography (not just in their gear, but buying gas, staying at resorts and hotels, and picking up food). No wetland means no visitors which means no money added to local economy.
10. Wetlands are recognized for their aesthetic value to our society. They are fun places to visit, they provide a boost to both our physical and spiritual needs.
It is the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's job to protect and sustainably manage the province's natural heritage areas, including wetlands.
Please do your job MNRF!
2.  The proposed changes will result in lack of protection for provincially significant wetlands -- protection which MNRF is mandated to provide.
The proposed changes permit wetlands currently deemed provincially significant to be divided up into small segments.  These little pieces will undoubtedly gain lower scores than the original larger wetland and thus risk being drained, filled and completely lost. The ecological cost of splitting viable species habitat into orphaned pieces is huge. It will destroy ecosystems, populations and ultimately, economies.
Splitting off and evaluating pieces of wetland separately is like cutting off fingers from a hand.  It's ridiculous to think it won't matter.
It is essential that wetlands continue to be evaluated in their entirety, as a whole.
3.  The proposed changes will result in the loss of knowledge and information to effectively manage Ontario's wetlands.
Just as it is ridiculous to contemplate cutting fingers from a hand, it's equally ludicrous to prevent one hand from knowing what the other is doing.  Yet this is what the removal of provincial coordination and oversight will do.
The province will no longer keep wetland evaluation files and maintain significant wetland mapping, or provide information for use in wetland evaluations. This responsibility will be downloaded to individual municipalities who may not have the expertise to manage this and certainly will not have the financial or staff resources.
Do we really think that plant and animal species or watercourses know and respect municipal boundaries?
We will be left with scattered and incomplete information, at best, and conflicting approaches at worst.  Just imagine one municipality working really hard to re-establish wetland habitat while across the township line the neighbouring municipality is working hard to destroy it.
It is the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's job to protect and sustainably manage the province's natural heritage areas, including wetlands.
MNRF, please do your job.  Maintain a role in the management of provincially significant wetlands.

Despite their important values, wetlands continue to be lost. It is estimated that up to 70% of wetlands have been destroyed or degraded in settled areas of Canada (DUC 2021). Wetlands in southern parts of Ontario have been drained for agriculture, filled for development, polluted by toxic runoff and damaged by artificial changes in water levels (Environment Canada 2010). In Southern Ontario (Mixedwood Plains area), 68% of the wetlands originally present were lost by the early 1980s (OBC 2010) and an additional 4% has been lost since this time (OBC 2015). Wetland loss has been greatest in southwestern Ontario, parts of eastern Ontario, Niagara and the Toronto area, where over 85% of the original pre-settlement wetlands have been converted to other uses. While land conversion is the primary cause of wetland loss in southern Ontario, pollution, invasive species, alteration to natural water levels and climate change also pose serious threats.

73149,/comment/73149,"I am writing to express my unqualified opposition to the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES).  One would think that, with both a biodiversity crisis and a climate crisis at hand, the province would be moving to enhance wetland protection, not decimate it.  I expect the province, especially the MNRF, to be careful custodians of our natural resources rather than its liquidators.  The proposed changes more closely resemble a development industry wish list rather than responsible government policy.
     My specific reasons for opposing these changes include the following:
- The province's own Housing Affordability Task Force stated that a shortage of land isn't behind the current housing shortage.  As such, there is no need to pave over wetlands to ease the housing crisis as the document misleadingly suggests.
- Wetlands are crucial to reducing the risk of flooding events which are predicted to rise as a result of climate change.  The proposed changes will not only lead to a loss of the buffering capacity of wetlands, but also lead to more housing in flood-prone areas.  No doubt, the province (public) will be asked to provide compensation when inappropriately-sited housing areas experience flooding.
- Wetland losses in many areas of southern Ontario already exceed 85%.  How high do you wish to take that to - 100%?  It's hard to hold other areas of the world to account for the protection of their natural heritage when our own track record is so dismal (and getting worse).  It seems lost upon the government that healthy ecosystems are the underpinning of a healthy economy, not an impediment to it.
- The proposed policy would no longer recognize or consider wetland complexes.  This ""slice and dice"" approach to evaluating wetlands will lead to many smaller wetlands losing their provincially significant status.  This change blatantly caters to developers who wish to see the protections currently afforded PSWs eliminated.  If granted, it would lead to the systematic dismantling of PSWs piece by piece until little or nothing remains.  Clearly the goal here is not the protection of wetlands but, instead, the elimination of protections for wetlands.
- The proposal to no longer recognize threatened or endangered species is another ""cut"" designed to further weaken protections by seeing that fewer wetlands qualify for protected status.  Again, the goal here is clearly to erase protections under the guise of ""streamlining"".
- Under the proposed changes, MNRF would remove itself from the wetland evaluation process leaving the process with no oversight body or central record-keeping system.  This is a disastrous proposal that would leave assessments in the hands of evaluators working for developers with no oversight or any checks and balances.  Furthermore, without MNRF serving as a central record-keeper, there would be no centralized mechanism for uploading evaluations for future access by the public or by private organizations.  Instead, we would have a ""hodgepodge"" of local records that would be inaccessible to many.  Lastly, how would MNRF achieve the targets set out in its Wetland Conservation Strategy for Ontario, 2017-2030 if it is removed from the wetlands evaluation and record-keeping process?
- It has not escaped the notice of many that these proposed changes are being made at the same time as many other proposals that will have far-reaching, negative impacts on environmental protection.  One could be forgiven for thinking that this is a deliberate strategy designed to overwhelm the public and NGOs so as to limit their meaningful participation in the consultation process.  The short timelines provided to respond are equally problematic.
- The stated impacts of the proposed changes conveniently omit the inevitable negative natural heritage implications.  Instead, it focuses only on the impacts on businesses which MNRF describe as neutral to positive.  How irresponsible to gloss over the significant negative impact these proposals will have on natural heritage protection, public safety and public finances.
    In summary, I am calling on the government to withdraw, in their entirety, the proposed changes to the OWES.  In all my years of advocating for natural heritage protection, this is one of the most cynical pieces of legislation I have yet to encounter.  I do not believe that it is the result of recommendations of MNRF staff at the ground level; rather, I believe it is being imposed on them from above, leaving many conscientious workers in this ministry to potentially defend or implement the indefensible.
   Please put your duty to the public good over the interests of the development lobby and withdraw these proposals.
    Thank you.

73151,/comment/73151,"Ontario Wetland Evaluation System Classification Changes
Wetlands play a critical role in a healthy, functional environment. Changing the classification system will mean further wetland loss and may result in serious flooding, putting the safety of communities at risk. Wetlands are a natural, cost-effective strategy for protecting downstream properties from floods, adapting to climate change, and retaining water to lessen drought impacts. By changing the classification system, existing Provincially Significant Wetlands could lose their status and un-evaluated wetlands are unlikely to meet the standard for additional protection.  This could lead to wetlands  being filled in, resulting in loss of habitat and numerous species, decreased storage area for water resulting in decreased flood storage but increased potential for erosion, and poorer water quality. These losses will have detrimental effects on tourism and recreation industries. Loss of wetlands will also result in the necessity of more stormwater ponds which require more maintenance and monitoring than wetlands. The government must be prudent when considering changes like offsetting, which could negatively affect the ability of wetlands to reduce flooding and confuse roles in wetland management and protection between municipalities and CAs.
I recommend that:
•	The province re-engage the multi-stakeholder Conservation Authority Working Group and work with the working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and develop better alternatives, prior to proceeding with current proposed amendments.
Potential Loss of CA Lands
Minister of Natural Resources Graydon Smith has told media outlets that conservation authorities are “the second largest landowner after the Crown” and have been asked to “evaluate” their land in order to identify areas for housing development. In most instances, these lands have been acquired for specific purposes; typically, lands are purchased to protect the public from flooding and erosion or the lands are left through estate donations to the Conservation Authority by members of the public who wished their private lands stay natural. The development of these natural spaces will have numerous negative implications on the natural environment and a community’s ability to adapt to climate change. Further, the local tourism and recreation industries that rely on these spaces will feel the effects as will individuals of the public of who could experience negative social, mental & physical health impacts.
I recommend that:
•	The province focus efforts on building up urban areas instead of urban sprawl outwards;
•	Municipal Official Plans continue to be followed as written; and
•	Lands identified as natural hazards be maintained as open space.

RE: Proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (ERO:019-6160)
As a Wetland Biologist with over 17 years of professional experience, I have a number of concerns with the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES). Ontario’s wetlands play a critical role as a natural filter of nutrients and pollutants protecting water quality, as flood storage areas that protect people and property from floods, as recharge areas for groundwater, and in providing habitat for wildlife including many Species at Risk. Ontario’s wetlands also provide an abundance of tourism and recreation opportunities. If the proposed changes to OWES are implemented, existing Provincially Significant Wetlands will lose their status and un-evaluated wetlands are unlikely to meet the standard for additional protection.  This will lead to wetlands being destroyed and lost, resulting in loss of habitat and numerous species, decreased flood storage and increased erosion, poorer water quality in our rivers and lakes, and the loss of tourism and recreation.
Ontario has a housing supply crisis, not a shortage of buildable land. Access to housing that is affordable is necessary and important, but that is possible without making changes to the OWES that would remove environmental protections and encourage the destruction and removal of the remaining wetlands in Ontario. The proposed changes are not supported by science and will erode decision makers ability to protect wetlands and their functions.
My specific concerns with the changes include:
- The removal of the MNRF, and its varied and essential roles, from the manual.
o This leaves no oversight system in place and no identified replacement.
o This will result in a significant loss of knowledge base since the MNRF has been the administering body for this system since its inception.  This will result in a significant need for additional resources and administration capacity that will be lost.
o Unclear who will be responsible for administering OWES.
o Unclear who will oversee OWES evaluator training and certification.
o Unclear who can be contacted for further details and support.
o Unclear who will be responsible for making final decisions or determining outcomes if there is a disagreement between evaluators.
o Unclear who will be responsible for training and certifying evaluators.
o Unclear who will be responsible for overseeing and housing wetland files and how this will be done.
- Addition of “A Complete Evaluation” section.
o Unclear who a ‘decision maker’ is and how they will be looking at evaluations.
o Unclear who will be responsible for updating and maintaining the provincial wetland database and mapping information.
o ‘Complete once it has been received’ provides no oversight to ensure that the evaluation was completed properly.
- Conservation Authorities removal from the manual. Conservation Authorities require tools and data including the information generated through OWES to continue to focus on natural hazards management and fulfill their core mandate.
- Changes to enable re-evaluations and mapping updates, and the removal of wetland complexes.
o Unclear what ‘closely grouped wetlands’ means.
o Wetlands do not function independently of one another, they collectively provide significant ecological functions and services, and should continue to be complexed.  Removing wetlands from the complexes in which they have been identified fails to recognize how wetlands function on the landscape. It will result in the vast majority of wetlands not meeting significance criteria and becoming unprotected.
- Removal of 4.1.2.1 Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species and 4.1.2.2 Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species
o Wetlands are an incredibly important ecosystem for many of Ontario’s Species at Risk. Wetlands support these species by providing reproductive, feeding and hibernation habitat for residents as well as migratory species. Without the wetlands that support them many of these species will become at risk of extinction. The removal of these criteria for scoring will result in the vast majority of wetlands not meeting significance criteria and becoming unprotected.
I recommend that:
• The role of the MNRF in the administration of OWES be retained.
• The complexing of wetlands be retained.
• The scoring of Endangered and Threatened species be retained.
• The province engage with a multi-stakeholder working group to determine the unintentional negative implications of these proposed changes, and develop scientifically sound alternatives, prior to proceeding with the current proposed amendments.

She helped start the group because all species of turtles are at risk.  Some like the Spotted, Spiny Softshell and the Wood Turtle are actually listed as Endangered in Ontario.
In my science class, we learned that wetlands are an important way to adapt to climate change and that they support so much biodiversity.  Most of Ontario's wetlands have been drained or filled in so it seems like a no brainer to strengthen not weaken the protections of the remaining wetlands.
I want to live in a world that supports as much biodiversity as possible.  I also want to have systems in place to help with climate change, my future literally depends on it.

73157,/comment/73157,"Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System ERO 019-6160
More housing at the expense of the environment is extremely short sighted and will result in a worsening quality of life for the people of Ontario. These amendments will benefit developers that happen to own property with a provincially significant wetland on it. Then an MZO which many people disagree with won't have to be handed out. What about the costs associated with the loss of wetlands? What about the costs associated with flooding events or the loss of ecosystem services that wetlands provide?
Clearly some of the ERO's of Bill 23 relate very closely. For some wetlands with some protection and offsetting and to follow the requirements avoid, mitigate and then offset, I would predict most developers would go straight to offset and that most municipalities would allow it. With climate change and biodiversity loss as extreme as it is, I believe offsets should not be used as the habitat for the species that depend on that wetland would be lost. Some species may be able to move to a new location but many would die out. Habitat loss is one of the main factors driving biodiversity loss. Not only do we not have the time to wait for a ""new"" wetland elsewhere to build biodiversity, apparently they don't function to the same degree as the original.
Wetland complexes should remain in the OWES to determine Provincially Significant Wetlands. Most wetlands are complexes. So if you remove complexes from the OWES, the majority of wetlands remaining will not be considered provincially significant and will have little protection. The Mer Bleue Bog in Ottawa is a wetland complex as well as the Oak Hammond Marsh in Manitoba and are recognized as having international significance under the Ramsar convention. Even in the original version of the OWES, it states that ""delineating of the wetland units into individual ones would not be an ecologically or functionally sound process"" and it also speaks of wildlife being dependent upon the entire complex. Apparently, complexes can contain a wetland unit less than 2  ha in size but the OWES does not consider individual wetlands under 2 ha however small wetlands are disappearing faster than bigger wetlands and need more protection according to a study by researchers at the University of Waterloo.  In the OWES Introduction it states ""If wetlands small and large cannot survive in reasonable abundance across the landscape, their dependent species will decrease in number and eventually disappear. As you want to increase biodiversity (another ERO) yet not protecting wetlands will do the opposite.
Regarding Agricultural Lands. Planting of crops and tilling land in the wetland means you shouldn't consider it a wetland but cattle pasturing or grazing means you should. Clearly then planting of crops and tilling land in a wetland should not be allowed.  Most farmers would be encouraged to plant crops and use drainage with the policy as is.  How does this help to filter contaminants from reaching water bodies?
Under Section 5.0,  5.1 to 5.5 have been crossed out. These are important indicators and should be included.
Locally important wetlands should remain  and be protected. Wetlands are areas of high biodiversity and help deal with climate change in terms of carbon sequestrations and flooding associated with extreme rainfall events and also drought. Many have already been lost especially in southern Ontario. According to Ontario Nature, less than 30% of the original wetlands remain in southern Ontario and in the Niagara and Greater Toronto area that number drops to 10%.
The following section is crossed out in your proposal but I believe it should remain in the document.
""Nevertheless, the evaluation is not a complete biophysical inventory and certain information, particularly about the presence of rare species and about hydrological functions, may be lacking even after the evaluation is completed. If this is determined to be the case, then more information should be obtained before making decisions about the types of land uses in the vicinity of evaluated wetlands (particularly those deemed to be provincially significant.""
I do not understand the section about landowner permission to carry out wetland evaluation. Who else but the landowner would request an evaluation? No one should be allowed to do a wetland evaluation of private property unless hired by the landowner.
The government of Ontario is suppose to work for the people of Ontario. Yes, addressing the housing issue is needed but it can be done without destroying the environment. Many people might not be aware of how much trouble we are in regarding climate change and biodiversity loss.  I haven't figured out if this government doesn't know either or just doesn't care.  How angry will people they be when they find out about things once  it is too late and knowing this government actually made things worse rather than trying to deal with the real priorities of our time.

The changes to the OWES and removing power from conservation authorities are chief among these. Wetlands are not what are getting in the way of affordable housing, and we shouldn't be building on them. What is getting in the way of affordable housing in this province are restrictive bylaws, lengthy approval times, high developer fees, and municipalities / residents groups who block new development. The bill makes a step in the right direction toward addressing many of these problems, which is why I mostly support it, although I think it should go further by removing height limits, setback requirements, and other bylaws that restrict building forms. I think as a province, we need to find a way to make better use of low-density spaces like defunct malls, underused industrial areas, strip malls, spaces above train corridors, and other places where we can add density before trying to build into the greenbelt or on wetlands.

73167,/comment/73167,"I vigorously oppose the proposed changes to the Wetland Evaluation System for several reasons, all bearing on the damage to wetlands that will not be easily reversible. First, I am aware of the essential role of wetlands in providing protection against flooding, amongst other vital services. I have personally witnessed torrential rains wipe out the possibility of a normal morning commute on the Don Valley Parkway near our home in Toronto in 2013. Thirty-year veteran police officers had never seen water cresting so high. 1400 passengers had to be rescued from a commuter Go train that got stranded in storm water 15 minutes after leaving Union Station. Homeowners took a beating with flooded basements, sewer problems and other issues. Nor have I forgotten driving through flash floods in the High Park and lakeshore area of the city in 2020. The 50-70 mm of rain delivered by a sudden wild storm while I was at the dentist almost equalled what Toronto normally got in the month. I am aware of the critical role of the TRCA, the creation of the Conservation Authorities Act to deal with water and watershed issues province-wide, and the place of preparedness among our city’s top priorities. Why move in the opposite direction when COVID has taught the need for broader vision and the need for science-based decision-making?
It is important for wetland evaluations to be reviewed by arm's length agencies with an objective view. The proposed legislation is not allowing the Ministry of Natural Resources or Conservation Authorities to review wetland evaluations, leaving it to municipalities. If they are responsible for development, as well as preserving natural heritage like wetlands, where do they find balance? Many wetlands cross municipal boundaries. How will the different municipalities determine the level of importance for the wetland?
Secondly, I am aware that proposed changes will not allow wetlands to be grouped together, so that smaller wetlands will most likely not meet the criteria to be provincially significant and may be open for development. But groupings are important for fish and wildlife that live in wetlands, as the entire complex makes up their habitat. I am personally aware of the work that has gone into bringing back viable, sustainable and ecological wetland communities near my home, and I am appalled by the prospect of their destruction, and the discouragement of similar projects for the common good.
Thirdly, I am aware that wetlands are the worst place to build, beyond ecological considerations. Damage to diverse and delicate ecosystems that provide important habitats for plants and animals, for the sake of development that is vulnerable to flooding and housing that contributes to sprawl rather than intensification, is reckless and ethically unacceptable.
",comments-42.json
73171,/comment/73171,"I am quite concerned about the proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) and what those changes will mean for Ontarians and for Species at Risk.
As someone who has professional experience in this field, it is known that the evaluation of wetlands aid in the land use planning process to assist municipalities and conservation authorities in the proper planning required for development around and within wetlands. The MNRF and local Conservation Authorities are scientists that are knowledgeable and experienced in protecting and conserving wetlands. The conservation authorities currently regulate these wetlands or require a permit to develop or work in wetlands (however, with Bill 23 this will change) as wetlands under Bill 23 will no longer be regulated by Conservation Authorities.
It is curious that Bill 23 and changes to OWES have been proposed at similar times, as the Conservative Government anticipates building over 1.5 million homes in Ontario over the next 10 years and want to avoid constraints to development to quickly achieve this goal. I understand our population is increasing and that we do need more affordable housing for many Ontarians, but what I am observing currently is increased urban sprawl or estate homes being developed that are not currently assisting those who need affordable housing.  I can understand that developers may be frustrated by having to go through applications, permits and appropriate mitigation measures, however that is why we have created regulations to protect and conserve the environment, which has been a long time in the making.
The new wetland evaluation system scoring system will eliminate various factors in the scoring system reducing the chance of making a wetland “provincially significant” therefore making it easier for developers to build and eliminating many of these wetlands protected under the Provincial Policy Statement under the Planning Act.
Changes noted in the Proposed Changes to OWES:
1)	Wetland Complex – REMOVED
2)	Threatened and Endangered Species – REMOVED
3)	Consultation and Background Information with Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) and Conservation Authorities – REMOVED
1.	As stated in the OWES document provided for review in the Environmental Registry: (Proposed Revisions to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (prod-environmental-registry.s3.amazonaws.com): a wetland complex is stated as “A group of wetland units that are functionally linked to one another. The outer boundary of any one unit in no more than 750 m away from the outer boundary of one or more other units in the complex.” This means these are linked to one another and function together hydrologically and should be included together and not as single units as otherwise proposed. By removing evaluation of a wetland complex this greatly reduces the scoring system, as they will now only be considered separate units, reducing the chance that it will be considered provincially significant.
2.	Wetlands are known to provide habitat for many of Ontario’s Species at Risk (SAR). Removing threatened and endangered species from the scoring system is inconceivable and should be considered an important factor in determining if a wetland is provincially significant. These are rare species that depend on wetlands and legally require their habitat to be protected. By removing these species from the OWES scoring, this will not eliminate any red tape for development. Developers would still need to following requirements under the Endangered Species Act (i.e., Completing Information Gathering Forms, Overall Benefit Permits, etc.). Therefore, I do not understand why we need to remove these species from the scoring system.
3.	By removing the involvement of the Ontario MNRF and Conservation Authorities and acquiring appropriate background information in assisting in determining significance is unfortunate. This removes expert and scientific opinion of those who are most knowledgeable of Ontario wetlands. Background information they can provide regarding wetlands is invaluable.
We need smart land use planning right now regarding Ontario’s Wetlands. in Ontario’s A Wetland Conservation Strategy for Ontario 2017-2030 (see link), it states the following about wetlands; “They’re vital to the health of our province, giving us clean and abundant water, protecting us from flooding, and reducing the effects of climate change.” It also states “In Southern Ontario, wetlands act as natural infrastructure – producing at least $14 Billion in economic benefits each year for Ontarians."" According to Ontario Nature: The Worth of Our Wetlands - Ontario Nature (see link): Wetlands are a nature-based climate solution and critical in responding to climate change and biodiversity loss and that is more cost-effective to protect our existing wetlands compared to other conventional land management and water treatment systems.
Please amend changes to the OWES Manual to include wetland complex’s and threatened and endangered species as part of the scoring system, and to include involvement with the MNRF and Conservation Authorities.

73174,/comment/73174,"Dear Ministers,
I am writing to express my opposition to Bill 23 and associated policy proposals that would weaken environmental protections and undermine public involvement in land use planning and decision-making.
I am particularly concerned about the:
1. Removal of my right to appeal on planning matters that affect my community;
2. Limitations on the power of conservation authorities (CAs) to regulate or prohibit development that negatively impacts wetlands, rivers or streams, to provide expert review of planning applications, and to appeal planning decisions;
3. Removal of the role of seven regional municipalities (Simcoe, Durham, Halton, Peel, Niagara, Waterloo and York) in planning matters, thereby eliminating coordinated efforts to protect farmland and natural areas, determine optimal locations for development and infrastructure, and efficiently deliver municipal services;
4. Drastic amendments to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, ensuring that very few wetlands in Ontario will be deemed provincially significant and protected from development;
5. Replacement of the Provincial Policy Statement with a new policy instrument geared to facilitating unchecked development; and
6. Creation of a natural heritage offsetting policy and “pay to slay” fund that could lead to widespread and extremely risky tradeoffs, where existing natural areas are sacrificed on the faulty premise that they can be recreated or restored elsewhere.
In the face of unprecedented and accelerating biodiversity loss and the ever-worsening climate crisis, it is vital that your government do its utmost to protect the farmland, wetlands, forests, rivers and other natural areas that sustain us. As Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report, we do not need to sacrifice environmental protection to address the housing crisis. That’s because “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem.” (p.10) There is a vast supply of land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries.
I urge you to 1) withdraw all amendments likely to weaken the protection of farmland and natural heritage; and 2) retain and uphold the role of the public, CAs and regional municipalities in environmental planning and decision-making.

original wetlands, and in the GTHA fewer than 10% of the original wetlands remain! The cause?
Development of natural areas is the primary cause of wetland loss ... This occurs as a result of ever expanding residential and commercial development around cities and towns.
If the proposed changes to the OWES goes ahead, wetlands, that naturally form a complex network, will be torn apart, divided into small wetland parcels, which can no longer be protected, and sold off to the development industry to pave over for homes that are entirely not needed and not affordable.
The scores for threatened and endangered species will be eliminated, and that destroys biodiversity.
Wetlands in general, receive no protection in Ontario until they are designated 'provincially significant'.
The process to arrive at this designation is slow and often inefficient, and according to the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario in her 2018 Report, contains a ""260 year backlog ... Instead, all unevaluated wetlands should be protected (presumed significant) until proven otherwise.""
If OWES goes ahead, unbelievably, a property owner or developer seeking to remove the significant wetland designation, will be the only authority determining if the wetland evaluation is valid. This proposal is completely destructive. This proposal should be entirely and immediately withdrawn.

73189,/comment/73189,"Re: EOR Posting #019-6160 Proposed Changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System
To Whom It May Concern
I have a university degree in Conservation Biology and been working as a professional planner and ecologist for twenty years, I am also a certified OWES evaluator. In those years I have assisted other professionals in the development of provincial policies including the natural heritage strategy and Lake Simcoe Protection Plan, reviewed hundreds of Planning Act applications, evaluated wetlands AND peer-reviewed OWES records, as well as coordinated several development monitoring programs to assess the effectiveness of SWM infrastructure, wetland/watercourse setbacks, and offsetting to mitigate impacts to wetland hydrologic and ecological functions. I’d say with my experience, I am qualified to offer my opinion to the proposed changes to OWES.
1.	Removing ‘Complexing’ Principle and Habitat for Threatened and Endangered Species
All evaluators know that wetland size (contiguous or complex) and species at risk are key scoring factors that make a wetland significant and are often the triggers to determine whether a wetland should be evaluated in support of a Planning Act application. By removing these two scoring components, coupled with the proposed deconstruction of existing complexes through the re-evaluation of individual wetland units, appears to diminish the power of Provincial Policy Statement policy 2.1.4 a) and contravene complimentary provincial policies to maintain or enhance biodiversity, manage water resources, and protect people and property from natural hazards, including changes to wetlands.
Scientific literature concludes that wetland hydrology is a key driver supporting wetland ecological functions, i.e., disturbance to wetland water balance/hydroperiod elicits a biological/ecological response. Re-evaluating complexes unit by unit or ignoring the watershed context by removing wetland complexing, leads to a poor understanding of wetland hydrology and associated impacts to natural hazards. If the proposed changes are based on science, rather than a red-lining exercise by politicians, shouldn’t the hydrology component of the protocol also be updated? What about updating the entire protocol to include eco-hydrology science, feature-based water balance methodologies, headwater drainage feature protocols, etc.?
In case the changes to OWES were not based on science, wetlands provide the province with a number of cost effective benefits including flood and drought control, clean water, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestering, and shoreline stabilization. In lieu of unpredictable climate hazards, wetlands are this province’s only natural (and free) asset to mitigate impacts of flooding, erosion and drought, which minimizes risk to people, property and infrastructure – engineered solutions will not be able to replicate all the services already provided by natural wetlands.
2.	Removing MNRF as OWES Approval Authority and OWES Files
The existing provincial process includes ministry appointed staff with OWES certification to review OWES record submission. OWES evaluators are currently required to be registered with the province so that peer-reviewers can verify their status. In the absence of provincial review, planning authorities will have no way of confirming OWES certification unless the province makes this information public. Based on my experience with OWES, it is a subjective protocol that is biased towards the evaluators skill set and quality of training, i.e., inexperienced OWES evaluators typically have several errors and omissions in their submission, and the new requirements for collecting evidence/sources of information previously provided by local experts (MNRF District Office, Conservation Officers, Conservation Authorities, Field Naturalists, NHIC, others) may require skills that go beyond OWES. By removing MNRF as the approval authority and giving autonomy to OWES evaluators increases the risk of inaccuracies and perpetuating the current issue of incomplete or poor-quality Planning Act application submissions.
The open file principle of OWES supported periodic updates, e.g., changes to species at risk provincial ranks and subwatershed plans that affected wetland status and boundary adjustments; it was a repository/record or source of information to validate findings. The new updates create a point in time evaluation referred to as the Wetland Evaluation Data and Scoring Record (WEDSR) – will this database be public or circulated to regulatory agencies?
Changing OWES, which does not appear to be conducted from a science-based perspective, has a direct implication to natural hazards. By evaluating wetlands on a site by site basis (not evaluating the wetland beyond property boundaries or fulsome drainage basin, which is the current practice by developers applying for approvals under the Planning Act) or a unit by unit basis (not evaluating the fulsome drainage basin or considering watershed context/connectivity) to support wetland removal, runs the risk that functionality of individual wetlands or watersheds are misunderstood, and therefore mismanaged or poorly replicated. Mismanaging wetland hydrology equals to a complete disregard for associated hazards, which will only be further aggravated by climate hazards, resulting in aggravated or new hazards and increased risk to infrastructure, offset plans, and asset management costs.
To minimize risk to people and property, and to protect healthy futures for our children, I ask the province to continue to recognize the importance of wetlands and to continue to uphold policies that protect hydrologic functions by keeping hydrologic features in situ. While OWES is not the only method to evaluate critical or significant wetland function, i.e., functions that cannot be replicated, it is important to maintain a provincially-recognized standard for identifying and protecting hydrologic/hazard features like wetlands from unaffordable housing development projects. So, either update OWES entirely based on good science or stakeholder input, not politics, or leave it alone!

▪ Eliminate wetlands that provide Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species from the scoring system. No points allotted for Endangered or Threatened species under this section (i.e. OWES section 4.1.2.2 to be deleted);
▪ Eliminate points for “Endangered” and “Threatened” species.
PECFN Comment
It is important to understand that virtually every Provincially Significant Wetland in Prince Edward County will lose the high protection afforded by the PSW designation if these changes go through.  They will lose their designation because the reasons they were rated as PSWs in the first place will no longer apply.  To be specific, the OWES would no longer allot points to wetlands that provide reproductive habitat or migration, feeding and/or hibernation habitat for Threatened and Endangered Species.
It may help you to understand how disastrous it would be to have the PSW status removed.  The County is an island separated from the mainland of Ontario by the Bay of Quinte.  It is covered with wetlands, large and small.  Data we have obtained from 2012 indicates that about 11,176 hectares of wetlands in the County had been evaluated by the MNRF and about 10,000 hectares of these wetlands were provincially significant.    This data also indicates that there were 24 PSWs in the County in 2012.  Some PSWs have been added since then including Slab Creek PSW and Lost Lake PSW, which received its designation earlier this year.  Lost Lake PSW received this designation due to the  presence of reproductive habitat for Least Bittern (Threatened) and Migration and/or Feeding Habitat for Blanding’s Turtle (Threatened) and Barn Swallow (Threatened).
Based on these proposed changes, Lost Lake PSW and all the other PSWs in the County that were designated for similar reasons would be down-graded from PSWs to regionally and/or locally significant wetlands under the new scoring system that the OWES would be using.
As noted, as well as providing wildlife habitat, the County’s provincially significant wetlands provide specialized habitat for about 10 Species at Risk birds, 30 Species at Risk reptiles and amphibians; and 36 Species at Risk plants, insects, fish and mammals.  It is well known that wetland protection is closely tied with the protection of Threatened and Endangered Species. This is because protecting wetlands has always had the added benefit of protecting their habitat.  In other words, when development is prohibited within 120 metres of a PSW these lands are utilized by wildlife to carry out their life cycles, in their providing breeding, nesting, feeding, hibernation and migratory habitat. Permitting development within120 metres of a previously-protected PSW will lead to habitat loss and degradation.  Development will also cause fragmentation, for example almost all new residential, commercial and industrial developments require the construction of new access roads.
(2)  The government is proposing to:
▪ Permanently remove the OWES from the Provincial Policy Statement which mandates the conservation of wetlands that are considered provincially significant;
PECFN Comment
We note that the following section has been stricken from the OWES manual:
[T]he wetland evaluation system serves as an essential cornerstone of wetland policies of the Provincial Policy Statement, authorized under Section 3 of the Planning Act. As well, the evaluation system may prove of value in identifying nationally and internationally important wetland features.
If this change goes through the OWES will no longer inform wetland policies in this Province. But if the OWES will no longer inform wetland policies, then what will?  Striking the OWES from the PPS will leave a gap that cannot be filled.  The system for identifying wetlands, for evaluating (and valuing) wetlands and for creating policies to protect wetlands, will be broken.
It is outrageous to suggest that policies for wetlands can be created by administrators and bureaucrats without survey data and ground-proofing.  The OWES provides critical data about wetlands and information that informs the government about the health and long-term sustainability of wetlands.  If this change goes through this data will no longer be collected and analyzed because there will be no one to interpret and oversee the information that would allow for long term planning.  All of this data and information will be unavailable for future generations.
If this section is struck out, the result will be a policy that disavows the importance and the value of wetlands and  that as such will not allow for the sustainability of wetlands over the long-term.  In taking this section out our government is for all intents and purposes  saying that wetlands are unimportant, which is false, of course and disingenuous.  We urge you to reconsider the direction this type of thinking is taking us in.
What has changed to disavow the importance of wetlands at this time?  There could not be a worse time to support a policy when we are in the midst of a climate emergency.

(3)  The government is proposing to:
▪ Eliminate the MNRF’s long-held role of administering the OWES;
PECFN Comment
The OWES provides a standardized method of assessing wetland functions and societal values and enables the Province to rank wetlands relative to one another. In administering the OWES the MNRF is a key part of a system of checks and balances that have been put in place over many years to promote the protection and conservation of wetlands.
Ontario Nature has provided an excellent summary of this change and its ramifications:
MNRF is proposing to remove itself from any involvement in Ontario’s wetland evaluation process, despite the deep and valuable expertise of ministry staff who have overseen the process for decades. No central agency is being assigned to coordinate or approve evaluations or to ensure that information about PSW designation is publicly accessible. Consultation with MNRF will no longer be an option.
It appears that approval authority will be downloaded to municipalities, many of which have little expertise and would no longer be able to consult with conservation authorities (due to proposed Bill 23 amendments to the Conservation Authorities Act). Instead, the onus would be on the wetland evaluator (working in most cases for the development proponent) to inform the municipality and landowners in writing about the outcome of the evaluation or re-evaluation.
MNRF would:
•	Be unaware of wetland evaluations and outcomes
•	No longer ensure wetland evaluations were accessible to the public through Land Information
 Ontario
•	Have no authority to intervene on behalf of the public regarding an evaluation of questionable merit
(4) The government is proposing to:
▪ Eliminate the roles and responsibilities of conservation authorities, for example their responsibility to regulate areas around wetlands including provincially significant wetlands (i.e. areas within 120 metres of all PSWs and areas within 30 metres of all other wetlands);
PECFN Comment
The reasoning appears to be that conservation authorities are impediments to developing in wetlands and as such, need to be dismantled.  It’s also  clearly being stated that there’s no need to regulate areas around wetlands.
Results of this change:
1.	Protection for wetlands will lost without a central protection authority
2.	Leaving the management of wetlands to developers will cause irreparable harm to Endangered and Threatened species resulting in the extirpation of said species in Ontario
(5) The government is proposing to:
▪ Restrict the use of results of wetland evaluations, i.e.,  wetland evaluations can no longer be used by conservation authorities to provide technical advice to municipalities or used by the MNRF to manage and conserve fish, wildlife, land and other resources and to inform stewardship and incentive programs;
PECFN Comment
These changes set limits on what conservation authorities and the MNRF can do with the OWES.  Conservation authorities cannot provide any technical advice to municipalities that is based on the OWES.  The MNRF will not be permitted to use the OWES at all.
Results of these changes:
(1)	Protection for wetlands will lost without a central protection authority
(2)	Without wetland protection climate change impacts will accelerate uncontrollably
(3)	Leaving the management of wetlands to developers will cause irreparable harm to Threatened and Endangered species resulting in the extirpation of said species in Ontario
(4)	Preventing municipalities access the environment and wetland specialists will cause the eradication of the wetlands and the species that cohabitate the environment.
(5)	Not stating clearly the importance of wetlands will allow the destruction of the natural environment
(6)	Not applying direction for the sustainability of wetlands by expertise with the authority to manage the resources will cause the resource to disappear along with the species that require these resources.
(6) The government is proposing to:
▪ Remove “Wetland complexes” (groupings of wetlands that are considered a single contiguous wetland) from the OWES.  Evaluators will be permitted to re-score and re-map single wetland units that are part of a previously evaluated wetland complex (with the exception of closely grouped wetlands);
PECFN Comment
The plan to get rid of wetland complexes by breaking them up into “single wetland units” contradicts the government’s own science-based policy, which states that the delineation of the wetland units into individually recognized wetlands would not be an ecologically or a functionally sound process.  According to the Natural Heritage Manual (2005),
Many areas of Ontario contain closely spaced wetlands that vary in size from a fraction of a hectare to several hundred hectares. The topography of the landscape in which these wetlands occur, the short distances between some of the wetlands, and the density of wetlands per unit of areal landscape may be so complex that delineation of the wetland units into individually recognized wetlands would not be an ecologically or a functionally sound process. Such groupings of wetlands are referred to as “wetland complexes.” For the purposes of the PPS, the OWES uses various criteria (e.g., distance) to identify and evaluate wetland complexes.
The government has not provided any justification to eliminate wetland complexes even when it is clear that this change will open them up to development.
(7) The following change is being proposed to:
▪ Eliminate MNRF’s involvement in training and approving Evaluators.   The MNRF will no longer offer assistance to Evaluators.
PECFN Comment
At the present time the MNRF only recognizes ministry-sanctioned wetland evaluation courses and the Ministry routinely offers training courses in wetland evaluations.   Wetland evaluations conducted by individuals trained by other organizations will not be considered by the MNRF.  This policy is evidently to provide some reassurance to the public that evaluations of wetlands are consistently applied throughout the province and that only evaluations that meet the OWES standards are accepted for review.
If this change goes through the OWES will effectively be privatized.  With no governmental oversight and supervision, evaluators will be at the beck and call of industry.
PECFN Concluding Comment
These changes to the OWES have many ramifications.  In one fell swoop these changes remove all of the checks and balances (including the Provincial Policy Statement, Conservation Authorities and the OWES) that are there to protect and preserve wetlands. Although we will still have the OWES it will no longer have any “teeth”, which effectively extinguishes any hope of sustainable management of our wetlands. To the contrary, wetlands will be degraded and destroyed by development.
These changes to the OWES have no basis in science – or in reality. It is well known by now that wetlands “provide a wide variety of ecosystem services that benefit people and the environment including flood control, shoreline stabilization, water purification, filtering of run-off, groundwater recharge and discharge, and recreation, education and tourism opportunities.”  The government should be affirming these things in the OWES, not weakening the OWES to the extent that it’s only role is to assist developers and streamline development.
Thank you for taking our comments under consideration.

This will not only cost the Government money, but everyone who lives here, and many of those houses that you are so eager to build are likely to be damaged in some way.
You cannot take the power away from the experts. The ecologists, MNRF, Conservation Authorities and other environmental experts are the only ones who truly understand the consequences of having these systems removed. Wetlands cannot be chopped into small areas and be evaluated in that way; the broader picture must be looked at.

I read that Ontario has lost 72% of its wetlands. I live in Essex county, and the loss is above 90% here. Wetlands provide us with many services such as flood mitigation  and providing habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna on a full and part time basis. The destruction this proposal will cause cannot be undone even with changes to the legislation in the future. A healthy ecosystem takes thousands of years  to mature and provide a high level of biodiversity. Many properties will be flooded.
I disagree with all removals of MNR from the proposal. Land use and conservation need a regional, coordinated approach.
I disagree with the removal of 4.1.2.1. and 4.1.2.2 regarding endangered species. Theses species should be given the consideration they are currently afforded.
I disagree with 4.1.2.5 and 4.1.2.6 where it talks of a ministry list being used instead of existing lists. The in addition part is fine.
I disagree with the removal of wetland complexes throughout the proposal. These are just as important as larger wetlands and should be considered as currently.

73209,/comment/73209,"I am writing to express my opposition to Bill 23 and associated policy proposals to change the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System that would weaken environmental protections and undermine public involvement in land use planning and decision-making.
I have been in the environmental and planning field for over 30 years when I started my career Ontario was at the forefront of environmental planning and regulations, unfortunately we are now near the bottom and the proposed changes in Bill 23 will accelerate this process.
Your government has produced a narrative of a false crisis to help your developer friends. There is no shortage of developable lands, as detailed by Environmental Defense in the existing white belt there enough developable land for 25+ years. There is no crisis and there is no shortage of developable land. Tens of thousands of building permits currently sit idle; houses are not being constructed developers are just sitting on the approvals and crying that they need easier to develop sprawl lands for their profit-making machines.
It is impossible to comment on changes to the PPS without being provided with the justification and the proposed changes. The proposed changes will eliminate the protection of scarce natural resources that sustain us all.
The proposed changes to the OWES will result in few wetlands being designated PSW and downgrading current designated PSW's. We've lost between 75-85% of wetland in Ontario that provide protection from flooding, regulate climates rising temperatures and biodiversity. This will abandon the no-net loss provisions of the PPS resulting in harm to the people of Ontario.
The proposal to expand offsetting policies will accelerate the loss of wetland, woodlands, and other areas that will be destroyed by developing areas not needed. There is already enough white belt lands to accommodate the next 25 years of growth in the GTA. Offsetting cannot replace existing natural features created over hundreds and thousands of years and should not be implemented.
In the face of unprecedented and accelerating biodiversity loss and the ever-worsening climate crisis, I urge you to cancel these profound and dangerous changes to OWES and engage the various stakeholders, upper and lower tier municipalities, conservation authorities, Indigenous Peoples, interest groups and the general public in meaning full consultations to improve the existing policies in the province of Ontario.

Comments to the Ministry of the Natural Resources and Forestry
Comments on the Proposed Updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (ERO 019-6160)
Background
The mission of the Ottawa Valley Chapter of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS-OV) is to protect and preserve biodiversity in the Ottawa Valley by promoting and advocating for ecological integrity in the management of public lands, working with other local and regional environmental groups, and collaborating with Indigenous Communities, industries and governments.
We represent over 5000 people in Eastern Ontario who care deeply about the province’s environment and natural resources.
While we support the government’s efforts to provide Ontarians with affordable housing in all regions of the province, we know that proposed changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES), as they are currently drafted, will not solve the housing affordability or supply crisis in Ontario. They would completely undermine the protection of wetlands in Ontario, damage existing neighbourhoods and undermine the viability of the farms and natural areas that sustain our communities by providing food, protection from flooding and mitigating climate change risks.
OWES assessments are necessary to designate Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs), resulting in a high level of protection under provincial law and policy such as the Provincial Policy Statement (sections 2.1.4, 2.1.5 and 2.1.8). However, the proposed overhaul of the OWES will ensure that very few wetlands would benefit from such conservation status, and most existing PSWs would lose their designation. CPAWS-OV is firmly against the proposed amendment for the reasons detailed below.
The purpose of the amendment is unfounded
Amendments to the OWES will not solve the housing crisis
According to the ERO posting, the purpose of the proposed changes is to support the construction of 1.5 million new housing units over the following years by streamlining the wetland evaluation process. However, as noted by Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force (2022), a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the housing shortage:
Land is available inside the existing build-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts [...]. Most of the solution must come from densification.
Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (Housing Affordability Task Force, 2022, p.10)
There is no need to pave over wetlands to provide housing.
Wetlands provide valuable services to communities.
In the 2019 report of Ontario’s Special Advisor on Flooding, wetlands are vital in addressing the harmful impacts of increasingly frequent and intense rainfall events and reducing associated flood damages and financial losses.
The MNRF, in 2017, published a study that found that maintaining wetlands can reduce flood damages and costs by 29% in rural areas and 38% in urban areas.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada documented wetlands’ “cost-effective” ability to reduce flood damages and associated costs.
Therefore, we can’t afford to weaken protections for wetlands. In addition to flood control, wetlands provide water filtration, carbon storage, groundwater recharge, erosion control, wildlife habitat, wild foods and medicines, and recreational opportunities. They provide these benefits at minimal cost to taxpayers.
Wetlands are disappearing at an alarming rate.
Wetland loss in southern Ontario exceeds 72 percent and continues to drop. In municipalities such as Russell & Prescott, wetland losses exceed 85 percent. Given their fundamental importance in responding to the interconnected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, the Government of Ontario should be doing its utmost to strengthen, not weaken, wetland evaluation and protection.
Removing Wetland Complexes from the OWES
As stated in the ERO posting, the OWES is the official procedure to identify PSWs and determine their boundaries, using a science-based scoring system that considers biological, social, hydrological and unique features. Identifying wetland complexes has been integral to the evaluation and scoring process, based on the understanding that delineating “the wetland units into individually recognized wetlands would not be an ecologically or functionally sound process” because:
Wetland complexes are commonly related in a functional way, that is, as a group they tend to have similar or complementary biological, social and/or hydrological functions. Much of the wildlife in the area of the complex is variously dependent upon the presence of the entire complex of wetlands, with each wetland unit contributing to the whole (OWES- Southern Manual, p.39)
MNRF is proposing to no longer consider wetland complexes as part of the OWES, a not science-based plan that will facilitate and promote the “de-listing” of significant wetlands. Despite decades of effort to develop and refine approaches to delineating and scoring wetland complexes, these would be erased from the system. As a result, crucial interconnections among individual wetlands will no longer matter, and smaller wetlands assessed in isolation from the whole won’t qualify.
In the current system, wetland complexes have been a significant factor in designating wetlands as PSWs. Wetlands are complexes based on their proximity to each other and their occurrence within the same watershed. This makes sense from various perspectives, including resilience to climate change impacts: while a small wetland may not be able to protect a town from flooding, a complex of wetlands may be able to.
If MNRF proceeds with the proposed changes, very few new PSWs will be designated in the future, and many existing PSWs will lose that designation and the protection it affords. Developers who want to drain or pave over a wetland will have an easy time with the new piecemeal approach –ignore the complex and separate the evaluation of individual wetlands from the whole. A developer could re-evaluate it without consideration for how it contributes hydrologically or ecologically to the remaining complex. Through this process, the complex could be disassembled until nothing remains of the PSW.
Removing endangered and threatened species from the OWES
MNRF is proposing to no longer recognize the presence of endangered or threatened species in the OWES process, a criterion which is currently a critical factor in determining wetland significance.
Wetlands provide habitat for at least 20 percent of Ontario’s species at risk. Protecting the habitats upon which they rely to carry out their life processes is critical to their survival and recovery. Currently, the presence of endangered or threatened species automatically qualifies the wetland as provincially significant. However, according to the proposed changes, species at risk will be considered only as “provincially tracked species” worth far less in the evaluation. This significant change would affect the assessment of most wetlands in Ontario, leaving many of these wetlands and the critical species that rely on them vulnerable to development.
The loss of habitat is the leading cause of the current biodiversity crisis, and we need to protect our wetlands to prevent the fauna and flora on which we depend from disappearing.
Removing provincial government oversight and coordination removed from the OWES
MNRF is proposing to remove itself from any involvement in OWES, despite its staff’s valuable expertise, from having overseen the process for decades. No central agency would be assigned to coordinate or approve evaluations or to ensure that information about PSW designation is publicly accessible.
Consultation with MNRF would no longer be an option, and the approval authority would be downloaded to municipalities, although many don’t have the expertise. They wouldn’t even be able to consult Conservation Authorities due to the proposed Bill 23 amendments to the Conservation Authorities Act.
A wetland evaluator, likely working for the developers, would have the responsibility to inform, in writing, the municipality and landowners of the outcome of the evaluation or re-evaluation.
MNRF’s abandonment of its role in wetland evaluation is problematic in many respects:
1-	There would be no central administration of the OWES program going forward, including training and certification oversight;
2-	Most wetland evaluation and re-evaluation would be undertaken by evaluators working for development proponents with no checks and balances, creating a build-in bias in favour of development;
3-	There would be no central authority to make decisions regarding conflicting opinions;
4-	MNRF would have no authority to intervene on behalf of the public regarding an evaluation of questionable merit;
5-	MNRF would not be aware of wetland evaluations and outcomes, undermining coordination and public transparency. There would be no centralized process for record-keeping and uploading the information to Land Information Ontario, which is necessary to ensure that public and private organizations and individuals can find, access and share geographic data;
6-	Taxes and landowner eligibility for the Conservation Land Tax Incentive Program would be negatively impacted. MNRF’s approach has been to contact all landowners with more than two hectares of wetland within the PSW and invite them to participate in the tax incentive program. Landowners participating in the program could see this benefit removed if the wetland is re-evaluated and loses its PSW status.
7-	MRNF’s non-involvement would severely compromise its ability to achieve the targets it set out in the Wetland Conservation Strategy for Ontario, 2017-2030: by 2025, the net loss of wetland area and function is halted where wetland loss has been the greatest; an by 2030, a net gain in wetland area and function is achieved where wetland loss has been the greatest.
Misinformation on the analysis of the regulatory impact on the ERO
MNRF’s description of the anticipated impacts of the OWES changes on the ERO posting is misleading and far from comprehensive. They speak only to the effects on business that MNRF anticipates will be positive or neutral. They say nothing about the significant adverse environmental, social or economic impacts related to wetland loss that would arise from the changes to the OWES system. It would appear that no thought has been given to these impacts.
Concluding remarks
Suppose MNRF proceeds with the proposed changes to the OWES. In that case, Ontarians can anticipate that very few PSWs would be designated in the future and that all existing PSWs would be vulnerable to losing that designation. That ongoing wetland loss in Ontario will accelerate and intensify.
Ontario’s wetlands are critical in sustaining healthy communities, enhancing climate change resilience and conserving biodiversity. We urge you not to proceed with the proposed changes to the OWES.

73213,/comment/73213,"I would like to point out the lack of transparency in this ERO posting, starting with the title. It seems dishonest to characterize the changes being proposed as “updates” when, in fact, sweeping changes are being made to the OWES including taking the whole OWES program out of the MNRF.
It also seems somewhat dishonest to suggest that these changes are demanded in the face of “Ontario’s housing supply crisis” when, in fact, these changes would apply to ALL development scenarios, i.e., commercial, residential and industrial. The government is using the housing crisis as a red herring to distract people from the wide range of policies that Bill 23 will change forever, if this Bill is allowed to become law.
The lack of transparency is also apparent in the MNRF’s summary of these changes. According to the MNRF these changes to the OWES are being proposed in order to:
• Add new guidance related to re-evaluation of wetlands and updates to mapping of evaluated wetland boundaries.
• Make changes to better recognize the professional opinion of wetland evaluators and the role of local decision makers (e.g. municipalities)
• Other housekeeping edits to ensure consistency with the above changes throughout the manual.
It may appear from this summary that these changes are minor in nature. But they are anything but that.  Based on my review, these changes open up opportunities to remove the PSW designation for every wetland that has ever been evaluated as a PSW based on the presence of specialized habitat for Threatened and Endangered Species; will remove all references to the OWES in the PPS; will prohibit conservation authorities from providing their technical expertise based on the OWES to municipalities; will eliminate the practice of keeping wetland files and the role of the MNRF to provide assistance to Evaluators based on these files; will prevent conservation authorities from regulating the 120 metre setbacks from PSWs and 30 metre setbacks from evaluated wetlands, and will eliminate “wetland complexes”.
These changes are not minor.
My last comment concerns the lack of due diligence in posting this ERO notice. Members of the public have every right to expect more from the government than a downloadable version of the OWES manual with strikethroughs throughout sections to be deleted and additions inserted in blue font, especially when something as important as this is at stake.
It’s unfair and unreasonable to invite public comment on an ERO posting when members of the public are required to set aside many hours of their time just to sort through the proposed “updates” before they can even get started on a comment.
Every one of these changes could – and should – have been methodically listed in the ERO posting.  The public has every right to expect full transparency from their government regarding changes that have such serious environmental and societal implications.

73215,/comment/73215,"I’m writing to express my opposition to the removal of several key components of our Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES). One of the most concerning segments involves the removal of any discussion of, or evaluation of, wetland complexes. Our wetlands function as complexes, and it’s critical to our understanding and protection of our hydrological features that we continue to evaluate wetlands as such. There are no “efficiencies” to be found in attempting to understanding natural features while ignoring how they work. The critical ecosystem services provided by wetlands - absorbing excess water during flood events, holding and slowly releasing water during drought events, cleaning water as it moves across the landscape - require wetlands to function both biologically and hydrologically. All the wetland functions we rely on will be jeopardized in complex wetlands that are no longer recognized and afforded appropriate protections.
The wholesale removal of Sections 4.1.2.1 and 4.1.2.2, concerning Reproductive Habitat for Endangered or Threatened Species and Migration, Feeding or Hibernation Habitat for an Endangered or Threatened Species, are also greatly concerning. The beginning of Section 4.1.2.1 section reads “The protection of endangered and threatened species and their habitats is necessary in order to slow or prevent the extirpation of species from the province, and, in some cases, to help prevent their extinction on a global basis.” This passage and its associated wetland scoring criteria reflect our current biodiversity crisis across the globe. At least 20 percent of Ontario’s Species at Risk are directly dependent on wetland habitats (Ontario Nature). Southern Ontario has already lost 70% of its wetlands (Ontario Biodiversity Council 2021), and the removal of these components of OWES will only accelerate our already catastrophic biodiversity loss across the province.
The province’s own Housing Affordability Task Force stated that “Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, (…)” (Report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force 2022) and acknowledges that we need not build on environmentally sensitive lands to provide homes for all Ontarians who require them. I encourage you to reconsider these changes in order to PROTECT the future homes of Ontario's from floods, droughts and the ravages of climate change.

73216,/comment/73216,"Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) assessments are critical tools to identify and designate Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs). Designation as a PSW results in a high level of protection for wetlands under provincial law and policy.
If the proposed changes to the OWES are realized, very few wetlands would be deemed provincially significant in the future. Additionally, many (if not most) existing PSWs could lose that designation. In future, very few of Ontario’s wetlands would benefit from the protection that PSW designation currently provides.
The most urgent concerns about the proposed changes to the OWES are:
1. Wetland complexes will no longer be recognized or considered - The OWES evaluation process currently recognizes the interconnectedness of wetlands in close proximity to one another. This interconnectedness contributes to the overall health, functionality, and significance of the entire wetland complex. No longer recognizing the importance of maintaining intact wetland complexes will result in a loss of protection for sensitive wetland habitat.
2. Endangered and threatened species will no longer be recognized - Currently, the presence of endangered or threatened species automatically qualifies a wetland as provincially significant and affords it protected status. The proposed changes to the OWES will diminish the importance given to the presence of endangered or threatened species, leaving both the species and wetlands that they rely on vulnerable to development.
3. Provincial government oversight and coordination will be removed - It is proposed that the MNRF will remove itself from any involvement in Ontario’s wetland evaluation process. Additionally, no central agency has been proposed to coordinate/approve evaluations or ensure that information about PSW designation is publicly accessible. Instead, it appears that approval authority will be downloaded to municipalities, many of which have little expertise and would no longer be able to consult with conservation authorities (due to proposed Bill 23 amendments to the Conservation Authorities Act). The onus would instead be on the wetland evaluator (working in most cases for the development agency) to inform the municipality and landowners in writing about the outcome of the evaluation or re-evaluation.
The stated purpose of the OWES overhaul is to streamline the wetland evaluation process in order to construct 1.5 million new housing units over the next 10 years. This purpose is misguided and misleading, given that a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the housing shortage - this was stated by the Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force in its 2022 report. The amount of greenfield land already designated for development within municipal settlement boundaries, but still sitting unbuilt, far exceeds what is needed to meet long range housing targets.
Ontario’s wetlands play a critical role in sustaining healthy communities, enhancing climate change resilience and conserving biodiversity. I am therefore opposed to the proposed overhaul of the OWES.

73217,/comment/73217,"Hello here are my thoughts about the changes to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.
-I am not sure why the wetland evaluation system seems to only apply to municipalities now. Does the system no longer apply to the Ontario Government? If that is the case, I believe that is wrong and the government should not be exempt from having to use it. Why are the conservation authorities not involved with using the system anymore either? It would seem to me that they should be, as conservation authorities manage wetland areas.
-It would also seem to me that many of the changes aimed to remove redundancies, are in fact removing safeguards to make sure that wetlands are properly evaluated by multiple parties, and that they are evaluating multiple important features of wetlands, including evaluating for endangered species.
-Re-evaluation of a wetland system in my mind can lead to the potential for systematic abuse, and harm to a wetland system by a landowner, followed by a subsequent re-evaluation. We farm just outside of the GTA, and we have seen, on several occasions, destruction of natural wetland areas by developer-landowners, in an attempt to shrink them in size. Re-evaluations could then potentially allow for this man-made shrinkage in wetland area to be 'approved' as far as mapping is concerned.
-Removing the idea of a wetland complex seems ridiculous to me. Is that supported by current ecological science? The entire wetland area should be considered as a single unit, as it functions together, and not separate of each element.
-The idea of any tillage in an agricultural system removing wetland consideration is quite frankly ridiculous. We have farmed many areas that *technically* we could get the tractor through and work up the soil, but absolutely should not be considered as good farm ground. Some areas are wet, and should remain wet and provide habitat, it is a better and more appropriate use of the land.
-It is unclear why all of the requirements for a catchment basin, particularly the mapping and record keeping portion, are being removed.
I only made it about halfway through the document, as my time was limited, but there appears to many redactions in place throughout the document that remove items that added clarity to the document. These removed items also functioned to mitigate misinterpretation throughout the document, and it is unclear to me why they were removed. Most of the changes in the document do appear to me to have the potential for abuse and removal of wetland protections, and I strongly encourage that this document be reviewed further by experts in the field of ecological and biological sciences before it is approved.  Wetlands are a critical part of our ecosystems, water supplies, and flood protection, and they should be evaluated to the fullest extent by experts in the field. This document should reflect that, and should give priority to wetland protection over ease of development.

Besides, there's plenty of apartments sitting empty in most major cities in this province. Please don't go forward with this, I wish to share the beauty of our wetlands with future generations

73220,/comment/73220,"The “Green Belt Policies” state that they were designed to protect “Ontario’s …. farmland,
communities, forests, wetlands and watersheds” (Green Belt Plan, 2017). However, the Green
Belt does little to protect Niagara’s Wetlands because only 4.6% of our remaining wetlands are
located within the Green Belt boundaries, leaving 95.4% outside the planning protection area
(Fig. 1). This means in the case of Niagara the Green Belt is pushing urban development into
direct conflict with our remaining wetlands and our highest biodiversity areas.
This also means the protection of 95.4% of the remaining wetlands in Niagara depends upon
the provincial policy statement, Niagara Region environmental policies, municipal policies,
Conservation Authority regulations and policies and the Environmental Impact Study (EIS)
process.
This bill and its proposed updates to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System will not protect the remaining wetland but rather eliminate what little remains and allow changes to made without the knowledge and expertise that we need to put forward to protect what little we have left.
