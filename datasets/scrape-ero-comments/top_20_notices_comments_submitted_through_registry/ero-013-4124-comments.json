This is essentially a legislated slaughter of a\nspecies for no scientific reason other than some uninformed people are looking\nfor a scapegoat for declining fish stocks.\nI live close to Lake Nipissing and I cannot imagine the mess this is going to\nmake when \"hunters\" go to a roosting island and blast away 50 Cormorants each\nand then leave them to rot there. Nobody is going to pick them up and dispose of them properly.\nThis is possibly the most insane proposal that I have seen from the MNRF in my\nrecent memory and if this passes they should be absolutely ashamed of\nthemselves as a natural resource agency. Go back to the drawing board and where\nthere are valid ecological issues, perhaps the degradation of some island\necosites, and come up with a real management plan that addresses that issue.\n",

I do not agree with that. Also, having countless people taking pot shots at cormorants during the busy lakeside summer season will undoubtedly result in some innocent human deaths and serious injuries. I agree that Double-crested Cormorants are arguably a pest and there is a a reasonable argument (that I don't agree with at present population levels) that they should be controlled. If they need to be controlled, there are ways of culling populations that are efficient and humane and do not involve hundreds of shotgun-toting macho types roaming around to the detriment of everyone else. For example, removing and destroying a percentage of the eggs. Also note that many, if not most, of the cormorant populations are in urban areas (Toronto, Burlington, Hamilton). We don't allow hunting in those areas now and we certainly don't need to start.\n",

Will they be targeted next?  Leave the cormorants alone.  Do not mess with the natural food chain.  The animals need our help in this crazy world of changing climate.\nThe concept of a bag limit of fifty birds a day and then allowing the flesh to rot is reprehensible.  How is this sustainable? How is this a positive use of Ministry monies?  Let us be looking at the decline in the Moose population and how we are dealing with that.

        "comment":"I object to Double Crested Cormorants being listed as \"game\" birds.  They are not traditionally used as food.  The only purpose of the hunt appears to be to eliminate a once endangered species that is a native to the Canadian environment. This is underlined by the fact that the proposed legislation will allow hunters to keep the meat until it putrifies.\nThe apparent purpose is to protect fish stocks and prevent the birds from spoiling trees at their breeding sites.  I am old enough to remember when there were wind rows of dead fish fowling every shoreline on Lake Ontario because Cormorants and other fishing birds were not available to balance  their numbers. It is true that Cormorant colonies can kill trees but they also supply guano that feeds new understory and refreshes the soil, enriching new tree growth.\nThe hunting season is way too long and impinges on the Cormorant's breeding season. Cormorant colonies are not single species places. Many other birds breed at these sites including most of Ontario's gulls,Common Terns, Caspian Terns, Black Crowned Night Herons, Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets etc. Allowing hunting of Cormorants during the breeding season will greatly endanger these other species, many of whom are struggling to survive with habitat loss and global warming.The months when Cormorants can be hunted (which, in my opinion is never) must be reduced to late summer or fall.\nThe politics of keeping the fishing community happy at the expense of this elegant fishing bird is simply not justified.  We humans are causing the 6th extinction. There is no need to make Double Crested Cormorants a victim of our thoughtless greed.\n",

So  as this bird is a fish eater   like the merganser its taste is acquired at best. Hence I think you need to  call this a\" cull\" and separate from the migratory bird act. You need a places  the dead birds can be dropped at to make sure they are not being wasted,Maybe  the private sector might need them for dog or cat food or feeding sled dogs ,bait for trappers,in digenous peoples  for there feathers?

The wording in the proposal is indicative: \"There continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners)...\" Concerns are fine, but there is no evidence base to support a need to cull cormorants. In fact, as described in the proposal, the latest information indicates that Great Lakes populations have stabilized or declined slightly. So the need for \"population management\" is not supported by the facts.\nMoreover, the proposal to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to allow hunters to let the carcasses spoil and the idea of a 50\/day bag limit and no possession limit makes clear that this proposal is intended to facilitate a major cull of this species by hunters.\nIt would be preferable that in considering this proposal the Ministry paid more attention to science and less to uninformed opinion.\n",

Hunting these birds will terribly disturb the breeding grounds of countless other birds and is absolutely not a viable solution to the problem. Possibly a more restricted hunting season would be better if this plan goes through. Examples of the trouble with hunting other birds such as duck season give a very obvious indication of the troubles. When hunting season is open for ducks, most of the bird species go into hiding and it greatly disturbs their livelihood, foraging, and general well being. This occurs so badly in some of our provincial parks where duck hunting is allowed usually on alternate days that the wildlife rarely come out of hiding even on the non-hunting days. To assume that some guidelines for hunters would have any affect is absolutely ludicrous. An example of this is after duck hunting was changed to allow Sunday hunting (ie. 7 days a week), I no longer am able to go out onto the lake where I live from opening day on. This is because there are always some hunters that are irresponsible and very careless no matter what advice they are given. I can give many examples of this occurring. Due to this behavior, it would spell disaster for all concerned, wildlife and humans for the entire season.\nYou absolutely can not allow the plan to proceed in it's current form.\n",

The United States FWS has estimated that the entire population of cormorants nesting across the Great Lakes region at 200-240,000 birds, having made a substantial recovery since the 1970s, and holding stable since the early 2000s. Under the limits set by this proposal (which would conceivably permit the taking of 14,550 cormorants per person per year), one single hunter could conceivably extirpate the entire Great Lakes population of cormorants in less than two decades. This proposal is, quite simply, an eradication plan for Double-crested Cormorant masquerading as a \"sustainable\" wildlife management strategy. Furthermore, the suggestion that the implementation of this management plan would be \"neutral\" completely disregards even the most fundamental aspects of biology, and since cormorants are colonial nesters with other, protected waterbirds, hunting throughout the nesting season places a host of other species at unnecessary risk.\nEven the most cursory analysis of its basis, methods, and suggested limits makes it an unconscionable management plan; rather, this is a cormorant eradication proposal masquerading as wildlife management.\n",

I live and fish near Mohawk Island on Lake Erie and have noticed over the past several years that the cormorant colony has exploded and displaced all other gull and shore birds that were commonly observed.  Now flocks of thousands of cormorants frequent the waters in a 5km radius around the island and huge flocks can be seen flying to and away from the Island.  I would gladly participate in a hunt for Cormorants in this area and anywhere else that the population has overwhelmed the local environment.\n",

        "comment":"Besides the proposal to allow shotgun use for hunting, I propose the use of pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) air rifles with scopes. Most PCP pellet guns cost considerably more than most shotguns and are used at gun clubs or private property.  They are extremely accurate out to 100 meters and beyond, can be had in many cailbers of pellets, mostly at speeds just under 1000 feet per second. This is slower than shotguns and dispenses one shot at a time rather than 50 to 100 pellets.  An FAC is required because of the higher than 500 fps. speed. Most cheap break barrel air rifles do not have the accuracy and mainly the power to humanely dispose of a cormorant. PCP air rifles are used by many pest control companies to control pigeon populations in warehouses and steel mill buildings. Furthermore, PCP air rifles make considerably less noise than even a 410 shotgun. Shotgun users will not only shoot birds on the water or land, but will shoot at birds flying, creating hazards to people within a few hundred yards from falling buckshot. PCP air rifle users would only shoot at sitting birds, eliminating the extra hazard. I propose the use of the three smallest calibers - .177, .22, and .25 . Any larger calibers would be overkill and also travel a greater distance due to the weight of the pellet.\n",

The trees they roost in and the soil beneath their roosts become so whitewashed with guano that nothing grows there anymore. This is something I have observed in small inland lakes near Owen Sound and in places on the Lake Erie shoreline.\nA hunt will help to reduce their numbers and to reclaim some of the shorelines they have been destroying.  It may offer a modest boost to tourism as I know people from both sides of the border who would like to help reduce cormorant numbers. Of course I would want to see this carried out ethically and responsibly (as any other hunt should be, usually is) to ensure public safety is maximized and neighbourhood effects (noise and image of hunting is offensive to some) are minimized.\nIf there is a way to use these birds as table fare I would want that emphasized in the regulations in order to provide hunters with the information they need to safely consume these birds. I can't imagine they'd be all that different from some of the diving ducks that are hunted.\n",

By the way i don't think that hunting cormorants will resuce their populations -- proof? Relaxed regs on Giant Canada Geese in S.

Cormorants do not nest on their own but rather with other colony nesting species - for instance Great Egret, Great Blue Heron, Black-crowned Nightheron, White Pelican, Common Tern.  Allowing a hunt during breeding season will cause major disruption to these species and others as well. Some undoubtedly would be collateral damage due to poor aim or misidentification, but also breeding success would be at severe risk with shooting going on all around.\nAlso, \"the ministry will implement a monitoring programme\" - surely any monitoring programme needs to begin BEFORE any hunt to truly assess impact - how can you assess without a baseline?\nThe proposal to not have to dispose of the corpses would also seem to be a problem - imagine 10 hunters shooting 50 birds\/day each at one colony.  The rotting flesh would be considerable.\nI disagree that cormorants are having any major impact on fishing or other interests, but if a hunt is going to be done, at least restrict it to September on to ensure that other species have successfully nested and left the nesting area - though even in September egrets and herons tend to return to their nesting roosts.\n",

Their perception of this issue is a value-judgement. The science tells us that DCCO are opportunistic feeders and will select different prey species in different situations, so sweeping generalizations like DCCO are wiping out game or commercial fish species are usually nonsensical.\nCommon Loons, Common Mergansers, Great Blue Herons and other bird species also eat fish, including game species. Thankfully these birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Convention Act (MBCA). If the public and commercial fishers put pressure on the OMNRF would you approach the Canadian Wildlife Service to propose the de-regulation and shooting these species in Ontario too? American White Pelicans eat game fish and are not protected by the MBCA so will you consider the shooting of them one day too?\nI enjoy hunting game animals and birds and am not opposed to hunting. I eat what I bag but DCCO hunters, or anybody else for that matter, are not going to eat distasteful birds like DCCO. What is the OMNRF proposing to do about the potentially high number of DCCO carcasses left behind by hunters? Your public posting does not tell us. Since nobody will be eating these birds, this will be a 'sport hunt', but do have any idea if hunters will be willing to spend their time and money shooting something they can't eat? Have you asked the hunting community? If so, why didn't you post their answers in your porposal? Do you have any evidence to support the idea that there will be enough hunting mortality to actually help acheive population management goals for DCCO in Ontario?\nMost importantly, DCCO use lakes that campers, cottagers, paddlers and sailors also use and at the same time of year. I have a great concern about the safety implications of your proposal. Hunters discharing firearms from shore or stationary boats in prime recreation seasons and locations has too much potential for conflict, injuries, or even deaths. Your regulations may speak to this but how can this be effectively enforced with your chronically under-funded conservation officers, who are already over-worked and seldom, if ever, seen on field patrols?\nThe OMNRF needs to abandon this ridiculous and unsafe proposal. Instead, you should spend more time and money on proactive approaches such as researching and implementing alternative methods of game bird management or focussing more on addressing the issue of invasive fish species eradication.\n",

I do think the dates of June 16 to August 31 are more reasonable for the whole province and not just Central and Northern Ontario.  The start date will be outside of the nesting period.  Cormorants gather where other birds gather: Great Blue Herons, Black-crowned Night Herons, Great Egrets, Common and Caspian Terns, Ring-billed and Herring Gulls.  Those birds will have their nesting cycles disrupted in Southern Ontario if the start date of March 15 is allowed to stand.  Their numbers (except for gulls) are decreasing as it is.  Another item that concerns me is the disposal of the cormorant carcasses.  You do not note in your proposal where or how these birds will be or can be disposed of.

Entire colonies could be wiped out by a few individuals in a day. Not to mention the cruelty of allowing hunting during the breeding season, allowing their young chicks to starve\/freeze to death without the protection of their parents. These birds nest among other water birds that would also be disturbed or harmed during their breeding season as well, such as Great Blue Herons. People shouldn't be allowed to tromp into a wetland or waterfront with guns during the breeding season. Period.\n",

There has been a significant decline in the fish populations in the lake and I know you can say it may be many factors but watching these birds eat you can tell they have an impact. For a bird who eats only fish to flourish the way they have I can only deduce that they are eating a lot of fish. I for one will participate in this just to remove them from our lake and restore a once beautiful island with living trees back to its previous state. They have reduced a whole island to a toxic waste site that you cannot even go near. Cant wait to see this implemented.\n",

Governments have shunned away from any type of hunt due to the push back of a few birding groups and animal rights fanatics. These are invasive species that were not native to this area and they have impacted the environment in many negative ways.\nThese birds out compete other types of waterbirds, adding to the decline of other bird populations, their excrement is a toxic substance that devoids the landscape of any natural vegetation. This compounds issues in areas of rare species habitats, like those found in many of Ontario's provincial parks.\nThese birds provide little natural benefits, they consume large numbers of baitfish and gamefish that are beneficial to Ontario's environment and creates a negative impact on its fisheries.\nWe must act now to control and reduce the Double Crested Cormorants population and start fixing all the natural impacts these birds have destroyed. We must stop their expansion into Ontario's valuable natural ecosystems and minimize the impact that they have.\nThe fact that birders actually watch these ugly things is a joke. They are not special and they do not hold any natural beauty, they are invasive threats that need to be curtailed.\n",

Creating a season where individuals can go out and shoot on open water could potentially create conflict with other users (boaters, fishermen, cottagers...) and increase accidental harm to property or people.\n3. Shooting a species and not utilizing that species is a crime against nature.\n4. This may open the door to permit shooting of other species which are troublesome to some people. Why not shoot loons? They eat lots of fish. Why not shoot gulls on the same lakes where cormorants are found? They're noisy and eat fish.\n",

For starters, it would generate a new source income for the ministry of natural resources by having more people buy licences to hunt them as well as the enforcement of the polices and procedures. Secondly, opening up a season would help ease rising tensions between the local fisheries the community and the ministry of natural resources (MNR). Lastly, as an avid outdoors man I have noticed a significant increase in the double- crested cormorant in Ontario over the past few years. They not only have killed all of the vegetation on sister island but they have also have a ferocious appetite for fish. The MNR already has to cull hundreds if not thousands of these birds annually why not open it up to outdoors man as well?\n",

As colony nesters I suspect that double-breasted cormorants  are naturally disturbed by occasional nest predators.

To gauge not only the hunting impact on the cormorant population, but the hoped for recovery of bait fish and forested areas.  I'd also suggest expanding the hunt to include Canada Geese too.\n",

        "comment":"This is a bad idea.\nCormorants have been heavily persecuted because of perceived impacts, even at times when there were less than 1000 pairs in all of Ontario and they were on the verge of extinction. Special interest groups continue to view them as nuisance and direct competition for resources they have no demonstrable effect on and whether they are present or not. The reality is cormorants are part of a complex food web and removing them will have a knock on effect in lowering general biodiversity in Ontario. With an open season like the one described, one single person can decide to take out an entire colony of cormorants even if the majority of stakeholders on the water body disagree. This is a bad move. Instead, the province should study cormorants in their habitat over multiple years to get a real idea of their role in the ecosystem and only remove them when they pose a specific threat that can be substantiated. I guarantee you that there is at least one person per lake that will make it their mission to eradicate cormorants.\nRebounding cormorants have had over 40 years to negatively affect fish populations and they haven't. Now, as predicted, cormorant populations are stabilizing via vectors such as Newcastle disease. An open season will disrupt this process.\nThe following is a non exhaustive list of species that have already been devastated or extirpated by human activity in Ontario. A number of these species were extirpated by the very groups that want to delist cormorants. I don't want to see more biodiversity gone forever:\nPassenger Pigeon, Timber Rattlesnake, Eastern Box Turtle, Lake Ontario Kiyi, Blue Walleye, Atlantic Salmon, Paddlefish, Gravel Chub, Deepwater Cisco, Blackfin Cisco, Shortnose Cisco, Loggerheaded Shrike, Greater Prairie Chicken, Illinois tick-trefoil, butternut, american chestnut, american elm, and ash trees, American burying beetle, Trumpeter Swan, American Badger, Blanding's Turtle, Frosted Elfin, Karner Blue, eastern Elk, eastern cougar, carolina parakeet.\n",

        "comment":"My main concern stems from the unlikelihood that cormorants shot will be consumed.  As a hunter, I know few, if any, hunters who will eat merganser due to the reputation of their flesh tasting like their diet (fishy).  Hunters will be even less likely to consume cormorants.  It seems misleading to me to reclassify them as a game bird to allow hunting of them when it\u2019s highly likely (and no secrete) that most birds killed will go straight in the trash.  Hunters all over the place will be wasting game meat, an illegal act, while setting a bad example for new and young hunters by doing so.  Few will ever be caught in the act as the enforcement branch of the OMNRF and the Federal counterpart (they are a migratory bird and so I assume the Feds are largely responsible for enforcement) are pathetically underfunded, but it will be happening and those regulators who have put together this proposal are aware of this.\nIt seems to me the motivation to reclassify cormorants as game birds does not come from a desire for these birds to be harvested and consumed, but simply for them to be killed in the hopes of \u201ccontrolling\u201d them.  Doesn\u2019t sound like a \u201cgame bird\u201d.  While I am not completely up to speed with the available literature on the impacts of cormorants on fish populations, I suspect this proposed hunt is not backed by evidence, but instead is motivated by pressure from a minority of citizens lobbying to have them controlled because of the assumed negative impact they are having on some fish communities. This is the easy solution to get those lobbying for the rights to kill cormorants to be quite, however I suspect our game fish populations would benefit more from additional enforcement of both recreational and commercial fisheries than a slight reduction in cormorant population size.  I recognize that I\u2019m not comparing apples to apples as additional enforcement efforts would cost a great deal more than the addition of this hunt, however my point is that we\u2019re likely not addressing the real threats to our game fish populations with this hunt.\nLastly, I am also a bit troubled by the idea of folks hunting cormorants during the summer months when recreational boating\/water use is at its peak.  To allow folks with a valid small game licence to hunt cormorants during the summer is asking for a lot of unnecessary conflict and potentially dangerous situations.\n",

They wait for the fry\/fingerlings to start out the creek\/river and then gorge themselves. This is certainly detrimental to efforts of stocking and a great deal of money is lost.

I have personally witnessed the deforestation on Middle Island, East and Middle Sister Islands.  The deforestation leads to erosion.  Their guano can be 20+cm deep which kills the trees, breeds bacteria, overnutrifies the surrounding water causing harmful algae blooms, and is the ideal environment to breed the invasion of flies that spread disease.  Their absolutely voracious appetite for fish in the limited spawning grounds is hurting the fishery.  According to Parks Canada, the population of cormorants on Middle Island was 3 breeding pairs in 1987 which rose to over 5000 breeding pairs by 2009 and they estimated that approximately 400 breeding pairs was appropriate.  The Canadian Coast Guard even has to wear hazmat suits when servicing their navigation aids.  There needs to be a 90 percent cull in the cormorant population.  Not only hunters but non-hunting firearms owners should be allowed to participate as well.\n",

Their waste kills all trees and vegetation.  This has caused islands to disappear from erosion.  I have seen 2 small islands that have been there for years, just disappear, as the trees  that were on the islands died from Cormorants.  With no roots from the living trees to hold the soil, they just eroded away.  Other larger islands are now bare of all life take the smaller islands west of Pelee Island, there are no trees there now.  All of this caused by these birds.

I do see abandoned dead birds floating all over the great lakes and other species such as Common and Caspian Terns, Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, Black Crowned Night Herons,  Ringbilled and Herring Gulls which nest adjacent or amongst cormorant colonies being disturbed.  At present I believe Bald Eagles are starting to control DCCO numbers, at least on the North Channel of Lake Huron. I have twice witnessed eagles preying on adult cormorants early in the Spring while ice fishing off Algoma Mills Ontario( Magazine Island colony area) in late March when only river mouths have open water. On several DCCO colonies In Georgian Bay I have seen Bald Eagles feeding on adult Dcco's  while counting nests in May and expect when young are hatched they also are preyed upon by eagles. I've worked with researchers from Canada,Ontario and the USA and ten years ago visited every DCCO colony known on the Canadian side of Lake Huron. I can see having certain areas open ( ie MacGregor Bay near Little Current ) where the birds may be limiting walleye rehabilitation efforts but Judging from the large amounts of Gobies I observed at many Lake Huron nests, cormorants may be playing a positive role on removing introduced species. Vegetation is not affected on the rock outcrop islands found in the North Channel and Georgian Bay areas. Their affect on trees in Southern Lake Huron  and in the Kingston area was very noticeable on several islands.  These islands did not appear to have multiple species nesting on them other than gulls. I would support hunting in specific areas where severe vegetation damage is occurring.\nI am a ardent hunter and angler and am not a fan of cormorants completing with anglers or commercial fishermen for fish stocks. I really see this as a poorly thought out proposal to appease a few special interest groups that will not improve over all fish stocks.\n",

For the cormorants: Those that shoot cormorants are unlikely to eat them and unlikely to bother recovering the bodies or even ensuring that they are dead. I anticipate numerous wounded, injured birds left to die slowly. If they do go ashore to recover bodies they risk disturbing other nesting species, particularly those nesting on the ground.\n2. For other nesting species: Cormorants nest in conjunction with other species such as Herring Gull, Ring-billed Gull, Common Tern, Caspian Tern, Great Blue Heron, Black-crowned Night-heron, Great Egret. Those that shoot cormorants will have little concern for or awareness of other species. Shooting may be haphazard or careless. Birds of other species may be killed or injured. If shooters go ashore they may disturb the nests of other species, particularly those that nest on the ground.\n",

Considering the immense damage to these waterfront habitats, destruction of other waterfowl habitat, the damage to the fishery, and the current population of the species in Ontario, it is time that an active population control mechanism is put into place.\nI would suggest that even a licensed hunting season as proposed will not likely have an influence on the population in certain areas because the vast majority of waterfowl hunters will simply not target this species to eat, and therefore, will not represent a significant impact.\nWe are very much in support of this proposed regulatory change and I applaud the Ministry for finally making efforts to bring about such change.\n",

They are a terrible game bird and are likely to be \"hunted\" (read as eradicated) due to their colony behaviour.\nTheir populations, while rebounding thanks to zebra muscles cleaning the water, are still vulnerable and have not yet stabilized.

In fact their recovery was touted by many as a sign of environmental improvements.\nIt is also true the MNRF hold the responsibility to monitor and where necessary regulate Ontario's wildlife populations.  If we agree the population is indeed excessive, causing adverse impacts of other plant and animal populations or unnecessarily negatively impacting commerce then recommending population controls may well be appropriate.\nHOW you go about this is my concern.\nI am an active hunter and have been for in excess of 40yrs.  I am very concerned with the image of Ontario's hunters in the eyes of the general public.  In most instances the average Ontario resident is not well versed (educated) on wildlife management principles and practices.\nIn my opinion they do not completely understand the role hunting plays in wildlife management.\nI realize MNRF is looking at how best to accomplish a management objective, I get that.  But please look past your desired outcome of cormorant controls, consider the potential harm you are generating to the image of the hunter and the legislation.\nThe hunting population is facing many challenges and image is one of them.\nWe have negative news (and MNRF requests for assistance) reports of hunters shooting and abandoning wildlife (moose for example) on one hand while on the other you propose legislative changes to the very Acts and regulations that are in place to prosecute these unethical individuals to allow for exactly that!\nVery confusing messaging for the general public and young hunters and I would suggest the lower courts to grasp.\nDemographics show a shrinking hunter population and slow recruitment.  It is imperative the image of the hunter be considered here.\nI appreciate MNRF looks to the cadre of licenced hunters as a potential management tool here and is (in my opinion) downloading a workload responsibility.\nTo alter the FWCA to allow and encourage the open slaughter and deliberate waste of any animal is to attract extreme negative fallout from the non-hunting population.   It will be the Hunter who takes the blame here and this will foster a truly negative image.\nI feel this to be a very slippery slope you are proposing.

The groups concerned or bothered by the birds are those with financial interest in seeing their population wiped out. Certainly it is the easy way out, isn't it? Would it not be prudent to do a full population analysis and do further observation to see exactly what kind of an impact the population of the double-crested cormorant is having on other species? Furthermore, the human species is the most destructive of all, and by far the most responsible for the decline in the fish populations, both due to over fishing and to the decline of their environment through pollution and climate change.\nHunting these birds is not an acceptable solution to their overpopulation, if indeed there is truly an overpopulation. I enjoy being out on the water, near the water, and certainly do not want my time to be affected by the worry of hunters out to kill for fun. Not with my tax dollars.

Yes they eat fish but analysis of stomach  contents from colonies studied on Lake Nipissing, Ontario revealed that the vast majority of fish species consumed where not those the anglers sought.  (Not large quantities of walleye, pike or bass but rather perch, shiners, and other minnow species).   What's more, colonies once established, began a decline to stable population levels that seem to be in harmony with the environment.\nI am a hunter.  Hunting to me involves the ethical and humane harvest of an animal one intends to eat or to make use of for some other legitimate purpose.  (Hides for leather, etc.)  Hunting involves respect for the life of any animal you are taking.\nThis proposal to hunt cormorants seems to be fed by a desire to eliminate the bird from areas where it is being blamed for sport fish population declines, without the scientific studies to back that claim.\nTo kill for the sake of killing is not what hunting is about and legalizing cormorant culling through hunting regulations is in my opinion a poor way to walk away from doing the research required to determine if the problem is actually real or imagined.\nHunting is on the decline in Ontario as more and more folks chose not to participate in this historic activity.  Please do not give our sport another black eye in the public forum by passing this legislation.  There is no way to justify this to those that do not hunt.  This will simply create more opposition to hunting in the future, a pressure our sport does not need.\nI suspect that most people supporting this initiative are those bent on removing cormorants from the environment entirely.  A summer hunt with a 50 bird \"daily?\" limit will allow participants to kill the birds in nesting colonies.  The lack of a requirement to utilize the killed birds may well result in increased complaints of dead cormorants found rotting on the water or islands by summer tourists.  Tourists not interested in seeing birds killed and wasted out of what I consider a misguided attempt to cover up MNRF's failure to properly manage the fisheries.\nThank you\n",

        "comment":"Compared to other game bird hunting laws, the proposed hunting season for the double-crested cormorant is far too permissive. I think that it should be more like duck hunting, e.g. a season limited to the fall (after breeding is over), with a daily bag limit of 5 or 6, and a possession limit of around 18. All other game is not permitted to spoil. This should also apply to the cormorant. If people are not willing to eat the game birds, they should not be permitted to hunt them.\n",

Whether it is east sister island on Lake Erie or Snake island in Fathom five national marine park, these birds really do severely impact the areas they decide to flourish in. Not only do they make the areas they live in aesthetically not pleasing due to the stench they create, the noise they emit in the larger colony\u2019s, but also the damage they do to tree canopy\u2019s, the ground below these trees, and the amount of fish they take from the waters. I very much support the hunting season for double crested cormorants and as a licenced firearms holder and hunter I would happily take part in the season on my own land including some restored gravel pits my father in law owns in-land from Lake Huron.

        "comment":"I am strongly opposed to the proposal for many reasons. Most of them were outlined in Linda R. Wires extensively researched book \"The Double-Crested Cormorant\" (Yale University Press, 2014). I urge the decision makers to read it if they haven't already. I have much first-hand experience with these birds personally. I find it disturbing that the proposed season occurs during nesting season. This will leave nestlings without parents and leave the orphaned cormorants to die a slow painful death by starvation. Additionally I have observed that cormorant nesting grounds are shared by other species that are sure to be affected by hunting activity. These include ring-billed, herring, and Thayers gulls as well as common & Caspian terns, black-crowned night herons, great egrets, and great blue herons. The argument that cormorant numbers are large is not a valid one for these colony nesting birds. The passenger pigeon was once the most plentiful bird on the planet & was hunted to extinction. The double-crested cormorant was virtually extinct in the Great Lakes region not long ago. Describing cormorants as \"game birds\" is preposterous. My ancient copy of \"The Joy of Cooking\" contains recipes for any game a person could think of; cormorants are not among them. I imagine them being foul (no pun intended) tasting, fishy & oily. These birds are native to Ontario, not introduced and as such are subject to the same natural checks & balances found with other native creatures. The long lines of cormorants flying low over the lake where I live are a magnificent spectacle and source of serenity for me. It would be a tragedy for this to end. Having researched the topic of this proposal I can only conclude proceeding would cause certain harm and provide no benefit either to people or our natural world.\n",

Double-crested cormorants are eating the biodiversity from our Ontario waters by eating copious amounts of fish per bird per day. Their excrement is killing the habitat that they reside in. For an example look at the islands that are denuded of plant life just off the shore of Presqu'ile Provincial Park. I totally agree with the listing of double-crested cormorants for a hunting season. Please change the regulations to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants to protect our fish, wild places, and the wildlife that live in these wild-places. We need to reduce the populations of double-crested cormorants to protect the other birds, the fish and other wildlife that are trying to co-exist in the wild-places double-crested cormorants are in.\n",

Season is way too long, in particular it should not be in breeding season, will cause way to much disruption\n2. Many other species of breeding birds will inadvertently get shot, since cormorants are typically associated with many other species such as herons, tern, waterfowl, gulls.  Even if not killed these other species would be disrupted throughout their sensitive breeding season, affecting their reproduction\n3. a daily bag limit of 50 and no season limit is way too high to be sustainable\n4. Cormorant is not an edible species, so this killing would be solely for sport.  This is very cruel and wasteful practice for a civilized society.  We could expect to see large numbers of dead cormorants rotting on our shorelines\n5. Allowing hunters out in spring and summer would make natural areas dangerous for the public for most of the year.  Currently we know that only in autumn does public need to avoid hunting areas.\n6.

I have watched them in spring spawning beds around Mitchels Bay gorging on the new hatch. They are a lethal predator, small fish stand little chance of escaping . The roost trees they choose soon die from their acid like droppings. There is no such thing as catch and release with these birds , sportsfishing has felt their  presence in a negative way.

The cormorant population in the Bay of Quinte region that I call home is seemingly \"out of control\".\nThere are many islands in our beloved bay that have been destroyed in recent years, turned to mere piles of barren rock with no signs of vegetation. These are islands that once flourished with vegetation, until the cormorants began to nest on them. Not only are these \"dead\" islands unsightly, but I would assume the lack of growth negatively effects the other wildlife that would otherwise inhabit these islands (I.e. less food, less cover\/shelter).\nIn recent years while goose hunting in fields closely bordering the bay we have witnessed almost daily certain times of the year (late September through mid October) Cormorants flying overhead by the thousands. With this vast number of Cormorants in the area, I can only believe that they are having a negative impact on our ecosystem.\nThis is why I agree that we should open a hunting season for Double-Crested Cormorants in Ontario.\n",

        "comment":"Hello,\n     I have read through the proposed Double Crested cormorant hunting plan and have several concerns. I am indeed a supporter of sustainable hunting, but this proposal does not seem to be sustainable at all. First, the proposed cormorant hunting season spans the entirety of the breeding season, and hunting activities will likely disrupt much breeding activity and prevent the birds from replenishing hunted numbers.  In addition to this, many other seabirds, such as gulls and terns, share breeding grounds with Double Crested cormorants and may also be disturbed by hunting activities even though they are not being directly targeted. My second concern involves the number of birds allowed to be hunted. A 50 per day limit and zero possession limit seems incredibly high, and given the above mentioned breeding disruption, I cannot see how this is sustainable.\n     I am not against the concept of a cormorant hunting season, but if one were to be implemented I would like to see the season shortened to allow the birds to breed, and a lower daily limit.\n     If the province continues to push for the plan as it is outlined, I would like to see some scientific research conducted by an agency not affiliated with the province or any hunting and fishing organization to prove that the plan is indeed sustainable. Additionally, the proposal states that the concerns over cormorants' impact on fishing quality have been raised by the fishing industry and property owners. I would like to see scientific research proving this claim before the proposed plan comes into effect.\n",

Additionally, other birds such as gulls and terns share breeding grounds with cormorants and will also be disturbed by hunting during the breeding season, even though they are not direct targets.

        "comment":"Double-crested cormorants are in invasive species in Ontario and are likely having a serious detrimental effect on native aquatic habitats and aquatic wildlife species where they compete for food resources and nesting cover\/habitat.  Native fish populations are most certainly impacted in fish rearing habitats such as wetlands and shallow near-shore lake environments.  As a biologist I am seeing the cormorants in spring and summer months foraging in small wetlands in rural Ontario, away from what we traditionally think of as cormorant habitat.  This may be because the species have reached the carrying capacity for their species and competition for food has pushed them to interior wetlands more and more over the years.  They can also consume large volumes if our native fish stocks in all areas where they live.\nIt is possible that cormorants may have a role to play if other aquatic invasives take off in Ontario lakes.  I think of the Asian carp species now at large in the great lakes.  More research is likely needed on this but my opinion is that double-crested cormorants need to be reduced in numbers to something much more sustainable than at present.  Hunters may have a role to play in reaching such a goal.\n",

The idea being that the industry was responsible for very low yellow perch populations. To this day, fishers still cannot catch any quantity of y. perch. What is worth understanding is that the largest nesting colony of cormorants on L. Ont. has existed on Gull Bar & High Bluff Is. since the mid 1980's. It shouldn't be rocket science to realize that in 33 yrs. of virtually no fishing pressure that something other than commercial fishing is impacting y. perch populations. We know that food analyses projects cited alewife as being the main prey spp. but remember that those projects involved summer students & that the projects occurred in early summer when alewife enter shallow water. The main damage that occurs to L. Ont. Y. perch populations happens in early to mid April. At this time, large staging flocks of cormorants congregate & accumulate fat reserves to help them on their northward migration. It is also at this time of year that the L. Ont. spawning stocks of Y. perch are forming large schools in shallow L. Ont. embayments. Large schools of edible sized fish concentrated in shallow water is exactly what the large cooperatively foraging flocks of cormorants are looking for . Remember that cormorants prefer feeding in water depths of 30 ft. or less. The commercial fishery has been requesting cormorant control for years. Cormorant pops. have far surpassed historic levels.

The preamble to this act states:\n\u201cThe best traditions of recreational hunting and fishing should be valued by future generations.\u201d\nI fail to see how shooting a species has no use as food with only the intent to kill it and let it spoil is part of the hunting tradition in this province. This is exactly the type of behaviour that our hunting laws attempt to eliminate. The fact that there has to be an amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to add provisions so hunters could allow cormorant to spoil shows how far this proposal is from the best traditions of hunting.\nAs a hunter myself who thinks it is important that at least a portion of my food comes from the land and connects me directly to our resources, I find this proposal embarrassing and frankly, disgusting to be associated with hunting.\nCurrently, hunting is an activity that is conducted by a relatively small portion of the Ontario public. It is permitted to occur because the majority of non-hunting Ontarians see it as well managed, focussed on providing sustainable food and other benefits to the province. However, permitting activities such as this proposal which is essentially legalizing wanton killing of animals for no use will shift this perception and threaten the support of hunting as a viable activity in the province for the future.\nThere are situations in Ontario where cormorants may be out of balance with the ecosystem. These specific instances can be identified and dealt with, much as they currently are.

        "comment":"I am assuming the current population of Double-crested Cormorants (DCCO) is above its threshold and that's why these harvest regulations seem similar to that of the Snow Goose (SNGO; 50\/day, unlimited poss.)- that's a lot of birds. 50 birds\/day, I don't think is as attainable as one may think. In the SNGO example, we can harvest 50 birds\/day because they are gregarious feeders. large groups typically mean large amounts of food, which in tern allows us to harvest large numbers. Is this the same for the DCCO? Sure, they nest and loaf in colonies, but do they feed in large groups? That raises some serious concern for harvest, which would likely target nesting colonies- areas with large numbers of birds. However, I don't know of many people who would go out to shoot 50 birds\/ day. Again, to put things into perspective, I can go to a nesting colony, shoot 50 birds, and leave every carcass where it lies. I can do this every day of the season. I think this aspect leaves room for kickback from the public. In my opinion, shooting 50 birds and allowing meat to spoil is a cull. Putting lipstick on a pig and calling it your girlfriend does not make it a pretty lady who loves you dearly. Obviously, the above is entirely dependant on hunter participation.\nThere is also a concern regarding legislation amendments. Once we start making alterations to provincial legislature, will we see a cascade of other changes; and, will these amendments be made using sound, scientific evidence? I think this should be avoided. As conservationists we owe it to the birds. Spoiled meat is not acceptable. If this species is to be managed as a game bird, then no meat should go to spoil- period. I'd like to see the \"spoil amendment\" kyboshed. If not, and they have the ability to amend the FWCA, why not allow the commercial sale of the harvested birds. At the very least, an application for a commercial permit which allows a set number of individuals to harvest and sell the birds for profit. The permit would allow commercial harvest to take place in the March-December season; while small games license holders could harvest during regular season (September-December). This way, managers can keep a closer eye on purposeful harvest during commercial seasons, while hunters retain the ability to do their part. This could even be used as an additive management tool with less \"cull-like\" appeal.\nSeason timing and length are another concern. The season would be open during the spring migration various migratory waterbirds\/waterfowl. Harvest would focus on and around colonies where other, FEDERALLY PROTECTED colonial birds\u2019 nest, increasing the possibility of misidentification and accidental harvest. Furthermore, the colonial behaviour means they also share nesting sites with Gulls, Terns, and other water birds. The proposed hunting season overlaps with their nesting periods, which is not ideal as colonial species don't typically take well to disturbance while nesting. This should be a concern for managers, especially when the Black-crowned Night Heron (Species at Risk) is involved.\nThe timing poses additional risk for negative interactions between hunters and recreationalists (fishing, boating, kayaking, etc.). Primarily, during the summer months when there is an increase in watersport activities. This isn't a concern during the regular waterfowl season, as most individuals who partake in boating activities have retired for the season. A simple strategy may be to prohibit harvest in specific areas; or, make the cormorant-specific season line up with the regular waterfowl season. This addresses the misidentification issue, making it \"acceptable\"; it separates the two recreational groups; and alleviates all unwanted pressures on other nesting species. Of course, a separate set of rules\/regulations would need to be developed for commercial permit holders.\nA couple additional questions come to mind when I read the proposal:\n-\t Enforcement in particular, are there even enough provincial officers to enforce the alternate regulations during open fishing seasons? We barely have enough enforcement to cover fishermen standing on shorelines, let alone new migratory bird hunters spread throughout the province.\n-\tDo we have sufficient evidence that they are even impacting sport\/commercial fisheries; and, if we do, at what spatial scale is it occurring? It sounds like this is a provincial wide cull on the DCCO. I think we should be assessing these impacts case by case. I also think that understanding the DCCO colonies\u2019 interspecific interactions on the landscape at given time periods may be something mangers need to investigate further, especially before we implement a province-wide harvest.\no\tExample: Is colony (A) more of an inter-species competition concern, whereas colony (B) is simply and overabundant breeding colony. We may find that different management tools work better for the different colonies. If we intend on designating these birds \u201cGame Birds\u201d, we need to manage them as such.\nHarvest is useful, especially when disturbance isn\u2019t a concern for managers. However, targeting the breeding adults on a colony can be difficult- this is what is needed if we intend on reducing overall numbers. Inversely, management could become a provincial responsibility. This would benefit areas where interference and disturbance of nesting birds is a concern. Simple techniques such as egg oiling or egg and nest removal have worked in the past (Canada goose and various Gulls).\nThese are just a couple things that come to mind. I\u2019m at a stand still. I don\u2019t think we have enough supporting evidence to warrant the development of a species-specific harvest with extremely liberal limits. Though, at the same time, I agree that something needs to be done. I would be in favour of a government-based intervention that does not require the province to revise legislature. I also think the spoiling of meat issue needs to be addressed pending the implementation of the hunting season.\nOverall, the proposal is unique. As a hunter, it does not seem like something I would be interested in participating in. By no means would this be a hunting season, the management strategy proposed seems more like a killing spree. And to be honest, it almost seems like the government wants hunters to do their dirty work; and unfortunately, the public will paint all hunters with the same brush. However, if it comes down to a cull-like management practice, I would hope the evidence supports the decision; and, that managers are open to alternative forms of professional, though resourceful management.\nIf it makes any difference in the credibility of my arguments, I am a future graduate student studying the effects of development on nesting waterfowl. I have my Honours degree in Biology, and my Fish and Wildlife Technician and Technologist diplomas.\n",

In the early 80's herring gull nesting islands became cormorant nesting islands then later as the island died they would be abandoned and the birds would move to another. They would number in the hundreds if not thousands and large rafts of them would sometimes be observed while boating in open lake areas. The food deposited on the nesting islands for young appeared to be perch. As the cormorant numbers increased, the perch population decreased. The Herring gull populations seemed to have decreased. Other birds with similar nesting habits seemed to have decreased. I am not a biologist, these are just personal observations.\nI now see cormorants inhabiting numerous small inland lakes in all regions of Southern Ontario and during fishing trips into Northern Ontario I have observed small flocks of them in every area I visited.\nCormorants were a cursed species by most people within the area where the population appears to be abundant, if not excessive.

Let\u2019s call this proposal what it is: a plan to extirpate an entire species of bird from the province, without any compelling scientific evidence. If cormorant colonies are an issue with sport fish or commercial fish in specific areas, numbers could be controlled by egg oiling and selective culling. But this policy doesn\u2019t care about the proper management of a wild species.\nThe double crested cormorant is not a game bird. Nobody hunts them to eat them, like geese or ducks. And if you make something a \u201cgame\u201d animal, it should follow that the government will manage that resource accordingly, as it does other game animals. You don\u2019t accomplish this by letting people hunt them provincewide from March 15 to December 31, with a personal limit of 50 a day and no possession limit, and let them hunt from stationary boats. You have created (intentionally) a recipe for people who hate cormorants to go to rookeries or approach flocks and simply open fire, with a goal of killing every last one of them.\nAs someone who is regularly on the water on Georgian Bay and hikes in marsh areas where there are limited hunting seasons for waterfowl, this proposal terrifies me. I will have to deal with shotgun-wielding people firing away most of the year, and boats full of people who are out to kill as many cormorants as their daily limit allows. Cormorants flock in open water. Hunters will be firing into these flocks while I and my family could be in the vicinity. You are making Ontario unsafe to satisfy prejudices against an animal.

        "comment":"Dear Public Input Coordinator,\nThis comment concerns the Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario, ERO\/EBR Registry Number 013-4124.\nI wish to voice my strong opposition to this wrongheaded policy proposal and respectfully urge the Ministry not to allow it to proceed.\nAs implicitly acknowledged in the description, the proposed cull of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) is not based on scientific evidence, but rather on the concerns\u2014unfounded, misleading, anecdotal\u2014of groups such as the commercial fishing industry.\nYou are no doubt aware that the best available evidence points to the cormorant population having no perceptible effect on commercial fishing, since cormorants rarely eat large, commercially-harvested fish.\nSays Environment Canada:\n\u201cStudies have repeatedly shown that in a natural environment, cormorants feed primarily on small, largely non-commercial, shallow-water fish.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026concerns do not appear to be valid, since studies of cormorant diets in Lake Ontario show that less than 2% of the prey found in cormorant pellets is Lake Trout or salmon. Also, cormorants consume only about 0.5% of the prey fish, which is insignificant when compared to about 13% taken by sport fish.\u201d\nWhat is being proposed is unnecessary and outrageous. The Ministry acknowledges that \u201cthe latest information [indicates that] Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly\u201d since their peak in the early 2000s.\nEven during the period of population recovery and growth from the 1970s to the early 2000s, threats to cormorants continued to be of concern. In 1992, an outbreak of Newcastle disease killed nearly a third of juvenile cormorants in several colonies. A future viral outbreak could potentially devastate the population, especially if it were to come on the heels of a massive cull.\nThe proposed bag limit of 50 birds per day with no possession limit is unprecedented and dangerously high. Furthermore, it is shameful that the Ministry would allow the spoilage of killed cormorants. This calls to mind the worst hunting excesses of the previous two centuries. It is easy to imagine mounds of dead cormorants rotting. It would be disrespectful of our natural environment and unbecoming of who we are as Ontarians.\nAllowing the hunting of cormorant would also present a grave threat to other species, including those protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act. The common loon (Gavia immer), for example, cannot be easily distinguished from the cormorant on the water. Gail S. Fraser, an Associate Professor at the York University Faculty of Environmental Studies, and an expert on the double-crested cormorant, has been quoted as saying, \u201cAn open season on the cormorant is an open season on the loon.\u201d\nEven without additional pressures, loon numbers are expected by scientists to decline through much of southern and central Ontario in the coming decades.\nTo conclude, everything about this proposal is wrong. It is unscientific, unnecessary, and it does not reflect the principles of the Ministry\u2019s Statement of Environmental Values, which calls on the Ministry to apply a \u201csound understanding of natural and ecological systems\u201d when making decisions.\nThank you for your consideration of my comments.\nSincerely,\n[signed]\n",

Rather, I suspect the driving force behind this proposal is pressure primarily from the OFAH. I'm sure I don't have to tell the MNRF that the claims made by the OFAH are far from objective and ecologically-minded. It is the duty of the MNRF to manage natural resources for all Ontarians, not just for those who are interested in exploiting them.\n2) Even in the event that cormorant control is warranted, I am shocked and disappointed to see the proposed exemption allowing hunters to legally spoil the meat. This is not a proposed hunt so much as a proposed cull. Call it what it is, because we all know most (if not all) hunters partaking in cormorant control will not be consuming the meat. This is not only unsportsmanlike, it is irresponsible resource management.\n3) The MNRF must have to foresight to predict the hundreds of thousands of pounds of cormorant carcasses being left on beaches, in wetlands, and floating in water bodies as a result of the harvest exemption. If hunters are allowed to spoil the birds, how inclined do you think they will be to go out and collect them once shot?  Aside from the immediate issues of decomposing carcasses, there will be increased exposure to disease, bacteria and parasites to other species in the environment as a result of the abandoned cormorant carcasses.\nPlease consider the broad consequences of this proposal. I recognize the appeal of a low cost cormorant reduction strategy, but this is surely the wrong way to do it.\nSincerely,\nA concerned biologist.\n",

Predator - prey interactions are seldom linear, and perhaps there is a positive to commercial fish from a predator such as the Double-crested Cormorant. In complex systems, this is a possibility. Either way, the data needs to be out there and clear, before one tries to solve a problem that may not be solvable by culling Double-crested Cormorants. Perhaps Double-crested Cormorant are a symptom rather than a cause of a problem in the Great Lakes ecosystem. If you cull cormorants, why not egrets, herons, Caspian Terns etc. Perhaps some of those have a greater effect on commercial fisheries? If it is merely the population number, it means that you are being simplistic in your understanding of what the dynamics are in the system, and you may be making the incorrect assumptions. I say no culling of cormorants, or other fish eating species, until you have clear, data from multiple studies that clearly show that the culling will have a positive effect on the prey species that you want to manage for.\n",

Thank you for proposing this as I feel that it is long overdue.\nThe changes that are being proposed will serve to keep the population of cormorants at an appropriate level for the ecosystems they live in. currently, we are seeing a rise in populations that cause significant damage to the shorelines and islands of water bodies that are inhabited by colonies of cormorants.\nPersonally, I have seen some of these cormorant colonies kill entire islands and large areas of shorelines due to the high number of cormorants in these areas. The trees and plants that are killed by cormorants are habitat for many different species of animals that can suffer from the loss of habitat as the plant life dies due to the overabundant cormorant population.\nCreating this hunting season for cormorants will allow the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to keep a closer watch on the populations of cormorants by receiving feedback from hunters in the field. The management approach is similar to that of other bird species in the area like crows. It allows people to reduce damages to the ecosystems of our shorelines and islands while allowing an appropriate number of cormorants to survive as long as the area that they live in can support their population. The population will be managed properly under a hunting season, allowing the cormorant population to be kept at a sustainable level so that the damage they do is reduced.\nI applaud this proposal as It will bring about the required changes to ensure sustainable cormorant populations while reducing the damage they do to our lakes and rivers. This hunting season on cormorants must be approved if we want to conserve our shoreline and water ecosystems.\nThank You\n",

Over the last 3 years I have seen the minnow population decline, and sunfish\/ perch fishing almost non existent.\nIt is my opinion that the cormorants have eaten such bait fish and taken this food source away from other game fish such as pickerel, bass and muskie.\nI have fished this lake for over 30years and in the last 2 years fishing has declined to catastrophic levels. This decline has occurred while the cormorant population has exploded. The lake shore has been almost fully developed for a long time so the human factors should not have had such an impact on the fishing. However what has changed is the establishment of a large cormorant population. I'm  afraid the damage done to the fishery environment is irreversible without taking action to exterminate the cormorants .\nWhile fishing on lake Erie and lake Simcoe, seeing the flocks of cormorants and their feeding forages, convinces me that  action needs to be taken before irreparable damage is done to the environment, commercial and game fishing, and the economic spin offs on those lakes.\n",

        "comment":"What is MNRF thinking with this proposal??  Please do not implement these regulation changes at least outside the Great Lakes basin.  We do not need individuals boating around in summer months with shotguns shooting at and leaving behind dead birds to spoil.  Numerous public complaints will no doubt arise from this activity that is not at all defensible by science from Ontario and elsewhere.\nThe preamble to Ontario\u2019s Heritage Hunting and Fishing Act states:  \u201cThe best traditions of recreational hunting and fishing should be valued by future generations.\u201d  Shooting a species that has no use as food with the only intent to kill it and let it spoil is NOT part of the hunting tradition in this province. This is exactly the type of behavior that our hunting laws attempt to eliminate. The fact that there has to be an amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to add provisions to allow cormorant to spoil shows how far this proposal is from the best traditions of hunting.\nAs a hunter who thinks it is important that at least a portion of my food comes from the land and connects me directly to our natural resources, I find this proposal very concerning. Currently, hunting is an activity that is conducted by a relatively small portion of the Ontario public. It is permitted to occur because the majority of non-hunters see it as well managed, focused on providing sustainable food and other significant benefits to the province. However, permitting activities such as this proposal which is essentially legalize the killing of animals for no use will shift this perception and threaten the support of hunting as a viable activity in the province for the future.\nThere may be very few situations in Ontario where cormorants may be out of balance with the ecosystem. These specific instances can be identified and dealt with, as they currently are in many jurisdictions. Random, in-discriminate killing by the public will NOT help address these specific situations in a helpful, thoughtful and science based manner.\nUnder the this proposal, it is quite likely that small nesting colonies might be completely annihilated on border lakes in NW Ontario.  Was any monitoring data and science of impacts from this part of the province even used in making this proposal?  There are other natural controls mechanisms (e.g. Newcastle disease) and other lethal control measures that could be utilized when populations are excessively high rather than indiscriminate killing of birds.  The species is an important part of the natural ecosystem and should be considered as such!  There are international implications to consider over the species range.  Small nesting colonies could easily be annihilated under this proposal (50 birds\/day) or nesting birds may be displaced to other lakes.\nPlease consider using all the available science and monitoring information from the entire province, not just from highly contentious areas of S. Ontario and the Great Lakes basin.  If not, then consider leaving NW Ontario out of this proposal.\nWhat are the enforcement and safety implications of individuals caring shotguns around in boats for cormorant culls during the non-hunting seasons?  Please consider this impact in your decision.\n",

        "comment":"After reading your proposal, I am left with many questions. It does not sound like you really know what the consequences will be for the population of Double-crested Cormorants in the long-term if you allow them to be hunted, do you? Nor have you really demonstrated actual impacts that these birds may or may not have on fish populations. Remember how the Harp Seal was blamed for declining fish populations but then the real fault was found to be over-fishing by humans? Are competitive fishermens' complaints actually being taken as proof here? If as you say, you haven't a clue about how many hunters will be killing Double-crested Cormorants or where, then how can you possibly state with any certainty that the effect of your proposed hunt will be \"neutral\" ecologically -- it's impossible to predict that because there are many hunters in Ontario. Everything is ecologically related and this population of birds was low once before already, so you need to consider this idea more carefully before opening hunting on a species so freely -- \"50 bagged birds,\" \"no possession limit,\" and from \"April to December.\" This sounds excessive and likely to cause an impact on the population eventually \"depending on the number of hunters.\" Your proposal sounds like you are catering to a group of people who just don't like Double-crested Cormorants really. Your comment about \"aesthetics\" is a statement about what is completely wrong with society today, and I find it shocking that you'd even consider it. It worries me that you would find 'looks' so important that wildlife must be killed to protect that -- it's sheer nonsense and should not be part of any intelligent conservation plan. Do we cull people that we think are ugly or create a mess on their property? It is tantamount to the same thing really -- arguments based on aesthetics cannot be considered when the job is to protect our natural world for the betterment of human life. Anyone familiar with them knows that these birds can damage a small number of trees but that is natural and certainly should not be used to justify your proposal. Humans do the most extensive damage to trees and all environments in general, so are we going to hunt foresters and developers too? Of course not. Many wildlife species on this planet are ugly or do ugly things in order to survive but 'ugly' is not the same thing as 'bad' or 'harmful.' The success of human survival depends on protecting species diversity and this proposal sounds like it could cause harm to populations of colonial waterbirds in Ontario in the long-term. Birds such as American White Pelicans (which is a species at risk), Black-crowned Night-herons, Caspian Terns, Common Terns, Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, Herring Gulls and Ring-billed Gulls are often blended with Double-crested Cormorant nesting colonies. If hunting is allowed in or close to those colonies, it would have the potential to disrupt the breeding season of many birds. How is the wildlife that humans depend on supposed to sustain itself if we allow hunting during any breeding season? And the cruelty caused to young orphaned birds by this type of hunt is not ethical as well. So, no hunting should be allowed near any active bird colony including one of only cormorants, and hunting should never be allowed during breeding seasons. In the recent past, we already had to work to bring colonial waterbirds back to respectable numbers, so please don't allow such a needless practice as sport hunting to reverse that hard-won achievement. Humans always underestimate the long-term damage we can do to other species through seemingly legitimate short-term actions. Please reconsider this unhealthy sounding proposal. A hunter couldn't have written it better and that is a skewed and risky viewpoint. Also, with climate change effects now at a tipping point in human history, we NEED to protect our diversity fiercely and not waste our precious resources on unnecessary human WANTS. Sport hunting is a waste of potential food sources, and you even stated that hunters should be allowed to let cormorants \"spoil\" in their possession -- shame on you for that! No wildlife should be killed and left to spoil in the name of 'fun' because wildlife has immense value to humans and you should be protecting it for future need. Furthermore, my family has been threatened in the past on our home property by raccoon hunters whose bullets could have injured us from a nearby field. I have also been in great fear of gunfire at the shore of Niagara-on-the-Lake in winter, where Americans can legally hunt ducks on the Niagara River. In my experience, Double-crested Cormorants are very often found near human habitation or where humans go for recreational purposes, even their colonies in parks and such. So this adds another unnecessary risk to humans from your proposal. It only makes sense that hunting should never be allowed where humans live or play close by (knowing that a bullet from a rifle can travel up to a mile in some cases). So, hunting is already allowed too close to where human activity takes place in Ontario -- Presqu'ile Provincial Park duck hunting is another example I can remember feeling uncomfortable with. So, please reconsider this disturbing proposal for all of the above reasons. Thank you.\n",

I also recommend establishing a cormorant population reduction in the nesting colonies on Toronto Islands and Leslie St spit in Toronto Lake Ontario waterfront. I have fishes for thirty years in Lake Ontario for salmon and trout.

Over this same time cormorant numbers have skyrocketed and feed almost exclusively on salmon and trout forage, alewife most of all. Salmon stocking on both sides of the border are down 20% YOY for several years and cormorants continue to grow in numbers and have zero benefits to the environment killing trees and vegetation. While at the same time reducing game fishing quality. Sport fishing brings millions into our GTA economy through charters, boat sales, equipment, lodging, restaurants.

        "comment":"Cormorants, unfortunately, for other species, share the same nesting sites especial along the shoreline of the Bruce, such as Chantry island and the Fishing Islands.  The proposal allows shooting from a stationary boat.  If you have gone out in a boat  to see the nesting sites in the islands, you would realize that there is no such thing as a stationary situation.  Photographers are well aware of this situation. If hunters were allowed to shoot at will in the Islands then we would lose the nesting sites of a variety of other species such as Green heron, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, and others. Chantry Island is designated an Important Bird Area, and, as such, should continue to be protected, along with a buffer zone, particularly from any hunting intrusion. Any new regulation for hunting, such as this one, must also state that all IBAs , including an additional buffer zone, are specified as off-limits to hunting. While Cormorants may be plentiful, other species in IBAs are likely to be of Special Concern, Threatened or Endangered and should definitely be protected from the effects of hunting for Cormorants both in IBAs and in areas where Bird Species at Risk are known to exist. Representations by Bird & Birding experts as to harm likely to be caused to other bird species as by-blow of opening of hunting of Cormorants for this very long season,  which includes both migration and nesting periods, should be solicited and acted upon in limiting Cormorant hunting areas.  Recognizing the likelihood of continuing & future changes to bird populations, Bird & Birding experts should continue to have input; and actions based upon them should be a continuing process throughout any period in which hunting of Cormorants is allowed.\nAs a member of a large Birding club (Bruce Birding Club with well over 100 members) and associated with The Huron Fringe Birding Festival (widely known and award-winning) which attracts tourists and their dollars, both Canadian and American, to Bruce County and Grey, I believe it is important for the survival of the large number of bird species, including endangered species such as the Piping Plover, that live in and pass through this area and our tourism industry, to protect and nurture our bird population by ensuring that such a proposed Cormorant hunt does not, in any way interfere with the lives of other bird species or the enjoyment of these birds by enthusiasts and tourists in this Bruce Grey area and other similar areas throughout the proposed hunting area.

If people want to shoot the cormorants they should also have to eat them.\nShooting 50 a day with no possession limit seems way to high for these large birds.\nI can believe that this idea must be driven by fishermen and other landowners that simply don\u2019t want the cormorants around and have no intention of using the birds for consumption. They just want to get rid of them.\nThese birds should be treated no different than other game birds if they are going to be put into that classification.\nWhat is the difference is between cormorants and other diving birds that there is no hunting season for (gannets, pelicans, etc).\nAs you can probably see I am not negatively affected by these birds so I don\u2019t see a need to hunt them at all but especially not during breeding season.\nThere are boating tours specifically set up to observe birds during breeding season and having other boaters sitting blasting away at the cormorants and then landing in the breeding grounds to gather the dead cormorants for disposal will certainly negatively affect the birds nesting near them, as well as the companies giving these tours. Specific breeding locations should be exempt from hunting.\n",

This goes against what hunting is all about, harvesting wildlife for food in a sustainable way. Making it legal to not retrieve what you shoot teaches very poor behaviour. When these dead and rotting birds wash up on our beaches, or go noticed by swimmers and boaters, hunters are going to get a very bad image. Not to mention the sounds of gunshots in summer cottage areas are not going to be very popular.\nThe shooting of cormorants during the breeding season is going to disturb many other colony nesting birds that nest within cormorant colonies. This is simply unacceptable and unnecessary. Oiling of cormorant eggs will have a greater affect on cormorant populations than hunting, and will not disturb the other colony nesting birds.\nFinally, is there some scientific data that shows hunting of cormorants will have the desired affect on reducing their numbers? I don't think there is data to back up this initiative, and so the risks of creating this \"hunting\" season far outweigh any possible reward.\n",

Living in Toronto is important to me and I value the opportunities to experience nature in the midst of a large urban centre. I frequently make use of Toronto's ravines and lakeshore, including Leslie St. Spit. I have watched in the increases in cormorant populations over those 50 years and I see it as a positive sign that nature can survive under urban conditions. I understand that cormorant populations should not be allowed to grow unchecked, but favour the humane approach of treating eggs on the nest that I believe is currently carried out by the TRCA.   I believe that opening a hunting season is absolutely the worst thing that could happen as it sends a public message that shooting our birds and other wildlife is acceptable in an urban area. Other wildlife would suffer collateral damage. We should be protecting our wildlife and treating them with respect. When absolutely necessary, populations should be managed in a humane manner.\n",

The population of Cormorants on Lake of the Woods has steadily increased and the population of smaller game fish and Walleye and Perch has decreased considerably.  Watching the continual feeding of large groups of Cormorants on spawning fish and shallow feeding fish has been hard, but seeing this proposal has truly shown a great way to help with a problem that had no solution till now.  Back in Early 50's and 60's, many residents of the South end of Lake of the Woods followed this procedure that's listed in the proposal and populations were held in a very manageable state and fisheries were being able to steadily increase back in to sustainable populations.\nThe only idea I may have, which most people would contest too, would be to have the Cormorants be disposed of in the Landfill.  So hunters would need to retrieve the birds, place them in a garbage bag for transportation to town and then dispose of in a garbage facility.  OR the birds must be retrieved and at least disposed of on land.

These birds have been an issue in the United States and have been historically targeted lethally for a reason. Below an excerpt from Wildlife.org\n\"Since its inception (Cormorant Control Efforts), various agencies have attempted to manage cormorants under the PRDO in a variety of locations. Michigan\u2019s Les Cheneaux Islands located in northern Lake Huron, home to an important recreational yellow perch (Perca flavescens) fishery, was one of the first. Some of the islands had been colonized by over 11,000 nesting cormorants. Research in the 1990s documented predation by cormorants on the fish, but the researchers concluded that the predation did not diminish the perch population (Belyea 1999). By 2000 the perch fishery had collapsed and subsequent research indicated that cormorants were a significant contributing factor to natural mortality rates as high as 85 percent\"\nThe longer this bird is able to prey in the areas in which it dwells it will continue to diminish food sources for larger game fish which will in turn decimate lakes in their entirety.\n",

Administering oil to the eggs to prevent hatching would fool the birds into continuing to roost until egg failure was apparent, perhaps therefore using up the typical hatching season. Several years of this controlled activity would result in reduced populations and a re-balancing of bird and fish populations in affected areas.\nAllowing essentially unchecked shooting will have far-reaching negative effects that will outweigh the seemingly simple answer it presents.\n",

The first reason as to why I disagree with the proposed changes is because there is a slight decline in the Double-crested Cormorant population. I really don\u2019t understand why there is a potential possibility of hunting regulations being put on top of a species that is already declining without the help of seasonal hunters. Another obvious reason as to why I oppose the possible proposal change is because these animals stink and are mainly considered to be \u201cinedible\u201d. I find it extremely disturbing to know that there is a potential possibility that the Fish and Wildlife Act may \u201clift\u201d a law which normally prohibits hunters from allowing the meat on the carcass to spoil. I do not agree with this potential decision as it allows the lives of innocent animals be killed and their bodies to be wasted. If this proposal does succeed to change the hunting regulations for the Double-crested Cormorant, I strongly believe that the bag limit should be decreased significantly.

        "comment":"Species currently listed as \"Game Birds\" and having open seasons in Ontario are:\n- Gray Partridge\n- Ptarmigan\n- Ring-necked Pheasant\n- Ruffed Grouse\n- Spruce Grouse\n- Sharp-tailed Grouse\n- Wild Turkey\n(Source: Ontario open seasons regulation (670\/98))\nAll of these species are edible and have historically been hunted for food as well as for sport. None of them are migratory. They all create hidden nests in forested areas, well separated from each other.\nOpen seasons for all these species are from Sept. to March (or Sept. to Dec. in some cases), except for Wild Turkey, which has a more limited open season. Daily bag limits range from 2 to 10, and possession limits from 6 to 15.\nThe bag limits and possession limits in place are designed to prevent any one hunter or group of hunters from depleting the population of game birds in an area. The hunting seasons are during the fall and winter to avoid killing the birds while they are breeding and replacing their losses from the hunting season.\nThese regulations exist because, historically, unregulated hunting depleted the populations of every species of bird, exterminated some species from settled areas (e.g. Wild Turkey from Ontario, Trumpeter Swan from the continental U.S. and Canada, and Canada Goose from southern Ontario (yes, really!)), and caused the extinction of other species (e.g. Passenger Pigeons and Eskimo Curlews).\nThe proposal under discussion is remarkably different from the existing regulations:\n- open season from mid-March through December\n- daily bag limit of 50\n- no possession limit\n- exemption from prohibitions against letting meat spoil\nDouble-crested Cormorants are also remarkably different from existing game birds. They are only technically edible (they taste horrible), have not historically been hunted for food (though their eggs have been harvested, and they have been hunted to be used as bait meat), migrate to the southern U.S. during the winter, and (importantly) nest together in the hundreds in obvious colonies.\nCormorants breed in Ontario from mid-April to mid-August. The proposed open season includes their entire breeding season in addition to the traditional fall and winter hunting season. The only time they would not be hunted, January to mid-March, they are not present in Ontario, having migrated to the southern U.S. and the Atlantic coast. During the breeding season, cormorant colonies are highly visible and contain dozens to thousands of pairs. With a 50 per day limit, one hunter could easily exterminate a small colony, and even the largest colony could be exterminated in a few days by a dozen hunters working together.\nThis seems to be the main aim of this proposal: to allow the culling of cormorant colonies by members of the public. Cormorants have historically been culled because their colonies are ugly (as are the birds themselves) and because they eat fish, which is perceived as competition by fishermen.\nThe reasons given for this proposal match these historical reasons:\n- cormorants deplete fish populations, so they harm the commercial fishing industry\n- cormorant colonies harm island forest habitats and other species (they strip sticks from trees for their nests, which kills the trees they nest in)\n- cormorant colonies are ugly (the phrase used is \"detrimental to ... aesthetics\"), so they harm property owners\nSo, on to my actual comments about this proposal, now that the background has been covered. I oppose this proposal, partly because the arguments in favour are weak, partly because the impact is likely to be larger than estimated, but mostly because amending the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act is entirely inappropriate for accomplishing (what I believe to be) the goals of this proposal.\nThe arguments in favour are weak:\n- cormorants are far from the main driver behind declines in commercial fish stocks, to the point that it's still an open debate over whether cormorants have a negative effect (some believe they have a positive effect on commercial species because they primarily eat small non-commercial fish (\"trash fish\") which compete with commercial species), and there are a large number of other fish-eating bird species which nest right along-side cormorants, *yet are not being targeted*\n- cormorant colonies are not known to have destroyed habitat critical for any globally threatened species (I ignore here species which are globally common but whose range just barely make it into Ontario; species like this probably shouldn't be listed as threatened or endangered in Ontario, or at least not in the same category as species which are globally rare)\n- ugliness is not sufficient reason to kill birds, though it may be sufficient grounds to take non-lethal measures to prevent some specific locations from being used\nThe impact is likely to be larger than estimated:\n- historically, birds which nest in colonies on islands have been by far the most vulnerable to extirpation and extinction due to human action, because a small number of people can harvest thousands of eggs and kill hundreds of birds in a few days, and repeat the process every year because the birds have only a few suitable islands on which to build nests, all of which can easily be scouted every year\n- cormorants nest in the same locations as, and scattered among, other species including terns, gulls, herons, and egrets (several species of each type), and destroying a cormorant colony will necessarily involve quite a lot of collateral damage to these protected species (ideally only through disturbance and abandonment of nests, but likely also from accidental shootings and trampling of nests)\nBut these objections are sideshows. The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act exists to put reasonable limits on hunting and fishing, so that no one can deplete wild populations and ruin things for everyone else. Its content is all written with this in mind, and deals almost entirely with common situations related to hunting and fishing for food, furs, and other material gain. Cormorants are not and have never been game birds in the common sense of the term, and the proposal is not aimed at instating them as game birds, but is instead intended for wildlife population control. The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act is not written with wildlife population control in mind. Wildlife control in general, and cormorant culling specifically, is best carried out by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, not by the very members of the public who have the strongest motivations to over-cull. This is especially true because the Ministry does not require the aid of the public to cull cormorant populations. Double-crested Cormorant colonies are easy to find, few in number, and densely populated, which makes it easy for a small group of people to substantially impact the population with relatively little effort. Given this, the restrictions on their killing should be *more strict than those on existing game birds*, all of which are much more difficult to kill in substantial numbers. This proposal would instead have an open \"season\" of 10 out of 12 months, a daily limit 5 times larger than any existing limit, and declare cormorants to be an exception to several other existing limits and regulations.\nSo, I urge those reading this comment to seek a more sensible way to deal with cormorant control, and to actively oppose giving the job to members of the OFAH, some of whom have views on this issue that are out on one edge of the range of opinions held by the informed public of Ontario, and are highly unlikely to restrain themselves to actions which won't upset everyone else.\n",

The wolves duratastically changed the enviroment when absent, when returned they durastically changed it again for the Better. I believe the same would happen for the cormorants. They are important to their ecosystem. Just Because they clearly do not play an important role in the eyes of those competing with them, does not mean they are important and cruicial to their ecosystem. What we must do is find a balance between the human consumption (not waste or sport)and predator consumption.\n",

        "comment":"Creating a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario is not a wise or logical approach. The reasoning behind my statement:\n1. Loons can easily be mistaken for cormorants even with a reminder to hunters to properly identify their target. The loon population is in dangerous decline and this proposal can only harm an already vulnerable species.\n2. The proposal itself gives contradictory information reading in the first paragraph that the cormorant population is stabilized or DECLINING. Why is this considered an imbalance? Why actively seek to decrease the population numbers (of a stable population) period, and why do so by hunting?\n3. The current concern is based on an assumption only, a belief by property owners and some hunters (as stated in the proposal). There is no science, statistics or studies to verify and identify the cormorant as the cause of disruption in fish populations and\/or habitat loss. Taking action without being clear on the actual root of the problem is not a wise route to take.\n4. A bag limit of 50 cormorants\/day with no possession limits is excessive and highly detrimental to both the cormorant population and other similar-looking targets that will be affected by this limit. The proposal also states the impact will depend on levels of hunter participation. This can be catastrophic.\n5. The potential negative impact to the environment, ecology, and intricate food webs to an already environmentally-fragile planet is too great a risk to take. Unfortunately, negative impacts as a result of human hunting are typically only realized in hindsight, once the damage has been done. The province of Ontario, and the world at large, cannot afford to implement proposals such as this one.\n6. Hunting is not a population management tool. It is a recreational activity for many people. Allowing this proposal to go through will not increase the recreation level, it can only affect the wildlife and conservation of its targets.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 205, Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (Double-crested Cormorants)\nI am writing this letter in response to the proposal of listing Double-crested Cormorants as a game bird in Ontario. I believe that the concerns raised by some parties (ie. the commercial fishing industry, anglers, hunters and private landowners) are unwarranted and unsubstantiated.\nIt is well known that the species suffered a massive decline due to DDT use from the 1950\u2019s to the 1970\u2019s and have since come back from the brink of extirpation. It is suggested that now  the number of cormorants is increasing beyond reasonable capacity and that these numbers are negatively affecting Ontario\u2019s fish stocks.\nHowever, the numbers are currently leveling, and in fact, display moderate decline. As for effecting the fishing industry, there is no evidence that Cormorant prey heavily on our \u2018game\u2019 fish. Evidence instead suggests that the vast majority of their diet is on cyprinids and other littoral, forage species.\nTurning the Double-crested Cormorant into a huntable species will require unnecessary revision of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (1997) as well as require the alteration of wanton waste laws, which have long been a safeguard of ethical hunting throughout the province.\nAs for private landowners; Cormorant\u2019s guano is known to harm trees and plants, specifically when the birds congregate in large numbers. So it is understandable that the land owners are concerned for the overall health of their property. However, landowners already have the right to act in protection of their land from potential \u2018pests\u2019. As such there should be no need for further legislation involving private land.\nDouble-crested Cormorants have long been a native of Ontario\u2019s waters and have suffered at human hands before. Now that they have finally reached a recovered level there is no need to further persecute these animals. Why change regulations in order to hunt an animal that has never proven to be detrimental to our environment, and has no harvestable benefit to the parties involved? It is time to stop using our wild species as scapegoats in the decline of Great Lakes fisheries.\nThank you for the consideration,\n",

There is currently little, if any, science that supports this assertion.  The need to decrease the number of cormorants is being driven by the emotions of people who do not understand the biology of this species.\n-Many other species nest in the same areas as cormorants.  Opening hunting of the cormorants, especially during the breeding season and within breeding areas, will cause major disturbances that are likely to result in breeding failure or mortality in species like black-crowned night heron, great egret, and great blue heron.\n-Hunting without using the carcass is in effect a cull.  Culls should be done in an ethical manner by professionals if the best available science dictates a need.  This is not the case in this situation.\n-Without being required to retrieve the carcasses, the hunt will be out of control, and likely done in an unsafe and unethical manner.  Shooting will be done recklessly and with little care for bird welfare.\n-The hunt, as proposed is unscientific, unethical, and likely to result in negative consequences for other shoreline inhabitant.\n-Other methods of population control such as egg oiling, or encouraging predators like bald eagles in areas where cormorants are too numerous are likely to more effective and more ethical.\n",

Those parameter are, in my view, dangerously permissive\u2026so much so that the cormorant population could culled to the point where it can no longer play its natural role in the Ontario ecosystem.  In an era where various invasive species are stressing that ecosystem, we need cormorants as a check on some of those invasive species.  We should recognize that the species is integral to the current ecosystem, playing an essential role in controlling the populations of certain species below it in the food chain.  Any cull initiative should therefore be approached with caution.\nParameters for the hunt should be conservatively at first, so as not to shock and potentially imperil the ecosystem to which these birds belong:  these parameters can be adjusted later, if indicated, i.e., if studies of the initial hunt\u2019s impact dictate such adjustment.\nSpecifically, the proposed bag limit seems far too high.  As I see it, that limit should initially be set in the single-digit range\u2026maybe 5\/day (10 at the very most).\nMy other concern is that the proposed policy seems to set no possession limit\u2026an invitation to wanton killing of these birds.

Who will take part in these hunts if these birds are virtually inedible? Most  waterfowl hunters do not shoot fish eating ducks.\nIf these are to be eaten, like any other top predator on our lakes they will carry contaminants will there be a guide and studies done to tell us how much we can consume safely.\nIf they are to be hunted and discarded than I prefer the Gov. provides drop off depots for the carcasses. As a sportsman I am still torn on the ethics of the slaughter of birds not for the table by sportsmen and women. Also this is not like shooting problem crows on private land out of the view of other people. 90% of these birds will be hunted on public lands in view of anti-hunting groups and non-hunting public. Making sportsman appear to be savages killing these birds needlessly and discarding them. This is bad press we do not need.\n",

When I sight these birds they are commonly in larger groups alone shorelines or small islands. It's easy to observe the areas they inhibit for long periods of time as they are covered in Cormorant faces leaving a white-grey stain on impermiable surfaces, and moss-wear on rock islands.\nThough I have not personally witnessed an area of shoreline where groups of Cormorants intermingle, I have read erosion is a large worry and the contents and contents within the feces, as it commonly is detrimental to grass\/dirt\/tree trunks.\nNoting the habitat quality where these Cormorants have been personally sighted, I find it easy to believe the destruction to landscape these birds are capable of.\nI think opening a hunt of the Double-creasted Cormorant in Ontario is a good idea, and if not permanent, an experiment worth the time. If monitoring stats note a large decline after the 2019 season, reversing the hunt is always an option.\n",

        "comment":"I think this proposal is an illegitimate use of the word hunting. Hunting is the harvesting of game species for eating. This is simply a cull with an open season attached. I don't think disguising it as an ethical activity is the answer. Calling it hunting is degrading to proper wildlife management.\nWhile I have witnessed the poor water quality near nesting sites, I think using guns to control populations will prove ineffective. I feel this will disrupt much more than cormorant reproduction. Furthermore the political repercussions will outweigh the benefit.\nI believe there are other non-lethal measures that have not yet been exercised. Public harassment is an option that could have a greater impact. Currently as a migratory species they are free from harassment at the nesting site. Allowing volunteers to place birds of prey within cormorant rookery sites might provide a greater impact. This was practised in Port Colborne, ON around tern nesting beds with some success. This would also provide some relief to private landowners dealing with this species. It should not be illegal for residents to chase cormorants out of trees providing shade to streams and riverbanks. Trees are an important tool for regulating water temperature and slowing runoff which avoids poor water clarity and erosion. Cormorants kill trees along the water's edge.\nOiling of eggs by public agencies should continue and other non-lethal options that are safer than discharging firearms. The Ministry could also deploy bird bangers in problem urban areas such as Hamilton Harbour without creating a political firestorm.\nWhile I wholeheartedly agree this species numbers are detrimental to native fish stocks and water quality I do not believe allowing the public to shoot 50 of them a day will have an impact nor do I believe the public are willing to spend the time or money for ammunition on a species as undesirable to eat for more than 1 season.\nI as a participant believe in hunting as sound wildlife management tool but I do not believe this fits the definition of hunting. This is a public cull and should be labeled as such if implemented. Please do not add this to the hunting regulations. Although I believe some control measures are necessary I do not support adding this proposal to the hunting regulations.\n",

Hunters do not cull the weak, sick or injured.  They kill the strong animals that need to stay alive to keep the gene pool strong.  Many animals suffer needlessly due to careless or inexperienced hunters who do not know how to drop the animal with one kill shot.  Hunting is cruel and unnecessary.  With the easy accessibility of many different types of food products in most areas, hunters do not need to hunt for food.  Hunting is an outdated tradition that has absolutely no benefit to anyone, and especially to the environment.  Please do not allow yet another animal to be cruelly slaughtered by hunters who only care about displaying a dead animal on social media or on their mantle instead of beholding the beauty of a living creature moving about in its natural environment.

The damage they have caused on the surrounding landscape is astounding.

The population has spread to as far as Lake Nipigon and the signs of tree damage is starting to appear on a few islands in this wilderness area. This will bring competition to the already struggling White Pelican population.\nI agree with the following parameters.\n1. Steel shot must be used, similar to migratory game bird regulations.\n2. All hunting safety regulations must apply to hunt Cormorants.\n3. The Cormorant should NOT be considered table fare, therefore acceptable to dispose of properly.\n4. All Cormorants killed MUST be collected by the hunter and not allow to be disposed of in local garbage containers.\n5. A small game hunting license is all that is required to hunt Cormorants.\n6.

I also believe that since cormorants are considered \"migratory birds\", that if hunting them were permitted, that a Migratory Bird Hunting Permit would be required as well as being legislated under the MBCA, and NOT the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.

Trout populations are on the rise.\nIn Lake Nippissing over harvest of game fish is known. This has likely lead to increased bait fish populations.\nIn my opinion in lakes with increased populations of perch and lacking large game fish (such as the acid damaged lakes in the Sudbury region) - restocking efforts of trout failed in the early years likely do the predation by perch - adult fish had to be reintroduced to eat down the perch population before trout populations could recover.\nDo cormorants play a role in eating down bait fish populations in lakes that have been over harvested \/ invasive species such as alewives - allowing game fish to recover - where is the research in your proposal?\n",

Seeing the damage first hand of what they can do to the environment is devastating. Hunting them like a migratory bird is good and I do like the fact that you can't just shoot and leave as it would cause alot of resistance from non hunters. Personally my self I would save them all for hunting coyotes in the winter instead of just letting them rot. First few hunt will be rather successful but like any animal hunted they will become educated rather quickly. I personally think it is a step in the right direction!!\n",

Stop scapegoating the cormorants who eat what they need and reign in the greedy fishing industry. Humans are the ones overfishing, not the cormorants or any other animals.

The return of these birds is a success story; it is a sign that we have reduced some toxic chemicals in our aquatic ecosystems, a sign that SHOULD make anglers and swimmers happier, you would think. I doubt these creatures are edible, so a hunting season would be a misnomer; my apologies if I am incorrect. I am a fisher not a hunter. People who support such a season, and who haven't considered the effects of human activities on water quality, shoreline health etc, indeed have their heads in the sand (possibly in the sand that they had delivered to make a beach over their once vegetated shoreline). I have seen results of  small scale culls in the Eastern Lake Ontario area  and the sight was not pretty: injured and flopping birds scattered across an island. I believe we should work on using and developing  more innovative and less destructive methods of deterring or controlling numbers of cormorants, if this reduction in numbers is absolutely necessary.

Having a bag limit of 50\/day and no possession limit would make the populations decline significantly. Even though the cormorants are disturbing the fish populations along with island forest habitats, I still don\u2019t think that humans should have the right to say which species should be extirpated from Ontario. The cormorant populations right now are not super low but also not super high, if people were to hunt the double-crested cormorants, there would be a significant population decrease. In a recent study from Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, Cormorants are dying in Toronto because of a sickness. The current population is estimated to be between 60,000-70,000 individuals which isn\u2019t great, and the populations are deceasing just from nature.

There is a large population of Cormorants around Pelee Island and a nesting area on Middle Island just to the south.   If Cormorant hunting occurs it will most likely occur in my area.\nPresently, Cormorants don\u2019t constitute a nuisance to me personally as an angler, recreational hunter and on my family\u2019s visits to the beach.\nIf Cormorant hunting is allowed, however, I fully expect that hunters will not retrieve and dispose of Cormorant bodies appropriately (regardless of regulation) and their carcasses will begin to wash up on our shores.   These decaying carcasses will interfere with people who would like to enjoy my community\u2019s shoreline.\nSecondly, as a recreational hunter I find the current proposal to hunt Cormorants offensive.  Shooting Cormorants (or any other animal) gratuitously with no intention of utilizing the carcass is unethical.\nAdditionally, encouraging this form of hunting (i.e. gratuitous killing) will give a negative reputation to recreational hunting in general.\nTherefore, I am against Cormorant hunting in and around my community.\n",

        "comment":"I have serious concerns about the \"Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\".  Cormorants have long been unfairly vilified as killing sport fish, but the reality is that according to the Canadian Wildlife Service, less than two percent of a cormorant\u2019s diet consists of sport fish. As Barry Kent McKay explains, \u201cthere is no empirical, scientifically determined indication that the fish consumed by cormorants have a significant, measureable negative impact on what is available to commercial and recreational anglers.\u201d Cormorants are opportunity-based fishers \u2013 they eat what is most abundant and easily available which prevents them from depleting stocks of any one species.\nPermitting a hunting season for nesting birds is cruel and inhumane.  While most members of the public aren't in a position to see baby cormorants starving to death after their parents are killed, if they were, most would be as outraged by the thought as I am.\nIn addition, this change would undermine the entire concept of hunters as people who are killing for sustenance, and who care about the environment.  Even if someone would consider consuming cormorants, there is no way that 50 a day could be consumed.  And allowing killed birds to remain and decompose undermines the very concept of hunting as a \"use\" of the environment.  It would essentially be killing for fun and not something out government should support.\n",

Their preferred roosting sites are small isolated islands and these are quickly turned into barren moonscapes from their droppings once they establish a colony. This destroys habitat for other birds and animals and is also a huge eye sore. Once an area has been a roosting site for cormorants, it's basically ruined for any kind of recreational activity as the droppings are like mud all over the ground and no doubt toxic. I wouldn't let my kids anywhere near an island where these birds have lived.\nI know cormorants eat fish, but I have no idea (ie concrete data) that they have a detrimental effect on fish stocks. I would definitely go out and shoot as many as I could just based solely on their habitat destruction potential, but if that also helps fish stocks, then that's even better. I would like to see commercial fishermen have quotas reduced in the great lakes to help improve fish stocks as I believe that they have a far greater detrimental effect on fish populations than cormorants do.\nLike I said though, cormorant hunt is a fantastic idea, let's get it done!\n",

These concerns are really concerns of inconvenience. Provide some quantifiable data to justify the concerns. Is the fish catch truly down ?

They are in no way offensive or problematic. They avoid people.\nThe gulls are equally prevalent and are far more obtrusive because they do not avoid people and their droppings create unpleasant messes all around the dock yet no one is clamoring for their removal.\nMiddle Island is the only Island in my region of Lake Erie where these indigenous inhabitants nest in large numbers and the Island is uninhabited and owned by Point Pelee National Park a federal property. Is Mr Ford and his government responding to Mr Trudeaus concerns about this property ? Not likely !! Canada Geese and their droppings are far more detrimental to our 'species' and the aesthetics of public parks and waterfront properties yet I hear no cry for a barbaric cull under the guise of a hunt.\nWith the adjunct proposal to alter the policy to allow the 'meat' to spoil why not be forthright and call it what it is ...a cull to rid us of a pest deemed so by the fishing industry ?\nSurely this government has better things to focus on then trying to manage a population of animals inconvenient to Conservative constituents but few others.

This is not to mention the fact that certain other species, which could potentially be endangered, might also be accidentally shot instead. So rather than just allow anyone with a game hunting license to shoot these birds in large numbers, would it not be a more reasonable solution to only allow culling in problem areas, and potentially grant special permits based on the situation?

They have fished out our lake of any fish worthy of catching, and create an environment where no other birds are allowed to live.   They are most aggressive and upset our regular resident loon who lives just off the dock.  If someone doesn't take action very soon we will lose our lake in more ways than one.

I have lived on this lake for over60 years.  Our once beautiful sandy beaches have been replaced with a mucky weed infested bottom.  What a shame!   Lets get a control on the cormorants!\n",

Although I don\u2019t believe in hunting a species and not finding a use for it\u2019s body, I believe that they provide more negative things on the environment than good for several reasons. Cormorants have been known to have a major negative affect on tree growth due to their deposition of feces on the leaves. This also damages the soil causing an impact on other vegetation. Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems have been impacted by this species of bird. They can feed on up to one pound of fish per day, consisting of game fish such as small mouth bass. They have caused a huge decline in bird species such as the black-crowned night heron, great blue heron and great egret. The only way to protect these species is to do something about the high populations of double-crested cormorants.\n",

You are planning to allow idiots with guns to shoot 50 cormorants a day during their breeding season and not even have to collect the carcasses. I already have enough people with guns around my cottage in the fall shooting everything else that moves. Now you are going to have these people using Cormorants for target practice all summer long.\nIf ever a government policy was not thought through, this is it.\nCormorants are important birds in the ecosystem. They do not generally eat the fish that the fishermen hunt - those fishermen that constantly pollute the area around my dock with garbage and abandoned fishing lines with hooks.\nFor once, why not let the creatures live in peace with their families, instead of unleashing a bunch of idiots with guns to shoot them all summer long. It will further detract from the peace at my cottage that is already amply disturbed by guns being fired and fishing people that have little consideration for the environment or their neighbours.\nI highly object to this new plan and my opinion of the current Ontario government will drop enormously if this proposal is implemented.\nThank you for allowing me to comment.\n",

The timeframe in which this season is proposed encompasses the entirety of the open water season which is when the public uses the areas where the hunting would take place for recreational activities such as swimming, fishing and boating. This would create unnecessary dangers to all users of the waterbodies especially during the summer months. I myself am a hunter and know that while most members of the hunting community use sound judgment and would never intentionally harm another person while practicing their sport, accidents do happen and certainly will happen if this proposal goes through.\nThis proposal is based on the thought that there are too many Double-crested Cormorants and these increased numbers are damaging fish populations. In the Description of policy it states that Cormorant populations decreased dramatically in the 1950's to 1970's but have since risen in the 2000's and have now stabilized or slightly decreased. This means that at best we are slightly below the carrying capacity and at worst are at the carrying capacity for these birds. The populations are currently at the natural size, a size in which the fish have lived with for as long as there has been Cormorants, The number of Cormorants is not doing to much damage to fish populations, they are helping keep fish populations in check just like they should be. The reason it seems the Cormorant population is so high is due to the fact that we as a society are used to the numbers we had from the 1950's to now, a number that was significantly lower than what it should be.\nNow to address the problem of damage to properties and possible species at risk habitat. This is a valid concern but the answer should not be too allow anyone with a valid small game licence to kill 50 a day and dispose of them how they please. Research should be done to find ways to minimize damage done to these areas instead of taking the easy way out, that is exactly the mindset that has destroyed countless species populations throughout the world. Now if there really is no other way to deter the Cormorants from these areas then perhaps less extreme measures of culling can be taken; such as the creation of limited employment opportunities within the MNRF in which extermination only of Double-crested Cormorants that are damaging important habitat is the main goal.\nIn conclusion I believe a provincewide public Culling of this species is both dangerous and irresponsible.\n",

Cormorants are doing exactly what they are supposed to do in their environment.  Therefore, I agree with monitoring and assessing their population and status.\nI do not agree with allowing the hunting of cormorants under any circumstances.  These birds have been on the decline due to habitat loss, pollution, culls, and most recently, Newcastle disease, which is species specific.\nThe proposed hunting season between March 15th to December 31st is too long, gives visitors to natural areas no break, and will leave orphaned chicks.\nThe proposed bag limit of 50 birds per person is excessive.\nAllowing any hunted animal to rot is completely unethical.  Animals are not garbage.  Leaving animals to rot can create attractants and wildlife conflicts.  The \"you kill it, you eat it\" rule was created for a reason.  If hunted animals are not eaten by people, then they can be given to wildlife in zoos and wildlife centres.\nAny lethal wildlife control leaves more room for more animals.  A lethal approach is a lazy approach that does not get to the root of the problem.  A much better approach to human conflicts with double crested cormorants is to fully protect them from hunting and culls, while educating the public about their vital role in the environment.

Instead, the birds prey on minnows, small carp and alewives, and less than one per cent of a cormorant\u2019s diet is made up of the fish that sport fish eat.\nCormorants can already be killed by a landowner if they damage or are about to damage private property.  As well, both the federal and provincial governments have the authority to manage cormorant populations in the name of conservation, and this is already being done through appropriate culls, oiling of eggs, etc.  Further, if protecting trees is a major concern, an answer is provided by efforts of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, who have been managing the cormorants at Tommy Thompson Park (aka Leslie Street Spit), by successfully encouraging the birds to nest on the ground.\nThe idea that cormorants could be called \"game birds\" is somewhat ludicrous, as I doubt anyone would ever eat one.  So any birds shot would likely be left to rot where they fall, especially with a suggested hunting limit of up to 50 birds.  And has been pointed out, allowing people to hunt cormorants could endanger loons (a protected species), which have a similar appearance when flying.\n",

Hunting would be defined generally as harvesting game for consumption - this proposal is looking at an exemption to that requirement to allow harvested game to spoil. This suggests to me that the term \"hunting\" in this context is window dressing to make a cull sound nice.\nI am concerned that few ligitimate hunters will take advantage of this kind of opportunity.\nCormorant populations may be doing well on the Great Lakes but have declined on many inland waters such as Lake of the Woods. A healthy population (about 200-250 pairs) of Bald Eagle have in recent years keyed in on young cormorant chicks as a major food sources. Population numbers of cormorants on Lake of the Woods have declined significantly in the last 5-10 years. This proposal indicates that cormorant numbers will be monitored to ensure a sustainable population. I would agree that in certain parts of Ontario that a cull of cormorants may be desirable for specific reasons at specific locations. I don't support this proposal as written - it is certainly not a new \"hunting\" opportunity!!!\nI would also be interested in your cormorant monitoring program on Lake of the Woods and would like to receive a status report indicating population estimates for cormorants over the last 15 years.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\nLeon\n",

        "comment":"I oppose this proposed murder\/cull of this cormorant species for several reasons as listed below:\nNO EVIDENCE\n- this bird is not in surplus nor is it invasive. Biologists do not believe it needs culling nor that is is a danger to anyone or any fish. It is a nuisance to some humans - not a reason to allow the public to murder it. The species has natural raptor predators that have been doing their work on our lake for several seasons.\nDANGER TO PUBLIC\n- lakes are public spaces especially in warmer weather. People with guns will be dangerous during the boating season. There is almost no enforcement of fishing or boating rules or laws on my lake. There is no enforcement of alcohol use on the lake. No police presence seen.I do not trust hunting in boats to be safe. Plus the added noise and killing on our quiet lake will be annoying and unbearable.\nIn summary you propose to murder a bird species for which there is  no proven harm to other wildlife but merely  annoys those who believe they interfere with human economic interests. This murder will bring hunters to my lake who are not being watched by police or enforcing agents. These birds are not invasive and not in over supply.\nWhy bring noise, danger and animal murder to our lakes for no other reason than human convenience.\nI am saddened, angry and scared.\nPlease use science and common sense to make decisions- not the interests of human commerce. We have destroyed enough of the wild already.\n",

Definitely,  good thinking out of the box on this one!\nOnly concern I see is around user conflicts and the safety of shooting from power boats during summer time when other recreationalists are out on the lakes fishing, water skiing, canoeing, kayaking, etc. in greater numbers.  Especially in Northern Ontario where hunting has not been allowed during summer, traditionally.\nI suspect,  the tourist industry may have some concerns along these lines as well.\nPerhaps, some thought can be given to tayloring the season to close just prior to the walleye opener (third Saturday in May) and then open again during the regular waterfowl season start (mid September).  Cormorants should be present in good numbers during these periods and harvestable without much conflict or safety concerns.\n",

        "comment":"Cormorants should be left alone. There is no need for population control as their populations are already being naturally adjusted after their sharp rise over the past decade. Just as any population spike there is a natural carrying capacity that will be met before they even out again. Since the ban of DDT cormorants have made a drastic recovery. People may confuse this population recovery as over population. Also, hunting cormorants without being required to eat them or use them in some productive way goes against the sport of hunting. This cull will also upset many of Ontario\u2019s cottagers as the decaying corpses will smell up the lakes and property lines of these people. Lastly, a significant portion of the population is anti-hunting and the sound of gunfire within the vicinity of cottages will not be tolerated by all.\nIn my opinion, we should hold off on allowing cormorant hunting for at least another decade to be able to properly witness the plateau of their population. While the sport of fishing is held dear to us, I don't think its importance trumps requiring us to share these resources with our wildlife.\n",

        "comment":"RE: Cormorants\n     First off, in my opinion this whole idea is deplorable.\n     \"The Cormorant's population declined between 1950s-1970s due to environmental\n     contaminants.\" The causal effects from humans using DDT and other toxins.\n     They increased rapidly from the 70s to the 2000s - because flocks will do\n     that when the 'predatorial or toxicity' is removed or controlled..\n     \"Their populations have STABILIZED or declined SLIGHTLY.\" In other words,\n     they are back to the numbers they were before humans decimated them prior to\n     the 50s.\n     \"Some groups say the cormorant is detrimental to the fish\n     populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\"\n     Let's take a look at that statement: People who fish for 'sport' are always\n     going to be against any kind of competition for their catch. The cormorants\n     eat live fish and are excellent 'fisherbirds' with a skill that would make\n     any human fisherman envious. The birds do it for survival, any fisherman I've\n     ever met who fishes the great lakes has always told me that \"(they'd) never\n     eat the fish in the lakes...it's just not healthy.\"\n     Detrimental to island forest habitats:  Clear cutting for a\n     house to go up; docks set up to tie off a motor boat that dumps toxins into\n     the water; chopping trees down for firewood because that's how they wanted to\n     heat their 'cabin\/cottage'. The determination between who causes what\n     detriment to the growth of trees on islands, in my opinion, is up for grabs.\n     Detriment to other species: I think not. They live in colonies with other\n     birds such as night herons, great blue herons, gulls, etc. There is a safety\n     in numbers from natural predators...just not from human predators.\n     Detriment to aesthetics:  Driving along the highway near\n     Hamilton Harbour do we see the cormorants in the trees? Maybe. But do we\n     notice the industrial piles of waste, the 'capped' area of the harbour (due\n     to extreme pollution), and lets not forget the beautiful plumes of toxins\n     going up in the atmosphere.\n     The changes being listed require so many comments:\n     1- Designating them as game birds only gives humans the right to kill\n     them without any remorse or compunction to actually seek out a better solution if their populations need looking at - which they actually don't at this time.\n     2- Open Season - March 15 to December 31...starting into the migrating season, throughout, courting and nesting and birthing and rearing the young...onto the juveniles learning to fly and back   into the migratory season. The December 31st date would seem to me to keep\n     the hunters sated with being able to just shoot anything.\n     3- Small games hunting licenses valid June 6 - August 31. This would enable\n     bows and arrows, falconry birds, etc., under that classification, to be used\n     to kill off babes not able to fly and juveniles just learning.\n     4- This \"change\" is interesting as stated: \"Establish a LIMIT of 50\n     cormorants\/day with NO possession Limit.\" So they are saying it's fine to\n     kill 50 birds a day but if you go over, and have more in your possession,\n     don't worry about it.\n     Do you realize that one person killing 50 birds per day will kill 1500 in 30\n     days of hunting. That means 100 people hunting 30 days over the course of 9\n     and 1\/2 months, killing 50 birds per day = 150,000 birds. Remember it is Open\n     Season.\n     How long would it take for even 100 people - who are not given real\n     restrictions - to decimate a species entirely?\n     5- The use of shotguns on a colony...it doesn't matter that the shot is\n     'designated as safe to the environment'...think in terms of the resulting\n     deaths and wounding of these birds and any others in the vicinity. And will they be brought to any place for help? Not by the hunter that's for sure...doesn't matter whether he hits other birds or not...who is going to oversee this - there's not enough conservation officers now.\n     6- Hunting from a stationary motor boat: That brings all kinds of visions to\n     mind when I think of someone sitting in a boat with a\n     shotgun aiming at the cormorants in the trees and bushes while the cars zip\n     by on the bridge and the roads below. Don't tell me it would never happen!\n     But, I do wonder what the O.P.P. would think of that potential nightmare?\n     \"Provisions will also be added to \"exempt\" persons \"lawfully\" hunting (or\n     possessing) cormorant carcasses to be able to leave them to spoil but they\n     still have to retrieve them and dispose of the carcasses.\" This is Doubletalk.\n     \"The Ministry will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess\n     population status and trends.\" We all know how good the Ministry is about\n     looking after wildlife. They hand out permits for people to widen roads or\n     build malls or condos or be able to drain wetlands for such things too. I\n     have copies of these. Those permits allow them to destroy, or kill, flora and\n     fauna on the endangered species list of Ontario and their habitats. So how\n     can they be trusted to stop the destruction of a species before it's gone too\n     far.\n     \"Purpose of the Policy - Proposing to list cormorants as game bird, create a\n     hunting season for population management.\"\n     There is no 'real' purpose to this bill other than the decimation of a\n     species of bird.\n     \"Regulatory impact statement: The anticipated environmental consequences of\n     the proposal are expected to be neutral.\"\n     \"The anticipated economical consequences of the proposal are expected to be\n     neutral but depend on levels of hunter participation.\"\n     In other words as long as no one kills the birds there wont be any changes.\n     But if the hunters get on board, then the impact will be the decimation and\n     possible extinction of a species from our areas.\n     These birds eat invasive fish, are useless for human consumption and when you take a species out you will upset the balance. This bill is strictly to allow the killing of a species.\n     There is so much - morally and sustainably - wrong with this bill that our\n     government is trying to implement.\n     The government needs to listen to biologists, rehabilitators and others in the know to learn from them and implement rules and regulations to make it so the human species can live with other species and not just think that eradicating them is always the answer.\nEducating the public, letting people know that the government is trying to learn too, will make for a better end to the story.\n     Do the right thing...stop this from going through.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"The introduction to this proposal states that Double Crested Cormorant (DCCO)  numbers are stable or slightly declining based on current information. In addition, the proposed rules for the \"hunt\" make it clear that what is intended is a cull by citizen hunters, thus the bag limit of 50\/day and no requirement to retrieve dead or wounded birds or to make use of the meat. It tarnishes the reputation of the OMNRF to present this proposed cull as a \"hunt\".\nIn addition, this \"hunt\" puts other species of colonial nesting birds such as Black Crowned Night Herons, Ring Billed Gulls, Herring Gulls, Common Terns, Great Blue Herons, Caspian Terns, American Egrets and White Pelicans at risk because they nest near or within DCCO colonies and will have their breeding disturbed by the Cormorant \"hunt\" and some other species may become casualties of inaccurate marksmen.\nFurthermore, the role of DCCOs in keeping non-native fish such as the Round Goby in check does not appear to have been considered.\nI doubt that DCCOs are responsible for any significant damage to game and commercial fish populations when compared to other factors such as environmental contaminants and competition from non-native introduced species.\nI believe it to be very reckless policy to allow this \"hunt\" without studies to show harm caused by the current numbers of DCCO.  Plus, it is a reckless policy to allow hunting of DCCOs during the spring\/summer breeding season.\nI urge OMNRF to rethink this reckless \"hunt\" proposal.\n",

        "comment":"I oppose the proposal to allow hunting for Double Crested Cormorants. It is poorly thought out and wrong.\n1. The proposal background states: \"There continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\"\na) In my view, merely expressing a concern is insufficient grounds for changing the regulations in such a fundamental way, or even bringing a desire to the level of a proposal by a government agency, and as a formal proposal in the Environmental Registry. Using concerns voiced by only a small segment of Ontario residents, or concerns voiced only by small and limited-number special interest groups sets a very bad precedent.\ni. I am an angler for trout, and I sometimes fish in lakes that are stocked at great expense, but I and fellow anglers are aware that Loons take a huge toll on freshly-stocked Brook Trout; should I and fellow anglers propose that there should be spring and summer hunting on Loons both to protect trout stocks, stop Loon impact on sport fish stocks that are exploited by myself and other anglers, provide more fish on more lakes for a longer period each year so that the fishing industry (makers and retailer of tackle, bait sales, etc) can sell more and contribute more to the economy, and provide a higher return in fish caught by anglers from the expensive hatchery and stocking program?\nii. It does seem that MNRF is supporting this proposal, if my interpretation of the wording is correct. But there does not seem to be any standard for what number of groups, or number of individuals, is sufficient for the MNRF to take the time to create this proposal. How many individuals are required to voice a concern about the aesthetics of a treeless island that was formerly treed- 1,000, 500, 50, or only 10? If a group of citizens, with evidence supported by a group of doctors, gets together in various Ontario cities and voices a concern that Pigeons are a health hazard to people, ruin statues and buildings with excrement, and are just generally unsightly, will the government float a similar EBR proposal to allow sport hunting in cities, over-riding municipal restrictions on discharge of firearms? I don't see any effective difference between cormorants and pigeons in this regard. Can my friends and I, and like-minded individuals across the province, propose a catch and kill at any time, by any means, without a limit or need to take them home to eat, everywhere on Lake Superior and its tributaries, on Rainbow Trout can legitimately be classed as an Invasive Species that effectively supplanted the native Brook Trout in Lake Superior since Rainbow were planted around 1900.\nb) There is no actual evidence of the level, if any, of cormorant impact on fish populations, islands, other species and aesthetics provided in this proposal. If such evidence exists, it should have been made available; not providing some actual facts to support this statement suggests that such evidence of harm is either totally lacking or so minimal as to not be significant. If the harm was significant, why is it not provided?\ni.  MNRF has whole network of biologists and fisheries managers who have been monitoring both fish stocks and commercial and sport fish catches and their impacts, all over the Great Lakes and inland waters for many years. Surely this proposal could have found some supporting evidence for the statement that cormorants are, or have been, or might be, detrimental to fish stocks. There is no supporting detail at all in this statement. What species of fish, and was the impact localized or general? If the impact was only on sculpins on Lake Superior, it doesn't seem that cormorant control is warranted. if the impact was very significant, on a prime sport or commercial species, there is no indication of it in the proposal. It may be that there has been a detrimental impact on Yellow Perch in shallow waters around some nesting islands, but if so that is not provided as part of the proposal rationale, giving us the opportunity to weight the proposal against perhaps the only real fisheries and economic detrimental impact.\nii. Cormorants are not randomly or evenly distributed across Ontario. They tend to concentrate where there are suitable nesting islands. This suggests that the detrimental impact of cormorants, if any, are localized rather than general across the province. But, the proposal neither provides any evidence of exactly where these impacts are located, nor why the proposed hunting season should be in effect across the whole of Ontario. If there are a few cormorants nesting on a tiny rock in the middle of some northern lake in the boreal forest, why would the open season need to apply to them? If on the other hand there are ten thousand cormorants nesting at one location on Lake Ontario, where perhaps an argument could be made that they must be having a detrimental impact on fish, why not restrict the hunting proposal to those specific locations? Modern GPS navigation devices allow very precise metes and bounds descriptions of areas where hunting might lawfully take place, so there is no need for an Ontario-wide hunt in this proposal.\niii. Detrimental to aesthetics? When did this become a cornerstone of fish and wildlife management in Ontario? This is a 'beauty in the eye of the beholder' issue. There is no detail provided on just what aesthetics are involved. Who gets to choose on such a subjective decision as aesthetics? If we start going off in this kind of non-game-management direction, why not accept proposals from motorists, and the economically-vital trucking industry, for a year-round season to control the ugly moose that cause human carnage and huge costs on Ontario's highways, year after year? A fatal moose accident involving multiple vehicles can close a northern highway for 8 or 12 hours to allow OPP accident reconstructionists to examine the scene, with a huge economic impact. Aesthetics- what about those pigeons crapping all over our beautiful statues? Snakes-many people are frightened to death of them, even the useful and harmless Garter Snake; why not have an open season on all snakes, as most people can't tell the difference between an endangered Rattlesnake and any other loathsome-appearing species.\niv. What other species are being impacted by cormorants. Are they other birds? If so, that would appear to have been the easiest area on which to provide some details; are cormorants taking the place of Common Terns or Caspian terns, or Great Blue Herons or Night Herons on nesting islands? Some of those are species of concern; if cormorants were displacing them why not provide such evidence? The lack of evidence to back up such a claim in the proposal suggests that no such evidence exists, or is very weak. Are the other species trees on some islands in the Great Lakes? For all we know, from the lack of specifics in the proposal, some Poplars that are extremely common all over the province were killed by cormorant nesting activity, but is this really a concern?\nv. There is no pro vs. con evidence or discussion. If the invasive species Roundnose Goby are displacing native species, but they live in the shallows around the islands where cormorants nest, is there not a benefit in having a high cormorant population to control the gobies? I don't know the answer to that, but was the question even on the radar when the proposal was written. In my view, the lack of information provided on this and the other parts of my answer alone, is sufficient to have this proposal withdrawn and if it is to be re-submitted, it must have good evidence to support it. At this juncture fish and wildlife management should be evidence-based, not concern-based.\n2. The proposal lists a number of changes that would be made to the F&W Conservation Act and regulations to permit the licenced hunt for cormorants.\na) But, there is no assessment of how this will affect law enforcement by MNRF, or how conservation officers will enforce the new regulations. Do Ontario officers have the tools (boats) to conduct enforcement in offshore areas where cormorants nest? Will budgets be increased to deal with this new hunt? Will man-hours and budget, already limited, be diverted from existing enforcement efforts to this new area of work? Given that this whole proposal smacks of a political gift to certain interest groups, will there even be a will to enforce and direction from managers to enforce this hunt?\nb) There is no assessment of how much genuine interest there will be in a lawful (following the new regulations) hunt. Surely a randomly-distributed questionnaire could have been sent to Ontario hunters; the MNRF have computerized records of all hunters in the province. I have held a resident hunting licence in Ontario for some fifty years; I did not receive a questionnaire nor was asked for my opinion on this.  The MNRF keeps records: just how many hunters expressed a specific interest in hunting cormorants? Was there even a \"straw vote\" among selected groups of hunters in some part of Ontario. If there are only a handful of hunters who plan to sit in a boat near nesting islands, these planned changes to the legislation do not seem warranted at all.\nc) Judging by the \"some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals\" listed in the proposal, these are not typical of people who hold small game hunting licences.\ni. What evidence is that these people, who are behind the proposed changes, will take the required hunter safety training and then take time from their commercial fishing business and summer barbeques, as the case may be, to sit in a boat near a nesting island with a shotgun and box of shells? The groups and individuals who are pushing for this must be well known, through this proposal, to MNRF; what level of participation has been expressed by them to take the training and buy the licences required, and how much actual time to they plan to spend in this hunt? As a hunter who talks to other hunters, I am not aware of any genuine interest by grouse hunters to spend time and effort on this hunt.\nii. Will this turn into a carte blanche allowing of commercial fishers without hunting licences to shoot cormorants from their fishing tugs? Is it a carte blanche for commercial fishers to go onto cormorant islands and destroy eggs and nestlings? Has this been considered in the law enforcement planning? Has there been any law enforcement planning or assessment on this?\nd) Will the proposed hunt be effective in producing the desired result, namely a reduction in cormorant numbers? I have been to cormorant islands on Lake Superior when they were nesting, for the purpose of counting Herring and Ringbill Gull nests and eggs; they often nest in the same places. When you come close with a small boat, all the cormorants lift off the island and fly around in wide circles around it. They don't come particularly close to the people. My recollections now are that, although I was not at the time contemplating a shotgun hunt, they did not come close enough to shoot. My belief, based on my experiences on those islands, is that a boat-based pair of hunters floating near a nesting island might not be very successful in bagging any cormorants. Has MNRF looked at this at all in Ontario or other jurisdictions around the world? Has MNRF done any \"test hunting\" to see if indeed this is a viable hunt form the hunter's point of view? Will a poor hunting experience, after one or two outings, result in word getting around among hunters that this is just a waste of time, resulting in the long run in a non-useful bunch of legislation on the books that might be difficult to get rid of?\n3. Generally, in Ontario we protect fish and game species when they are nesting or caring for their young. For instance, we have closed seasons on many species of fish during the spawning and nesting times, to ensure successful and sufficient recruitment of fish stocks.\ni. It is clear from the open season dates provided, that much of the hunt will take place when cormorants will be nesting on eggs, or feeding their nestlings, on the nesting islands. In fact, around the nesting islands at exactly those times would be the only time and place that cormorants can be effectively hunted. After the nestlings fledge, cormorants raft on open water. To suggest that a lone hunter will put out cormorant decoys on a beaver ponds, and sit there all day waiting, is ludicrous.\nii. There is still a lot opposition in Ontario to a spring bear hunt, because some cubs might be orphaned. But in the case of cormorants, the hunt specifically targets adults that are returning to their nesting islands to sit on their eggs or feed their young. On the face of it, this is inhumane. If a farmer leaves a chicken to die of starvation, he can be charged with a criminal offence. In the case of a \"very successful hunt\" around nesting islands, it is possible, even likely, that many orphaned nestlings will be left to starve to death. Has this issue been addressed by MNRF, or even thought of, when writing this proposal. It is possible that the level of adverse public reaction to the proposal will far outweigh any favourable public reaction by a small number of interest groups and individuals. Has MNRF run this proposal past any other agencies to determine if there is a \"humane hunting\" issue or conflict?\n4. The proposed changes would allow for hunters not to have to eat their cormorants. I suppose if they HAD to eat them, nobody would hunt for them. I wouldn't. I know a person who years ago was part of an expedition to collect bird specimens for the Royal Ontario Museum; because they were way up north with limited food they ate what they shot, and my friend said that Loons are just awful and fishy tasting. Cormorants must taste the same. But so do the mergansers, which are lawfully hunted ducks that eat fish. Will hunters who mistakenly kill a merganser instead of a Mallard be allowed to just chuck it in the bush because of the awful taste, using cormorants as a precedent? I have cooked Spruce Grouse that made the whole house smell of turpentine; will there be a change in regulations to permit them to be left in the bush because they don't taste good?\n5. This proposal, if implemented, would set bad precedent in so many ways.\na) If commercial interests (fishing) are the main driver of this proposal, when can we expect an open season on elk in Algoma, of whom many farmers have complained in Algoma for eating grass and hay intended for cattle. Similarly, Algoma farmers complain about Sandhill Cranes that congregate in immense flocks every autumn on local farms. Both farmers and farm groups, and hunters and hunting groups, might want a year-round open season on Elk and Cranes. If Wild Turkeys start destroying crops, can concerned groups of hunters and farmers propose an all-year hunt? In all these species, there is not even the 'waste of flesh suitable for food' issue at play.\nb) The proposal to leave the flesh of cormorants taken under a small game licence, to spoil, sets a bad precedent for future proposals from the public about the flesh of mergansers, Spruce Grouse, pike taken from muddy water, etc.\nc) It opens fish and game management and the regulations for proposals by small interest groups, when, as in this case, there is no larger need or desire by the public. Heartened by any success in this endeavour, small groups may start to demand their own changes to the legislation.\nd) This proposal is not evidence-based. If there is evidence of harm by cormorants, it has not been expressed. No change to the legislation affecting any Ontario fish or wildlife should be contemplated without good and sufficient evidence to back it up. This proposal could open the field to other evidence-lacking proposals.\nend\n",

Some of the smaller lakes have been overrun by these birds (300+ on our small lake alone). They have also decimated all vegetation on one of our small islands within 2 years of nesting there and it is now barren and covered in their excrement. They have now begun nesting on another small island that will likely suffer the same fate. Unless something is done to curb their population growth there will be serious environmental and fish population repercussions.\n",

        "comment":"I totally support the hunting of cormorants in the Great Lakes Basin of Ontario for the following reasons.\nThey are currently unchecked and have devastated some of the beautiful islands and other areas in and around the Great Lakes due to their acidic excrement.  Boating or fishing downwind of these areas is repugnant because of the overwhelming stench.\nCormorant populations have greatly increased due, in large part, to the advent of the zebra mussel that has made the Great Lakes much clearer allowing the birds to easily see and catch game fish (bass, perch, walleye, etc.) at extended depths.  Noticeable reductions in game-fish specie populations have been the result, impacting sport and commercial fishing.\nThe economic result of all of this has been decidedly negative.  Sometimes it is necessary to do the balancing between species that is not being done by nature alone.\nOn behalf of those of us who use, sustain economic livelihood, and experience the environs of the Great Lakes and connecting waters, I urge the passage of this logical law.\n",

        "comment":"This is a bad proposal. As a resident of northern Ontario, living in a city that relies on healthy lakes economically, ecologically and culturally\/socially, I am very concerned about numerous aspects of this proposal. First, it would undoubtedly have devastating consequences not only for Double crested cormorants, but also for all the other bird species that nest alongside them. Nesting birds are not able to tolerate people shooting at them OR next to them - they cannot differentiate between a shot that is aimed at them, and one that isn't! Having people shooting at them from a boat is going to destroy the nesting prospects for all of the bird species in a colony - not just cormorants. This is absolutely unacceptable. I think that if the provincial government is really concerned about potential threats to commercial fish stocks, they should look at more serious human-derived factors first. More genuine efforts to protect fish stocks would include protecting aquatic environments from pollution, staving off human-caused toxic algal blooms (which are increasing as the number of ice-free days on many of Ontario's lakes increase), and preventing transfer of invasive species. The Double crested cormorant is being used as a scapegoat for human mismanagement, and many, many other species would suffer disastrous consequences if this proposal is passed. Decisions like this should be evidence-based, and informed by science - not driven by special interest groups. What we need (and by \"we\" I mean communities that rely on healthy lakes for their economic, social and ecological importance in our lives) is a government that takes the time to research, consult broadly (not just with lobby groups), and develop policies that are actually likely to be both effective and ecologically responsible. The Migratory Bird Convention exists for a reason. We Ontarians don't need this, and we lake-dependent Ontarians don't want this. Please re-think this one.\n",

Fishermen are under the illusion all fish in lakes is only theirs for the taking but many wildlife depend on these fish for survival.  Eventually, will ALL wildlife be targeted to appease hunters and fishermen?  No animal eats more than they need to survive but many people do no do the same as I've seen many fishermen do when fishing.  Killing cormorants and the unfortunate loons mistaken for cormorants is unjustified as a means of protecting fish stocks for unscrupulous fishermen.

Their numbers are greater because our water quality is better and this is good news. There is no concrete evidence that cormorants are causing a decline in fish populations. They feed mostly on non-native fish like Alewives and Round Gobies.\nThe idea of shooting cormorants at their breeding colonies during the breeding season is misguided. Double Crested Cormorants share their breeding colonies with many other colonial nesting birds like Common Terns, Caspian Terns, Black Crowned Herons and Great Egrets. Allowing shooting in the breeding colonies during the breeding season will have a serious disruptive effect on the other species let alone on the cormorants.\nPlease rethink this entire plan. McMaster University biologist and cormorant researcher, Jim Quinn, makes some excellent points in his article:\nhttps:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/9059210-nature-not-bullets-should-co\u2026\nPlease consult with Dr Quinn and other experts to determine the best approach to this situation. He makes an important point:\n\"cormorants are approaching or have reached a point of zero population growth. That means we may be in a situation where the population is not going to expand any further. Any efforts to kill off a certain number of cormorants, will throw the population back into a more rapid growth form.\"\n",

However, further down in the same notice its states;\n\"To comment on the proposal, please submit your comments online by clicking the \u2018Submit a comment\u2019 button, or by reaching out to the contact(s) listed\u2026..\"\nRationale and Eye of the Beholder:\nIf the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) was considered \u2018cute and cuddly\u2019 or \u2018majestic\u2019 or \u2018beautiful\u2019 in the court of public opinion, this proposal would not even be considered.\nIn New York State, the Department of Environmental Conservation recently proposed culling mute swans. Unlike native double-breasted cormorants, mute swans are an exotic invasive species native to Europe and their populations have grown dramatically in some areas. Like the double-breasted cormorant, they are huge birds with seven-foot [two-meter] wingspans and can have a significant impact on local ecosystems. But because mute swans are big and beautiful and people form emotional attachments to these birds, a huge public outcry forced the agency to reconsider.\nThis Notice incredibly, states one of the primary reasons to maim and kill these sentient creatures is because of concern over \u2018aesthetics\u2019. The Notice indicates that those who want these birds killed are property owners because these birds are not cute and attractive but are large, noisy and smelly and interfere with recreational enjoyment which arguably can be just as noisy and unattractive.\n This proposal is just another example of our hubris and ignorance.  This plan to cull these inedible birds under the guise of designating them as \u2018game birds\u2019 is more than deceptive and flies in the face of the MNRF\u2019s Statement of Environmental Values that the Ministry is there to :\n\u201cTo protect, conserve and where reasonable, restore the integrity of the environment\u201d, as well as, \u201cThe protection and conservation of biological, ecological and genetic diversity.\u201d\nThe very wildlife the Ministry is charged with protecting will fall victim to the greedy cosmetic whims of us humans. Before Europeans became a major presence, double-crested cormorants lived throughout much of their current North American range, in populations far greater than 21st century observations. After birdwatching near Natchez, Mississippi in December 1820, John James Audubon reported:\n\u201cWe saw today probably Millions of those . . . Cormorants, flying Southwest\u2014they flew in Single Lines for several Hours extremely high\u201d\nIt is not clear why cormorants have to be added to the shoot-to-kill list since cormorants can already be killed by a landowner if they damage or are about to damage private property.\nIt should be noted that in a comment posted to an online media article regarding this proposal, the commenter stated once this proposal comes into effect, he and his cottage neighbours plan to wipe out the colony near them.  The MNRF has no way to prevent this from happening under this proposal and it is entirely possible that the entire population could be wiped out in a single year.\nEnvironmental Impact:\nThe Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, and angling community argue the cormorants consume fish that might otherwise be caught by humans. However, according to the federal government\u2019s Canadian Wildlife Service, that is not true. Studies presented to the CWS indicate that less than two per cent of a cormorant\u2019s diet consists of \u2018sport fish, such as lake trout or salmon\u2019. The same reports indicate less than one per cent of a cormorant\u2019s diet is made up of the fish that sport fish eat.\nFurthermore a federal study concluded: \u201cStudies have repeatedly shown that, in a natural environment, cormorants feed primarily on small, non-commercial, shallow-water fish.\u201d\nA 2010 study found that cormorants are actually an important tool in the fight against the invasive species round gobies:\nDouble-crested cormorants are feasting on round gobies, leaving more sport fish, especially small-mouthed bass and yellow perch, for anglers.\n\"Cormorants seem to be opportunistic feeders that take whatever is most available,\" said Russell D. McCullough, senior aquatic biologist for the state Department of Environmental Conservation. By studying the contents of cormorant pellets, regurgitated bones, scales and other undigested particles eaten by the birds, DEC officials reached the conclusion that in 2009, 91.6 percent of the cormorants diet consisted of round gobies from Lake Ontario. Cormorants consume almost 14 million fish during their stay in the north country. Round gobies, an invasive species in the lake, account for 12.7 million of that take.\nThe gobies are dominating the cormorant diet so the birds are eating a lot less of other species, Mr. McCullough said. http:\/\/www.ogd.com\/article\/20100825\/OGD01\/308259886\/0\/ogd01\nThe argument has also been made the excrement of the cormorants has resulted in the destruction of ecologically sensitive island habitats and as another reason to allow for the mass killing of these birds.  This is rich coming from the MNRF who has approved hundreds of \u2018overall benefit\u2019 applications by commercial, industrial and residential developers and municipalities that will decimate a vast variety of species at risk populations as well as biological and genetic diversity province-wide. Furthermore, the ecological damage by the construction along shorelines for residential structures inevitably results in the complete removal of all pre-existing natural habitat and is far more destructive than these isolated bird colonies.\nThe Toronto Region Conservation Authority adopted a non-lethal management approach to mitigate cormorant-induced tree mortality in 2008. In one of the largest colony of double-crested Cormorants in North America, double-crested Cormorants were managed for space occupancy rather than population size, with the main objective of minimizing tree mortality while supporting the cormorant population.\nIt is reprehensible that those most responsible for the erosion of this province\u2019s natural heritage will be allowed to further degrade it simply because these native birds who existed  and thrived for thousands of years are now considered simply \u2018offensive\u2018.\nCulling is Killing and Cruel and Does Not Work:\nThis proposal for the mass killing allowing dead and injured birds to spoil is appalling in its seeming assumption that these creatures will not suffer both physically and psychically. Jaak Panksepp, one of America\u2019s leading neuroscientists, has concluded that both animals and humans have brains wired to feel emotions, and that animals have the capacity to experience pleasure and happiness.  Those who will apply for licences will be those who hate these \u2018nuisance\u2019 birds especially since they are inedible as game. How humanely does the MNRF think these \u2018culls\u2019 will be carried out when there is obviously an intention to rid waterways of these birds.\nWhile the proposal calls for the use of non-toxic shot as required by the federal Migratory Birds Regulations, non-toxic shot is much more expensive than toxic lead shot. So what are the chances that the safer, but more expensive shot will be used to kill off what is considered to be nuisance vermin? The MRNF will not have the means or staff to ensure that toxic shot is not being used. It is quite possible that scavengers will be exposed to lead contamination.\nStudies world-wide conclude culled populations, in effort to ward off extinction, bear more young. This \"compensatory rebound\" effect is evolutionary; when there's a sudden decrease in the population; species survival kicks in to induce a high reproductive rate.\n\"The general theory of harvesting animals is based on the premise that when animals are not harvested at all, growth and recruitment are balanced by natural mortality and that the average growth rate of a population at its carrying capacity is zero. Harvesting reduces the population size, but the reduction results in an increase in the growth rate of the population. This increase in growth rate is brought about because of higher birth rates and lower death rates resulting from decreased competition for resources. This increased growth rate provides a surplus of individuals above the number required to replace the population, and this surplus can be harvested.\" William Robinson, Wildlife Ecology and Management\nIn 2004 and 2005, Ontario\u2019s Liberal government authorized a mass cull of cormorants on two small islands in a provincial park near Trenton, technically to \u201cprotect the environment\u201d and more than 11,000 birds were shot. Eggs in more than 3,000 ground nests were oiled to prevent hatching. More than 2,000 tree nests were destroyed but obviously were not effective.\nThe long-term ecological effects of cormorant culling are uncertain.  It is unknown what the cumulative impact will be since other jurisdictions currently allow for cormorant killing or will adopt Ontario\u2019s plan.\nIn 2016, it took the courts to stop this massive slaughter and indiscriminate persecution:\nCOURT ENDS CORMORANT SLAUGHTER IN ALL EASTERN STATES\n\u201cDepredation\u201d Orders for Double-Crested Cormorants Rescinded Immediately\nPosted on May 26, 2016\nWashington, DC \u2014 A federal court has quashed \u201cdepredation\u201d orders under which tens of thousands of double-crested cormorants are killed each year in 24 states east of the Mississippi, according to a ruling and order in a lawsuit filed by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). As a result, the nearly twenty-year legal regime of indiscriminately shooting these aquatic fish-eating birds for the supposed benefit of sports fishing and aquaculture has come to an end.\nIn March, U.S. District Judge John D. Bates found that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) clearly violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in giving open-ended approval for \u201clethal removal\u201d of double-crested cormorants \u201ccommitting or about to commit predation\u201d on fish in Eastern states through\n2019 without current data or adequate scientific analysis. But that earlier ruling stopped short of ending the depredation orders and instead called for additional briefing on a \u201cremediation plan.\u201d\nIn his May 25, 2016 ruling, Judge Bates concluded, after the two sides had made their case, that revoking or vacating these depredation orders was the appropriate remedy, by finding that \u2013 individual permits for removal, as are used for most other birds protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, would be sufficient to alleviate any \u201cany serious detrimental impact\u201d caused by cormorants; the FWS had ignored the environmental benefits of cormorants, such as curbing invasive fish\npopulations, and helping co-nesting species. Moreover, its predictions of adverse eco-effects was unsupported and rested upon \u201cabstract\u201d and \u201ctentative\u201d assertions; and the FWS claims of economic disruption were \u201cimprecise,\u201d \u201cspeculative,\u201d and not \u201ccompelling.\u201d \u201cWe urge the Fish & Wildlife Service to abandon its myopic \u2018predator bad \u2013 kill predator\u2019 approach to perceived human-cormorant conflicts,\u201d stated PEER Staff Counsel Laura Dumais, noting that FWS adopted depredation orders as a convenience over individual, situation-specific removal permits.\nSummary:\nThis proposal is not based on scientific evidence but because some in the human population find these big, noisy, smelly birds to be objectionable. The animal which most greatly threatens and damages biodiversity is us humans. If we are not willing to cull our own species we cannot morally justify culling another.\nCulling does not work and is cruel. The cumulative impact of culling is unknown.\nIt is humans that have caused the damage to fisheries and aquatic ecosystems through overfishing, introduction of exotic species and pollution.\nInstead of  trying to \u2018manage\u2019 cormorants through mass killing, reducing coastal pollution, securing conservation land and marine preserves, and assisting aquaculture producers and fishermen to develop new bird conservation practices would be not only be practical but also sustainable.\nColonial bird specialist, Linda Wires states in her book, \u201cThe Double-Crested Cormorant: Plight of a Feathered Pariah\u201d these once numerous birds were driven to near extinction twice in Ontario\u201d\u2026 so is the MNRF hopeful that the third time is the charm, so like the also once numerous passenger pigeon we can look at these amazing creatures only as images online or dead birds on display in museums?\n",

Early in the 1980's we saw the return of the Blue Heron, followed some years later by the Loon, both have continued a strong comeback of steady but slow growth.  One day in the year 2005 I spotted what I first thought was a Loon diving for food but soon realized that this was a different bird as it floated lower in the water and when approached instead of diving it took off and flew up into a nearby pine tree, Loons do not do that, I knew right away that this was not a Loon but a rather strange bird only seen by me before in the Florida Everglades.   Over the next few weeks this bird was joined by several more and they frequented the same area and the same tree.  By the end of the summer that tree turned white and died along with all the vegetation on the ground below it.  The following year their numbers increased by staggering amounts to the point where they outnumbered all other water foul in the area and took to roosting in the next standing pine trees.  Today that little island and standing pines is totally destroyed with no chance of recovery for years to come.  I can only conclude that the underwater destruction on bait fish and small game fish is suffering also as the fishermen are no longer coming to this beautiful area.\n",

        "comment":"This proposal to allow cormorant populations to be managed is long overdue.  We have seen a thriving small mouth bass sport fishery crash in a few short years.  The average number of bass caught has declined drastically in this time along with a great reduction in smaller, younger fish.  Bass, and other species, have altered their habitat behaviour in response to the greatly increased predation pressure from the over-abundant cormarant population.  In several locations along the shoreline, the treelines are being destroyed where large colonies of cormorants roost.  The eastern portion of Gravelly Bay in Port Colborne is completely polluted in the warmer months due to the enormous volume of excrement from these birds.  The water is discoloured to an opaque green and the odour spreads for over a kilometre.   The negative environmental and monetary impacts of this situation need to be addressed promptly.  If any impact can be hoped to be achieved, the large daily limit, no possession limit AND ammendment to allow the carcasses to be discarded is integral to the proposed plan.\n",

However, we do need to examine these activities from time to time, to ensure that we are in line with how developed and advanced societies have evolved in terms of management of wildlife resources and the value placed on humane practices.\nI have two points to make regarding this legislation - the first is that there seems to be little protection for the disruption of other species during their breeding season. This is difficult to police and enforce and may result in the loss of other species that are currently at risk or in a low number situation.\nThe second point is the number of birds allowed to be taken.  50 per day is a very high number when we do not know the impact this may have on the total population.  It would be wise to start cautiously so as to not disrupt the balance of nature. Allowing birds to \"spoil\" is also unacceptable.  Cruelty is not an acceptable practice in society today. Hunters and others have worked hard to change that view of their recreation activity, let's not go backwards.  As well, given our changing climate, all wildlife is facing change at an unprecedented pace.  They are having to adjust migratory patterns and feeding patterns quite rapidly and this places additional stress on the current population.\nThank you.\n",

This proposal does not account for the overall impact that this type of devastation creates in the cormorant\u2019s environment. Using civilian hunting licensing to control an animal population is irresponsible and unscientific right from the start. It is also inhumane and sets a low standard of care and responsibility to our wildlife and environment.\nAs a taxpayer in this area, I am asking for greater attention to the welfare of our wildlife and wild land by reducing the rights of hunters and eliminating their devastating impact on our wildlife. If controls are necessary to balance the cormorant population, then natural predators could be introduced or a restructuring of our idea of what balance means in this situation.\nTo say that cormorants are negatively impacting our environment is irresponsible and irrational. The human impact on fish populations is far greater and more devastating. From the aesthetic perspective, again human activity has a greater negative impact and it is the human impact that needs to be addressed without the use of hunting to devastate any of our wild lands.\nThis situation also lends itself to review that hunters have on other people (who aren\u2019t hunters) being forced to deal with the horror of meeting a hunter during a hike or on a lake or river. These moments can be devastating to the wellbeing of other people as well as the animals being killed or being present during a massacre.\nPlease put a stop to this concept that this is in anyway a decent means to mange the health of our environment.\n",

        "comment":"Comment regarding EBR number 013-4124: Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario.\nThis proposal, if enacted, would cause harm to Great Lakes ecosystems and would not have the effects hoped for by commercial fishing and property owner groups. The changes proposed would have unpredictable repercussions to fisheries and lake ecology, cause avoidable suffering to nesting birds and nestlings of many species, set several bad precedents that may open the door to poorly planned, reactionary wildlife management practices in the future, and reflect badly on hunters and the Province of Ontario.\nWhile cormorant numbers are at a historically high level, the driving factors behind this increase are anthropogenic changes in the ecosystem, such as the addition of nutrients to the water, making the system more biologically productive and changing the system from a cold-water fishery to a warm-water fishery; the introduction of several invasive, non-native species; and climate warming. Energy and nutrients now flow through the food web, supporting more biomass in prey species through to the top predators like cormorants. There are now more shallow, warm-water fish species like yellow perch, sunfish, bass and pike, and exploding numbers of introduced species like round goby, white perch and alewife. Cormorant populations have reacted to this increased food availability and not suddenly become detrimental to fish populations.\nCormorants now play an important role as top predator in the new regime. They provide the ecosystem services of limiting prey populations and helping balance the food web as it reacts to changing conditions and human-caused perturbances, in fact making the system more stable and robust. In addition, cormorants help keep invasive species populations in check. For example, in a 2016 study on Lake Michigan, (https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0380133015002750), Madura and Jones found that \u201cInvasive species, most notably alewife, round goby, and white perch, contributed over 80% and 90% of the diet of cormorants by biomass and number, respectively.\u201d The study concluded that its \u201cresults do not support the active management of the cormorants \u2026 to protect or recover local fisheries.\u201d The significant reductions in cormorant populations that the proposed hunting season would cause would clearly allow an increase in populations of invasive species, which would have detrimental effects on fisheries and biodiversity in the Great Lakes and reduce the capacity of the system to \u201cbuffer\u201d the effects of future invasive species introductions. Cormorant populations are ecologically important and should not be hunted in order to reduce their numbers.\nThe proposed changes to allow for a high bag limit, the spoilage of meat, hunting from a stationary motorboat and hunting during the bird breeding season are problematic on many fronts. This will enable hunters to approach island breeding colonies closely and kill hundreds of birds at a time from just one boat. This would cause panic, trampling, and abandonment of nests with young birds. Given the disturbance it would be impossible to keep tracked of bag limits. After the shooting, hunters would then have to go ashore, collect and properly dispose of carcases, causing even greater disturbance to breeding birds. Most cormorant breeding colonies contain other non-target species, including protected and declining species such as the common tern, which would also lose nests in the chaos. Nestlings of all species would die of exposure and starvation. This suffering would be seen publicly and internationally as extreme cruelty and probably violates laws protecting animals from such treatment. Additionally, many colonies are on protected islands such as the Limestone Islands in Georgian Bay (Killbear Provincial Park), nature reserves such as Snake and Salmon Islands in Lake Ontario, and on privately owned islands. It would be very difficult and expensive to regulate and enforce any hunt that would spill over to such lands. Summer hunting also has great potential to cause disturbance to cottagers, local residences and safety issues with recreational boating.\nMany people view sport hunting as a legitimate activity that provides food and gets people out into nature. The proposed changes would darken this image and turn sport hunting into killing for killing\u2019s sake, undermining the practice and image of hunting as disciplined, government-regulated and conservation-minded. This proposal harkens back to the disgraceful days of unregulated market and plume hunting and evokes the loss of the Great Auk, Passenger Pigeon and Carolina Parakeet.\nFinally, these unprecedented changes would make it to too easy for similarly ill-conceived, reactionary management efforts to be levelled against other native species that are sometimes seen as competing with people for resources or considered unaesthetic. These changes would result in behaviour and levels of killing and cruelty that will be documented by the media and seen by the public as a massive wildlife cull. No sensible government ministry would proceed with this proposal, given these risks.\n",

This is just so bad that some of us out-door types will be surely injured by over-enthusiastic, simple-minded  hunters.\nAre you going to set aside areas for normal people to keep away from (which is most of Ontario's lakes districts) during \"cormorant hunting season\" - which is to be almost all year?  This is the worst idea I have heard of in all my years - from a past, highly recognized government department. Don't do it!\n",

        "comment":"I am strongly opposed to this proposal. Culls are not effective conservation or wildlife management. This particular proposal is very problematic and ill-advised.\nAccording to Gail Fraser, a biology professor at York University and expert on cormorants, \u201cAn open season on the cormorant is an open season on the loon\u201d, as the two birds are commonly confused as they glide majestically across the water.\nExperts like Fraser also note that the concern of anglers that cormorants deplete fish stocks is not supported by the science. According to the federal Canadian Wildlife Service, a cormorant\u2019s diet consists of less than 2% of fish that anglers and commercial fisheries want.\nA concern of many is the potential impact of hunting parties on one of the largest colonies on the Great Lakes located at Tommy Thompson Park on the Leslie Spit in Toronto. Peaceful Parks Coalition has noted that \u201cAs long as sport hunters remain in their boats, and do not step onto the shore, there is nothing restricting them from coming close enough to shoot nests from below, killing adults peacefully tending their young and the chicks. The enjoyment of Toronto Harbour will be reduced by the presence of gunshots and flying bullets and dead birds floating to shore.\u201d\nPeaceful Parks has also rightly noted that \u201cdouble-crested Cormorant colonies contain several other colonial waterbird species such as Herring Gull, Ring-billed Gull, Common Tern, Caspian Tern, Black-crowned Night Herons, Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, White Pelicans, who will also be disturbed during their breeding season by this hunting activity.\u201d\nThis is just a bad idea all around. Please stop buying into the hate and fear of cormorants, or the idea that guns are the solution. Instead, please consider the information and perspective contained in this article (linked) by the Director of Animal Alliance Canada.\n",

        "comment":"I object strongly to shooting these cormorants indiscriminately, and leaving the bodies to rot, and likely leaving sick and injured birds, as well as nestlings that will starve. Even though the information claims these birds have recovered in population, with uncertain climate how do we predict if they will continue to thrive?\nHaven't we lost enough wildlife yet? Until we reverse the extinction curve I think it is high folly to allow hunters to shoot without the usual minimal requirement that the dead animal be taken and presumably eaten.\nThe nuisance factor of guns going off, disturbing other species, including humans, and the possibility of killing non-target birds or animals just makes me conclude this is giving a licence to shoot for target practice because there is permission to do so.\nThe localized driving off of the birds with harassment or a much more controlled approach to killing birds, not a long open season permission to shoot as many as you like anywhere (and likely on private property?) and leave them to rot, sounds like an intelligent, thoughtful, responsible approach.\nPlease don't sanction this change!\n",

        "comment":"Comments submitted on Proposed double-crested cormorant hunt in Ontario,\nEBR Registry Number: 013-4124\nBackground. I study and teach the biology and management of colonial nesting waterbirds. Both my MSc and PhD were on colonial nesting waterbirds.  Since 2006 I have undertaken research on double-crested cormorants (hereinafter cormorants) and participated in The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority\u2019s Cormorant Working Group.  I have an ongoing long-term monitoring project (10 yrs) following breeding chronology and productivity cormorants and black-crowned night-herons.  My students and I have also undertaken other cormorant-related research projects which fall outside of the monitoring goals. This research has thus far resulted in six peer-reviewed publications specific to cormorants and cormorant management (McDonald et al. 2018, Gupta et al. 2017, McRae et al. 2017, Andrews et al. 2012, Taylor et al. 2012, Taylor and Fraser 2011).\nI am opposed to this proposal and provide rationale for my position below.\nThis proposal originates from the OMNRF and as such the justifications provided for a cormorant hunt should be science-based. The generic statements on double-crested cormorants without data to back such statements are a problem.  The OMNRF should have a full and detailed rationale to provide justification for this proposal, as well as population modelling exercises, population level targets to support the extreme daily bag numbers being proposed, exactly how the cormorant population will be monitored to determine effects of a hunt and an evaluation of the negative impacts on non-target species.\n1.\tDetrimental to fish populations.  The science behind determining whether a cormorant population has a negative effect on a particular fish population is complex (Wires et al. 2003).  There are factors that could negatively impact the abundance of a particular fish population: human predation, predatory fish (multiple species), predation by other waterbirds (e.g., red-breasted merganser; Bur et al. 2008), competition from other prey which would include multiple species, abiotic considerations (e.g., water temperature) etc.   Thus, rigorous scientific studies are required for each fish population consumed by cormorants (Wires et al. 2003; see also Dorr et al. 2014 for a summary of cormorant fish predation).\nAs one of the presumed intentions of this proposal is to increase fish abundance by reducing cormorant predation, additional factors which influence fish populations should be considered (see Wires et al. 2003).  For example, predicted changes in the distribution and abundance of walleye due to climate change (see Van Zuiden et al. 2016); and how changes in lake ice will modify aquatic food webs (Ontario Biodiversity Council 2015) should be considered.\n2.\tIsland habitats. Cormorants nest in high densities (Dorr et al. 2014). Where they nest in trees they will cause the mortality of trees in 10-15 years (e.g., Lemmon et al. 1994; Herbert et al. 2014) which is a natural ecological process.  Cormorants do not occupy all available island habitat; they have only occupied 3% of the U.S. Great Lakes islands over a 30-year period (Wires and Cuthbert 2010).\nIf particular islands or forest patches that host at-risk species are being significantly modified by cormorants, local, small scale management such as deterrence and culling (e.g., Middle Island, Point Peele National Park) may be appropriate . Non-lethal management, deterrence and knocking down nests, should be used first to disperse them (McDonald et al. 2018).  For roosting cormorants, a tethered raptor has successfully displaced birds (Quinn et al. 2012).\nAesthetics are presumably an additional factor for this section.  People dislike the change of a forested island to a non-forested island.   Yet, ecological processes involve change.  Cormorants are a native species to Ontario and this is what they do. On a far larger scale, humans are significantly modifying the landscape in Ontario. For example, in Ontario forest cover the mixedwood plains ecoregion is declining (Ontario Biodiversity Council 2015); and agriculture is a primary a driver of species endangerment in this ecoregion (Kerr and Cihlar 2004).\n3.\tOther species. In general, competition within and among species is a part of evolution and proposing a provincial wide cull because one out-competes another is a disproportionate response and not necessary.\nCormorants nest with other species both in trees and on the ground. Tree-nesting cormorants can nest among great blue herons, black-crowned night-herons, and great egrets (see Rush et al. 2015 and references therein).  Caspian terns and ring-billed and herring gulls can co-occur with ground-nesting cormorants.  This means there are a considerable number of species which could be disturbed from humans on or near colonies; and hunting activities will be detrimental to all birds nesting nearby (Carney and Sydeman 1999).  Disturbance to non-target birds would presumably violate the Migratory Bird Convention Act.\nI will include comments on the positive impact cormorants have for bald eagles. Bald eagles were de-listed from the Endangered Species listing in the U.S. and their population is increasing in Ontario, though they are still listed a species of special concern in Canada (Armstrong 2014; Environment and Climate Change Canada 2017).  Bald eagles on the Atlantic coast are negatively impacting seabird colonies by preying on adults and chicks (Hipfner et al. 2012) and farmers\u2019 chickens (Williams 2017).  In Minnesota cormorant remains were found in 40% of bald eagle nests (Windels et al. 2016). Ecologists predict a top-down effect of bald eagles on waterbird populations (Hipfner et al. 2012); bald eagles can take adult cormorants as well as juveniles and disrupt nesting colonies which can result in a site abandonment (Cairns et al. 1998; Armstrong 2014; Windels et al. 2016,). Based on other locations, it is likely that cormorants will provide a significant source of prey for bald eagles in Ontario in the near future and may assist in achieving the population recovery goal for the eagles identified by the OMNRF (Armstrong 2014).   Bald eagle predation should be incorporated into a model on what may suppress the cormorant population in Ontario.  In addition, the potential economic impact to free-range chicken farmers in reducing an abundant prey (cormorants) for bald eagles should also be under consideration.\nAdditional comments.\nUnlike ducks and mergansers, cormorants have altricial young where both members of a pair are required for nest success.  The killing of either a male or a female during the breeding season will result in their chicks starving to death even if the other parent is present.  How will the sustainability of this cull be assessed in this regard? Monitoring of the cormorant population will be done presumably via nest counts, but this approach does not assess reproductive success. Where strong rationale and evidence is provided, a controlled, local cull by OMNRF would avoid this situation. At Point Peele National Park, adult cormorants are shot at the nest site early in the nesting season when no chicks are present, thus permitting a reduction in nest density but avoiding unnecessary suffering and mortality of young (e.g., Dobbie and Kehoe 2012).\nThere is no mention of restricting hunting on or near colonies. Hunting on or near colonies would almost certainly disturb ground-nesting colonies, as well as disturb non-target, co-nesting species.  Cormorants will disperse to other locations; including new tree sites where available. A study using marked cormorants showed that the management actions of complete nesting failure resulted in the dispersal of adults to sites without management (Duerr et al. 2007).  The dispersing adults established 10 new colonies, and in some cases, moved up to 100 km away (Duerr et al. 2007) .  Disturbance to nesting sites may also have the indirect effect of increased predation on nests, thus lowering productivity even further and causing more dispersal (Carney and Sydeman 1999; Duerr et al. 2007).\nThere is, presumably, also a significant risk to recreational boaters given that the proposed hunting season is throughout the summer months.  When queried, the Toronto Marine Police did not know where the municipal boundary was on Lake Ontario with respect to hunting. They confirmed that at a minimum fire arm discharge would not be permitted within the harbor. Municipal boundary lines need delineation for all coastal cities and towns to ensure public safety.\nA controlled, focused management action by the OMNRF is preferred over a public hunt because appropriate steps would be taken to consult the public: it would be a targeted\nlocal action; data (i.e., date, location, the number of birds shot) would be collected; a target of the number of birds to be killed would be articulated; disposal would properly occur; and other data could be gathered from the killed birds (e.g., Coleman et al. 2012).\nA public hunt may disperse cormorants into new areas creating more conflicts \u2013 potentially moving ground-nesting birds to new tree or ground habitat and reduce prey for bald eagles.\nA blanket open season on double-crested cormorants is not warranted and its impacts would be difficult to monitor.\nThe change to the Fish and Wildlife Act to permit game wastage is unprecedented, a serious change to the Act and completely unethical.\nCormorants are a species native to Ontario (Dorr et al. 2014, McIlwraith 1894). A significant amount of financial resources was invested in creating a healthier environment which allowed the recovery of this species; their abundance is a conservation success story (Weseloh and Collier 1995).  Should this proposal be approved, specific targets should be articulated for the cormorant population in Ontario. To avoid the species becoming endangered again, these targets should be set prior to a hunt and their populations carefully monitored.  Annual monitoring data should be released to the public on a timely basis for comment.\nThis proposed hunt places other aquatic waterbirds species at risk, particularly ones that nest with cormorants (herons, egrets and gulls and terns).  Disturbance from hunting on non-target birds should not be underestimated; for example, it can displace birds from foraging areas and disrupt breeding (Masden and Fox 1995; Cairns et al. 1998).  Should this proposal proceed, how will the impact on other waterbird species be monitored?\nSince the proposal is for all of Ontario, enforcement and monitoring will be minimal and that alone should be the basis for a rejection of this proposal.\nLiterature Cited\nAndrews, D., G.S.

I am totally in favour of deeming them too be game birds. Not only do these birds destroy landscapes and vegetation with their feces, I am led to believe that they also eat their weight every day in young fish. It has gotten to the point where we don't even see otters any more and they used to be plentiful. There is still time to save the natural fish and the wildlife that depend on the fish population in the St. Lawrence river and region. As far as I know these birds are not truly native to our geographical location but have adapted well at our expense due to the fact that they have no natural enemies here. They are just too plentiful and need to be managed and that means thinning their numbers.\nSincerely,\nL****e L******sse\nP.S.

I think this idea sets a negative precedent, not only because it is a negative trend in our \u201cresource management\u201d (cormorants are not a resource nor are they a trophy), but because it is the manifestation of negative feelings for this species.  This is not the case for any other hunted species that I can think of in Ontario.  Elsewhere, seals may be a good comparison, but there is no seal culling happening in Newfoundland and Labrador despite calls for it.  There are some current calls for sea lion culls in BC at the moment also\u2026\nNew Brunswick has a varmint hunting season for cormorant March to September, and then a regular hunting season starting in September.  It would be good to know the effects of these policies on the cormorant population there: https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/new-brunswick\/shooter-targets-cormorants\u2026 .  There has been very little background information posted about this proposal to help with evidence-based decision making.  Opinions and concerns that cormorant populations are too high are not evidence.\nOther examples of predator culls have not had positive or effective results. With advice from experts, Newfoundland is not considering opening a cull on seals like some are calling for (there is a hunt, though, which has been declining).  The seal population is \u201cstable\u201d at the moment, and in fact, evidence suggests that climate change and humans are what are keeping the cod stocks low: https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/newfoundland-labrador\/seal-cull-science-\u2026 . My point is that eliminating the \u201ccompetitor\u201d has been shown as an inviable solution in more than one situation, despite the fact that it\u2019s the most obvious course of action.  In fact, having a variety of different predators has been shown in numerous circumstances to increase the overall biodiversity \/ resiliency of an ecosystem.\nMNRF is proposing that the cormorant killing can occur during breeding when the birds are colonial \u2013 i.e., when there are adults, eggs and chicks all near each other.  It seems to me with a shotgun, a hunter is bound to hit more than one animal without having to aim carefully.  What happens if birds are injured or chicks are parent-less?  There has been some bad press on this issue in the past (https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/news\/national\/environmentalists-condemn\u2026 )  A hunter would maybe have to be about 5 m away to ensure the shooting and killing of only one bird at a time.  Based on what they are proposing, one determined hunter with a small game licence could cull 2,250 cormorants in a season in central and northern Ontario.\nCormorants are a species very responsive to fish stocks, and would probably undergo population cycles, especially because the population can grow quickly.  The recent increase was the most pronounced because of the starting low numbers that resulted from DDT, but the MNRF states that cormorant numbers have leveled off or even decreased slightly.  Based on this information, hunting\/culling might do one of two things (depending on how many are killed):  it might accelerate a decline that has started, or, perhaps more likely, it may keep the numbers artificially higher than they would be if we just let cycles happen.  In fact, human actions (fish stocking, taking of big fish (that eat smaller ones), culling some cormorant eggs) might already be keeping the cormorant populations higher for a density-dependent species that would fluctuate, if allowed.  Basically, I agree with Jim Quinn as described in this article: https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/9059210-nature-not-bullets-should-co\u2026 .\nThere is no guarantee that culling will affect the high population (unless it is extreme as modeled here: https:\/\/besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1046\/j.1365-266\u2026 ) and further, there is no guarantee that killing the other fish predator will increase fish stocks (https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2012\/nov\/15\/seal-cull-canada-co\u2026) although I did find the following evidence that fish stocks could increase slightly after cormorant control measures are implemented in the Great Lakes (http:\/\/wildlife.org\/the-rise-of-double-crested-cormorants-too-much-of-a\u2026 ). There is no mention of the other control measures on the same population of cormorants that is happening south of the border.\nEvidence suggests that, because they are an effective generalist hunter, cormorants eat notable quantities of invasive species, for which we have very few control measures at the moment (e.g., https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0380133015002750 )\nThe proposal lacks accountability measures: how will hunters count how many animals they\u2019ve killed, how they will prove it, how they will prevent cruelty and ensure only the one species is killed?\nI do not understand the following:  Why have #1 if you already have #2?\n1) Create an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to December 31 each year across the province.\n2) Create an exemption allowing small game licences to be valid for double-crested cormorant hunting in central and northern Ontario from June 16 to August 31 each year.\nIn a paper from AB (Cost Effectiveness of Egg Oiling Versus Culling for Reducing Fish Consumption by Double-crested Cormorants in Lac La Biche, Alberta), cost per metric ton of fish-not-eaten-by-cormorants is much cheaper, and more predictable for egg oiling than for a culling program.  Egg oiling targets only one species and prevents cruelty to the largest extent possible.  Although not directly related to the proposal here, I think this paper provides good food for thought on how MNRF can competently manage cormorant populations without opening it up to a potentially vindictive public, who do not have the collective living memory to realize that the current population levels for the birds are natural and historical (http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/full\/10.1675\/1524-4695%282006%2929%5B9%3AHPOT\u2026 ).\n",

This is short sighted, and I cannot fathom how this is a priority.

This will also create health and environmental hazards from the large numbers of rotting birds. This will also result in increased gun use and subsequent disturbance, particularly in cottage country during family vacation time. This does nothing but cater to the pro-gun lobby to the effect that guns and killing solve problems. This will again push the cormorant back to endangered status, necessitating full protection.\nThe Herring Gull, Ring-billed Gull, Common Tern, Caspian Tern, Black-crowned Night Herons, Great Blue Herons, and Great Egrets will also be disturbed during their breeding season by this hunting activity.\nThis also encourages the belief, contrary to all scientific evidence, that cormorants are responsible\nfor depletions of game and commercial fish species.

The hunting of these birds will not have any affect where the government is hoping it will. The birds eat fish of little to no commercial value and are not favoured by sporting anglers. These birds have no serious effect on fish stocks. This move will encourage beliefs counter to what has been proven on multiple occasions through thorough evidence-based studies. The belief that these birds are responsible is simply untrue and uneducated. It merely promotes the thought amongst the academic and educated community that the government is looking to solve problems in simple, fast acts that have little to no evidence for their effectiveness, which is a common belief these days as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware.

I remember when cormorants first arrived and nobody knew what to make of them except that they came from the East Coast like the seagulls. Unlike ducks and geese that inhabit our area and swim around eating vegetation, every time you see a cormorant they have a fish in their mouth. As for their roosting habits, I look out at islands that have had extensive tree damage caused by their nesting habits.\nI think this proposal is a win-win solution and will benefit everyone involved.

But that can be said of gulls, loons and a number of other species who seem to have a kind iconic status denied to the vilified cormorant.  For too long, the MNR of Ontario--regardless of which party is in power and who is the Minister and his\/her staff--has dealt with wildlife as just another \"natural resource\" to be exploited when profitable or extirpated when regarded as undesirable by interests groups.  This is 19th century wildlife management in a 21st century situation, where species are being lost so fast and so irretrievably, that new ideas that favor species and the natural environment HAVE to supersede narrow human recreational interests, or else nothing will survive, including our own kind.\nPlease rethink this daft notion.  Oil cormorant eggs if you must, in the interests of somewhat impeding the success of this very successful species, vis a vis others, but do not institute a hunt, especially one so flawed as this plan is on every level.

Based on their published data in 2014 counted nests in 2011 approached 2800, an increase in counted nests over a 1993 count of less than a hundred.  (source Fisheries Management Plan for Lake Nipissing - OMNRF 2014) . Assuming one mating pair per nest and a reasonable estimate of 1 pound of fish per day consumed (source US Fish and Wildlife Service) per bird over the summer period of 90 days gives a conservative estimate of 504,000  lbs of fish consumed yearly out of Lake Nipissing by Cormoronts. To put this in perspective this is over 3 times the amount of walleye currently  removed by commercial fishing in this lake every year. This is a lake that has a severely declining walleye population largely dependent on the same food source over the same time period.\nPopulation growth of cormorants need to be managed in specific areas where populations are left unchecked and fish species populations are at risk.

The entire North American double-crested cormorant population is estimated to be less than the population of Toronto, with about 250,000 in the entire Great Lakes Basin and considerably less residing in Ontario.\nBecause they are conspicuous birds that congregate in colonies on exposed islands and peninsulas (only about 3% of potential island sites in the Great Lakes are suitable), they are particularly vulnerable, being easily targeted and killed, especially when nesting. Small congregations could be wiped out in just a few minutes or an hour, while larger colonies could be destroyed in just a few days or a week.\nRadical cormorant-haters have already attacked colonies under cover of night, destroying nests, stomping on chicks and killing adults. Once the proposed changes to the law come into effect, these people will be given free rein to destroy as many cormorants as they want. It wouldn\u2019t take very many people very long to wipe out most cormorants in the province, leaving just a tiny remnant of their population in a few protected areas. And driving them back to near extinction or even worse in Ontario is a real possibility.\n14 FACTS ABOUT THE ONTARIO CORMORANT ISSUE\n1. The Ontario government\u2019s proposal will allow individuals with a small game license to kill up to 50 cormorants per day. That works out to approximately 1,500 cormorants per month or up to 14,250 cormorants for the entire proposed annual hunting season.\n2. The presence of cormorants benefits other colonial water birds, such as herons, egrets and pelicans, all of which are stable or growing where cormorants are found.\n3. The mass killing of cormorants will not be beneficial. In fact, the process of killing them will force other bird species to vacate the colony sites they share.\n4. There is no way to kill cormorants humanely. Even controlled, organized culls in other regions have resulted in large numbers of injured and crippled birds being left to die of their wounds or starve to death, including nestlings.\n5. Cormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial, non-forage species.\n6. The mass killing of cormorants will damage the environment and disrupt natural ecosystem processes.\n7. The return of cormorants, a native wildlife species, to the Great Lakes Basin is part of a natural process.\n8. Cormorants are not overabundant in the Great Lakes. In fact, their numbers are modest, now stabilized and are dropping in many areas.\n9. Changes in the composition of vegetation in and around bird colonies are a sign of vibrant, dynamic natural ecosystem processes.\n10. The number of trees damaged or destroyed in colonial waterbird colonies across the province is miniscule and wouldn\u2019t even equal the number of trees in a single modestly-sized woodlot.\n11. Only a small number of islands (less than 3%) and peninsula sites are available for cormorants and other colonial waterbirds to nest on.\n12. The mass killing being proposed by the Ontario government is a political response to anecdotes, unsubstantiated claims and complaints by a small group of radical fishermen, supported by special interest groups. There is no substantive body of scientific evidence supporting their position.\n13. Instead of making cormorants a scapegoat for environmental problems they have nothing to do with, attention should be given to addressing the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, overfishing and a broad range of other issues.\n14. The proposed designation of cormorants as game animals, along with a non-utilization exemption that allows the carcasses to rot should be an affront to every hunter who believes in sportsmanship, fair chase and ethics.\n",

This idea is backward thinking and barbaric. Please do not create a hunting season for the double-crested cormorants. Thank you.\n",

Yes, their population has increased considerably but, the government's preposal to have open, unrestricted killing of adults and babies is unfair for a number of reasons:\n1)  Great Blue Herons nest in amongst the cormorants' colony. Many will be killed along with the cormorants. The Herons mate for life which would be devastating for the remaining bird and potentially their population.\n2)  Cormorants are also monogamous.\n3)  Many will be only injured, leaving a helpless bird to die a slow, agonizing and terrifying death.\n4)  Restocking the depleted fish areas would be a win win solution.\n5)  History shows, even with restrictions, hunters will show no regard to the laws or care what happens in all of my above comments.\n6)  Newcastle disease which is fatal has been killing hundreds of Cormorants. Why doesn't the government wait, let nature take its course first and see what happens.\n7)  Culling is a knee jerk reaction.\n8)  A more humane way would be to allow a licensed person to oil the eggs with paraffin.\nThank you for taking the time to read my comments.\n",

        "comment":"The policy sets the daily limit far too high. There is no reason that a hunter should be able to kill 50 birds in a day. Such a high limit would allow a single hunter to kill vast swaths of a colony on a daily basis. A limit of 2-4 is far more reasonable and achieve the goals of controlling the population without driving it to non-existence.\nAlso, without a reasonable limit, hunters will not be able to use all of the meat from the birds they kill. Surely we will end up with sport killing and cormorant carcasses left about. That\u2019s not the Ontario anyone wants to live in.\n",

        "comment":"In Ontario there is great concern about the Ford government\u2019s plan for the wholesale slaughter of Double-crested cormorants across the province.  According to the government's proposed regulation, any hunter with a valid Outdoors Card and a Small Game Hunting License will be able to shoot up to 50 cormorants per day for 10 months of the year (March 15 - December 30). And then  hunters can legally let the dead birds rot! The proposed regulations specify these points very clearly. It is little more than an effort to eradicate cormorants from Ontario.\nRecently on CBC Radio the Ontario Environment Commissioner Dianne Saxe said:\n\u201c Cormorants are a native species in Ontario. They were almost eradicated partly due to pesticides and DDT. And, they have made a tremendous comeback in Ontario and now the government is proposing to allow a tremendous slaughter of cormorants and actually just waste the meat. People will be allowed to shoot right through the summer cottaging season and then leave up to 50 cormorants each a day just to rot. So it will mean shooting in the summer where they shouldn't be shooting near people. It means devastating a species that just made a recovery. And, it means wasting the meat which is just an anathema to most hunters. ...\u201d\nWe thought this kind of assault on wildlife went out with the Buffalo and Carrier Pigeon hunters. Now we think we are wrong. Many hunters and fisherman and naturalist find this  such a retrograde approach, after many decades of widespread government and parental teaching about responsible hunting [no waste] and conservation values [leave the young and females alone].  Ask yourself what values are we teaching our young people with this proposed legislation that allows these birds to be killed and wounded when they are nesting with dependent young ......\u200band then just left to rot?\nIf this legislative change goes ahead, the shooting of cormorants can and will take place on Ontario\u2019s lakes where cottagers and permanent residents and children\u2019s summer camps and fisherman and boaters may also be located. To be clear -  the government\u2019s proposal means that licensed hunters, either in boats or transporting firearms in cars, will be on and around lakes for almost 70% of all the days of each year - hunting and shooting at cormorants.\nAnd why? The government says it is because some Ontarians want the law changed thinking that cormorants are supposedly eating too many fish that sport fishermen and commercial fishers want... and, that cormorants damage shoreline vegetation where their colonies are located. Scientific studies have repeatedly proven the first reason to be false; cormorants' main diet is small non-native fish such as alewives and round goby and some other small native fish such as perch. Rarely is anything bigger even ever caught by a cormorant. And, for the second reason - yes - cormorants and other colonial waterbirds such as herons alter the environment by breaking small branches off trees to build their nests. So do many other large birds. Trees and shrubs die from guano but the guano also enriches the soil as the environment changes and new trees and shrubs emerge. It is a natural process.\nCormorants were driven almost to extinction in much of North America because of extreme persecution in the previous century. They were almost eradicated in Ontario by the 1970\u2019s, along with other fish eating bird species, due to organochlorine pesticide poisoning. The provincial population of cormorants got down to a very small number of breeding pairs. History tells us that these birds\u2019 populations have been, and can again, be driven to endangerment by such drastic measures as are proposed by the government legislation. And this at a time when their numbers have peaked and are already naturally decreasing!!\nA main promoter and supporter of the plan is the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters who say they see more hunting opportunities for their membership  - and yet this legislation blithely ignores the OFAH\u2019s own published core principle and pledge of not wasting wildlife.  Commercial fishers who think that cormorants are eating \u2018their\u2019 fish have been corrected time and time again through scientific studies but still they persist in their view and their support for this legislation.\nThe Bill 205 legislative proposal is politically driven, cruel, unsportsmanlike and puts the public at risk.\n",

        "comment":"Good today,\nI am dismayed and quite frankly disappointed in learning of the renewed call for a proposed provincial law, Bill 205, which if passed, will allow the indiscriminate hunting and trapping of double-crested cormorants, lifting their current protection under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1997.\nPersonally I believe, and I am not alone, that the proposal to allow a hunting season in response to an increase in the numbers of cormorants is an impulsive one. Most animals which colonize new areas show a period of initial, unrestricted growth, just as we have seen with cormorants over the last 10-15 years. Such growth, however, can not be sustained forever. Eventually, the population outstrips its food supply, outgrows its habitat (or nesting areas), or is reduced by disease or predation. When this happens, the cormorant population can be expected to drop in numbers, until it stabilizes itself again.\nIn recent years, the explosive growth of the cormorant population has definitely slowed. The largest colony on the Great Lakes, at Little Galloo Island in Lake Ontario, showed a 31% decrease in\nnumbers of breeding pairs between 1992 and 1994. In 1994, the cormorant population of Lake Ontario decreased by 6%. This was the first such decline in over 15 years. In 1992, Newcastle Disease\nVirus killed up to 30% of the young cormorants in several colonies. These population declines and disease outbreaks are signs that other factors are starting to have an impact on the population. Thus\nit seems unlikely that the cormorant population will continue to grow as it has during the 1980s and early 1990s. According to fisheries biologists, stocks of the smaller prey fish have been decreasing dramatically in recent years. This decrease in the cormorants\u2019 food supply is probably already contributing to their decline on Lake Ontario.\nThe greatest controversy and complaint from the fishing and angling community appears to be around the subject of the cormorant diet in suggesting that the 'FACTS' are that cormorants threaten the sport fish industry.  According to the Canadian Wildlife Service, less than two percent of a cormorant\u2019s diet consists of sport fish. There is no empirical, scientifically determined indication that the fish consumed by cormorants have a significant, measurable negative impact on what is available to commercial and recreational anglers. Cormorants are opportunity-based fishers \u2013 they eat what is most abundant and easily available which prevents them from depleting stocks of any one species.\nLastly, although it\u2019s true that cormorants can cause damage to properties, the law already allows property owners to deal with this problem. Under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, property owners may capture or kill wildlife that is causing or is about to cause damage to their property, something that I personally am concerned about as not everyone will be responsible in ensuring that these animals are killed in a humane way.\nAs a long-time conservative supporter, I believe the prudent, responsible and balanced approach is to consider all the facts of this situation, not just those that support the sport fishing industry and do what is responsible in order to continue to protect this species. I am reminded of how the previous Harris government took the responsible step to end the spring bear hunt as it recognized the importance of protecting bears just out of hibernation. The Liberal government later reversed this decision and once again allowed spring bear hunting. It ignored science-based evidence that it was provided with from wildlife and conservation experts which debunked the belief that a spring bear hunt would reduce the numbers of human\/bear conflicts. I would like to see this new government take the same responsible action to ensure that cormorant species and all wild life continue to be protected in this province rather than perceived as a means of supply for fishing and hunting. They are first and foremost a valuable part of their respective ecosystem and environment.\nThank you.\n",

However, the proposed legislation goes much too far in two key respects:\n1) it allows too many birds to be collected per day by a hunter (50 birds). While that might be acceptable in regions where numbers need to be culled, it is not acceptable in most regions away from the Great Lakes where numbers are lower and not an issue. My main fear is that cormorant breeding sites will be eradicated in parts on Ontario where it is low in numbers resulting in local extinctions.\n2) it allows hunting during the breeding season. Chicks belonging to shot parents will starve. few game birds have hunting season that span the breeding season. Cormorants should not be an exception. More importantly, entire colonies will be eradicated since they are easy to locate.\nI suggest the proposal be amended to:\n1) set local quotas acceptable to that given region based on the need to cull and otherwise greatly restrict or prohibit cormorant hunting. Hunting should not be allowed across most of Ontario away from the Great Lakes region where population numbers are not a concern.\n2) prevent hunting during the breeding season when chicks are dependent on parents and when Great-blue Herons and Common Terns nesting nearby may be adversely affected.\n",

Although the birds seem solitary when they hunt, we often see them in large groups between our shore and the islands.\nTake trip up the river from Brockville to Gananoque and you will see how the birds are moving from island to island to establish new colonies.  We understand that it is legal to shoot them if and only if they are on your own property but let's face it, this is not America, we don't all have guns and it would be irresponsible for the average homeowner to be out shooting randomly at birds given the number of boaters, and tourists in the area at any given time.\nI am extremely in favour of a responsible cull, but it needs to be a cull that makes a considerable difference.\n",

It makes no sense to permit such activity when people are swimming in nearby waters and cruising in boats just beyond where the birds are.

A favourite prey item is the ubiquitous Round Goby, which preys on Smallmouth Bass eggs, so by consuming gobies, cormorants can be said to be providing a service to anglers. Where cormorants have been detrimental to desired fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics, authorities have oiled eggs in targeted and effective programs.\nGiven the animus some hold for cormorants, the proposed hunting season of 9+ months, a daily bag limit of 50, no possession limit, plus no requirement to retrieve and dispose of resulting carcasses will predictably result in wholesale slaughter of what is, after all, a native, migratory bird.\nAs a property owner with cormorants just offshore, I am also concerned that allowing hunting from a stationary motorboat will result in incoming rounds, as well as carcasses of dead birds washing ashore. I doubt that conservation officers would be supervising such a hunt.\nI do not support the cormorant hunt as proposed.\n",

        "comment":"I am concerned about this policy.  It seems inappropriate to me to have a hunting season that lasts for 8 to 9 months.  Hunting would take place during the cormorant's breeding season which could have unintended consequences on the overall viability of the population.\nI understand that cormorants have a deleterious impact on the vegetation around their nesting colonies.  I know that many people don't like the birds.  However, they are part of our natural ecosystem and they play a part in the ecological chain.  I think there needs to be stricter guidelines on hunting:\n1.  A shorter season, that starts after the breeding season and when young are largely self sufficient;\n2.  A much lower number of birds to be shot per day and\/or a maximum number of birds that each hunter can kill.\nIf the hunting season is going to incorporate the breeding season, then hunters should not be allowed to camp out at a breeding site and start shooting.  The birds are held captive to their nests when they are hatching\/raising their young.  Allowing shooting at a breeding site would basically amount to a sanctioned slaughter.  Would that traumatize surviving birds such that they avoid a breeding site in future?  What effect would that have on future population management?\nI think these questions need to be outlined and pros\/cons set out in the policy outline, with evidence to support the ministry's position that its plans do not significantly impact the species.  While I'm not a scientist, I find it hard to believe that hunters being allowed to shoot up to 50 birds a day with no maximum limit imposed would not have a significant and likely negative impact on the species, depending on the number of licenses issued.  It would be better to start with smaller numbers and monitor, increasing limits if the evidence warrants, rather than kill off massive numbers and then have a threatened or vulnerable species that requires investment to save.\nThere must be sufficient oversight to ensure that hunters actually retrieve the birds and dispose properly of the bodies.\nI profoundly hope the government will review their position and that their final policy will take into account the concerns of conservation specialists and comments from Ontarians.\n",

I have been gainfully employed as a trappers assistant, a fishing guide and as Forestry Technician with the MNR before relocating to Southern Ontario.\nI have watched with interest the Cormorants population over the past 45 years. My observations are mainly from areas of Lake Ontario (Toronto and Hamilton), Orillia, Georgian Bay and the west shores of Manitoulin Island.\nTheir population has surge over the past 25 years inline with the environment recovering from Dioxin, DDT and other known water pollutants.\nI remember my sightings of a small group (4 or 5), some 35 years ago off the shores of west Manitoulin Isl. I saw them 2 or 3 times a week. I watched with interest as they were not very common at the time. 5 years ago I was chasing cormorants out of a narrow creek that spills into Lake Huron. Only to find that they had return the following day. This creek is heavily populated with Rainbow Trout and Salmon fry from the previous fall spawning.\nToronto shoreline sightings were also rare. Now, between 8 and 10 am, one can watch many flocks, spaced minutes apart, numbering in the hundreds fly west toward their feeding waters. Thousands. Too many to count. One would need to count by 50s to get an estimate. One can only imagine the damage this number of cormorants do to the fish populations of the waters they choose to feed. It is no wonder that the decline of our game fish spieces, in these waters, also corresponds with the surge in the cormorant population. One only has to do the math. Weight of fish eat bird requires per day X ? Thousands X 365 X ? Years\nThe MNR has spent 10+ years studying the affects the cormorants population has had on our province. It was initially introduced as a 5 year study.\nI believe 100% that action must take place to reduce the cormorant population drastically.\nThe proposal has addressed the \"meat waste\" issue as carcass pickup and disposal is a must. There would be public out cry if carcasses were allowed to litter shorelines and beaches. The one thing that concerns me and should concern the MNR is that there is going to be a lot of negativity due to the fact that there will be the frequent sound of firearm discharged in areas and seasons that are generally without. As an avid hunter (45 years) and fishman (50+ yrs). I can under stand the concern and  discomfort from hearing gun shots while fishing, hiking, swimming, cottaging or any other family activity during a time that hunting is not the norm. Most of these activities generally wind down before the start of the traditional hunting season. I believe this will be a strong negative arguing point against the proposal that the MNR must be prepared to address.\nThank you for seeking public input.\n",

This recovery coincided with the decline in predatory fish in the Great Lakes, allowing forage fish stocks to increase, cormorants fed on this overabundance of forage fish species and their numbers increased. Cormorant numbers are declining at present, and should self regulate. In some areas such as cottage shorelines, culling of local cormorant populations may be necessary to prevent destruction of the vegetation along these areas. And in some locations, if it is proven that overabundant cormorant populations are negatively affecting other waterbird populations, then yes, have well planned, publicized culls, so the public understands the situation. Letting people shoot cormorants in or near the mixed species colonies where they nest will inevitably result in the deaths of non target species, either by outright assassination or by scaring other species off their nests.\nBut and this is a big but, don't declare cormorants a garbage species by declaring a virtual open season on them as a limit of 50 birds a day with no possession limit will do. And allowing hunters to abandon their kills and leave them floating???, what kind of message does that send to our up and coming hunters and our kids. And what about those rotting carcasses that wash up on cottage shorelines and beaches? has anyone given any thought to that?\nI enjoy hunting and eating what I shoot, but this situation makes me wonder what the future of hunting will become if the government who is mandated to conserve the wildlife species in Ontario caves to the pressures of those who do not like a species because they think that species competes with our over indulgent use of resources, we spent money to sponsor research in the north channel to find out what cormorants actually eat, and very little of their diet consists of game fish were the findings of this study. Using a species as target practise is unethical and will drive a further wedge between hunters and non-hunters, what are our wildlife managers thinking????????????? . This proposed legislation has the potential to severely reduce or wipe out this species in this area, the repercussions of this in the form of trophic cascades has not even been considered, have we studied the role of cormorants in nutrient cycling or as a prey base for our newly recovered Bald Eagle populations? The removal of a species from an ecosystem always has repercussions that we do not foresee or expect.

There is no scientific evidence which even suggests that this species is a significant threat to the commercial and sport fishing industry in Ontario or for that matter all of North America. The success of this species is partially due to improvements in the environment and the introduction of invasive species, such as the Round Goby and Alwife, which they have adapted to feed on.\nPassing of this proposal would be a environmental travesty and would cause serious damage to an important component of our current established ecosystem, which has evolved over the last 50 to 60 years.\nThis proposal is nothing but free ticket for an uncontrolled slaughter of a native species. This slaughter would disrupt the current balance in the ecosystem. As these birds are not eaten, of no commercial value, and are not game birds the slaughter will result in the addition of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of bird carcasses into the water which is the source of millions of Ontarians and our neighbours on the Great Lakes. In addition to the carcasses themselves, there will a significant risk of outbreaks of disease such as avian botulism, as the carcasses rot in the anaerobic environment at the bottom of our water ways. These outbreaks will pose a significant risk to all aquatic life in Ontario including desireable game birds such as ducks and geese and other species protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.\nThis proposal does not address the impact the additional volume of non-lead shot being added to the environment. The impact of this additional heavy metal contamination is not understood and has not been thoroughly investigated.\nIn addition to the above concerns there is also the risk that this whole sale slaughter would have on other more \"desireable\" and protected wildlife.\nThis proposal is ill conceived and based on rumour and hearsay and not on scientific fact. Not only does it threaten our sensitive natural environment it threatens the health and safety of all of our citizens as well as the citizens of our neighbouring provinces and the U.S.\nThere are many other proven methods for managing wildlife and if a threat from overpopulation is scientifically proven, these other less risky methods should be implemented rather than a whole sale uncontrolled slaughter of a species.\n",

Yes, they are problematic for killing off trees on islands because of their guano at their nesting areas and when they do so, the M.N.R. correctly  tries to control them.\nBut just to kill them (and let them rot!!) is certainly against any views of people who care for the natural environment.  Would prove that fishermen don't give a damn about all of the natural environment, just want to kill off the Cormorants so they think there will be more fish for them to kill.  They don't kill Cormorants for their own food.... just to get rid of them.....and let them rot.\n",

        "comment":"The culling of the Double-crested Cormorant in Canada I believe to be necessary to protect habitat degradation, but I believe that an open season for most of the year is a bad idea. I will lay out some concerns and suggestions in the following opinion piece that I believe to be a safer and more gradual culling of the bird without the possibility of destroying the population and having indirect effects on other habitat and fish populations.\nThe idea of having a 50-head bag limit with no possession limit is extremely high and unnecessary. I believe the Ministry of Natural Resources does not understand the potential popularity of this cull. Hunters, from my personal experience, despise these birds, and having the opportunity to shoot 50 per day could become detrimental to the population very quickly. Furthermore, the hunting season is too long and should rather line up with the duck hunting seasons to be consistent in regulation for migratory birds. This will give the Double-Crested Cormorant a better survival chance. I do not believe that these regulations will allow for the population research to keep up with the death of the birds.\nThe Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunter\u2019s is the largest proponent of the culling of the Double-Crested Cormorant. A July 2016 article released by the OFAH titled The Facts about cormorant control in Ontario lays out a list of sensationalized facts about the detrimental effects of the bird. In this article a few things pop out that raise more questions than answers. Firstly, the OFAH states that they commonly eat species like Alewife, Yellow Perch, Smallmouth Bass and Round Goby. They go on to say that even though they eat the detrimental invasive fish the Round Goby, there is \u201cNo research showing that cormorants offer significant control for the species\u201d (OFAH 2016). That is not enough to convince me that they are not making an impact on their populations. Maybe the control is not significant but perhaps adequate and still making a difference.\nThe OFAH claims that the bird enjoys eating the popular game fish the Smallmouth Bass but there are scientists who refute this claim. An article by Nancy E. Seefelt entitled A Disconnect between Science and Management for Double-crested Cormorants in Northern Lake Michigan claims that \u201cresults indicated that the Double-crested Cormorants do not negatively impact smallmouth bass populations\u201d (Seefelt 2018). The article goes on to say that because of the culling of Double-crested Cormorants in traditional colony sites on the ground they moved to tree nesting and in turn affected other co-nesting species (Seefelt 2018). This sediment is echoed by Wyman et al. in an article titled Great Lakes Double-Crested Cormorant Management Affects Co-Nester Colony Growth which concluded that cormorant management plans may not be neutral to co-nesters and any cormorant management plans must take this into consideration.\nIn conclusion I believe that we do not know enough about the positive impacts that Double-crested Cormorants have on invasive fish populations, their relationship to co-nesting bird species and how detrimental a large cull might be to their overall population. My suggestion is lower culling limits and conduct more research into the negative effects of the Double-crested Cormorant before wiping out their entire population. Allow for certain segments of populations that are detrimental to high risk susceptible habitats to be culled but restructure the proposed bill with the above concerns in mind.\nWORKS CITED\nOntario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (2016) The Facts about Cormorant Control in Ontario: A backgrounder for bill 205: Fish and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Act 2016.

        "comment":"What are you people thinking?  50 limit...there will be an  indiscriminate slaughter.  What do you gain by such a proposal?  The cormorant was here many years ago prior to the wipe out by DDT.  Let nature take its course.  Fishing will improve not by exterminating cormorants but by limiting fishing till the stocks recover.  Where is your science?  Do you think we should hunt all species if for some reason someone determines there is an abundance?   Do you recall the story of the passenger pigeon?  Perhaps you could review that debacle.  I am President of the Field Naturalists or Ontario and Michigan and all our thoughts will be forthcoming.\n  \"anticipated levels of harvest aren\u2019t expected to affect sustainability\" - okay, well where's the data to back this up?\nthe hunts will occur during breeding season - let's say we ignore the damaging impacts that this could have on the overall cormorant population. Think about all the other colonial nesters that are often mixed right in with the cormorants. If someone hunts at a multi-species site, you're going to disrupt and potentially ruin the breeding success of many other species, such as Herring Gull, Ring-billed Gull, Black-crowned Night-Heron, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, American White Pelican (a species at risk in Ontario), Common Tern, and Caspian Tern.\nsafety concerns - locally, our hunt would be mid-June through August. That's also our prime boating time. Here in the Desbarats area, there are many small rock island that host cormorants, but they're also along major boating routes. Obviously, duck hunting occurs on the water with no issues, but that's the fall when there's less boaters and hunters are usually more secluded in bays and uninhabited wetlands. I'm sure most cormorant hunters would take every precaution to be safe, but that may not be enough to settle the fears of nervous boaters as they pass by some cormorants. Maybe this isn't or won't really be an issue, but at least something to think about.\nBag limit is way too high - one dedicated anti-cormorant hunter could, on their own, put a real good dent in a local population. This might be harder to do in Southern Ontario, but up here, probably doable. Would be interesting to see how many people actually take advantage of this hunt though. I've definitely heard a lot of people around here say they wish they could go out and blast them.\nis there really a way to police the bag limit? - the limit is set to 50 a day. What's to stop someone from taking their 50, going and dumping them, then going back for another 50? Obviously, many hunters like to follow the rules so I guess there's got to be some trust too. I also guess anglers could do the same thing, take their catches home and go back out again, and that is never brought up.\nCall it a cull, not a hunt - since the dead cormorants will likely be allowed to spoil, that's exactly what everyone is going to do. They should at least call this a cull, not a hunt.\nIt is my understanding that scientific data rejects many common complaints , I'm told, by trusted sources, that there are many peer-reviewed, scientific studies that contradict many of the claims anglers make, such as their origin in Ontario, the amount and species that they eat, the damage they do, their population size, etc.\nAfter acid rain destroyed many Killarney lakes - acid tolerant perch survived - when the lakes chemically recovered - lake trout fry were reintroduced - but were just eaten by the over population of perch - the solution was to put in adult trout to eat down the over population of perch so the young lake trout would not be eaten by excessive numbers of perch.\nIn Lake Nipissing where gamefish have been decimated by over harvest - would you not think bait fish populations have exploded - no wonder there are cormorants - but are cormorants natures way of removing bait fish so that the few remaining game fish can successfully reproduce - also have not read any papers on this.\nThere  is a similar response to pelicans in NW Ont - over harvest of game fish = lots of bait fish = lots of cormorants and pelicans = fishermen blame the pelicans and cormorants for the crash of the game fish population.\nPlease reconsider this poorly planned proposals.\nRon Prickett President Sault Ste. Marie Field Naturalists\n",

Sometimes its used either in response to lobbying pressure from a special interest group or a situation that was left unmanaged for too long and the determination to kill one species of animal to potentially save other animal populations seems like the only thing to do. Example: killing wolves in BC to \"save\" an imperiled group of caribou. In that case, it may very well have been habitat degradation which created the situation in the first place. Culling seems lazy and misguided.\nSo now the scapegoat is the Double-crested Cormorant. My greatest concern in this proposal however is less about the obvious effects on the cormorant than the toll on many other species of birds who will get caught in the \"crossfire\" as collateral damage. accidental or intentional.  To allow hundreds of carcasses to rot in situ is certainly going to degrade the quality of water bodies and wetlands. And promoting such large scale open season on this bird in areas frequented by humans who want to enjoy the outdoors for recreation is a potentially dangerous and disturbing mix of guns, binoculars, boats and swimmers... oh and carcasses.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed hunting season on double-crested cormorants is outrageous - both for its suggestion, and for the additional exemptions suggested.\nFirstly, in the proposal details themselves it is outlined that the cormorant has previously been a species of conservation concern, and that the numbers are now stable or declining. In no way should a species that has been, and may well again be at risk ever be submitted to such unsustainable harvesting. There is no scientific evidence that cormorants are devastating fish populations or habitat quality. Without this there is no justification for damaging a native species (and with this it would be questionable).\nAdditionally, the suggested terms are deplorable. It is suggested that a hunting season be established across both breeding and migration seasons. This endangers virtually all other waterbirds and shorebirds (as well as others) due to the disturbance caused by the hunters, the common misidentifications, and the fact that the proposal also suggests that the birds can be left to spoil. What justification is there to circumvent the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, scientifically robust legislation put in place to conserve our native species? A bag limit of 50\/day soon adds up to the estimated population of cormorants in the province, and even if that estimate is low, the option to remove tens of thousands of birds per person for anyone with a small game license is wrong.\n",

As a citizen-science initiative dedicated to protecting birds, we strongly oppose this proposal for the following reasons:\nThe proposal says: \"There continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\" There is no evidence provided (including in the supporting materials) to support the first three concerns. The last one, aesthetics, is frivolous and does not justify the killing of any species.\nWhile Cormorants eat fish, biologists have found no proof that they affect the fishing industry. If \"anticipated economic consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral\", it suggests the hunt would neither hurt nor help the fishing industry. So why allow it?\nWhile Cormorant colonies cause trees to die off in small, localized areas, this is part of a natural, dynamic cycle with longer-term benefits. If \"anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral,\" it follows that the hunt would also neither hurt nor harm the environment. So why allow it?\nPermitting a bag limit of 50 birds per day from March 15 to December 31, from stationary motorboats, and allowing the meat to spoil is an invitation to hunters to massacre entire colonies for \"fun\", even during the breeding season when the birds are incubating eggs and raising their young. This isn't sports hunting; it's wholesale slaughter. Our government should never condone never mind encourage such wanton cruelty. And if property owners have aesthetic concerns about Cormorant colonies, would they not have aesthetic concerns about trees draped with hundreds of large, decomposing birds?\nThe words \"Hunters will continue to be reminded to properly identify their targets to avoid conflicts with migratory game birds and other waterbirds\" are a stark reminder that many hunters are unable or unwilling to identify first and shoot later. If hunters kill American Coots thinking they are ducks, and Trumpeter Swans thinking they are Snow Geese (examples of both have come to our attention), they are certain to shoot Common Loons, Common and Red-breasted Mergansers and other water birds thinking they are Cormorants.\nFinally, this sentence is disconcerting: \"Those interested in hunting cormorants or who believe cormorants are having detrimental impacts will likely support the proposed changes.\" It implies that people's desire to kill or the mere belief that a species is detrimental, regardless of fact, is sufficient cause to consider the eradication of a species locally. The decision to allow any hunt should be based on scientific evidence and rational decision-making, not the desire to indulge people who like to kill for fun, or who just don't like certain species of wildlife.\nThis poorly devised proposal should not have been considered in the first place.\n",

I worry that this hunt will have very detrimental impacts on other birds who nest in the same areas as cormorants - terns, for example. The cormorants that frequent my shoreline are hunting gobies - an invasive species. Although I am aware that the population of cormorants is growing very quickly, perhaps too quickly, I believe that this should be addressed with a more complex and thoughtful approach than just all out warfare against these birds. They do play a role in the ecosystem, and that role is intertwined with the lives of other species of birds whose numbers are declining.\n",

They appear to have no natural enemies and have invaded small lakes and rivers where they rapidly deplete the fish population , consuming up to a pound of fish per bird daily.  This leaves other wildlife that depend on fish such as loons without a viable food source.  This upsets the balance of nature down the food chain.\nCormorant droppings are highly acidic.  These birds cluster in large groups in trees and their droppings kill the trees and surrounding vegetation within a very short period of time.  Many islands on small lakes are now totally void of vegetation.  Shoreline areas and river tributaries are equally affected. These highly acidic cormorant dropping foul surrounding waters and as their numbers increase at an alarming pace this problem will only get worse Droppings on buildings and vehicles such as boats and cars eat away at the paint and metal causing thousands of dollars per annum in Ontario.\nI urge the provincial government to pass this bill.  It is important to restore a natural balance of nature in this province and to allow for the protection of vegetation in our lakes and water.\n",

If it is related to sport fisheries, do we know that cormorant are responsible for taking sport fish? The latest scientific studies indicate that cormorants eat mostly alewife and round goby (two invasive species that compete for resources with our native fish) (see Johnson et al. 2010, Coleman et al. 2012, Johnson et al. 2015, David et al. 2016, King et l. 2017).\n2.\tIt seems to me that in order to respond to the concerns of the commercial fishing industry and property owners we need a better understanding of the impact of a cormorant hunt and a better understanding of what exactly is ailing the commercial fisheries. The proposal does not indicate any scientific justification behind either the effectiveness of the proposed cull or how removing the main predator of invasive fish will affect the food chain and benefit native fish?\n3. Cormorants are native to Ontario. The culling of native species goes against many of the basic principles of conservation biology. Cormorants are part of the food chain and are a prey of bald eagles. Bald eagles need cormorants (and gulls) to eat!\n4. The cormorant population has stabilised or declined slightly as stated in your proposal.  What is the number of cormorants that this policy aims to achieve?\n5. The largest cormorant colony is at Tommy Thompson Park (TTP) in Toronto, a very popular hot spot for bird and nature lovers.  How could a hunt be allowed at TTP?\n6.\tShooting birds would disperse birds to new locations.  Has any modelling been done to see where these dispersed birds would be heading?  Hunters shooting birds and collecting carcasses would certainly disperse a great number of birds that will seek refuge elsewhere, possibly starting new colonies.\n7.  Cormorants often nest with other species (black-crowned night herons, great blue herons, egrets, gulls, terns etc...).  Shooting would disrupt all of these sympatric nesters.\n8.\tThere are other methods of controlling bird populations that might be safer and more effective than shooting birds and having to dispose of the carcasses. Have you considered oiling eggs or disrupting nests?\n9. How would a hunt be monitored? The proposed season seems extraordinarily long and could have a very quick and long-lasting effect on the population.\nReferences:\nColeman JTH, Adams CM, Kandel M. et al., 2012, Eating the Invaders: The Prevalence of Round Goby (Apollonia melanostomus) in the Diet of Double-crested Cormorants on the Niagara River, Waterbirds, Vol 35 (1) 103-113.\nDavid EA, Chipault JG, Lafrancois BM, 2016, Gut content analysis of Lake Michigan waterbirds in years with avian botulism type E mortality, 2010-2012, Journal of Great Lakes Research, Vol 42 (5) 1118-1128.\nJohnson JH, Ross RM, McCullough RD, Mathers A, 2010, Diet shift of double-crested cormorants in eastern Lake Ontario associated with the expansion of the invasive round goby, Journal of Great Lakes Research, Vol 36 (2), 242-247.\nJohnson JH, Farquar JF, Klindt RM et al. 2015, From yellow perch to round goby: A review of double-crested cormorant diet and fish consumption at three St.Lawrence river Colonies, 1999-2013, Journal of Great Lakes Research, Vol 41 (1) 1118-1128.\nKing LE, deSolla S, Marentette JR, 2017, Fatty acids, stable isotopes, and regurgitate reveal diet differences between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), Journal of Great Lakes Research, Vol 43 (3), 132-140.\nMadura PT, Jones HP, 2016, Invasive species sustain double-crested cormorants in southern Lake Michigan, Journal of Great Lakes Research, Vol 42 (2) 413-420.\n",

The proposal is nothing more than a wholesale slaughter as the flesh of these birds is unpalatable. Merely because a creature has become successful despite human efforts to destroy its environment is no justification for wanton destruction of a species - no matter what perceived harm some falsely believe is occurring.\nEven if the ministry's suggestion that a native species is harmful is accepted at face value, other areas of the proposal are entirely egregious. The season is far too long, lasting throughout the summer. The presence of firearm hunting in recreational and tourism areas can only be disruptive. Having hunters present and firing weapons from a boat is stunningly dangerous.\nThe fact that there is little by way of control or enforcement is cause for some alarm. The current hunting and fishing regulations go largely unenforced as it is now. How will the ministry even monitor potentially hundreds of hunters in small boats?\nAs a sport fisherman and a recreational property owner I can honestly say that game fish stocks have NOT been impacted by the success of cormorants. Even if I'm wrong  (I'm not) the appropriate response would be reducing catch and bag limits for recreational fishing and buying back commercial fishing licences. Not the slaughter of a native species that has as much right to the habitat as any other species, humans included.\nIn addition, no facts whatsoever have been provided to support the mistaken belief that cormorants are harming fish stocks or that the proposed extermination will have the \"desired\" outcome.\n",

I support controlled culling to help reduce their numbers and impact where they are a recognized ecological problem, but also I realize that maintaining healthy ecosystems and habitats are complex issues and the poor health of the lake system caused primarily by nutrient loading is a bigger problem that needs serious attention and solutions.\nAllowing an open season by hunters on this migratory bird species is a simplistic and poor solution--and will likely be challenged in the courts.  It is ill-advised and should not be permitted!  An uncontrolled free-for-all hunt where the objective is just to kill as many birds as possible without any monitoring, protection of non-target birds at risk, or habitats where they are not an ecological problem, and letting the killed or wounded birds to 'spoil' is bad sportmanship, bad science and gives the wrong tone to the role of hunters in wildlife management and how to intelligently manage natural ecosystems.  Drop this poorly thought out proposal!  Consult with wildlife scientists to find a better solution!\n",

Your opening statement provides all the necessary information to abandon this crazy proposal: \u201cthe latest information indicating Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly.\u201d\nThe only justification (and I use that term loosely) for this proposal is:  \u201c concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\u201d  I then looked to the supporting documents and did not find any material, scientific or otherwise, to support the premise that Cormorants were detrimental to fish populations or island forest habitat.\n\u201c\u2026the Ministry will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends.\u201d  Looks like you are putting the cart AFTER the horse. Do the science first and if Cormorant colonies are a significant problem come up with site specific solutions. Don\u2019t start with a blanket, province wide, season long, unmonitored(because that is what it will be) murder spree that requires legislative changes to make cormorants a game species that must include a special compensation to allow the meat to spoil.\nIf the Province wants to protect game fish species you can start with the following three recommendations:\nBan the use of live bait\nBan the use of depth\/fish finders\nBan the use of down riggers\nI enjoy the great outdoors like many in Northern Ontario. My enjoyment does not require the wanton killing of this persecuted species.\n",

The first is to allow hunting of the birds from a standing boat. Translated, this means that a person could be in a boat along the harbour front in Toronto with a gun shooting toward the shore at birds. This is ludicrous. It only takes two seconds to imagine the potential of shooting a person. The second is the plan to modify the requirement to retrieve and dispose of the dead bird bodies. This bill proposes that people don't have to do any such thing and can actually just leave the carcasses of these large dead birds to rot on our Toronto waterfront. The allowance to shoot is 50 birds per person per day. Just imagine how putrid this will be on the water front. The City of Toronto has spent a significant amount of our tax dollars to beautify and maintain the Toronto waterfront and this bill flies in the face of this. The potential revenue loss from people refusing to attend the waterfront is huge. Finally, we, as a people, need to figure out a way to embrace the wildlife that resides in our cities and towns instead of arbitrarily killing anything that we feel is a nuisance or an irritant. There are studies from here to kingdom come illustrating the negative results of creating an imbalance in nature, of eradicating species, of overhunting etc. etc. Perhaps, for once, we could try learning from our past mistakes and make the better plan to live harmoniously with our wildlife before we kill it all.\n",

Where one never saw a cormorant in these waters 15yrs ago, now they are there and in concerning numbers. Though I cannot prove the link between their presence and drop in fish density, it has occurred and been dramatic. I also do not know if this expansion is due to a growing population or declining fish stocks in their traditional waters, but the impacts are undeniable and need to be addressed. I can remember in the 60s, hearing this very topic being discussed by a group \"elderly\" residents in the Parry Sound area and they said the commercial fishermen used to control the population by destroying the eggs on nesting islands as well as the many birds getting entangled in the nets. They claimed the population started to grow unchecked when the commercial fishing stoped in the area. This is no different than the deer culls in Provincial parks or bird culls around beaches or airports. To maintain the ecosystem, this species must be kept in check. Whether the government does it directly via egg control or downloading to the hunting public makes no difference to me, as long as it is fixed.\n",

Secondly, the culls have historically been carried out when the birds are nesting.  One parent always stays on the eggs and this is when the MNR shoot them as they know that the parent will not abandon their chicks. The mates return to the nest with food and find their partner wounded or dead. I participated in protests to stop this barbaric act and treated many injured and drowning birds.

We know cormorants eat copious amounts of small fish, many of which are the sports fish bass, perch and walleye. They also target the bait fish that are the main food source for Salmon and Trout, both of which have experienced reduced populations and size (not all due to the cormorants). The game fish in the small inlets, bays, streams and inland lakes have significantly diminished in the last 10 years or so. These have been the fishing grounds of the cormorants. Lots of cormorants equals no fish. Another issue with cormorants is the total degradation of the area where they nest. Every plant\/tree in the area is dead due to their fecal droppings. Thirdly they are a black ugly bird which serves no useful purpose and are not fit to eat.\nMany sports fishermen and cottagers have been requesting that the cormorants be classified as  a nuisance bird and an all out hunting season be established. The birds impact on fish and trees is also a detriment to the tourist industry that caters to fishermen.\nThe generous hunting seasons and bag limits for these birds as proposed by the MNRF are welcome news and will go along way to eliminate the negative impact of these birds.\nI have utilized some fishing camps in the North Bay and Manitoulin areas and they have expressed the same problems regarding cormorants.\nI firmly support what the MNRF is proposing to deal with these birds.\n                              Thank you,    a concerned outdoorsman.\n",

I do not support this and am urging the government to reconsider.\nThe support for this motion is likely from those who partake in sport or commercial fishing and are blaming these birds for an assumed\/real decrease in fish populations.  Are these birds the reason why the codfish stocks in the Atlantic and the salmon stocks in the Pacific are close to extinction?  No!  It is certainly due to over fishing of the cod by both domestic and international fishers.  The cod populations will NEVER come back to what they were.  The possibility of extinction is real.  The change in the flow patterns of the rivers in BC due to the hands of man, lice and disease from fish farms, and the continued sport\/commercial fishing onslaught are the reasons for the decrease in salmon populations.  David Suzuki once said that elders told him that the sound of the salmon returning to spawn sounded like a freight train and could be heard from miles away.  To blame a species of bird for what has been clearly caused by the incompetence of man is not acceptable.  Please be responsible, think of the future, and do the right thing.\n",

        "comment":"Double-crested Cormorant Hunting Season\nERO # 013-4124\nI am writing to express my strong concerns about this proposal.\nFirst of all I wish to make it very clear that I am not opposed to hunting practised in a sustainable manner. I grew up in a hunting culture and continued to purchase an Outdoors Card and hunt for many years. I have family and friends who continue to participate in this pursuit and with whom I speak with interest about their hunts.\nThere are a number of things that are concerning about this proposal.\nHunters could allow cormorants to spoil! This is an unethical and unprecedented hunting practice.\nA bag limit of 50 cormorants per day with no possession limit combined with the provision to allow cormorants to spoil, is not a value associated with traditional hunting. Allowing such a practice will make all ethical hunters appear to be inhumane and create a much more negative feeling towards hunting in the eyes of the growing numbers of non-hunters. The long-standing practice of hunting for food while showing respect for the life of other beings is totally absent in this proposal.\nThis proposal promotes a shooting\/killing mentality. It does not promote respect for the life of other animals nor respect for the safety of others who may be nearby. It is irresponsible for the government to promote such a  public slaughter that once begun may be difficult to stop.\nBecause the carcasses have little or no value to the shooter, and because they may be allowed to spoil, shooters will feel very little obligation to retrieve their dead or dying victims. Therefore a bag limit means nothing. Large numbers of carcasses will be left to rot or wash up on beeches, used by others, possibly creating health hazards and ethical issues.\nSince cormorants are colonial nesters and since they nest along with a number of other colonial nesters and island-nesters and since the proposed hunting season includes the nesting season, numerous non-targeted species will be affected. Some will be shot accidentally, some shot intentionally and some will have their nesting season interrupted and their young perish. I realize the proposal has this concern covered because shooters will be \u201creminded to avoid conflicts with migratory game birds and other waterbirds\u201d. What wishful thinking this is! Once this killing-field style of massacre is allowed it will attract the attention of those who know nothing of the other species which live in close proximity with the target species.\nIf Double-crested Cormorants require a management strategy, this one has far too many flaws and raises too many concerns. Bag limits, length and timing of season, allowing carcasses to spoil, shooting from stationary motor boats are all concerns. Adding to these concerns it that this will appeal only to those shooters who want to fire at anything that moves. This attitude brings with it many safety concerns.\nI request that this proposal be withdrawn so research on effective and safe procedures for culling this species can be conducted. If and when a cull is needed a much more respectful plan must be implemented.\n",

The potential for severe environmental damage is great.\n      You propose a 9-month open season on cormorants that encompasses the nesting season. Other colonial- and island-nesting bird species breeding near cormorants will be adversely affected by endless shots ringing out whenever the hunters feel like hunting.  What are the chances that hunters -- despite being warned to \"avoid conflicts with other gamebirds and migratory birds\" -- will accidentally hit non-targeted species panicked by the gun shots?  Darn good, I would say.\n     Permitting hunters to \"allow cormorant to spoil\" is highly irresponsible, threatening human and  environmental health.  Such a grossly unethical hunting practice should not be allowed under any circumstances.\n     Shooting from a stationary motorboat on a dead flat calm day should ensure that the hunter hits his target but what about those days when the water is choppy?  Many unintended and undesirable consequences could result. (See above.)\n     With a bag limit of 50 cormorants a day and innumerable hunters hunting, have you considered the possibility that the \"slightly declining\" cormorant population may go into steep decline or be wiped out in Ontario?\n     The double-crested cormorant eats large numbers of invasive round gobies and other non-commercial species, benefitting, not damaging the fisheries industry.\n     Mass killing of any one species damages and disrupts natural processes, which should be allowed to run their course without drastic intervention.  Without human meddling, nature will re-balance itself.  If we kill most of the cormorants, will the round gobie population explode?\n     I oppose the plan to hunt cormorants but, if it must go through, I urge you to amend the proposal to protect other species, the environment and human health. Responsible hunters must always properly identify and target the species they mean to kill, shoot only when there is no danger to humans or other non-targeted wildlife, hunt outside of breeding seasons, shoot only from land where footing is stable and be responsible for disposing of the remains.  Responsibly managing the hunt is the only way your government can justify permitting the hunting of double-crested cormorants.\n",

And allowing during the busiest boating and water recreational times of the year. At what point did that strike someone as a good idea?\nFurthermore, it is basically unlimited shooting just for the sake of of killing something. Yes you can shoot 50 but since they don\u2019t need to keep those carcasses you don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve killed 50 or 550. No-one will eat cormorant. At least not more than once. Using small game licence to slaughter a practically unlimited amount of cormorants and leaving them to rot does great disservice to those of us who take pride in our careful regulation of small game and using as much of the animal as we can.\nIt is our lousy fishing practices and alteration of habitat that is causing fish populations to drop. A good deal of that problem can be laid at the feet of the MNRF and their short-sighted decisions of the past.  But let's scapegoat the cormorants though.\nOf all the management solutions possible to controlling cormorant numbers why would you chose this one? You might want to take a closer look at the conflicts of interest that may be influencing your decision makers to chose this route. It sounds like an excuse to placate a minority group of people who want an excuse just to kill something without having the inconvenience of consequences, limited time to kill, enforceable bag limits, and cleaning and prep of their kill.\nGet rid of the advisors on this policy. Start over. Come up with a control solution that doesn\u2019t involve giving people who like to kill for the sake of killing an excuse to fire off a gun 9 months of the year consequence-free. If you don\u2019t then believe me the lawyers are going to be all over your tushes when someone gets shot by this policy.\nWhy not a limited spring hunt? Why not oil the eggs? Why a near round slaughter with birds going to rot instead? How many carcasses are going to wash up onto beaches? What will the smell be like? Why not have a professional trained people ( ie not yahoos drinking in their boats who start taking pot shots at cormorants as they fly by) go to some of the nesting sites and target them there? Yes, it will also be a slaughter but it\u2019ll be controlled and only for a short period of time. And they won\u2019t be drunk fishermen wielding firearms where missed shots travel a long way.\nSo, smarten up, folks. I know you have intelligent people working for you. I worked there myself at one point. Use their brains. Listen to the experts, like Chip W. Really, I\u2019m rather stunned you even came up with this policy in the first place. On the other hand it certainly fits well into the buck-a beer alt-fact instant gratification mentality of the current provincial govt, so I shouldn\u2019t be that surprised.\nSo stop making\n",

This proposal aims for an open public hunt with a high bag limit for a native predatory species that has only recently recovered in population numbers. The impetus behind this proposal is from a small group of land owners and the hunting and fishing communities and not from those intimately acquainted with the delicate intricacies of freshwater and population ecology.\nThis proposed hunt would occur during the breeding period of many bird species who share similar habitat with the cormorants such as turns and colonial nesting egrets and herons. This would add unnecessary stressors to populations of species that are already sensitive and vulnerable to declining numbers.\nThe impending uncertainties associated with climate change make future predictions about population management difficult if not impossible. Allowing a hunt to occur in the magnitude of this proposal could reduce populations to be vulnerable in the face of climatic changes. This proposal would allow a single hunter to eliminate 14,000 individual cormorants in a season and annihilate entire colonies in a day.\nThis proposed hunt unjustifiably condones the vilification and disrespect of a native species by the government agency that claims to protect Ontario\u2019s biodiversity. Alowing this proposed slaughter, with its outrageously high bag limit and open season, propagates indifference for the natural environment. This disregard is magnified by the fact that the proposal allows hunters to shoot and leave carcasses to rot. The current culling practices on cormorants have shown that many birds that are shot at are only severely injured and the practice has proven to be inhumane.\n",

I also feel that if cormorants are not disposed of properly there may be issues arise with cormorants washing up on beaches and private cottagers\u2019 properties. The smell of rotting flesh in the hot summer months may also create issues with beach use, dogs getting into cormorant carcasses and disease transfer when carcasses are left to rot.\nOpening the season on cormorants similar to that of other migratory waterfowl (hunting in fall) may limit some of these issues over the summer months. I feel that the cormorant monitoring program will help assess the effects hunting will have on the species and allow the ministry to closely monitor and regulate some of these problems where they see fit.\nI think with strict regulations around open seasons on cormorants and the enforcement of proper disposal procedures on the species will allow for the success of this proposal\n",

What people don\u2019t realize it\u2019s hunters including myself rarely shoot a limit of ducks in a day which is 6 per day. So no, a single hunter will not kill 14000 in a year that is just absurd to even think that. Hunting is not as easy as the public tends to think. Waterfowl and these birds see a lot more that what humans can (they can see ultraviolet). So I agree with a hunt but i think the government should be consulting, Ducks Unlimited, Delta waterfowl and OFAH on this matter as well as the mnr. The population has gone crazy. I\u2019ve hunted on lake simcoe and seen thousands in just a couple hours and you can watch the in their hundreds diving wiping out populations of bait fish. For some the comments where people have said if man is involved we end up destroying their habit, is just false. As of January 2017 Ducks unlimited alone has conserved 13,902,792 acres in North America, 6,439,113 acres of that in Canada and have influenced a total of 157,660,148 acres in total across North America and in 1901 there were few ducks mainly due to habit loss not hunting and now today there are over 46,000,000. I get why you are asking the public but I have seen a lot of uneducated comments on this from people who have probably never hunted, never bought a tag, put time and work into conservation, been out in the field watching these birds year round or been impacted by these birds.

        "comment":"I support the change to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to address Cormorants.\nI\u2019m a cottage owner on Red Pine Lake, just west of the Haliburton Forest & Wildlife Reserve.  We, that is a significant number of cottagers on the lake, are alarmed by the sudden appearance of Cormorants and the rapidly increasing population.  The experience covers over 30 years on my part and over 50 years for many others and we only note the appearance of Cormorants in the last few years.  As I recall, before 2015 there were no Cormorants, in 2016 there was a couple Cormorants, in 2017 five or six and this past summer (2018) we counted no fewer than 13 Cormorants in one sitting and I believe our lake is infested with as many as 20.  While I recognize this isn\u2019t a scientific analysis the simple trend on my observed population on our Lake is alarming.\nWe also note the Cormorants are bullying the sea gulls from a shoal of rocks in front of our cottage.  As each summer day warms, the Cormorants numbers increase and gulls move on.  Cormorants appear to easily out compete gulls and this is a change of the observed pattern for decades.\nWe also are aware of a roosting place for the Cormorants on the south east shore of the lake and note a number of trees are already showing signs of deterioration unique enough to the area that I\u2019m concluding these trees are suffering from the effects of Cormorants.  Visions of our own Tommy Thompson Park cannot be normal.\nI\u2019m sure many will argue the 50 birds per day limit is excessive but in my opinion the interest in this hunt will be governed by the number of cormorants infesting a particular area and as the numbers are reduced, so will the interest in the hunt.  The planned population monitoring will address this and we won\u2019t have a passenger pigeon scenario.\nI\u2019d like to include in my response a reaction to an article I found on the Ontario Nature website wherein a contributor argues about three myths of cormorants in Ontario.  First damage to fishing industry;  I submit on our lake, where I\u2019ve noted above the very recent appearance of and rapid growth of the population of Cormorant, there is no scientific evidence that Cormorants are not having an effect on game fishing species or food chain for game species.  The simple math is, where no Cormorants existed in 50 some years and then appear and grow in numbers rapidly and stay from spring to late fall, they are eating something in increasing quantity that is no longer available to the lake\u2019s game fish food chain.  Second, arguing existing laws to protect one\u2019s own property are sufficient is ridiculous.  By extension of this notion, if Cormorant populations grew to the point where they ate every single fish in Red Pine Lake and killed hectares of forest around the lake like Tommy Thompson Park in Toronto, as long as they kept their bodies off private property they would be free to wreck the lake.  And Third, Cormorant populations may have plateaued from their recovery from DDT pollution which I\u2019ll agree is a good thing but clearly they are expanding into other areas of the Province, rapidly with impact and therefore bear some attention including, as the proposed regulation change notes, population monitoring and regulation adjustment.  I\u2019m confident this approach will work.\nIn conclusion, I support the proposed regulatory change and hope implementation for 2019 is achieved.\nShould additional information or follow-up be required I can be reached at rick.rhem@gmail.com.\nThank you\nRick\n",

        "comment":"I am opposed to this proposal and provide rationale for my position below.\nThis proposal originates from the OMNRF and as such the justifications provided for a cormorant hunt should be science-based. The generic statements on double-crested cormorants without data to back such statements are a problem. The OMNRF should have a full and detailed rationale to provide justification for this proposal, as well as population modelling exercises, population level targets to support the extreme daily bag numbers being proposed, exactly how the cormorant population will be monitored to determine effects of a hunt and an evaluation of the negative impacts on non-target species.\n1. Detrimental to fish populations. The science behind determining whether a cormorant population has a negative effect on a particular fish population is complex (Wires et al. 2003). There are factors that could negatively impact the abundance of a particular fish population: human predation, predatory fish (multiple species), predation by other waterbirds (e.g., red-breasted merganser; Bur et al. 2008), competition from other prey which would include multiple species, abiotic considerations (e.g., water temperature) etc. Thus, rigorous scientific studies are required for each fish population consumed by cormorants (Wires et al. 2003; see also Dorr et al. 2014 for a summary of cormorant fish predation).\nAs one of the presumed intentions of this proposal is to increase fish abundance by reducing cormorant predation, additional factors which influence fish populations should be considered (see Wires et al. 2003). For example, predicted changes in the distribution and abundance of walleye due to climate change (see Van Zuiden et al. 2016); and how changes in lake ice will modify aquatic food webs (Ontario Biodiversity Council 2015) should be considered.\n2. Island habitats. Cormorants nest in high densities (Dorr et al. 2014). Where\nthey nest in trees they will cause the mortality of trees in 10-15 years (e.g., Lemmon et al. 1994; Herbert et al. 2014) which is a natural ecological process. Cormorants do not occupy all available island habitat; they have only occupied 3% of the U.S. Great Lakes islands over a 30-year period (Wires and Cuthbert 2010).\nIf particular islands or forest patches that host at-risk species are being significantly modified by cormorants, local, small scale management such as deterrence and culling (e.g., Middle Island, Point Peele National Park) may be appropriate1. Non-lethal management, deterrence and knocking down\n1 Though in the case of Middle Island, I would argue a cull is not warranted as the Carolinian species are at-risk because they are at the northern edge of their range (see Brown et al. 1998 for concepts on species range and abundance).\nnests, should be used first to disperse them (McDonald et al. 2018). For roosting cormorants, a tethered raptor has successfully displaced birds (Quinn et al. 2012).\nAesthetics are presumably an additional factor for this section. People dislike the change of a forested island to a non-forested island. Yet, ecological processes involve change. Cormorants are a native species to Ontario and this is what they do. On a far larger scale, humans are significantly modifying the landscape in Ontario. For example, in Ontario forest cover the mixedwood plains ecoregion is declining (Ontario Biodiversity Council 2015); and agriculture is a primary a driver of species endangerment in this ecoregion (Kerr and Cihlar 2004).\n3. Other species. In general, competition within and among species is a part of evolution and proposing a provincial wide cull because one out-competes another is a disproportionate response and not necessary.\nCormorants nest with other species both in trees and on the ground. Tree- nesting cormorants can nest among great blue herons, black-crowned night- herons, and great egrets (see Rush et al. 2015 and references therein). Caspian terns and ring-billed and herring gulls can co-occur with ground- nesting cormorants. This means there are a considerable number of species which could be disturbed from humans on or near colonies; and hunting activities will be detrimental to all birds nesting nearby (Carney and Sydeman 1999). Disturbance to non-target birds would presumably violate the Migratory Bird Convention Act.\nI will include comments on the positive impact cormorants have for bald eagles. Bald eagles were de-listed from the Endangered Species listing in the U.S. and their population is increasing in Ontario, though they are still listed a species of special concern in Canada (Armstrong 2014; Environment and Climate Change Canada 2017). Bald eagles on the Atlantic coast are negatively impacting seabird colonies by preying on adults and chicks (Hipfner et al. 2012) and farmers\u2019 chickens (Williams 2017). In Minnesota cormorant remains were found in 40% of bald eagle nests (Windels et al. 2016). Ecologists predict a top-down effect of bald eagles on waterbird  populations (Hipfner et al. 2012); bald eagles can take adult cormorants as well as juveniles and disrupt nesting colonies which can result in a site abandonment (Cairns et al. 1998; Armstrong 2014; Windels et al. 2016,). Based on other locations, it is likely that cormorants will provide a significant source of prey for bald eagles in Ontario in the near future and may assist in achieving the population recovery goal for the eagles identified by the OMNRF (Armstrong 2014). Bald eagle predation should be incorporated into a model on what may suppress the cormorant population in Ontario. In addition, the potential economic impact to free-range chicken farmers in reducing an abundant prey (cormorants) for bald eagles should also be under consideration.\n\"To respond to these concerns, the Ministry is proposing to create a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario. This new population management tool would allow persons who hold a small game licence to hunt these birds.\nList the double-crested cormorant as a \u201cGame Bird\u201d. Hunters would be required to have an outdoors card and small game licence to hunt double-crested cormorants, similar to other species of game birds.\nCreate an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to December 31 each year across the province. Create an exemption allowing small game licences to be valid for double-crested cormorant hunting in central and northern Ontario from June 16 to August 31 each year..... Monitoring of cormorants will allow the Ministry to assess the impacts of the hunting season and to adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns about population sustainability. \"\nUnlike ducks and mergansers, cormorants have altricial young where both members of a pair are required for nest success. The killing of either a male or a female during the breeding season will result in their chicks starving to death even if the other parent is present. How will the sustainability of this cull be assessed in this regard? Monitoring of the cormorant population will be done presumably via nest counts, but this approach does not assess reproductive success. Where strong rationale and evidence is provided, a controlled, local cull by OMNRF would avoid this situation. At Point Peele National Park, adult cormorants are shot at the nest site early in the nesting\nseason when no chicks are present, thus permitting a reduction in nest density but avoiding unnecessary suffering and mortality of young (e.g., Dobbie and Kehoe 2012).\n\"Allow hunting from a stationary motorboat. \"\nThere is no mention of restricting hunting on or near colonies. Hunting on or near colonies would almost certainly disturb ground-nesting colonies, as well as disturb non-target, co-nesting species. Cormorants will disperse to other locations; including new tree sites where available. A study using marked cormorants showed that the management actions of complete nesting failure resulted in the dispersal of adults to sites without management (Duerr et al. 2007). The dispersing adults established 10 new colonies, and in some cases, moved up to 100 km away (Duerr et al. 2007)2. Disturbance to nesting sites may also have the indirect effect of increased predation on nests, thus lowering productivity even further and causing more dispersal (Carney and Sydeman 1999; Duerr et al. 2007).\nThere is, presumably, also a significant risk to recreational boaters given that the proposed hunting season is throughout the summer months. When queried, the Toronto Marine Police did not know where the municipal boundary was on Lake Ontario with respect to hunting. They confirmed that at a minimum fire arm discharge would not be permitted within the harbor. Municipal boundary lines need delineation for all coastal cities and towns to ensure public safety.\n\"The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act currently prohibits anyone who kills game wildlife (including game birds), or who possesses game wildlife killed by hunting, from allowing that meat to spoil. Via this posting, the Ministry is also consulting on a proposal to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to add provisions so hunters could allow cormorant to spoil. This proposal would add provisions to the Act, so that persons who lawfully hunt (or possess) cormorants could be exempt from this requirement and would be subject to conditions that require the person to retrieve and dispose of the carcass. Should this proposal proceed, it may be accompanied by regulations to implement the exemption and requirements. \"\n2 While there was a significant banding effort for cormorants in the early 2000s in Ontario and some banded birds remain, there is no effort in re-sighting marked birds before and after the hunting would occur, to establish residency and change of residency.\nA controlled, focused management action by the OMNRF is preferred over a public hunt because appropriate steps would be taken to consult the public: it would be a targeted\nlocal action; data (i.e., date, location, the number of birds shot) would be collected; a target of the number of birds to be killed would be articulated; disposal would properly occur; and other data could be gathered from the killed birds (e.g., Coleman et al. 2012).\nA public hunt may disperse cormorants into new areas creating more conflicts \u2013 potentially moving ground-nesting birds to new tree or ground habitat and reduce prey for bald eagles.\nA blanket open season on double-crested cormorants is not warranted and its impacts would be difficult to monitor.\nThe change to the Fish and Wildlife Act to permit game wastage is unprecedented, a serious change to the Act and completely unethical.\n\"To accompany the proposed hunting seasons, the Ministry will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends. Monitoring of cormorants will allow the Ministry to assess the impacts of the hunting season and to adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns about population sustainability. \"\nCormorants are a species native to Ontario (Dorr et al. 2014, McIlwraith 1894). A significant amount of financial resources was invested in creating a healthier environment which allowed the recovery of this species; their abundance is a conservation success story (Weseloh and Collier 1995). Should this proposal be approved, specific targets should be articulated for the cormorant population in Ontario. To avoid the species becoming endangered again, these targets should be set prior to a hunt and their populations carefully monitored. Annual monitoring data should be released to the public on a timely basis for comment.\nThis proposed hunt places other aquatic waterbirds species at risk, particularly ones that nest with cormorants (herons, egrets and gulls and terns). Disturbance from hunting on non-target birds should not be underestimated; for example, it can displace birds from foraging areas and\ndisrupt breeding (Masden and Fox 1995; Cairns et al. 1998). Should this proposal proceed, how will the impact on other waterbird species be monitored?\nSince the proposal is for all of Ontario, enforcement and monitoring will be minimal and that alone should be the basis for a rejection of this proposal.\n---\nLiterature Cited\nAndrews, D., G.S.

It doesn't appear to be based on sound science nor is any provision made for a ensuring that the cull overshoots and thereby puts the Cormorant population at risk of extinction.\n1) Has the science been done to determine what knock-on effects of a significantly-reduced Coromorant population will have on the ecosystem? Will invasive fish species that have been kept in check be able to proliferate  and cause serious and unanticipated damage to the ecosystem?\n2) Has the science been done to determine what the ecologically-safe cull numbers are? At 50 coromorants\/day, I've seen estimates that this translates to 14,250 birds per year. That seems awfully high.\n3) Even if a prudent target cull number is arrived at, I see no realistic provisions in the legislation for making sure that hunters don't exceed these numbers. Given the motivation for hunting these birds - to eliminate a 'nuisance' rather than for meat - it is not hard to imagine that exceeding allowed kills is a very strong possibility. Furthermore, because Cormorants congregate, it is easy to imagine some hunters wiping out breeding colonies.\nYou have a duty to share with Ontarians credible evidence that the above and other considerations have been carefully considered and dealt with using sound science. The potential repercussions of an uninformed and poorly thought-out legislation could have permanent and serious ecological impacts some of which might have very real economic impacts.\n",

Hunting policy should not be attempting to reduce predator populations in order to provide more hunting or fishing. The ecosystem is not well enough understood for us to be able to predict with confidence the ultimate outcome of reducing a predator population.  A desirable fish species might be wiped out because another species (that is not targeted by fishers) out competes the desired fish species when there is less pressure from cormorants.\nIf this policy change is made,  the funds must be made available to monitor the changes to the ecosystem and a commitment made that the policy will promptly respond to the scientific results of the study.\n",

They cormorants are widely known to be there, and many people wish they weren't.  If hunting of cormorants is permitted, per the proposal, from March until December, that will create a dangerous situation indeed.  In July, August, and September, people are boating (often silently, in a canoe or kayak), swimming off the shore of the island, or even picnicking or simply exploring the island.   The idea that people might be shooting off guns during that time is horrifying.   I strongly urge you to exempt those months from the cormorant hunting season.  I would further suggest that said hunting season be limited to only two months,  March or April and November, when the fewest number of people are out on the lake.  Thank you.\n",

The mass killing of cormorants will not be beneficial. In fact, the process of killing them will force other bird species to vacate the colony sites they share.\n3. There is no way to kill cormorants humanely. Even controlled, organized culls in other regions have resulted in large numbers of injured and crippled birds being left to die of their wounds or starve to death, including nestlings.\n4. Cormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial, non-forage species.\n5. The mass killing of cormorants will damage the environment and disrupt natural ecosystem processes.\n6. The return of cormorants, a native wildlife species, to the Great Lakes Basin is part of a natural process.\n7. Cormorants are not overabundant in the Great Lakes. In fact, their numbers are modest, now stabilized and are dropping in many areas.\n8. Changes in the composition of vegetation in and around bird colonies are a sign of vibrant, dynamic natural ecosystem processes.\n9. The number of trees damaged or destroyed in colonial waterbird colonies across the province is miniscule and wouldn\u2019t even equal the number of trees in a single modestly-sized woodlot.\n10. Only a small number of islands (less than 3%) and peninsula sites are available for cormorants and other colonial waterbirds to nest on.\n11. The mass killing being proposed by the Ontario government is a political response to anecdotes, unsubstantiated claims and complaints by a small group of radical fishermen, supported by special interest groups. There is no substantive body of scientific evidence supporting their position.\n12. Instead of making cormorants a scapegoat for environmental problems they have nothing to do with, attention should be given to addressing the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, overfishing and a broad range of other issues.\n13. The proposed designation of cormorants as game animals, along with a non-utilization exemption that allows the carcasses to rot should be an affront to every hunter who believes in sportsmanship.\n",

They have been vilified and persecuted enough through the years that it is a wonder they are still around.  They do not deplete fish stock.  Humans do that with unsustainable practices and environmental degradation.   We need to co-exist with our natural world.  Will hunters only be allowed to use non-lead shot?  Dead birds in the water and washing up on shore (not all birds will be collected) to be scavenged by the rest of the food chain will surely cause an increase in lead poisoning which already is all too common. This proposed cull under the guise of regulated hunting is not a science based program.  It has been proposed to humour a few groups of individuals who cannot or will not co-exist with the natural world.  I also worry that loons will be mistaken for cormorants as many people have difficulty telling the two species apart.  Who will police all this activity?

        "comment":"These regulations give me cause for concern for many reasons.  I've tried to list them below, but not in order of significance.\n1.  Game bird - no possession limit and no requirement to dispose of properly.   This seems like a terrible idea.  The potential for dead birds floating on the lake and washing up on shores is repugnant.  It also means that there is no check on activities of so called \"hunters\" - it is just wanton shooting.\n2.  Double Crested cormorant resembles other birds such as the Common Loon.  This broad open season puts at risk other birds that may resemble cormorants.  Do we want loons being shot and left to float dead on the lakes and rivers?\n3.  The proposed regulation makes no mention of shooters staying away from nesting colonies and in fact, suggests that they can shoot from boats.   Cormorants nest with other kinds of birds so if individuals are allowed to shoot at birds sitting on nests how can you be sure that so-called \"desirable\" birds wont' be negatively affected?    Could the hunting time be restricted so it is not in nesting time?\n4.  Property owners - yes these birds can be messy.  Rather than an open season would it not make more sense to find a localized solution.   There are scientists that study cormorants who would be more than able to make suggestions.\n5.  These birds are native to Ontario and are a significant portion of the diet of Bald Eagles. Why put the Bald Eagles at risk with a wide ranging permission to kill birds for 9 months of the year instead of focusing on local problems.  One action always has an outcome - think before we act.\n6.  Detrimental to fish populations - what is the science behind this claim?  Is it not possible that other there are other causes of decline of fish populations?  Competition from other species, warming water due to climate change, encroachment of humans on every shoreline possible?  How would you measure the results of a cormorant hunt on fish populations.  Shouldn't any regulation contain monitoring of impact and a timeline for such.\nThere are other things that bother me but mostly this just seems to be a regulation allowing wide ranging shooting at things that look like cormorants through out the year, including nesting season  and no thought about disposal.    If there are local problems find a local solution instead of making a regulation that the potential to create other problems in its wake.\nConsult some scientists - not just some neighbours who don't like cormorants nesting in trees near by and not just fisherman who they themselves are impacting fish stocks.    This feels like a knee-jerk reaction instead of a well-thought through plan.    Do more study on the actual \"problem\" and find a thoughtful solution.\n",

        "comment":"Comments regarding EBR number 013-4124: Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario.\nWe are biologists with a broad range of experience in conservation, ecology and ornithology, and we have significant concerns about the proposed hunting season on cormorants in Ontario.\nThis proposal, if enacted, would cause harm to Great Lakes ecosystems and would not have the effects hoped for by commercial fishing and property owner groups. We feel strongly that the changes proposed would have unpredictable repercussions to fisheries and lake ecology, cause avoidable suffering to nesting birds and nestlings of many species, set several bad precedents that may open the door to poorly planned, reactionary wildlife management practices in the future, and reflect badly on hunters and the Province of Ontario.\nWhile cormorant numbers are at a historically high level in the Great Lakes, the main reasons for this increase are human-caused changes in the lake ecosystem, such as (i) the addition of nutrients to the water, making the lakes more biologically productive thereby making a cold-water fishery into a warm-water fishery, (ii) the introduction of several invasive, non-native fish species, and (iii) climate warming. Energy and nutrients now flow through the lake food web, supporting higher biomass of both prey species and top predators like cormorants. There are now more shallow, warm-water fish species like yellow perch, sunfish, bass and pike in Lake Ontario, and exploding numbers of introduced species like round goby, white perch and alewife. Cormorant populations have responded to this increased food availability and have not just suddenly become detrimental to the populations of native fishes.\nCormorants play an important role as top predator in lake ecosystems. As a result, they provide ecosystem services by limiting prey populations and helping balance the food web as it reacts to changing conditions and human-caused perturbances. Because of this, cormorants make the lake ecosystem more stable and robust. Cormorants also help to keep the populations of invasive fish species in check. A 2016 study on Lake Michigan (https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0380133015002750), for example, found that \u201cInvasive species, most notably alewife, round goby, and white perch, contributed over 80% and 90% of the diet of cormorants by biomass and number, respectively.\u201d That study concluded that its \u201cresults do not support the active management of the cormorants \u2026 to protect or recover local fisheries.\u201d\nThe significant reductions in cormorant populations that the proposed hunting season would cause would clearly result in an increase in populations of invasive species, which would in turn have detrimental effects on fisheries and biodiversity in the Great Lakes. Such changes will reduce the capacity of the lake ecosystem to buffer the effects of future invasive species introductions. Cormorant populations are ecologically important and should not be hunted in order to reduce their numbers.\nThe proposed changes that would allow for a high bag limit, the spoilage of meat, hunting from a stationary motorboat, and hunting during the bird breeding season are problematic on many fronts. These factors will enable hunters to approach island breeding colonies closely with the potential to kill hundreds of cormorants at a time from just one boat. This would cause panic, trampling, and abandonment of nests containing young birds. Such disturbance at cormorant colonies would make it impossible to keep track of bag limits. After the shooting, hunters would then have to go ashore, collect and properly dispose of carcases, causing even greater disturbance to breeding birds.\nMost cormorant breeding colonies contain other non-target bird species, including protected and declining species such as the common tern, which would also lose nests in the chaos. Nestlings of all species would die of exposure and starvation. This suffering would be seen publicly and internationally as extreme cruelty and probably violates laws protecting animals. Additionally, many colonies are on protected islands such as the Limestone Islands in Georgian Bay (Killbear Provincial Park), nature reserves such as Snake and Salmon Islands in Lake Ontario, and on privately owned islands. It would be very difficult and expensive to regulate and enforce any hunt that would spill over to such lands. Summer hunting also has great potential to cause disturbance to cottagers, local residences and safety issues with recreational boating.\nMany people view sport hunting as a legitimate activity that provides food and gets people out into the natural environment. The proposed changes would almost certainly darken this image, undermining the practice and image of hunting as disciplined, government-regulated and conservation-minded. This proposal harkens back to the disgraceful days of unregulated market and plume hunting and evokes the human-caused extinctions of the Great Auk, Passenger Pigeon and Carolina Parakeet.\nFinally, these unprecedented changes would make it to too easy for similarly ill-conceived, reactionary management efforts to be levelled against other native species that are sometimes seen as competing with people for resources or considered unaesthetic. These changes would result in behaviour and levels of killing and cruelty that will be documented by the media and seen by the public as a massive wildlife cull. No sensible government ministry should proceed with this proposal, given these risks.\nDr. Fran Bonier\nDr Paul Martin\nDr. Robert Montgomerie\nDr. Vicki Friesen\nDr. Paul Grogan\nMr. Chris Grooms\nDr. Steven Lougheed\nDr. Laurene Ratcliffe\nDr. John Smol\nDepartment of Biology\nQueen's University\nKingston ON K7L 3N6\n",

This is a cull.\nLooking up the information on other waterfowl including Canada geese, cackling geese, ducks, rails, gallinules, coots, snow geese, Ross geese) hunting seasons generally range from September 1st through January 5th.\nhttps:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/environment-climate-change\/services\/migratory-\u2026\nThese are set AFTER the breeding. With this reasonablr timing, nests are not left empty and chicks are not left to die. The season being proposed for the cormorants is March 15th through December 31st. This is almost six months longer than the other waterfowl and runs straight through the breeding season.\nEven the 2019 overabundance species note for the snow geese and Ross geese is not as long as what is being proposed for the cormorants. This lists March 1st through May 31st. Which also works to exclude June through August, a prime time for breeding season.\nThis difference is not acceptable. This timeframe outlines a cull and not a hunting season. The season should be adjusted to be comparable to the other waterfowl.\nThe daily limit on the cormorants is excessively high compared to the other waterfowl:\n- 5 x Canada and cackling geese\n- 6 x ducks\n- 20 snow geese and Ross geese\n- 5 other geese\n- 10 rails, coots, gallinules\n- 50 double crested cormorant\nThat's 2.5 times more then the highest, which is snow geese and Ross geese.\nThis differential is unacceptable, again outlining a cull. The limits should be adjusted to be in line with the limits on the other waterfowl.\nThe notation outlines that provisions are being pursued to allow the hunters to allow the meat to spoil. With the volumes outlined and the season time frame outlined, this again outlines a cull and not a hunting season. If the scientific consensus is that a cull is needed than a single monitored cull should be implemented. Legislation should be put into effect separate from the cull creating a hunting season and limits comparable to that of other waterfowl.\nAdditionally, this type of reminder in this type of public notice outlines that there is already insufficient monitoring and insufficient self-regulation -\nThis is a very worrisome notation: \"\u00a0Hunters will continue to be reminded to properly identify their targets to avoid conflicts with migratory game birds and other waterbirds.\"  Is there a fear that they will be shooting any darkbird out on the water? Is the additional licensing fee that is being charged sufficient to allow for sufficient monitoring of hunters who require this type of notation?\nLastly, I am disgusted that \"aesthetics\" has been listed as part of the reasoning  and information provided. Perhaps the individuals who are offended by the appearance of cormorants and their natural functions should move into the city and avoid looking at anything near a park, farm, municipal waste dump, or municipal sanitation plant.\nThank you for the opportunity to provide comments in such an easy forum.\n",

        "comment":"14 FACTS ABOUT THE ONTARIO CORMORANT ISSUE\n1. The Ontario government\u2019s proposal will allow individuals with a small game license to kill up to 50 cormorants per day. That works out to approximately 1,500 cormorants per month or up to 14,250 cormorants for the entire proposed annual hunting season.\n2. The presence of cormorants benefits other colonial water birds, such as herons, egrets and pelicans, all of which are stable or growing where cormorants are found.\n3. The mass killing of cormorants will not be beneficial. In fact, the process of killing them will force other bird species to vacate the colony sites they share.\n4. There is no way to kill cormorants humanely. Even controlled, organized culls in other regions have resulted in large numbers of injured and crippled birds being left to die of their wounds or starve to death, including nestlings.\n5. Cormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial, non-forage species.\n6. The mass killing of cormorants will damage the environment and disrupt natural ecosystem processes.\n7. The return of cormorants, a native wildlife species, to the Great Lakes Basin is part of a natural process.\n8. Cormorants are not overabundant in the Great Lakes. In fact, their numbers are modest, now stabilized and are dropping in many areas.\n9. Changes in the composition of vegetation in and around bird colonies are a sign of vibrant, dynamic natural ecosystem processes.\n10. The number of trees damaged or destroyed in colonial waterbird colonies across the province is miniscule and wouldn\u2019t even equal the number of trees in a single modestly-sized woodlot.\n11. Only a small number of islands (less than 3%) and peninsula sites are available for cormorants and other colonial waterbirds to nest on.\n12. The mass killing being proposed by the Ontario government is a political response to anecdotes, unsubstantiated claims and complaints by a small group of radical fishermen, supported by special interest groups. There is no substantive body of scientific evidence supporting their position.\n13. Instead of making cormorants a scapegoat for environmental problems they have nothing to do with, attention should be given to addressing the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, overfishing and a broad range of other issues.\n14. The proposed designation of cormorants as game animals, along with a non-utilization exemption that allows the carcasses to rot should be an affront to every hunter who believes in sportsmanship, fair chase and ethics.\nPlease do not allow the hunting of cormorants as this will have a negative effect on the species possibly leading to their extinction. We cannot afford to lose more diversity in Ontario's Wildlife.\n",

        "comment":"This is a proposal for a cormorant cull not a hunting season. Allowing hunters to kill up to 50 cormorants a day with no limit, which makes it effectively unenforceable, and no requirement to use the meat is not hunting. Instead it's legal permission for those who hate cormorants, with the appropriate licences, to kill off entire colonies.\nThis proposal should be called what it is, a cormorant cull instead of what it isn't, hunting. Serious, responsible hunters would never take more than they could eat or so many that it endangers local animal populations. While some hunters might take advantage of the chance to hunt cormorants this proposal is very clearly aimed at those who want to destroy entire cormorant colonies. There is no other justification for the terms this proposal other than colony elimination.\nWhile cormorant colonies aren't pretty and not pleasant to visit they are a natural part of our ecosystem and deserving of their place in it. Not every part of our natural environment needs to exist just for the enjoyment of humans. Cormorants have only recently somewhat recovered their historical numbers. That's an environmental success story, not something that needs to be undone.\nKnowing that cormorants have recovered their population levels I supported allowing a hunting season for them when I first heard of it. However the details of this proposal completely changed my mind. If this proposal goes ahead it will bring the sport of hunting into disrepute, it already faces enough PR problems from trophy \"hunters\".\n",

According to the information posted on the EBR, this hunt has been proposed as being in response to \"concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics\". These 'concerns' are not backed up with scientific evidence. There is ample science-based evidence that these concerns are partially or substantially unjustified.\n2. The hunt would be allowed \"from a stationary motorboat\". Even a non-motorized boat is not entirely stable in the water and this could lead to inhumane injuries rather than clean kills, and 'accidental' hits on nearby non-target species. This also raises many concerns regarding human safety.\n3. Hunters \"could allow cormorant to spoil\". This would be an unprecedented, careless and inconsiderate threat to human and environmental health. It is an unethical and irresponsible hunting practice. Cormorant carcasses washing up on shorelines could create an environmental and human health disaster.\n4. Establish a bag limit of 50 cormorants\/day with no possession limit. This combined with the provision to allow cormorant to spoil could cause water pollution, health, aesthetic and ethical issues.\n5. Hunters will be \"reminded to avoid conflicts with migratory game birds and other waterbirds\". How would this be possible with the majority of cormorants nesting amongst other colonial-nesting and island-nesting species, some of which are species of concern. Any disturbance anywhere in the vicinity of other species during nesting season would constitute a 'conflict' capable of disrupting if not destroying their breeding cycles. Since the dates of the proposed hunt are from March 15 to December 31, nesting season is not being avoided. Eggs and chicks of colonial-nesting and island-nesting species could be abandoned leading to starvation.\n6. The posting indicates that cormorant populations are currently stabilized or on the decline. Natural processes such as this should be allowed to run their course, without such drastic intervention as is proposed.\n7. Mass killing of any one species damages and disrupts natural processes.\n8. The cormorant eats large numbers of invasive round gobies and other non-commercial species.\n9. The cormorant is being used as a scapegoat for environmental problems. No wildlife management plan should be proposed in the absence of consideration of all factors involved including climate change, pollution, control of invasive species, over-fishing, etc. These factors are not mentioned or addressed in this proposal.\n10. This is not hunting in the time-honoured, traditional sense - for food, for the love of being in the great outdoors, with high respect for human, animal and environmental safety, and based on fair play and good sportsmanship. It is a hunt that promotes a killing-field mentality. No respectable, ethical hunter would engage in this type of free-for-all. It is irresponsible of the government to promote this form of public slaughter under the auspices of \"wildlife management\".\nI am opposed to this hunt as laid out in the EBR.\n",

But those concerns are largely just anecdotes, complaints from a small, radical segment of the fishing community, and unsubstantiated claims that were debunked long ago. There is no substantive body of evidence proving that cormorants are depleting fish stocks or causing any ecological problems whatsoever.\nThe reality is that cormorants are a natural part of Ontario\u2019s rich biodiversity and an ecologically beneficial species, being major predators of invasive fish species, like round gobies and alewives, attracting other waterbirds to their nesting sites, and serving other important functions in the ecosystems they inhabit.\nA Recovered Species\nPersecution by humans and pesticide poisoning all but wiped out cormorants in Ontario on two previous occasions but, in recent years, they have returned and populated those habitats that will support them.\nFar from being overabundant, cormorant numbers are relatively modest, have stabilized and are dropping in some areas. The entire North American double-crested cormorant population is estimated to be less than the population of Toronto, with about 250,000 in the entire Great Lakes Basin and considerably less residing in Ontario.\nExtinction?\nBecause they are conspicuous birds that congregate in colonies on exposed islands and peninsulas (only about 3% of potential island sites in the Great Lakes are suitable), they are particularly vulnerable, being easily targeted and killed, especially when nesting. Small congregations could be wiped out in just a few minutes or an hour, while larger colonies could be destroyed in just a few days or a week.\nRadical cormorant-haters have already attacked colonies under cover of night, destroying nests, stomping on chicks and killing adults. Once the proposed changes to the law come into effect, these people will be given free rein to destroy as many cormorants as they want. It wouldn\u2019t take very many people very long to wipe out most cormorants in the province, leaving just a tiny remnant of their population in a few protected areas. And driving them back to near extinction or even worse in Ontario is a real possibility.\nThis is unacceptable and unscientific.\n",

Our group fully supports the Government proposal regarding the hunting of cormorants and their designation as a game bird.\nFor the past decade, we have observed the destruction of Muskrat Island (formerly Grape Island) which is clearly visible from our shoreline on Sturgeon Lake.  The rapid population explosion of the colony has put extreme stress on our fish population.  The birds have a voracious appetite and we understand that each cormorant consumes close to its weight in fish each day.  The cormorants form long ranks and drive the fish into shallow water where they dive on them.  Several of our neighbours have found numerous dead fish floating on their shoreline, as a result of their encounters with the birds.\nTrees and vegetation on the island have been destroyed by their toxic guano and the surrounding water has been degraded.  Recently a young neighbour swam near the island and was hospitalized for about two weeks due to contact with the toxin, proving this is a serious health issue.  We understand other methods of control such as oiling of eggs have been unsuccessful due to the aggressive nature of the birds.

Concerns about aesthetics are not an acceptable reason to legislate the decimation of an indigenous species.\nSimilarly, concerns of the commercial fishing industry about the impacts of an indigenous species on fish populations are specious at best. Aquatic birds eat fish; this is their nature, and to persecute them for this sets a dangerous precedent.\nI strongly object to this proposal. If there is legitimate scientific evidence that shows a need to control populations of double-breasted cormorants in Ontario, then the measures should be instituted far more responsibly than is proposed here.

        "comment":"Re: \tEBR Registry Number: 013-4124\n \tProposal to establish a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario\nTo the Public Input Coordinator,\nBird Studies Canada (BSC) is writing to express its deep concern regarding the proposal to establish a hunting season for the Double-crested Cormorant in Ontario through amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act and supporting regulations. As a science-based conservation organization, with decades of experience monitoring bird populations, we believe that the proposed changes pose significant harm to a native Ontario wildlife species, have the potential to negatively impact other wildlife species and habitats, and also lack scientific rationale or justification. Consequently, BSC voices its strong opposition to the proposal.\nBird Studies Canada is the country\u2019s leading non-governmental organization dedicated to the understanding, appreciation, and conservation of birds. The organization was founded in 1960 as the Long Point Bird Observatory, and by 1998 had expanded programs nationally and adopted the Bird Studies Canada name. A registered charity, BSC\u2019s mission is to conserve wild birds of Canada through sound science, on-the-ground actions, innovative partnerships, public engagement, and science-based advocacy. The organization is science-based with dozens of research, conservation, and outreach programs operating across Ontario and Canada. Many of BSC\u2019s programs are undertaken with the active participation of keen outdoors enthusiasts and field naturalists, currently numbering 49,000 volunteer \u201cCitizen Scientists.\u201d To advance its mission, BSC is proud to collaborate with dozens of conservation partners, representing non-governmental organizations, businesses, private landowners, and also many governmental agencies. This includes the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), which we are pleased to call a partner on many initiatives. We also have a long tradition of supporting waterfowl conservation, hunting, and research at Long Point and elsewhere within the Ontario Great Lakes Basin.\nBird Studies Canada recognizes the Double-crested Cormorant as a native Ontario species, and one which has been heralded as a conservation success story. BSC also recognizes that the biology of this species and its ecological interactions are complex, making some management decisions challenging. As a colonial-nesting waterbird, the species can have an impact on the flora and fauna in the immediate area of colonies. This impact is sometimes described as large on the small scale, but small on the large scale.\nThe species suffered from environmental contaminants (notably, persistent organochlorine contaminants) in the Great Lakes region, and its population has recovered rapidly in recent decades from a reduction in these pollutants. Among a number of other factors, the rapid increase may have been aided by nutrient overloading and introduction of non-native prey species in the Great Lakes. While the population has increased significantly in recent decades, MNRF indicates that the population is now stable or declining \u2013 a common pattern of growth and stabilization in natural populations \u2013 which suggests from the outset this proposal to actively reduce the species\u2019 population by hunting is unwarranted.\nBSC\u2019s objections to the proposal are multiple and varied, including: (1) lack of scientific credibility and justification; (2) inconsistencies with standard norms for hunting and Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act principles; (3) unknown impact on Double-crested Cormorant populations, native biodiversity and ecosystems; and, (4) public safety and enforcement of proposed changes. The following is a summary of the major concerns noted by BSC regarding the proposal:\n(1)   Lack of scientific credibility and justification\n\u2022\tThe proposal fails to demonstrate a sound scientific basis for the need for the hunt, lacking any detailed information about the species\u2019 population size.\n\u2022\tThe proposal\u2019s policy rationale indicates that the species\u2019 population is stable or declining, decreasing MNRF\u2019s justification for the hunt.\n\u2022\tThe proposal fails to address the potential impact of the hunt on the population of Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario, or the potential impact on other wildlife species which could be affected.\n\u2022\tThe proposal fails to adopt an ecosystem-based approach to wildlife population assessments and management, a key consideration for a species with such complex interactions with aquatic and terrestrial species and habitats. Among other things, it fails to describe a population management objective (population target) provincially or regionally. Nor does it describe a timeframe over which the proposal would be in place. Although it proposes a program to monitor cormorant population and trends in Ontario, it would be some years before any such program could provide solid estimates, leaving the first few years essentially unmonitored.\n(2)   Inconsistencies with standard norms for hunting and Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act principles\n\u2022\tThe proposed hunt is inconsistent with every tenet of wildlife management and hunting ethic, including failure to protect wildlife during the breeding season and permission to allow game meats to spoil. This proposed divergence from norms highlights the fact that this is not sport hunting by any standard definition, but is rather a broad-scale and largely unregulated cull \u2013 reminiscent of unchecked \u201cmarket hunting,\u201d which modern bird hunting regulations were designed to correct.\n\u2022\tThe proposed exemption to the requirement to protect against meat spoilage, coupled with a failure to retrieve or even report carcasses, renders population monitoring and enforcement effectively impossible, which could rapidly lead to large-scale mortality with population level impacts.\n\u2022\tThe hunting of Double-crested Cormorants during the breeding season is again inconsistent with wildlife management and hunting principles and ethics; such hunting will inevitably lead to failure of nests and starvation of chicks, which are issues of concern relating to both population management and to inhumane treatment to wildlife.\n\u2022\tThe proposed open season from March 15 to December 31 each year represents the entire duration of the species\u2019 natural annual occurrence in Ontario \u2013 effectively resulting in no meaningful closed season in the province.\n(3)   Impact on Double-crested Cormorant populations, native biodiversity and ecosystems\n\u2022\tThe proposed bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no possession limit over a nine and a half month open season is exceptionally high, unsustainable, and without precedent under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for its failure to address the need for population sustainability. It is not unlikely that such a level of hunting would lead to local and\/or regional extirpations, as well as reduction provincially to token remnant populations. The likelihood that this proposal would have only a \u2018neutral\u2019 impact is baseless.\n\u2022\tThe proposal allows for shooting of Double-crested Cormorants on breeding colonies which could lead to mortality of other colonial waterbird species which often nest in close association, such as Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, and Black-crowned Night Herons.\n\u2022\tDisturbance by hunters will disrupt other wildlife nesting in and near Double-crested Cormorant colonies, including the above-noted heron family members, as well as other species such as Caspian Terns, Common Terns, and Great Black-backed Gulls.\n\u2022\tThe increased level of shooting over water could lead to an increase in toxic shot deposited in lakes and rivers since not all shooters may abide by the proposal\u2019s requirement for non-toxic shot.\n(4)   Public safety and enforcement of proposed changes\n\u2022\tThe proposal allows for unrestricted shooting in Ontario, both in terms of season and location, potentially permitting hunters to be in unsafe proximity to boaters, cottagers and other outdoor recreation enthusiasts. The lack of a closed season in spring and summer increases the public safety risk due to the overlaps of the open season with the peak of outdoor recreation.\n\u2022\tThe proposal to permit hunting from a motorboat increases risk for public safety, which is contrary to migratory bird hunting regulations.\n\u2022\tThe large scale of the proposed hunt, the permission to discard carcasses and let meat spoil, and the exceptionally long open season render the hunt (including the daily bag limit) unenforceable by conservation officers.\n\u2022\tThe proposal\u2019s broad scope and exceptionally high quotas would require intensive and greatly expanded enforcement, as well as greatly increased resources for population monitoring; such resources are not likely to be available at a time when public expenditures are being cut back.\n\u2022\tThe Ministry\u2019s intent not to provide additional opportunities for public comment, should the proposal proceed, is a concern for due process relating to Ontario legislation, regulations, and policies.\nFor the above-noted reasons, Bird Studies Canada expresses its strong opposition to the proposal. If the Ministry has any questions regarding this submission, we would be pleased to respond to them.\nRespectfully submitted,\n",

I am 100% opposed to the proposed policy that would allow hunting of cormorants for many reasons including the following:\n1. I do not believe that the rationale behind the proposal is science-based (e.g. the alleged detrimental effect of cormorants on fish populations is not well founded).\n2. A hunt on cormorants would very likely have detrimental impacts on other bird species.\n3. There are public safety issues emanating from hunting from stationery boats.\nI have read the submission from Dr. Gail Fraser and am in full agreement with her views. In addition, I believe the government should be making science-based decisions that take into account many perspectives, rather than responding to special interest groups such as fishermen and cottage owners whose views on cormorants may be emotionally based and not founded on a full understanding of the facts.\n",

Please tell me who are these \"some groups\"?\nMost Ontario residents, in fact most Canadians, support preserving wildlife.  Stating the population of Cormorants has stabilized or only decreased slightly should not be a licence to change their status to \"Game birds\" and start hunting them for sport.  The decrease in fish, forest habitats and other species has not scientifically been proven to be a result of cormorants.  Considering that 83% of fresh water fish have vanished worldwide in the last 40 years, the decline of other fish and species is likely a result of human behaviour. These poor creatures are being used as a scapegoat for destruction by humans who need a new species to hunt because of the declining populations of everything they do hunt!\nWe should cut back on hunting and fishing to save the wildlife in Ontario, not try to blame a population of birds that currently are surviving, and the turn around and decimate their population as well.

        "comment":"I am writing to express my extreme opposition to your proposal to designate the cormorant as a legitimate game bird for licensed hunters to slaughter at the insane rate of 50 birds per day for an entire season. This is not a hunt. This is not even a cull. It is a deliberate slaughter of a native species of bird that has its own place in the environment. Your stated reason? Because fish stocks are down.\nThe cormorant is a native species of bird who has had an established place in the environment for millions of years. The reason fish stocks are down is because of commercial and sport overfishing, rural and urban pollution and environmental degradation caused by dams, water diversion and dredging which is all caused by humans, not cormorants.\nUnder your proposal,  hunters will be allowed to leave the carcasses to rot where they were slaughtered which would be a both an eyesore and a potential health hazard.  You are also proposing to allow hunters to shoot the birds from boats in public waterways. Your hunting season spans the entirety of open water tourism when swimmers, pleasure boaters and sport fishers could potentially be in the line of fire. Yes, I know, the hunters are required to make sure there is no one in the line of fire when they shoot but every year innocent people are shot by hunters on land. What makes you think it will be any different on open water?\nThe cormorant has a passing resemblance to many diving birds, including Loons, Grebes, Diving Ducks and Mergansers. Undoubtedly mistakes in identification will be made and many of these species could be threatened - especially if the adult birds are killed during the fledgling season.\nFinally, I live on a lakeshore property  in northern Ontario and I do not want to wake up  to the sound of someone slaughtering cormorants with shotguns at the first light of dawn. This proposal is akin to  the introduction of Cane Toads to Australia in the 1930s to control a beetle problem, which was caused by the introduction of sugar cane. If our fish stocks are down don't blame the natural predator who has been there for eons.  Blame the humans who have comparatively just arrived.\n",

NO to game bird status, NO to culling.\nThose of us opposing Premier Doug Ford\u2019s proposal to change the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to allow hunters to let the meat of game spoil do so in part out of humanitarian and environmental concerns. We also are appalled by the lack of either prior public and scientific consultation and concern that, after a century of steady progression in wild game management, Ford has taken a huge step back over a century, well before the science of ecology came into being and the role of apex predators in healthy ecosystems was understood. He\u2019s still in the depths of 19th century mind-set (although even then visionaries knew better, just were ignored).\nThe claim that double-crested cormorants have done \u201c\u2026a massive amount of damage to fish populations everywhere it seems\u2026\u201d is unsubstantiated. In 2003, five Canadian and American ornithologists did a search of pertinent literature on the effects of cormorant predation on fish caught by commercial and sport angling, entitled \u2018Review of the Double-crested Cormorant Management Plan, 2003: Final Report of the AOU Conservation Committee\u2019s Panel,\u2019 published by the (then) American Ornithologists Union (now the American Ornithological Society). The writers were from Tufts University, Harvard, University of Massachusetts, Duke University and Simon Fraser University. They found that except in contrived conditions, such as impoundments, cormorants generally had little to no impact on either such fish, or the forage fish they consume.\n- Advertisement -\nAs the Department of Natural Resources for Minnesota says on their website, predation is primarily compensatory, which \u201c\u2026is common in all animal populations and this type of mortality [by cormorants] does not decrease fish populations.\u201d\nWe have, I realize, entered an era of anti-science, anti-fact-based policy decisions. It\u2019s easier to scapegoat predators for declines in what we see as \u201cour\u201d fish and game, then learn that the term \u201ccompensatory predation\u201d means the percentage of prey taken is below the number needed to allow replacement.\nWorld-wide, there are 39 species of cormorant, 11 threatened species, one now extinct. Not a single one has ever eliminated any species of fish of any kind, anywhere. We can\u2019t say the same of humans, but we are notoriously loathe to take responsibility for our own actions.\nEven though Conservation Biology published a paper in 2014 claiming an extinction rate, \u201c\u2026about 1,000 times more frequent now than in the 60 million years before people came along,\u201d it is easier to find a scapegoat than to take responsibility. Even though human population size is now pushing the eight billion mark, it\u2019s claimed there are \u201ctoo many\u201d cormorants, a species found from Alaska to Newfoundland and south into Mexico, but is less numerous than humans in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).\nOntario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) spokesperson Lauren Tonelli\u2019s concern about urban cormorants shows ignorance of what science-based management can achieve. The world\u2019s largest colony of the species is located in Canada\u2019s largest city, Toronto. When the birds started nesting in trees where they weren\u2019t wanted, they were dissuaded simply be having people walk under the trees before \u201cnest site tenacity\u201d could form. Other non-lethal methods have successfully maintained a vibrant mixed cormorant, heron and egret colony. Ralph Toninger, associate director, Resource Management Projects at Toronto and Region Conservation Authority tells me the most abundant fish at Toronto\u2019s Leslie Street Spit occur nearest that colony.\nSimilarly, the Hamilton Conservation Authority\u2019s Gord Costie says, \u201ccormorants are not a nuisance or in high numbers.\u201d Cormorants in Hamilton Harbor are indicators of large fish populations, including round gobies, an invasive species deleterious to native fish stocks and consumed in huge numbers by cormorants.\nOFAH might want to drop that \u201cH.\u201d Hunting as the hunters I know define it involves fair chase, utilization of the meat, not killing parents of dependent young who in this case will die horribly of dehydration, hypothermia or hunger and is managed sustainably to maintain the population. Premier Ford\u2019s policy caters to what both my hunting friends and I call \u201cslob hunters.\u201d\nPremier Ford has also introduced omnibus Bill 57 containing a proposal to banish oversight by the Environmental Commissioner, decrease public trust, government transparency and accountability, and is at odds with the already ineffective federal initiative to control climate change. Cormorant hunting is symptomatic of Draconian authoritarianism providing simplistic panaceas to his trusting base and those wary of facts and expertise, and not willing to own the effects of their own actions.\nWe used to suppress every forest fire until forest ecologists realized that burning could be part of the ecological process, forming habitat, renewing forests and preventing mega-fires. Similarly, the effects on habitat of everything from beaver to elephants has been decried, only to learn as ecological insights developed, that species diversity and biomass increased overall. The total number of trees lost to cormorants would constitute the kind of medium sized woodlot cleared any given day for \u201cdevelopment.\u201d We are no longer used to seeing large concentrations of bison, passenger pigeons, northern cod, Eskimo curlews, or other once abundant species. It has been demonstrated by American scientists Linda Wires and Francine Cuthbert in 2006 that cormorants also once were abundant when there were maximum numbers of fish and trees. We wiped them out before, nearly, and now we are about to do it again. That should not be allowed.\n",

This proposal will allow for the mass killing of cormorants, will put the species in danger of becoming extinct, damage instead of protect the environments that cormorants live in, and potentially put the lives of Ontarians at risk due to the allowance of hunting in areas often populated by people (cottaging, vacationing, living).  Some of these effects might be mitigated by lowering the bird limit for license holders from 50 per day to 1 per day (or less!).\nMy disagreement with this proposal is based on the following facts:\n1. The Ontario government\u2019s proposal will allow individuals with a small game license to kill up to 50 cormorants per day. That works out to approximately 1,500 cormorants per month or up to 14,250 cormorants for the entire proposed annual hunting season.\n2. The presence of cormorants benefits other colonial water birds, such as herons, egrets and pelicans, all of which are stable or growing where cormorants are found.\n3.

Instead of making cormorants a scapegoat for environmental problems they have nothing to do with, attention should be given to addressing the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, overfishing and a broad range of other issues.\n14. The proposed designation of cormorants as game animals, along with a non-utilization exemption that allows the carcasses to rot should be an affront to every hunter who believes in sportsmanship, fair chase and ethics.\n",

        "comment":"Hello,\nI strongly object to this proposed legislation.  It is not based on fact. Cormorants do not normally feed on the fish that anglers seek. Even if they did, the proposal essentially amounts to a mass destruction of a species that has struggled to regain in numbers. Allowing  hunters to bag 50 birds a day for 9.5 months of the year, and to let the carcass rot where it lay, leaving plastic and lead to seep into our waters is nonsensical.  Moreover,  Cormorants nest with other birds (gulls, and herons for example) so any shooting during mating season  risks these other birds lives and deeply disturbs there reproduction time.   The 2.5 months of the year when hunting is not allowed, there are no cormorants to be found as they have left for the winter. I do not want to be canoeing with my child or grandchild and find dead cormorants around, or worse yet, witness any hunting in what should be a peaceful time in nature.\nThis proposed legislation is ill-conceived.\n",

        "comment":"I would like to express my strong opposition to the proposal to establish a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario as posted in the Ontario Environmental Registry on November 19, 2018.\nThe stated reason for this proposal is that there are \u201cconcerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\u201d\nThere is no mention of any evidence to show that cormorants are, indeed, having significant detrimental effect on any commercial fish species. There is evidence available to show that cormorants feed on 2 invasive species, Round Goby and Alewives, that are generally known to interrupt the natural ecology of the Great Lakes and subsequently have a much broader, longer-term detrimental effect on a sustainable commercial fishery.\nThere is also no evidence offered that show cormorants are having a general impact on island forest habitats.  The few know examples are of limited geographic scope which should be dealt with on a case by case bases and the use of a general extended hunting season cannot be expected to resolve those specific problems.\nThe cormorant hunting season is proposed to extend from March 15 to Dec 31, which includes the breeding season and, coupled with the change that allows hunting from an open boat clearly promotes the hunting at breeding colonies.  Aside from the ethical problem of destroying parent birds with young left to starve in the nest, many of these colonies are of mixed species including gulls, terns and herons which, ironically would be impacted at their most vulnerable time by the very action purported to help protect them.  This would also most likely lead to contravention of the federal Migratory Bird Act.\nThe bag limit of 50 birds is meaningless since it is also proposed that an exemption be made to the prohibition of allowing game to spoil so that the hunters do not have to retrieve any birds that they have shot.  This clearly will allow and even promote, unlimited slaughter of cormorant colonies.  Ironically, the population of cormorants are finally stabilizing in the Great Lakes after a long recovery from pesticide contamination. This senseless slaughter may very well trigger a stimulus to their reproduction and ultimately spur their population on to even higher numbers and defeat the stated goal of this proposal to manage the cormorants population.\nI ask that you withdraw this ill-conceived approach to cormorant population management.\n",

        "comment":"Good day,\nI believe that making the cormorant a game fowl might be a good idea, as they do nest in large numbers and presents problems to farmers near the lakes as well as to other water fowl. However, I think there needs to be more balance in this proposal between non-lethal conservation and hunting.\nThere already exists a permit to private property owners\/farmers who require hunting of the birds because of nesting wrecking havoc on their land\/property. Perhaps, create more avenues for this type of regulation, like helping them use disruption techniques in nesting season to get them to nest elsewhere.\nAdditionally, I think the proposed limit of 50 per day is far too much, with a season that stretches much longer than other game water fowl. Perhaps a limit of 20 per day with a shorter season, ranging from August to December. Along with increased efforts to provide alternative methods of population\/nesting control using disruption techniqiues (like bangers, etc.) in areas where the birds over-nest.\nAdditionally, I think there needs to be increased awareness to how to eat the bird, as I have heard fowl hunters (my brother-in-law being the loudest) who say \"they don't make good eating\", when you can do a quick google search that tells you how to cook them.\n",

I believe what hunters should classify as game, is meat in which we consume, allowing spoilage goes against just that.\nThe three of these things together constitute in my mind, and a lot of others, something similar to a cull, but where hunters will bear the most of the social and economics costs.\nIf the season was reduced to the fall, as with the rest of out game, I believe the bag limit would be appropriate. If the bag limit was reduced to something more comparable to geese, I believe the season would be appropriate, and maybe even the spoilage laws.\nIf the birds are of such nuisance, and inedibility, then why not use wildlife management professionals such as the MNR, to organize a cull for the birds in target areas where overabundance is an issue?

Their numbers are not that large, but because they congregate in colonies, they are conspicuous. They have been accused of depleting fish stocks. This is not supported by science. They actually provide a benefit to Ontario by consuming invasive species, which we want rid of, like gobies and alewives. Their colonies attract other water birds such as herons and egrets.\nThe plan to allow 50 killings per day\/1500 per month\/14250 per year, and to leave their bodies to rot where they lie is reminiscent of the buffalo killing of 100 years ago. I imagine that if the hunter wanted to kill 100 per day, there will be no one counting. Cormorants will be easy targets in their colonies, which will be rapidly wiped out, chasing out the other wildlife living among them. The Ontario government will briefly hear an outcry from the public when masses of rotting birds will be observed, which will be offensive, but then there will be no more complaints because there will be few if any cormorants. This is a plan to return cormorants to the endangered species list.\nThe real reason that fish stocks are down is not because of cormorants. It is because of the actions of people in the form of overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, loss of spawning beds and shoreline destruction, and climate change. When the cormorants are gone, you still won't have fish numbers until to fix the real problem, which is caused by man.\nPlease do not pass this legislation.

The bill also proposes to change the law in Ontario, to allow sport hunters to \u2018spoil\u2019 the birds after being shot, meaning left to rot. Currently it is illegal to \u2018spoil\u2019 game species, since technically the hunting of wildlife isn\u2019t supposed to be for the sheer thrill of killing. Carcasses, in theory, are to be used.\nThe current proposal \u2013 unprecedented in its cruelty and sheer blood thirst \u2013 would allow hunters to shoot up colonies at their pleasure in an open season that will run from March 15 to December 31(!) \u2013 every year.\nThe intention is clearly to kill off these birds in Ontario and this goal can be accomplished quickly with no restrictions on the number of hunters that can attack a colony anywhere, anytime, including one of the largest colonies on the Great Lakes located in Toronto at Tommy Thompson Park. As long as sport hunters remain in their boats, and do not step onto the shore, there is nothing restricting them from coming close enough to shoot nests from below, killing adults peacefully tending their young.\nLandowners have always had the unrestricted ability to kill cormorants if they were perceived as \u2018nuisance\u2019 on their private property. The main 'nuisance' that cormorants pose has however on examination been found to consist in their being in competition with sport fishers, who put their own personal enjoyment and hobby above the survival of other species and a healthy and normal eco system.\nAlmost all Double-crested Cormorant colonies contain several other colonial waterbird species such as Herring Gull, Ring-billed Gull, Common Tern, Caspian Tern, Black-crowned Night Herons, Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, White Pelicans, who will also be disturbed during their breeding season by this hunting activity. When Ontario Parks began culling cormorants at Presqu\u2019ile Provincial Park, they lost the ONLY Great Blue Heron breeding colony on Lake Ontario which was embedded among the cormorants for protection against predators.\nPlease stop this disastrous proposal before waterbird colonies are decimated across Ontario.\nPlease note: It is impossible to monitor this hunting activity as proposed.

Cormorants are a native species and their numbers have only recently recovered from being close to endangered and a significant amount of money was invested to create a healthier environment for these birds to encourage population growth.\nThere is no scientific evidence to suggest that Cormorants are the reason for a decline in sport fish numbers when in fact it has been shown that Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus), an invasive species, have reduced populations of Ontario sport fish as they eat eggs, young and compete for the same food source.\nItems in the proposal that TOC rejects include:\n\u2022\tThe proposed reclassification of Double-crested Cormorants to game birds as they are not game birds and are largely considered to be inedible.\n\u2022\tThe provision in the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act which would exempt hunters from being required to properly dispose of the deceased birds and allow for the carcasses to spoil on site. The possible public health issues associated with the dead birds as well as the aesthetics and impact it will have on waterfront recreation remain a concern which would be shared by most communities;\n\u2022\tNo overall bag limit and 50 birds\/day.\nThe proposed hunting season would also cause disturbance to other sensitive species that co-nest with Cormorants.  These birds are protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act and include: Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias), and Great Egret (Ardea alba) as well as other species which co-nest with cormorants in Ontario such as the Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis), Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), Common Tern (Sterna hirundo), Caspian Tern (Hydroprogne caspia).  The TOC is also very concerned that the Common Loon (Gavia immer), which looks very similar to the Cormorant could be taken by accident.  The MNRF has not provided any mitigation to ensure that there would be no impact to these co-nesting species and there simply has been no research conducted to conclude that there would be no negative impacts.\nBoth members of a pair of Cormorants are required for nest success.  The killing of either a male or a female during the breeding season will result in their chicks starving to death even if the other parent is present.  How will this inhumane approach be handled?  If a population cull is determined to be necessary through scientific study and evidence, a controlled, local cull in early spring before nesting season by the MNRF would avoid these situations.\nWe have also heard disturbing information that not a single MNRF Biologist was consulted regarding this outrageous proposal and further that the MNRF biologists found out about the proposal while perusing the Registry of their own accord.\nThis reeks of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters lobbyists (and by extension Doug Ford who is undoubtedly involved) pressuring the MNRF into this crazy proposal.\nIn summary, the TOC strongly believes that this proposal is flawed and request that it be rejected as it stands.\nAngela Brooks, M.Sc.\nSenior Ecologist\/Conservation Councillor\nToronto Ornithological Club\n",

        "comment":"The population of Double Crested Cormorants on Lake Ontario has exploded out of control. Their only known predator is man. Therefore we have to take charge in controlling their population.\n      Cormorants may not eat a great deal of salmon, trout or other sport fish but they definitely consume large numbers of bait fish. It is a known fact that each bird consumes about one pound per day.\n      They also do a significant amount of permanent damage to the environment.\n      I believe there is very little danger of extirpating the population as they are very affluent breeders. I therefore agree with the proposal of making Cormorants a game species and allow hunting of these birds.\n",

        "comment":"This irrationally\/ill conceived proposal makes zero sense in terms of responsible wildlife management or ecological health. It's nothing more than a licence to exterminate a species with no regard for how that would affect other species or the ecology of the habitats affected. One very likely result would be a further increase in invasive fish species. One study in Michigan found that on Lake Michigan, 80% to 90% of a Double Crested Cormorant diet consists of invasive species. Eliminating Cormorants will invariably have an inverse affect on the species they feed on. It could be argued that Cormorants are a beneficial species, contributing to the health of the lakes.\nThe \"limit\" of 50 birds per hunter per day is rediculous! That means that a small group of hunters could wipe out a colony in a Weekend. Also, the \"open season\" includes the entire time these migratory birds are in Ontario.\nThe fact that by all accounts the population of Cormorants is \"stable or decreasing\" just invalidates the \"need\" for such a proposal in the first place.\nAny time humans mess with wildlife, especially on a large scale, such as this proposal, it never turns out to be a good thing.\nCanada's leading bird science organization, Bird Studies Canada, has issued a very strong condemnation of this proposal. These are people who are the very top experts in the country when it comes to bird science and the habitats in which birds live and breed. If their strong condemnation isn't enough to kill this proposal then that makes it very clear that this is only about politics and not about responsible wildlife management at all. The Bird Studies Canada condemnation a well reasoned argument based in fact and the best current understanding of wildlife\/habitat management, not mention pointing out how this proposal defies current regulations, best practices and ethical hunting practices. It truly points out how irresponsible this proposal is and that if any scientific consultation was undertaken, the true experts were never contacted or at least they were ignored.

        "comment":"My major concerns:\n(1)   Lack of scientific credibility and justification\nThe proposal fails to demonstrate a sound scientific basis for the need for the hunt, lacking any detailed information about the species\u2019 population size.\nThe proposal\u2019s policy rationale indicates that the species\u2019 population is stable or declining, decreasing MNRF\u2019s justification for the hunt.\nThe proposal fails to address the potential impact of the hunt on the population of Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario, or the potential impact on other wildlife species which could be affected.\nThe proposal fails to adopt an ecosystem-based approach to wildlife population assessments and management, a key consideration for a species with such complex interactions with aquatic and terrestrial species and habitats. Among other things, it fails to describe a population management objective (population target) provincially or regionally. Nor does it describe a timeframe over which the proposal would be in place. Although it proposes a program to monitor cormorant population and trends in Ontario, it would be some years before any such program could provide solid estimates, leaving the first few years essentially unmonitored.\n(2)   Inconsistencies with standard norms for hunting and Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act principles\nThe proposed hunt is inconsistent with every tenet of wildlife management and hunting ethic, including failure to protect wildlife during the breeding season and permission to allow game meats to spoil. This proposed divergence from norms highlights the fact that this is not sport hunting by any standard definition, but is rather a broad-scale and largely unregulated cull \u2013 reminiscent of unchecked \u201cmarket hunting,\u201d which modern bird hunting regulations were designed to correct.\nThe proposed exemption to the requirement to protect against meat spoilage, coupled with a failure to retrieve or even report carcasses, renders population monitoring and enforcement effectively impossible, which could rapidly lead to large-scale mortality with population level impacts.\nThe hunting of Double-crested Cormorants during the breeding season is again inconsistent with wildlife management and hunting principles and ethics; such hunting will inevitably lead to failure of nests and starvation of chicks, which are issues of concern relating to both population management and to inhumane treatment to wildlife.\nThe proposed open season from March 15 to December 31 each year represents the entire duration of the species\u2019 natural annual occurrence in Ontario \u2013 effectively resulting in no meaningful closed season in the province.\n(3)   Impact on Double-crested Cormorant populations, native biodiversity and ecosystems\nThe proposed bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no possession limit over a nine and a half month open season is exceptionally high, unsustainable, and without precedent under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for its failure to address the need for population sustainability. It is not unlikely that such a level of hunting would lead to local and\/or regional extirpations, as well as reduction provincially to token remnant populations. The likelihood that this proposal would have only a \u2018neutral\u2019 impact is baseless.\nThe proposal allows for shooting of Double-crested Cormorants on breeding colonies which could lead to mortality of other colonial waterbird species which often nest in close association, such as Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, and Black-crowned Night Herons.\nDisturbance by hunters will disrupt other wildlife nesting in and near Double-crested Cormorant colonies, including the above-noted heron family members, as well as other species such as Caspian Terns, Common Terns, and Great Black-backed Gulls.\nThe increased level of shooting over water could lead to an increase in toxic shot deposited in lakes and rivers since not all shooters may abide by the proposal\u2019s requirement for non-toxic shot.\n(4)   Public safety and enforcement of proposed changes\nThe proposal allows for unrestricted shooting in Ontario, both in terms of season and location, potentially permitting hunters to be in unsafe proximity to boaters, cottagers and other outdoor recreation enthusiasts. The lack of a closed season in spring and summer increases the public safety risk due to the overlaps of the open season with the peak of outdoor recreation.\nThe proposal to permit hunting from a motorboat increases risk for public safety, which is contrary to migratory bird hunting regulations.\nThe large scale of the proposed hunt, the permission to discard carcasses and let meat spoil, and the exceptionally long open season render the hunt (including the daily bag limit) unenforceable by conservation officers.\nThe proposal\u2019s broad scope and exceptionally high quotas would require intensive and greatly expanded enforcement, as well as greatly increased resources for population monitoring; such resources are not likely to be available at a time when public expenditures are being cut back.\nThe Ministry\u2019s intent not to provide additional opportunities for public comment, should the proposal proceed, is a concern for due process relating to Ontario legislation, regulations, and policies.\nFor the above-noted reasons, I express my strong opposition to the proposal.\nThe above are noted as by Bird Studies Canada with whom I agree.\nBird Studies Canada is the country\u2019s leading non-governmental organization dedicated to the understanding, appreciation, and conservation of birds. The organization was founded in 1960 as the Long Point Bird Observatory, and by 1998 had expanded programs nationally and adopted the Bird Studies Canada name. A registered charity, BSC\u2019s mission is to conserve wild birds of Canada through sound science, on-the-ground actions, innovative partnerships, public engagement, and science-based advocacy. The organization is science-based with dozens of research, conservation, and outreach programs operating across Ontario and Canada. Many of BSC\u2019s programs are undertaken with the active participation of keen outdoors enthusiasts and field naturalists, currently numbering 49,000 volunteer \u201cCitizen Scientists.\u201d To advance its mission, BSC is proud to collaborate with dozens of conservation partners, representing non-governmental organizations, businesses, private landowners, and also many governmental agencies. This includes the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), which we are pleased to call a partner on many initiatives. We also have a long tradition of working with the hunting community towards waterfowl conservation goals at Long Point and elsewhere within the Ontario Great Lakes Basin.\nBird Studies Canada recognizes the Double-crested Cormorant as a native Ontario species, and one which has been heralded as a conservation success story. BSC also recognizes that the biology of this species and its ecological interactions are complex, making some management decisions challenging. As a colonial-nesting waterbird, the species can have an impact on the flora and fauna in the immediate area of colonies. This impact is sometimes described as large on the small scale, but small on the large scale.\nThe species suffered from environmental contaminants (notably, persistent organochlorine contaminants) in the Great Lakes region, and its population has recovered rapidly in recent decades from a reduction in these pollutants. Among a number of other factors, the rapid increase may have been aided by nutrient overloading and introduction of non-native prey species in the Great Lakes. While the population has increased significantly in recent decades, MNRF indicates that the population is now stable or declining \u2013 a common pattern of growth and stabilization in natural populations \u2013 which suggests from the outset this proposal to actively reduce the species\u2019 population by hunting is unwarranted.\nBSC\u2019s objections to the proposal are multiple and varied, including: (1) lack of scientific credibility and justification; (2) inconsistencies with standard norms for hunting and Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act principles; (3) unknown impact on Double-crested Cormorant populations, native biodiversity and ecosystems; and, (4) public safety and enforcement of proposed changes\n",

As well, the extremely long hunting season means birds still on the nest or just fledged will be shot. I foresee entire colonies being wiped out. Within the cormorant colony are often many other birds like Great Egret, Black-crowned Night Heron and Green Heron as well as gulls and terns. The disturbance to these areas will be great. Also, allowing the dead birds to remain unharvested is just completely disgraceful. This is nothing more than a shooting gallery or a slaughter. Also, there will likely be other birds shot by mistake. Several species of loon can be mistaken for cormorants as they loons, like cormorants, are inclined to hold their necks at the same angle. There is also a great deal of evidence that cormorants are eating a lot of invasive species. Some studies have it as high as 85-90% of their diet. To sum up, we've moved beyond this type of \"conservation\" method and this has no place in our Ontario.\n",

I see the proposed regulation changes regarding motor boats as a necessity to effectively hunt cormorants.  As the cormorant roosts and nests on treed bluffs along the shoreline and small treed islands, there is no other way to access them during the hunt other than by boat.  I have a cottage on a lake trout and bass lake in Halliburton County.  About 7-8 years ago, I noticed 2 cormorants inhabiting the lake mid summer. Now there are no less than 30 by late summer roosting along the south shoreline.  They frequent the small islands on the lake during the day and smaller brook trout and splake lakes nearby and the smell is extremely repulsive.  Because our lake is only about 300 hectares, the amount of cormorants is having an obvious affect on the lake.  I used to be able to snorkel along any shoreline and see numerous small mouth bass.  Now there are significantly less.  Because of the special strain of lake trout in this lake and the natural lack of bait fish, the Lakers main food source is small bugs and larvae.  The larger lake trout consume smaller small mouth bass.  With the amount of bass being taken by the cormorants, the large lake trout population will suffer. I am not able to say if the bird is targeting the lake trout themselves.\nI am also concerned that the proposed season for Central Ontario is too short.  The cormorants start showing up to our lake in late July and by late September\/early October they seem to have max'd out.\n",

I believe that other options should be considered before proposing changes to the hunting season.\n",

The Double-crested Cormorant seems to be a handy scapegoat when other factors may be having a more significant impact on fish supplies (e.g. development activity, pesticide runoff, climate change, overfishing). Classifying the cormorant as a \"game bird\" makes a joke of game bird management. A thorough scientific environmental assessment is required before any policies are adopted on this issue.\n",

Complaints that these birds are damaging commercial or sport fishing stocks have not been verified and even if they are, the  cull should be a controlled and careful process, because these native birds also fill an important niche in the ecosystem.\nThis proposal  with its high daily limit, long season  and the permission to let the carcasses rot reads like an invitation for irresponsible shooters, rather than sportsman and hunters who traditionally have cared about and for wildlife.\nLarge scale decomposing bodies create more problems that are easy to foresee.\n",

This is simple discrimination against a not so pretty bird that is finally recovering from our pollution of their environment. I appreciate they won't be shot from January to March when they aren't even in the province! Are the hunters going to respect the ban on lead shot?

The long standing concern over the presence of cormorants and the increase in population across Ontario has been controversial for various reasons. The strategy used in your proposal is poorly explained and likely to fail if implemented as planned.\nThe proposal does not provide sufficient information about the population across the province, estimates about the number of kills expected, the effect on other wildlife and may other questions the public or experts may have.\nThe high daily bag limit, over a long season, during the prime cottage and boating period is surely going to capture the attention of many people. Shooting cormorants during the summer from a stationary boat on an Ontario lake is not easy to explain to many of us. The lake I boat on, has a colony of them on an island where many boaters go by. The public safety of these boaters and cottagers may  indeed be at risk. The diverging views of groups and individuals may cause some public reaction as hunters hunt in such public places. The high daily bag limit also produce undesired results. It relies on the actions of individual hunters to either wipe out all the cormorants on a lake or not do anything.\nI find that the proposal does not provide for an adequate discussion of the issue and a serious dialogue about the options. It leaves me to believe that the ministry has simply given up. Many groups and individuals have asked for some controls and  I understand their concerns, but this proposal does not address the problem appropriately.\n",

As humans we are here to protect what land we have left and the flora\/fauna that reside within. I must say I am extremely disappointed in the government for issuing this proposition. I would not (nor thousands of others as I have witnessed) allow it in a million years.\nThe fact that you claim these birds are \"detrimental\" to the fish population raises a few questions.\nFirstly, there is NO concrete evidence you can provide that supports this. As EVERY living being NEEDS food to SURVIVE, these creatures are just living their life and we are being absolutely greedy and suggesting they do not have a right to eat? What about taking care of their babies? You suggest that the hunt can happen during their mating season\/nesting season. You suggest that, because these birds \"eat too many fish\", that we have the right to murder them and leave their babies to starve and die? The babies suffer because we shoot their parents because we feel it necessary. Who says we should have that kind of power over another living creature? What kind of Country is this? I certainly cannot believe it is Canada.\nA quote from the Animal Alliance, \"The Government of Ontario says it is responding to concerns about too many cormorants, depleted fish stocks and environmental damage.

The population now appears to have stabilized and I have heard from reliable MNRF sources that the population is declining. That is the normal result of an initial dramatic population increase that eventually slows and reverses. Fish populations are stressed, it is true, and most sources agree that there are two major human factors: (1) sport fishing that exceeds daily catch limits and (2) \u201crogue\u201d native commercial fishers who set nets illegally. Investigations of cormorant food sources and how they affect the food chain of sport fish show that cormorants do not affect the sport fishery. Even if a hunt were to be allowed, the details such as 50 per day, that it will occur all through the summer, that hunters are exempt from spoilage regulations are unconscionable and irresponsible. The prospects of hearing shotguns throughout the summer, or seeing carcasses of rotting birds floating on the water are neither acceptable nor in synch with standard hunting ethics. The purpose of this is not to hunt for the purpose of sustenance (that is having a meal). The purpose indeed appears to be very clear: the elimination of the species. And why? To satisfy a small group of people who feel mistakenly threatened by another species. Cormorants are a very intriguing bird: generally quiet other than their muttering to each other on hot summer days, just going about their business. They deserve better. A more logical strategy is for MNRF to hire more COs to enforce fishing regulations.\n",

Double-crested Cormorants are a native species that because of the elimination of DDT and the invasion of provincial waters by non-native species of invasive fish, have gone through a dramatic population increase in recent years. There is no evidence that this species is depleting stocks of native fish. To the contrary, a major study by Madura and Jones (2016) found that in Lake Michigan the diet of cormorants was composed nearly 90% of non-native species, especially alewife, round goby, and white perch. They concluded that active management of cormorants was not supported as it would not offer any protection to  local fisheries.\nEthically, no animal should have an open season placed on it. This proposal would allow for myriad rotting corpses to pollute our land, potentially being a source for disease to spread through other species. Countless plastic shotgun shells and shot will pollute our waters. Additionally, young cormorants will be left starving in their colonies.\nA little more than a century ago, Passenger Pigeons were the most abundant birds on this continent. Unregulated hunting resulted in their complete extinction. While EBR 013-4124 may not bring about the extinction of Double-crested Cormorants, it will certainly have negative effects on their population and the ecosystem in which they are part of. And it will likely open the door for unjustified open seasons on other native species.\nI find this proposed bill unconscionable.\n",

The fact that hunters would be allowed very high limits and are allowed to leave dead birds to rot encourages wholesale slaughter of a non-food species, not a legitimate hunt.\nIf residents are concerned about fecal matter from cormorants, I doubt they will be in favour of dead, decomposing carcasses rotting in their neighbourhood.\nThis proposal threatens the existence of a native species which has already been depleted by poor policies in the past.

        "comment":"Comment regarding EBR number 013-4124: Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\nFrom the Lennox and Addington Stewardship Council\nWe, the Lennox and Addington Stewardship Council, are very worried about the great damage that would result from the proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario.\nBreeding Birds\nIf the proposal permits a high bag limit, hunting from a stationary motorboat, and hunting during the breeding bird season, there will be severe problems. The non-target species, including protected species such as the common tern, could also lose their nests in the hunting process. Nestlings of all species would likely die of exposure and starvation. All these factors would give a highly negative face to this hunting practice and the public reaction to this cruelty would be strong and swift.\nAllowing hunting from a motorboat during breeding season will encourage the disturbance of other colonial nesting bird species, including black-crowned night herons, herring gulls, common terns, Caspian terns, ring-billed gulls, great blue herons and great egrets, which are protected under the migratory birds act. Such disturbance will cause reduced parental care and possible colony desertions of any of these species.\nTherefore, the nesting birds and nestlings of many species would be adversely affected by this action, perhaps for many generations.\nInvasive Species Control\nIn the current ecological system, cormorants are the top predator in the new regime. They help limit prey populations and help balance the food web. With the presence of cormorants, the system is now more stable. They help keep some invasive species populations in check.\nNote this 2016 study on Lake Michigan: (https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0380133015002750)\nMadura and Jones found that \u201cInvasive species, most notably alewife, round goby, and white perch, contributed over 80% and 90% of the diet of cormorants by biomass and number, respectively.\u201d The study concluded that its \u201cresults do not support the active management of the cormorants \u2026 to protect or recover local fisheries.\u201d Madura, P.T., Jones, H.P. (2016). Invasive species sustain double-crested cormorants in southern Lake Michigan. Journal of Great Lakes Research, 42(2), 413-420.\nIf invasive species are allowed to increase, the effects on fisheries and biodiversity in the Great Lakes could be very damaging. The double-crested cormorant is ecologically important to the Great Lakes. Preservation of the cormorant and other shoreline species is imperative.\nNote this 2003 study in Hamilton Harbour:\n(http:\/\/www.reabic.net\/publ\/Somers_et%20al_2003_Neogobius%20melanostomus\u2026)\n\u201cThe cormorant population has stabilized in the Great Lakes and complaints about cormorants by fishers are unsubstantiated. Cormorants do not appear to take significant fish stocks, whereas humans do.  I and my students have found that the vast majority of prey fed to cormorant chicks are alewife and the exotic\ninvasive round goby (both are not native to the Great Lakes).\u201d Somers, C.M., Lozer, M., Kjoss, V.A., Quinn, J.S. (2003). The Invasive Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in the Diet of Nestling Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario. Journal of Great\nLakes Research, 29(3):392\u2013399.\nThe double-crested cormorant is a scapegoat deflecting blame from human overfishing.  By culling a stable population, this policy will simply speed up the rates of reproduction as density-dependent limits are reduced.\nEffects on Tourism and Recreation\nThe unorganized shooting encouraged by the proposal is a potential danger to all users of the lakes and islands, including sailors and kayakers. Another problem will be the numbers of dead birds washing up on beaches during the swimming season.\nRecommendation\nWe highly recommend that this new proposal either be ruled out OR changed to a controlled hunt with specific restrictions to protect the ecological systems of the Great Lakes. Most efforts by humans to manipulate natural systems on a large scale cause unexpected consequences and usually make the situation worse.\nAbout the Council\nThe Lennox and Addington Stewardship Council was established in 1995 to work with local groups and individuals in our county to foster healthy stewardship practices in the community.

There is no scientific evidence to indicate they are a threat to the commercial fishery. The destruction of nesting adults will result in a slow, painful death for the chicks. Loons, as well as other protected species, will be shot by hunters engaging in this activity. I am a hunter and I know this mistaken identity will occur on a regular basis. As a cottage owner, I do not want to listen to the boom of 12 gauge shotguns echoing around the lake. This will be an unethical hunt in which birds are proxies for traditional clay pigeons used for target practise.

In my opinion, they are not only birds like no other but they occupy a place in our bird kingdom.  What use is a dead cormorant?  It cannot be used for food nor is it fair to use it as an example of taxidermy.  Accidental deaths can be used for taxidermy as species can be examined more closely.  It seems as if a hunting season would be enjoyed only by people who would like to hunt to kill - not for hunting for food.  It may be that the cormorant population is increasing but is this justification for slaughtering them ?  Especially as not long ago, they were low in numbers.\n   I understand that cormorants eat fish and are therefore in competition with fishermen but are fishermen more important than our natural species?  I wonder how many fishermen in the area of cormorant habitats fish for livelihood and how many fish for sport.\n  Please think again before embarking on this project.  In this era of climate change, who knows what disastrous consequences may result.  Should we interfere with the balance of Nature?  I am reminded of the old story of the villagers who killed all the annoying starlings only to be visited with a plague of caterpillars.\n",

It is based on the concerns of \"some\" groups, without input from others, and would study not the potential effects of its implementation, in advance, but only what then happened after implementation (i.e., after harm had potentially been done). It is aimed at a bird population which has previously been in decline and has only recently stabilized.  It allows killing birds simply for \"sport\" (since cormorants are not edible; responsible hunters eat\/use what they have killed); it limits bags but not possession; it allows carcasses to rot. It gives the cormorants no chance at all: these are large, rather slow birds the shooting of which is like shooting fish in a barrel, and even allows them to be shot when nesting, and from stationary boats.  This isn't sport, it's killing for the pleasure of killing.\nSometimes birds have to be culled if populations grow too large. A  responsible cull, which is undertaken after careful study of the situation, is quite different from what is being proposed here.\nThis is NOT responsible policy, and the proposal should be withdrawn and a careful study undertaken in consultation with all interested groups.\n",

Killing animals for no purpose is inherently wrong.\nCormorants are inedible so the only purpose served by allowing them to be hunted is to reduce the population. Throwing open the entire population to be hunted in the numbers possible could be catastrophic to the birds. And the birds are part of a natural ecosystem, so removing them in this manner will have implications for that ecosystem, most of which are likely to be unpredicted and not good.\nThe facts are clear - despite the misinformation, these birds have minimal impact on commercial or sport fisheries.

        "comment":"As a hunter who primarily targets waterfowl, I do not agree with the proposed action concerning the addition of Double-Crested Cormorants as a game species, via its exception from the Migratory Bird Act.\nI feel this amendment to the act is not justified for the following reasons:\n1) While I to often see cormorants while hunting, I have never felt they have impeded my hunt.\n2) Permission to let meat spoil is against everything that hunting represents - at least to me, but also many others I am sure.\n3) The daily bag and possession limits, combined with the long seasons present a situation which could lead to rapid declines.\n4) The potential declines, may not only be rapid, but will be very difficult to monitor effectively until it is too late.\n5) The province has spent many years, funds and efforts on restoring and managing the cormorant population. It would be foolish to make an amendment could undo years of conservation and wildlife management activities.\n6) While culls have played various roles in wildlife management in the past, few examples of native species culls are looked upon favorably in hindsight. Notably, the culling of elk from Ontario, where the justification was centered around the protection of other species. Only after the cull had occurred, did the province realize that the source of the problem was not elk. Many millions have been spent on the reintroduction of elk in Ontario.\n7) The extended season of the cormorant hunt would overlap with breeding periods of the species. Hunting species which are actively tending to eggs or young is unethical. Hunting seasons are specifically built around avoiding this portion of their target's life history.\nTo summarize, while I understand the public desire from some hunters to have greater management of cormorant populations, especially around the great lakes. However, I do not think an open season, especially one so broad, long and with such an extensive bag limit is justified.  I, as a hunter, disagree with the Ministry's proposed plan, and sincerely hope that modifications to the proposed amendment will be considered.  The biggest issue, in my view, is the lack of regulation and monitoring, both of which cannot be addressed with the proposal as is. It is important to understand the implications and likely outcomes associated with any wildlife management strategy. The amendment as presented does not appear to be based on scientific facts, cogent reasoning, and therefore should not proceed.\nThank you\n",

They live in colonies rather than their numbers being spread out over a vast region.  That means the so-called \"destruction\" their colonies cause to trees and vegetation is both natural and very limited.  Secondly, the impact they have on fish in the area is generally a positive one, as they eat mostly invasive species.  Over-fishing by people is to blame for the reduction in fish caught by fishermen, not the cormorants. Third, the number of cormorants slated to be killed, or allowed to be killed, could cause them to be completely wiped out.  They are easy to kill when they are in colonies, and the kill limit is ridiculously high, especially given the number of cormorants in existence within the region in question.  Further, their bodies would be left rotting under the guidelines, with the young left to perish from exposure and starvation.  In addition, many other aquatic birds who nest alongside the cormorants would be very negatively impacted as well, including nesting interruption, having to move away, being killed by proximity.

I hold many opinions which may or may not be based in fact.  I don't expect the government to amend legislation because of my opinions.\nGroups of hunters, each shooting 50 birds in a day and allowing the meat to spoil is wasteful and unsanitary. It seems certain that there will be wounded birds left as well, which is cruel.

Scientific data show that this species only depresses sports fish populations in a very small number of studies, and not in any of the Great Lakes, although there is some very small local depression of forage fish around very large colonies. To kill Double-crested Cormorants on their nesting colonies would also greatly disturb other species that are nesting nearby including threaten Common and Caspian Terns. It is also incredibly inhumane to consider killing parents of birds while they have eggs or young. Double-crested Cormorant populations have also stabilized and, although they do cause destruction of their nesting trees, this destruction is tiny in comparison to the scale of destruction that occurs due to human activities such as industrial or housing developments. DCCO are a native species to Ontario with bones showing up in prehistoric middens even in Northumberland County so there is no good reason to assault our local biodiversity.\n",

I have enjoyed watching the cormorants that I see on the lake and have sailed by the island colonies to the west of Presqu'ile Provincial Park many times. I really love these birds and am horrified to learn about this proposal to allow them to be shot from boats, even in their nesting colonies.\nI have a background in Restoration Ecology and this type of intervention in an attempt to 'control the population' is not ecologically sound and can only cause much harm to all of the species that may be affected by it. There are other birds that nest alongside the cormorants and would undoubtedly be disturbed and harassed by the gunfire. The invasive species of fish that are currently in the great lakes will also become a bigger problem as these species have been a big part of the cormorant's diet. There is no ecological benefit to allowing a controlled cull for the above reasons and a free-for-all hunt, like the one being proposed, could spell disaster for the double-crested cormorants.  The allowable numbers of 50 birds killed each day suggest that the population could be quickly decimated with nesting pairs suffering if their mate is killed or injured and chicks dying from starvation if their parents are killed. Entire colonies could be killed by overzealous hunters and it will be a colossal waste of their lives. The idea that the Ministry will monitor the hunt suggests that there will be people on the ground for 7-8 months of the year at all the colony sites which is very unlikely or very expensive and so the whole proposal undermines the stability and survival of the cormorant populations. The proposal states that there is no real benefit to allowing a hunt and yet there is a huge amount of harm that is being proposed. It's not only unethical to allow wanton killing of a species but it's cruel to allow the colonies to be shot at in this way where many birds will be injured or harmed and parents and chicks will be harassed during nesting season. Studies show that the cormorant populations on the Great Lakes have stabilized after a rapid growth period but their rebound from the brink of a population crash mustn't be forgotten. With climate changing and previous ecological patterns being disrupted, we don't know what the future may bring for Great Lakes ecology and we can't operate in a heedless way when it comes to a species that play a key role in lake ecology. They deserve to be here. Please do not allow this hunt.\n",

Now that DDT is not being used, the double-crested cormorant population has increased, but according to the information in your proposal has now plateaued and even decreased slightly. There has been a lot of energy expended in helping this bird to recover from the devastation that it experienced, and to now undue what has been accomplished makes no sense to me.\nI am not a fan of hunting, in general, but I can support it if it is done in order to feed the hunter and his\/her family. What is being proposed is not that, it is killing for the sake, for the pleasure (????) of killing. Why on earth is there a proposal being made for that? It takes little to no skill to go to a nesting sight and start blasting away. That isn't hunting, is it?\nAllowing people to kill these birds, indiscriminately seems dangerous to other species that are nesting in the same area, and also to people in the area as I see that this killing is to be allowed through the summer months. I believe that these birds nest in the same areas as people have their cottages. Surely we don't want guns being shot when there is a possibility of people being in the same space.\nI understand that sometimes a species will become over-populated and may need to be culled in one area or another, and that is the job of the MNRF. It is about carefully determining the number of birds to be culled and then culling only that number. What you are proposing is nothing like that, it is allowing people to determine where they will kill the birds and how many they will kill over time. I see that this could easily progress to a time that the double-crested cormorant would again be endangered. We are hearing every day about species of animals the world over, that are becoming extinct.

        "comment":"As a Ontario fishing tackle manufacture, that specializes in Great Lakes trolling, the impact of bait populations has a direct correlation with the amount of anglers participation, which in turn affects our bottom line. When the Great Lakes were full of bait, there were lineups at the launch ramps of anglers preparing to fish for the prized salmon. As the water became clearer, due to envasive species, the comorants were able to hunt deeper into the lake and consume more alewife bait, the main food source for salmon. As a result in Lake Huron the alewife population crashed and the salmon population crashed as well, destroying a fantastic fishery. This had a great impact on businesses along Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, forcing Tackle\nShops and Motels to close. The impact was felt throughout the Great Lakes, causing salmon stocking reductions. These stocking reductions have had a ripple down effect, launch ramps no longer had lineups, tackle stores and motels started closing, boat and tackle sales for the Great Lakes dropped and fuel sales and restaurants took a hit. What was once a tens of billions dollar industry was reduced to a 5 billion dollar industry.\nThe facts are clear, reduce the\nCormorant population to reasonable levels and the alewife bait has a chance to recover, allow the cormorant population to go unchecked and we lose the salmon and those businesses that depend on those fish, fail.\n",

        "comment":"My objections to the proposal are multiple and varied, including: (1) lack of scientific credibility and justification; (2) inconsistencies with standard norms for hunting and Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act principles; (3) unknown impact on Double-crested Cormorant populations, native biodiversity and ecosystems; and, (4) public safety and enforcement of proposed changes. The following is a summary of the major concerns noted by BSC regarding the proposal:\n(1)   Lack of scientific credibility and justification\nThe proposal fails to demonstrate a sound scientific basis for the need for the hunt, lacking any detailed information about the species\u2019 population size.\nThe proposal\u2019s policy rationale indicates that the species\u2019 population is stable or declining, decreasing MNRF\u2019s justification for the hunt.\nThe proposal fails to address the potential impact of the hunt on the population of Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario, or the potential impact on other wildlife species which could be affected.\nThe proposal fails to adopt an ecosystem-based approach to wildlife population assessments and management, a key consideration for a species with such complex interactions with aquatic and terrestrial species and habitats. Among other things, it fails to describe a population management objective (population target) provincially or regionally. Nor does it describe a timeframe over which the proposal would be in place. Although it proposes a program to monitor cormorant population and trends in Ontario, it would be some years before any such program could provide solid estimates, leaving the first few years essentially unmonitored.\n(2)   Inconsistencies with standard norms for hunting and Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act principles\nThe proposed hunt is inconsistent with every tenet of wildlife management and hunting ethic, including failure to protect wildlife during the breeding season and permission to allow game meats to spoil. This proposed divergence from norms highlights the fact that this is not sport hunting by any standard definition, but is rather a broad-scale and largely unregulated cull \u2013 reminiscent of unchecked \u201cmarket hunting,\u201d which modern bird hunting regulations were designed to correct.\nThe proposed exemption to the requirement to protect against meat spoilage, coupled with a failure to retrieve or even report carcasses, renders population monitoring and enforcement effectively impossible, which could rapidly lead to large-scale mortality with population level impacts.\nThe hunting of Double-crested Cormorants during the breeding season is again inconsistent with wildlife management and hunting principles and ethics; such hunting will inevitably lead to failure of nests and starvation of chicks, which are issues of concern relating to both population management and to inhumane treatment to wildlife.\nThe proposed open season from March 15 to December 31 each year represents the entire duration of the species\u2019 natural annual occurrence in Ontario \u2013 effectively resulting in no meaningful closed season in the province.\n(3)   Impact on Double-crested Cormorant populations, native biodiversity and ecosystems\nThe proposed bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no possession limit over a nine and a half month open season is exceptionally high, unsustainable, and without precedent under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for its failure to address the need for population sustainability. It is not unlikely that such a level of hunting would lead to local and\/or regional extirpations, as well as reduction provincially to token remnant populations. The likelihood that this proposal would have only a \u2018neutral\u2019 impact is baseless.\nThe proposal allows for shooting of Double-crested Cormorants on breeding colonies which could lead to mortality of other colonial waterbird species which often nest in close association, such as Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, and Black-crowned Night Herons.\nDisturbance by hunters will disrupt other wildlife nesting in and near Double-crested Cormorant colonies, including the above-noted heron family members, as well as other species such as Caspian Terns, Common Terns, and Great Black-backed Gulls.\nThe increased level of shooting over water could lead to an increase in toxic shot deposited in lakes and rivers since not all shooters may abide by the proposal\u2019s requirement for non-toxic shot.\n(4)   Public safety and enforcement of proposed changes\nThe proposal allows for unrestricted shooting in Ontario, both in terms of season and location, potentially permitting hunters to be in unsafe proximity to boaters, cottagers and other outdoor recreation enthusiasts. The lack of a closed season in spring and summer increases the public safety risk due to the overlaps of the open season with the peak of outdoor recreation.\nThe proposal to permit hunting from a motorboat increases risk for public safety, which is contrary to migratory bird hunting regulations.\nThe large scale of the proposed hunt, the permission to discard carcasses and let meat spoil, and the exceptionally long open season render the hunt (including the daily bag limit) unenforceable by conservation officers.\nThe proposal\u2019s broad scope and exceptionally high quotas would require intensive and greatly expanded enforcement, as well as greatly increased resources for population monitoring; such resources are not likely to be available at a time when public expenditures are being cut back.\nThe Ministry\u2019s intent not to provide additional opportunities for public comment, should the proposal proceed, is a concern for due process relating to Ontario legislation, regulations, and policies.\nFor the above-noted reasons, I express its strong opposition to the proposal.\n",

        "comment":"Hello. This new government has won my respect for several reasons. However, this proposal to control the Double-crested Cormorant population is not one of them. As a professional biologist I am very concerned. As someone who respects hunters, I am concerned too. I believe that hunters are an important component of the electorate, and demographically I would expect they have a lot in common with Conservative voters. I fear that they will find this plan is insulting to their sport. What you are proposing is not hunting. You are proposing a cull. I would even go so far as to call it an extermination plan. You should call it what it is and not try to fool people with words. If there is a \"hunter\" who likes your proposal, I would call them simply someone who wants to do a lot of killing. Why would you want to call Double-crested Cormorants a game species? Game species are supposed to be desired as food, challenging to hunt, and failing both of those reasons, charming trophies. Cormorants are not \"game\".\nAs a professional biologist in the field of wildlife, I worry about your plan for several reasons. I would like to say that I doubt that any of your very talented wildlife biologists had a hand in crafting it, but I really do not want to believe that could be the case. Double-crested Cormorant is a colonial nesting species. They nest at sites shared with other colonial nesting species. Where is the plan to protect the other species? You want to allow \"open season\" during nesting season. I might trust a real, ethical hunter to avoid the non-target species, but I suspect only less ethical hunters will go for this so-called hunt and will hit non-target species either through carelessness or lack of knowledge.\nWhere are the data that will show how this \"hunt\" will control the population such that we will still have a reasonable population of Double-crested Cormorants afterwards? How does the current Double-crested Cormorant population compare to the historical, pre-near-extirpation population? They are, after all, a part of Ontario's native biodiversity. It worries me that you have not presented these data up front so the public can consider it.\nAs someone concerned about language and society, I also worry about the way you are treating this so-called nuisance species. Underneath this plan, between the lines, I can read the utter disdain that people have for these birds, these birds that to them are an inconvenience. For a peaceful world we must learn to live and let live, not to go and shoot to bits anything that inconveniences us. I am not opposed to wildlife population management, but I would like my government to do it in an honest and ethical way, not in a way that warps the language and the law to suit the desires of the inconvenienced few.\n",

        "comment":"One must wonder what is the justification behind the mass slaughter in the name of recreational hunting of defenseless cormorants at such an alarmingly high scale? The important questions to ask is whether the concerned department of the current government has acceptable peer reviewed publishable data on the population dynamics of the cormorants based on which hunting tags are being released? If yes, can these be made available for public review before taking such a decision; and if no, then the government is directly answerable to the public as to what exact mechanism is being followed in deciding the release of hunting tags and the numbers entitled for each hunter. The objection is not against recreational hunting; but at the same time we need to be responsible for not overexploiting a particular species that over next two decades their numbers start dwindling beyond ecological recovery. In case of decimation of a species that is not a conservation concern today, will the present government take the responsibility and accept their direct and indirect role in the not so distant future as being a catalyst for legal ecocide? Recreation for one species is not acceptable at the cost of the demise of another in a civilized world. Will the concerned Minster be bold enough to tackle these questions?\n",

        "comment":"I am a hunter and grew up in a hunting family. And I am deeply troubled by this proposed legislation on many levels.\nFirst of all, the very idea of allowing anything that is shot to \u201cspoil\u201d goes against everything that a true hunter believes in or was ever taught. My Dad had an absolute rule: If you shoot something, then you eat it! There were no exceptions. Otherwise, hunting degenerates to killing just for the sake of killing. This is morally wrong and should never be allowed legally under any circumstances. Please do not change the laws to allow this to happen.\nSecond, allowing the killing of young cormorants still in the nest is again contrary to everything hunting stands for. It is a disgusting and abhorrent thing even to consider let alone actually propose.\nThirdly, while many blame cormorants for the decrease in gamefish stocks, this is simply not true. Please take into account the careful scientific research that has been done on this exact thing. Contrary to what so many people \u201cbelieve\u201d to be true, this research clearly shows that cormorants do NOT eats significant amounts of gamefish and, in point of fact, cormorants only thrive where there is an abundance of coarse fish that are of no interest to anyone who fishes.\nPlease look at the scientific facts rather than respond to unfounded opinion and prejudice.\nAnd finally, my cottage is on the southern part of Georgian Bay. I watch cormorants throughout the season. They spend much of the day on small rocky islands and are almost always to be found with seagulls, terns and often ducks as well. If hunting cormorants is permitted, then these other species of birds will also be killed, perhaps in large numbers. Do we just dismiss this as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d? Killing seagulls and terns and ducks out of season is illegal but it will happen. Are you prepared to take responsibility for this? Because whomever allows this will be held responsible for the consequences, morally and especially legally.\nI submit these comments in the hope that they will be taken seriously by those making decisions in this very important matter.\n",

This is especially important where large numbers have been shot in one location.\nThat shooting from boats be prohibited, since even stationary boats are not steady, and so hitting a desired target is less likely.\nThat the dates for allowed hunting be restricted so as to exclude the nesting season.\nThat shooting cormorants when they are close to other waterbirds be prohibited.\n",

        "comment":"Objection to cormorant hunting season\nIssue\nWe strongly oppose a lengthy open hunting season on cormorants in Ontario, and allowing cormorant hunters to leave cormorant carcasses to spoil. The proposals will result in odious slaughter, doing a disservice to ethical hunting.\nWe object to the proposed season for four primary reasons:\n\u2022\tInevitable destruction of nesting habitats for other birds, including those of concern to wildlife authorities \u2013 habitats that our organization owns\n\u2022\tCertainty of environmental degradation with spoilage of carcasses if suggested legislative changes are implemented that relieve cormorant hunters of the need to retrieve slaughtered birds\n\u2022\tQuestionable science regarding the cormorant impacts on fish populations, island forest habitats, other species, and aesthetics\n\u2022\tStrong safety risk to residents and visitors\nWho we are\nOur organization, The Land Conservancy for Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington, is a non-profit registered charity whose mission is to preserve and protect natural sites and landscapes in our area through owning land and holding conservation easements on land in perpetuity. We own Snake and Salmon islands, and both islands are nesting grounds for cormorants plus other bird species that are currently declining in number. We protect a total of eight properties in our area.\nDetailed objections\n1. Destruction of nesting habitats\nOur land conservancy owns two islands, Snake and Salmon, which are major nesting habitats for cormorants, gulls, and terns. Allowing open hunting of cormorants during the nesting season will inevitably drive away all other nesting species. Snake and Salmon have been subject of continuous study by Canadian Wildlife Service scientists since 1976.\n2. Cause of environmental degradation\nThe ministry is conducting consultation on proposals to exempt hunters from retrieval of cormorant carcasses.  At a bag limit of 50 cormorants per day, hunter carelessness compounded by the possibility of implementing the exemption will negatively affect the environment. Our local area shoreline will be heavily impacted by rotting cormorant carcasses if hunters are exempted from carcass retrieval. Prevailing winds blow from offshore islands to the shorelines of our two counties, leaving municipalities to deal with the resultant stench and waste disposal requirement. Even if the proposal to exempt cormorant hunters from carcass retrieval does not go forward, environmental degradation will nevertheless occur when the hunter is unable or unwilling to retrieve the wounded or killed cormorants.\n3. Questionable science\nWe are certainly aware of the changes wrought by the recovery of the cormorant population in our area. Islands that used to feature trees are now bare. But the many impacts attributed to cormorants remain unproven. Cormorants were common to the Lake Ontario\/St. Lawrence River prior to the introduction of DDT. The cormorant population appears to be stabilizing or possibly declining. Studies of cormorants show heavy consumption of invasive, non-native fish species such as Round Goby. A slaughter-level hunt may threaten a delicate balance of water and land species.\n4. Safety risk\nCormorants nest near areas popular with boaters and those who fish. Permitting a cormorant hunt for a  nine plus month season presents strong safety risks to boaters. For example, Snake and Salmon islands house major cormorant nesting colonies, and the islands are close to the shoreline of the City of Kingston and major recreational boating areas. Kingston advertises itself as Canada\u2019s sailing capital. The Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River headwaters are heavily visited during summer months. Permitting hunting from boats during these months is an invitation to accident.\nRecommendation\nOur land conservancy recommends complete withdrawal of the proposed cormorant hunt for the reasons we have outlined above. If the ministry considers itself compelled to introduce a hunting season for cormorants, we suggest a low bag-limit short hunting season in late autumn \u2013 beyond the recreational boating season \u2013 and insist that the ministry require cormorant hunters to retrieve their prey and dispose of the cormorant carcasses in an orderly and legal fashion. Given that the cormorant numbers appear to have stabilized, heavy hunting will likely trigger expansion of reproduction.\nOriginal signed by\nLand Conservancy for Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington\nVicki Schmolka, President\n",

The reasons given do not seem to go beyond the fact that some people don't like them because they compete with fishermen and are not aesthetically pleasing.

We need to stop looking at our natural world as just series resources for humans to exploit and rather see ourselves as embedded and dependent on the ecological integrity of our planet.

This is an ill-thought-out, knee-jerk reaction apparently  intended only to quell the self-centred \"concerns\" of the commercial fishing industry, property owners and other individuals, as is blatantly stated in the proposal.  Evident in this goal is that the proposal provides no scientific data that would support any of the statements about populations of either affected fish species or cormorants nor of the overall significance of purported negative effects to island forest habitats or to other species, nor any reasoning why the unsupported \"concerns\" of a few should override the larger environmental conservation mandate.  This proposal directly opposes the Ministry of Natural Resources' larger mandate to conserve and protect the natural environments and species and must be rejected.\nThe proposal presents no data to support any of the \"concerns\" that drive it.  \"Supporting materials\" is labelled misleadingly; it consists only of hunting-related legislation.  The proposal fails to provide any actual data on cormorant population and the currency and reliability of such data, and even admits that the population may be declining while failing to provide any analysis or even speculation as to causes. It fails to present any evidence of trends in fish populations nor any analysis of the effects on fish population of commercial and sport fishing, pollution and human-induced habitat changes; the same goes for the \"other species\" mentioned but undisclosed in the proposal.  There is no assessment as to whether the purported \"detriment\" to \"island forest habitats\" has any overall environmental significance; there is no support given as to why the effects of the presence of nesting colonies should be a motivating factor at all in proposing population reduction, nor why the \"aesthetic\" concerns of a few (presumably reflecting on the presence of bird droppings and the aforesaid effects of the presence of nesting colonies) should drive conservation policy.    In sum , it seems that the proposal responds only to the unsupported opinions of a sector of the public who resent the existence of cormorants and through misinformation or a lack of information, or simple greed, or a lack of appreciation for nature, are inclined to see the species as a scapegoat.\nIt can only be concluded that the proposal lacks foundation in scientific evidence.  Despite the implied \"concern\" that cormorant population affects commercial fishing success, the proposal admits that \"the anticipated economic consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral\", thus destroying one of the basic concerns it purports to address.  Additionally, it fails to set out how \"success\" would be measured, apparently seeking only some undefined reduction in cormorant population while simultaneously claiming expected \"neutral\" environmental consequences.  It can only be concluded that the proposal appears to punitive, rather than mitigative, and that success would likely be based on public opinion, not on scientific results.\nFor the reasons stated, the Ministry of Natural Resources should reject its proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants.\n",

I find  egregious the arguments listed in your proposal supporting the hunt.  Have we learned nothing in the past hundred years about how swiftly a species can be decimated? The cormorant itself was once endangered but thanks to judicious management has made a recovery. Now we are staying that there are too many?  What is to prevent their numbers from plummeting again in the future, particularly in light of your proposed control  measures?  You are supporting this hunt based on the needs and wants of the commercial and recreational fishing 'industry', not on any other considerations.  Shame on you for even considering this. Shame on you for viewing OUR wildlife as something to be slaughtered on a whim.\n",

It is disappointing that you are stepping into the sphere of giving in to people who do this.\nThere is no good reason for such a cruel cull of these birds.  In fact, what is proposed is simply a slaughter, since these birds will be \"sitting ducks\" on their nests on the ground or in the trees.  More guns out there for longer periods if time.

I am not sure of the over abundance of these birds further north but I definitely do not see them coming anywhere near the populations of Canada Geese that are far and above the Cormorant population.\nDo you have statistics that show this bird as expanding its habitat or overpopulating so much so that we need to take this course of action, for a bird that we are just going to dispose of up to 50 carcasses per small game permit.\nThis sounds to me a little harsh to say the least.\nOur Canada Geese are a much larger problem on both sides of the border and we do not open a season to shoot and dispose of them.\nWhy should these birds be so harshly targeted?\nPlease Reconsider this action,\nM\n",

        "comment":"The \u201cProposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\u201d (ERO number 013-4124) is poorly conceived and is likely to do more harm than good.  It should be rejected.\nThere are circumstances under which it is appropriate for wildlife managers to cull double-crested cormorants, and current laws and regulations have allowed this culling to take place for many years now.  Much has been learned from these ongoing professionally managed efforts that has increased their effectiveness and decreased their collateral damage to other wildlife.  In contrast, this proposal (ERO number 013-4124) is to tell hordes of amateurs to blast away with shotguns into multi-species nesting sites.  The potential for unintended harm is very high and there is unlikely to be any benefit.  The lack of benefit is obvious from the fact that the proposed amateur shotgun barrage is being promoted as being \u201cenvironmentally neutral\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d.  The proposal (ERO number 013-4124) is to have a perpetual amateur shotgun barrage that at best would be futile, but more likely will cause many types of collateral damage.\nTranslated from bureaucratese into English, this proposal (ERO number 013-4124) says:\nSome people are asking the government of Ontario to change the law so they can shoot large numbers of cormorants.  The government of Ontario does not know if this is \u201cneeded\u201d.  All the government knows is that it does not want to be involved.  The government of Ontario is of the opinion that large numbers of cormorants could be shot perpetually without making any real difference (i.e., is \u201cenvironmentally neutral\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d).  So, what possible harm can there be from turning hordes of amateurs loose on public lands and telling them to blast away with shotguns?  Since the government of Ontario shockingly fails to see any potential difficulties, it is willing to substantially weaken game laws and the Migratory Bird Treaty \u201cjust to see what happens\u201d.\nPlease reject this proposal (ERO number 013-4124).\nDetailed comments\/concerns:\nThe format below is a quote from the environmental registry listing (ERO number 013-4124) followed by the comment\/concern.\n1) Ontario MNRF: \u201cComment period November 19, 2018 - January 3, 2019 (45 days)\u201d\nI think that scheduling the comment period over the Christmas\/New Year\u2019s period has substantially weakened the quality of the public consultation.\n2) Ontario MNRF: \u201cWe are proposing to list the double-crested cormorant as a game bird\u201d\nAs a member of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, I object to this proposal in that it substantially weakens both the current meaning and public understanding of what a game bird is.  The bureaucratic meaning of a game bird, i.e. \u201ca bird that is covered under game laws\u201d is a tautology and is effectively meaningless.  In the mind of sportsmen, a game bird is a bird that is hunted for food or sport.  Most hunters feel that it is unethical to kill just for \u201csport\u201d, and as a result ALL of the several dozen species of birds currently covered under \u201cMigratory Birds Hunting Regulations\u201d are hunted for food (i.e., it is illegal to allow the meat to spoil).  The double-crested cormorant does not belong on that list, and is so different from the birds currently on the list that its addition to the list would weaken the significance of what a \u201cgame bird\u201d is.\n\tEven if the double-crested cormorant is being hunted just for \u201csport\u201d, just how \u201csporting\u201d is it to pull up in a boat and blast 50 double-crested cormorants off of their nests?  As a sportsman, I am insulted that the Ontario MNRF is proposing that this be considered \u201csporting\u201d.  I am concerned that if this proposal is adopted, that the public\u2019s opinion of hunters will be greatly diminished and that public approval of hunting will decrease.\n3) Ontario MNRF: \u201cthe latest information indicating Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly\u201d\nConsidering the nature of the proposal, this is a pretty big \u201cor\u201d to leave sitting without documentation.  Before making major changes to game laws and Migratory Bird Treaties that could have amateurs blowing birds off of their nests with shotguns, maybe it would be a good idea to know which \u201cor\u201d it is.  Was this \u201cor\u201d assessment made before or after the news that a disease outbreak has hit the largest cormorant colony?\nSee:  https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/cormorants-toronto-disease-1.479\u2026\nBefore making major changes to the laws, it would be a good idea to have a professional assessment of population levels and population trends (including the disease outbreak).  If the proposal is to \u201cmanage\u201d double-crested cormorants as \u201cgame birds\u201d, it would be a good idea to know what the management targets are.  Turning amateurs loose to blast away with shotguns without first knowing what those targets are would be pretty stupid.  (But that is what \u201cERO number 013-4124\u201d proposes.)\n4) Ontario MNRF: \u201cThere continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.  To respond to these concerns, the Ministry is proposing\u2026..\u201d\nThis is pretty appalling.  As written, it says that if someone wants to shoot something they can ask the Ministry, and since the Ministry lacks the resources to develop its own data, opinions, and responses that the Ministry acquiesces and proposes to change the law.\nI am very disappointed in the lack of information from the Ministry.  I would like to think that the professionals at the Ministry have information with respect to double-crested cormorant population levels and environmental impacts.  If it has that information it should have been part of this proposal (along with population target levels, and an assessment of the best way to get to those levels).  If the Ministry lacks this information, it has no basis for trying to manage double-crested cormorant population levels, and even less basis to suggest that the best management response is hordes of amateurs blasting away with shotguns.\n\tAnother major deficiency in this proposal is what is commonly called \u201ca review of best management practices\u201d.   Have double-crested cormorants been culled in the past?  What worked?  What didn\u2019t?  What was most cost effective?  What caused the least amount of collateral damage?\n\tMissing from this proposal was the fact that private land owners can already \u201ccull\u201d cormorants on their property if they are causing property damage.\n\tAnd on public lands, double-crested cormorants have been managed by culls for years.  For example, Middle Island:\nhttps:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/windsor\/cormorant-culls-stabilizing-midd\u2026\nThere is probably a lot that can be learned from this multi-year ongoing management, but I am concerned that since that type of information should have been included in this proposal (and wasn\u2019t), that the Ministry jumped straight from \u201cconcerns expressed by some groups\u201d to a 50 a day shotgun season without considering what are probably better alternatives.\nThe coverage of the Middle Island culling seems to indicate that the best approach has been professional sharp-shooters using \u201cmuffled\u201d guns to avoid disruption to the other species present.  The absence of this information from the Proposal suggests the Ministry is being way too cavalier with respect to impacts to other species.  This is turn casts doubt on the Ministry\u2019s unsupported \u201cexpectation\u201d that untrained amateurs blasting away with shotguns in multi-species nesting colonies will have a \u201cneutral\u201d effect on the environment.\n5) Ontario MNRF: \u201cList the double-crested cormorant as a \u201cGame Bird\u201d.  Hunters would be required to have an outdoors card and small game licence to hunt double-crested cormorants, similar to other species of game birds.\u201d\nDouble-crested cormorants are NOT \u201csimilar to other species of game birds\u201d.  ALL of the dozens of species of game birds currently covered under \u201cMigratory Birds Hunting Regulations\u201d are hunted for food.  Double-crested cormorants are uniquely dis-similar to all existing species of game birds.  Attempting to license their hunting and manage them within a group of species that they do not belong in is likely to cause more problems that it (probably won\u2019t) solve.\n6) Ontario MNRF:  \u201cCreate an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to December 31 each year across the province.\u201d\nAnother serious deficiency in this proposal is that it fails to consider alternatives.  Considering that this is clearly a poorly planned experiment, why roll it out province wide?  Certainly there are major budget constraints on the MNRF.  Why not just have a test roll-out limited to a small area of the province where the \u201cproblem\u201d is perceived to be the worst?  Even better, divide the \u201cproblem area\u201d in half and only have the amateur shotgun barrage in one half.  Then monitor the whole area and see if the amateur shotgun barrage made any difference.\nOne obvious problem with the province-wide roll out has to do with enforcement.  I grew up in Texas, but it is Ontario that is REALLY BIG.  Currently there are not enough Conservation Officers (COs) to adequately police the existing game laws.  (I rarely even see a CO.)  Adding a new province-wide, 290 day shooting season will only make matters significantly worse.\nThe few COs there are have to lean on any crutches they can to keep the enforcement \u201cstanding\u201d.  One of the few advantages of under existing game laws is that shooting seasons are short, and outside of these seasons if COs see someone swinging a shotgun it is a good time to ask some questions.  The Proposal is to allow shooting province wide for the vast majority of the year.  Effective enforcement of this greatly expanded 4-dimensional volume of time and space is likely to be very expensive.  How much will this cost, and why is there no mention of budgetary concerns under \u201cRegulatory Impact Statement\u201d?  This seems out of step with the current government\u2019s calls for budgetary restraint.\n7) Ontario MNRF:  \u201cEstablish a bag limit of 50 cormorants\/day with no possession limit.\u201d\nThe obvious question is: Why 50?  And since these birds aren\u2019t going to be kept for food, why an unlimited possession limit?  If the Ministry is aware of some reason to stockpile double-crested cormorant carcasses, then that information should be part of the Proposal.  But again, what principles of sound game management did the Ministry use to arrive at the number 50?  To have this number have any meaning there should have been some consideration of population levels, population targets, number of likely shooters, and average number of days per shooter per season.  If it had any of this information it should have been in this proposal.  Its absence suggests that this number was produced by pulling it out of where?\u2026.The Ministry should not charge ahead in this vacuum of information.\n8) Ontario MNRF:  \u201cThis would include use of shotguns that are not larger than 10 gauge, that cannot hold more than three shells and use non-toxic shot as described in the migratory bird regulations.\u201d\nConsidering the limited resources of the Ontario MNRF, the ability of COs to make sure all of the shotgun shells being used to kill 50 cormorants a day are non-toxic is probably quite limited.  If you are headed out to blast your way through 50 cormorants you may not be as careful about your shotgun shell selection as you would be if you were targeting an actual game bird (i.e., one that you intended to eat).  It is likely lead shot discharged near waterways will increase, and that lead poisoning of non-target birds (e.g., loons) picking up the shot for their gizzards will increase.  This further calls into question the rational basis for the Ministry\u2019s expectation that the environmental effects would be \u201cneutral\u201d.\n9) Ontario MNRF:  \u201cAllow hunting from a stationary motorboat.\u201d\nIf shooting from a motorboat is considered \u201croutine\u201d as a current practice, then why is it necessary to make a specific regulatory change to allow shooting of cormorants from stationary motorboats?  Why the lack of specificity about what counts as \u201cstationary\u201d?  Is a boat swinging on one anchor \u201cstationary\u201d?  Will there be additions to the hunter education course covering requirements for \u201cstationary anchoring\u201d for the purposes of cormorant shooting?  How many shooters will be allowed in a boat?  How does that vary with boat size?  Even if there is only one shooter per boat, how many other people can be in the boat with the shooter?  Should they lay flat in the bottom of the boat?  Will there be age restrictions for who can be in a boat while cormorant shooting?  What special education should be considered for compensating for boat swing while also swinging a shotgun on a flying bird? How long will it take to develop the educational materials?  How will they be distributed? For people who have already completed hunter education, will they need to take remedial education in \u201ccormorant boat anchoring and shooting\u201d?  How much will this cost?\nThe low draft boats that will probably be needed to get shotgun shooters within range of cormorant nesting colonies are likely to be small and not the most stable of shooting platforms.  Shooting from them SAFELY is probably not for beginners.  This Proposal has no restrictions (e.g., age restrictions).  Since the Ontario MNRF is considering promoting this as wholesome family fun, it needs to seriously consider making sure the required education is rolled out before the season is opened.  Since it is already mid-December 2018, I seriously doubt this can be accomplished by March 15, 2019 (the proposed start of the season).\nIt would be tragic if some young hunter \u201cDick Cheney\u2019ed\u201d his little sister because the \u201ccormorant boat hunting season\u201d was rushed through without due consideration about safety and hunter education.  Doubly tragic would be the fact that the MNRF legalized the tragedy even when its \u201cexpectation\u201d is that cormorant boat shotgun blasting is a meaningless activity (i.e., \u201csustainable\u201d and with \u201cneutral\u201d environmental impact).\n10) Ontario MNRF:  \u201cVia this posting, the Ministry is also consulting on a proposal to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to add provisions so hunters could allow cormorant to spoil. This proposal would add provisions to the Act, so that persons who lawfully hunt (or possess) cormorants could be exempt from this requirement and would be subject to conditions that require the person to retrieve and dispose of the carcass. Should this proposal proceed, it may be accompanied by regulations to implement the exemption and requirements.\u201d\n\u201cis also consulting\u201d\u2026\u201dcould\u201d\u2026\u201dcould\u201d \u2026 \u201cmay be\u201d\nThe core of this proposal lacks any information that justifies bringing it forward.  It fails to consider alternatives that have been tested for years and are far superior.  And late in the proposal is added that the MNRF really isn\u2019t even sure about what the proposal should be and throws out a few more \u201ccoulds\u201d and a \u201cmaybe\u201d.  This is all in support of regulations that it hopes to have up and running three months from now.\nThis public consultation is a farce, in part because the Ministry clearly has not yet decided what it is proposing.  It needs to stop this consultation, go back to the drawing board, make some effort to gather some facts, think about what it really wants to accomplish, consider \u201cbest management practices\u201d and alternatives, decide what it really wants to propose, and then return with a real proposal.\nSince I doubt this will happen\u2026.\nAgain, this \u201ccould\/maybe\u201d part of the proposal highlights why the double-crested cormorant is simply NOT a game bird like ALL of the game birds currently covered under the \u201cMigratory Birds Hunting Regulations\u201d.  In 100 years (or more) of migratory bird game regulations it has NEVER been necessary to make an exemption to allow a game bird \u201cto spoil\u201d (i.e. throw it away).  Making this exemption dramatically weakens the Migratory Birds Hunting Regulations, and in my opinion will lower the public\u2019s perception of \u201chunters\u201d and \u201chunting\u201d if this proposal goes through.  Lets face it, blasting 50 cormorants off of their nests is not \u201chunting\u201d, it is \u201ctarget shooting\u201d live birds on their nests.  I think it will repulse far more people than it attracts.\nBut since this is, in theory, a real proposal that is to be implemented soon\u2026.\nThe \u201cexemption\u201d is to allow \u201chunters\u201d(sic) to allow the \u201cgame\u201d to spoil if they retrieve the carcasses of the cormorants they shoot.  Why retrieve just the cormorants?  If you use a shotgun to scatter shot at least 50 times into a nesting colony that almost always has a mixture of species in it, you are not going to kill just double-crested cormorants.  You should be required to retrieve everything that you killed so that the level of \u201cby-catch\u201d can be evaluated.\nWhile the \u201cmaybe\u201d exemption would allow the proposed \u201cgame\u201d to spoil, it does not say what will be done with all of the carcasses.  Perhaps all of the species shot should be taken to nearest MNR office for proper identification, so that the Ministry can \u201cassess the impacts of the hunting season and to adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns about population sustainability\u201d.  Proper identification is needed because the mixture of species killed will include some species in need of expert identification.  It is likely that some of the cormorants shot will be provincially rare Neotropic cormorants (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) which can be difficult for the general public to distinguish from the congeneric double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus).\nA side benefit of delivering all of the carcasses to the MNRF is that the MNRF could then be responsible for proper disposal of all of the carcasses.  Certainly the MNRF has already sourced appropriate disposal facilities, since it intends to open \u201chunting\u201d (sic) very soon.\n11) Ontario MNRF:  \u201cTo accompany the proposed hunting seasons, the Ministry will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends. Monitoring of cormorants will allow the Ministry to assess the impacts of the hunting season and to adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns about population sustainability.\u201d\nThis is clearly cart before the horse.\nIf double-crested cormorants were actually thought to be a problem, monitoring of them should have been step one.  Step two would be to study putative negative environmental impacts.  Step three would be to see if any of these environmental impacts correlated with population levels.  If this was found to be the case then the next step would be to consider management options (e.g., see the discussion above regarding alternatives and best management practices).  Then the best alternative would have been put forward in this proposal.\nThis logical process was bypassed for the half-baked proposal here (ERO number 013-4124).\nAbout the only positive thing that can be said about the Proposal (ERO number 013-4124) is that the process has been fairly transparent.  That is not due to any commitment to open government, but rather because there is so little content in the proposal that what actually happened shows through.  Since the \u201cProposal DETAILS\u201d (sic) are only a page long, there is no hiding what actually happened:\n12) Ontario MNRF: \u201cThere continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.  To respond to these concerns, the Ministry is proposing to create a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario. This new population management tool would allow persons who hold a small game licence to hunt these birds.\u201d\nThis is incredibly poor public policy and has led to a really poor proposal (lacking both \u201cdetails\u201d and any supporting evidence).\n\u201cThis new population management tool\u201d is a rather fancy term for the \u201cproposal\u201d, which is simply to turn hordes of amateurs loose on the landscape to blast away with shotguns.\nThe best thing to do now would be to scrap this proposal, and start the process over following the logical steps above.\nThe next best thing would be to scrap the proposal, skip gathering evidence (take for a given some culling is needed) but at least take a \u201cbest management practices\u201d approach and study cormorant control measures that have been in progress for years.  Under what circumstances is culling needed?  Are there specific areas that need attention?  Where are they? What works best?  How do you minimize collateral damage?\nBut it seems the government is hell bent on ignoring all that has been learned and proceed full speed with a \u201cplan\u201d that has been fabricated out of nothing.\nIf it is insistent on proceeding, the least thing it could do is at least postpone the proposal for a year (until 2020).  Please at least consider taking a year of monitoring data so that there will be a \u201cbefore\u201d to compare with the \u201cafter\u201d when the season opens.\n13)  Ontario MNRF: \u201cHunters will continue to be reminded to properly identify their targets to avoid conflicts with migratory game birds and other waterbirds. Monitoring of cormorant populations will allow adjustments in cormorant hunting regulations as necessary.\u201d\nWhen trying to find the correct word to describe these \u201cProposal DETAILS\u201d (sic), the best word seems to be \u201cdisingenuous\u201d.\nAll types of claims and promises about the \u201cnew population management tool\u201d are made without absolutely NO DETAILS.\nAgain, it is now mid December 2018 and the Ontario government proposes turning hordes of amateurs loose on public lands in just three months to blast away with shotguns.  In what are supposed to be \u201cProposal DETAILS\u201d, it is far short of adequate to simply say there will be \u201chunter\u201d (sic) education while providing no details about what that education will be.\nThis \u201cdetailed proposal\u201d fails to mention that there are two species of cormorants in Ontario that are difficult to distinguish rapidly and accurately while sighting over a shotgun.  Considering the proposed amateur shotgun fusillade is only three months away, real \u201cproposal details\u201d would include information about how to avoid killing non-target species while blasting away in nesting colonies containing mixed species of birds.  It would also explain IN DETAIL how it intends to roll out the appropriate \u201cHunter\u201d (sic) education before it opens the season.\nThe absence of these details is in part due to the ill-conceived and rushed nature of the \u201cproposal\u201d, but more importantly it is unlikely that a \u201cdetailed proposal\u201d could ever be produced and be credible because if you actually examine this proposal in detail it is incredibly stupid.\nLikewise, it is disingenuous when the \u201cproposal details\u201d assert that there will be \u201cmonitoring of cormorant pollutions\u201d without any \u201cdetail\u201d.  What will be this monitoring be?  What is the budget for the monitoring program?  Where are the results of the monitoring that has taken place?  Why are you proposing to turn hordes of amateurs loose on public lands to blast away at mixed species nesting colonies with shotguns without doing the monitoring first?\n14) Ontario MNRF:  \u201cThe anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral. The double-crested cormorant is abundant in Ontario and anticipated levels of harvest aren\u2019t expected to affect sustainability.\u201d\nThis is a pretty concise summary of the stupidity and futility of this \u201cdetailed proposal\u201d.  The government of Ontario has absolutely no idea how many amateurs will choose to blast away at mixed-species nesting colonies with shotguns.\nIf the number is large, it would irresponsible for the MNRF to imply that it has any factual basis to suggest that the effects of the amateur shotgun barrage would be \u201cenvironmentally neutral\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d.  It is simply not credible to simply assert that hordes of amateurs blasting away at mixed species nesting colonies will not cause significant collateral damage.  Even in the extremely unlikely event that the MNRF\u2019s nonexistent \u201chunter\u201d education program is successful and the MNRF\u2019s nonexistent monitoring program documents that the collateral damage is \u201ctolerable\u201d (according to the MNRFs nonexistent standards), and that double-crested cormorant levels were to be reduced to levels deemed to satisfy the MNRFs nonexistent targets, then the \u201chunt\u201d levels would have to be reduced (because they would NOT be \u201csustainable\u201d).\nIf the number is small, the adverse impacts might be \u201ctolerable\u201d, but in that case it is extremely unlikely that the amateur shotgun barrage will have any significant effects on double-crested cormorant population levels.  So, in that case the Ontario MNRF is proposing to alter and weaken many \u201cgame\u201d laws simply to legalize random acts of senseless animal cruelty.\nIn conclusion:\nThe \u201cProposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\u201d (ERO number 013-4124) is poorly conceived and is likely to do more harm than good.  It should be rejected.\n",

        "comment":"I have significant objections regarding the proposal to open a season on double crested cormorants. My objections center around my experiences as someone who loves the outdoors and also as a hunter.\nI object strongly to the term of the proposal in that it suggests opening up a \"hunting season\" for the birds. As a hunter, I firmly believe in the basic concept that we do not hunt or kill anything that we don't intend to use and we would never shoot a bird without the intent to consume the meat that each animal provides. There is absolutely no way that a random killing of up to 50 birds that are largely considered to be inedible could be considered a \"hunt\". This is at best a cull and it should be named such as there is no way that I would consider such pointless killing to be anything related to the proper and respectful tradition of hunting. I find this suggestion to be deeply offensive.\nI also have serious reservations about the timing of the hunt placing it directly in conflict with tourists and recreational campers, boaters, fisherman etc who will be sharing the wilderness and waterways with people armed with guns who will be shooting at birds in the same areas inhabited by unarmed people. I just don't see how anyone could think this was a good idea and this would clearly be a recipe for disaster. I can't think of anyone who would be excited at the thought that they would have to consistently be concerned about encountering armed individuals all summer long at their cottages, homes and in their boats.\nI also fear that many non target species are going to be negatively affected by the disruption caused by gunfire on nesting grounds and in an environment shared by so many other birds that will have their nesting habits disturbed or possibly be hit by accident during the shooting.\nFinally, I strongly question the logic behind the cull in that I am under absolutely no illusion that this cull will have any noticeable affect on fish stocks in any of the Great Lakes or waterways in the province. With climate change, habitat loss and invasive species all impacting our fisheries in a major way, killing cormorants seems to be a pretty simplistic way to appease those who want real action to preserve our important fishery without actually making any of the harder but necessary management decisions that would certainly be a little more controversial but ultimately be the correct ones that would have a real impact.\nI ask that you reverse this decision and look for other less violent means of managing the population of cormorants in Ontario.\n",

I particularly do not think that virtually unrestricted hunting by the public is any sort of solution to a non-problem.

        "comment":"I have serious concerns about the details of the proposed hunting season for Double Crested Cormorant in Ontario.\n1) This proposal is clearly aimed at serious reduction in the population of this species. Possible reasons for this seem to be:\n     a) Aesthetics: Some people do not like to see large populations of \"ugly\" animals. This seems to be a poor reason for wholesale killing of a native species.\n     b) Shoreline forest damage: It is hard to imagine that D.C. Cormorants do more damage to shoreline wooded areas than logging or human development. Indeed, the proposal for this hunt describes the environmental impacts of the hunt as \"neutral\", strongly implying that no positive benefit will result. In addition, colonial ground nesting sea birds such as gulls and terns can benefit from generation of treeless areas of shoreline or treeless islands.\n     c) Protection of fish populations: Clearly D.C. Cormorants eat fish, and lots of them. A large and stable or growing population of these birds could not exist if there were not a huge population of fish to support them.  So the question becomes \"which fish are to be protected?\" This cannot be legal sized game fish, as these are far too large. The primary game fish in Lake Ontario are introduced, non-native salmon, and D.C. Cormorants might eat immature stocked salmon or forage fish that they depend upon. As the primary predators of small fish are larger fish, consumption of forage fish or immature game fish may or may not be an issue. Additionally, one of the most important forage fish in Lake Ontario is the non-native Alewife. It seems wrong to try to eliminate the D.C. Cormorant, a once extirpated native species, to benefit artificially introduced non-native game species, primarily to benefit wealthy anglers who can afford the boats and gear required to fish for salmon. Indeed, D.C. Cormorants have been shown to be major predators of Round Gobies, an invasive species in the Great Lakes that itself reduces game fish populations.\n2) Unintended Harm:\n     a) Nesting disturbance of other birds: The proposal allows hunting near nesting colonies throughout the breeding season. Many if not most colonial waterbird colonies are mixed in species, including some that are of concern. It is likely that frequent, nearly unlimited gun hunting from the water near such colonies will result in stress and lack of breeding success to non-target species, an issue not raised in the proposal.\n     b) Human distress: It seems reasonable that visits to natural areas such as Cootes Paradise, Hamilton Harbour, Tommy Thompson Park, Pres'Ilse, etc. will be discouraged if non-consumptive visitors are presented with the possibility of witnessing the nearby slaughter of wild animals.\n3) Ethical Issues:\n      a) Undue suffering: Killing of large numbers of adult birds during the breeding season will result in the death by starvation, overheating or exposure for multitudes of growing chicks.\n      b) Waste of meat plus shoreline pollution; This proposal allows wholesale slaughter (50 birds per day, no possession limit, per hunter for several months) without a requirement for the use of the meat or proper disposal of the carcasses. Birds will be hurled back into the lake to wash up onto shorelines to rot. This is simply wrong, as well as distasteful both ethically and aesthetically.\n      c) Discreditation of ethical sport huntin: Most importantly, those who participate in this hunt will be or appear to be involved soley for the pleasure of killing large numbers of animals for pure sport. As the environmental impacts of the hunt are \"neutral\", they will not even be able to reasonably claim that they are improving the environment for any practical reaon, other than possibly increasing the number of contaminated trophy salmon available to wealthy fishermen.\nIn summary, while I have no problem with including Double Crested Cormorants in a legal hunt following guidelines similar to those involved in other watewrfowl hunting (not during breeding season, requirements for the use of meat), I am totally opposed to the present proposal for the reasons cited.\nThank you for considering this comment.\n",

        "comment":"Re the Double-crested Cormorant Slaughter\nThe return of cormorants, a native wildlife species, to the Great Lakes Basin is part of a natural process and should be celebrated. Cormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial, non-forage species. The presence of cormorants benefits other colonial water birds, such as federally protected herons, egrets and pelicans, all of which are stable or growing populations where cormorants are found.\nThe mass killing of cormorants will force other bird species to vacate the colony sites they share. It will also create very real safety issues if hunters are permitted to discharge firearms throughout the spring, summer, and fall seasons when lakes and natural areas are populated by cottagers and tourists.\nThe mass killing being proposed by the Ontario government is a political response to anecdotes, unsubstantiated claims and complaints by a small group of radical fishermen, supported by special interest groups. There is no substantive body of scientific evidence supporting their position. Instead of making cormorants a scapegoat for environmental problems they have nothing to do with, attention should be given to addressing the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, over-fishing and a broad range of other issues.\nI oppose the mass killing of cormorants as an unnecessary, outdated,  environmentally damaging, and cruel proposal.\n",

I believe the effectiveness of the program however is almost completely dependent upon the rules to be set about disposing of dead cormorants. If hunters are going to be required to retrieve, bag and dispose of the dead birds [ how and where? ] the program will probably fail. I for one would be prepared to help cull these offensive birds, but I wouldn't want to transport carcasses in my fishing boat.\nThe cormorants certainly detrimentally effect our fisheries, but on top of that they are filthy, smelly birds whose excrement kills almost everything it touches. While in Cape Breton Island a local small sailboat cruise operator showed everyone aboard pictures of pristine islands once in the lake, and how today the islands were either completely gone or 1\/4 their previous size because the toxic cormorant excrement had killed all the vegetation and broken down the limestone and coral islands so they washed away.\nI hope this proposal goes forward very quickly, but I also hope that many other options are being considered, like oiling cormorant eggs, and maybe even baiting some cormorants [ if that can be done without harming other wildlife.] I have read newspaper articles about this proposal and some of the weak arguments against it.

And while their droppings can kill their nesting trees, the nutrient-rich guano will lead to a new round of healthy plant and animal life.  As for the fact that they are 'eating all the fish', they do eat fish, but only 2% of their diet consists of commercially valuable species, and they actually eat invasive fish species.The mass killing of cormorants will not be beneficial.\nIf you in fact, proceed with the process of killing them you willl force other bird species to vacate the colony sites they share.\nCormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial, non-forage species.  It is the commercial fisheries in Lake Erie and other lakes that are depleting fish populations, not cormorants!! The mass killing being proposed by the Ontario government is a political response to anecdotes, unsubstantiated claims and complaints by a small group of radical fishermen, supported by special interest groups. There is no substantive body of scientific evidence supporting their position. Instead of making cormorants a scapegoat for environmental problems they have nothing to do with, attention should be given to addressing the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, over-fishing and a broad range of other issues.\nThe proposed designation of cormorants as game animals, along with a non-utilization exemption that allows the carcasses to rot should be an affront to every hunter who believes in sportsmanship, fair chase and ethics.\nYou must  reconsider.\nThis is the worst policy to date that this government has implemented.\n",

I am a cottager in Ontario and Double crested cormorants nest on tiny islands on my lake.  To allow someone to sit in a boat and shoot at these birds during the summer months when so many people are on the lake is an accident waiting to happen.  You cannot allow hunters with guns out on the lake while others are swimming, water skiing, canoeing, etc.  This proposal is blatantly irresponsible!!\n2.  You say there continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\nas a result of those concerns, you are responding with this proposal.\nMy question is:  Where is the science to support the claims that Double crested cormorants are detrimental to fish stocks?  In fact, Double-crested cormorants are native Ontario birds that have repopulated parts of their former range and fulfill a valuable ecological role. Not only do they benefit biodiversity, they help generate healthy fish populations and should be considered a integral component of Ontario\u2019s natural heritage.  According to the Canadian Wildlife Service, only 2% of their diet consists of commercially valuable fish and they actually eat invasive fish species.  While their droppings can kill their nesting trees, the nutrient-rich guano leads to a new round of healthy plant and animal life.\nUnder the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, property owners may harass, capture or kill wildlife that is causing or is about to cause damage to their property.  Property owners have the right to deal with problems as needed.  The province does not need to declare 'open season' to help property owners.\n3.  You are proposing to list the double-crested cormorant as a \u201cGame Bird\".  If this is a game bird then why is the Ministry also consulting on a proposal to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to add provisions so hunters could allow cormorant to spoil.  How is it considered a game bird if no one is eating them?\n4.  You are proposing an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to December 31 each year across the province with a bag limit of 50 cormorants\/day with no possession limit.  That means each hunter could kill over 14,000 birds per year.  And with no means to track volume as the birds will be left to spoil, any hunter could kill more than that. This essentially adds up to a province-wide cull of this species.\nThank you for considering my comments.\n",

Open season for ten months of the year with up to 50 birds per day allowed to be killed! The season fully encompasses breeding season and offers no protections. The greatest audacity, however, involves the peculiar characteristics of this bird. This is not a game bird! It is virtually inedible! It poses no threat to the fishing industry as it does not consume the fish harvested for human consumption. Those who shoot this bird will not bother with safe disposal of carcasses. They will be left to rot in place - posing a far greater danger to the environment and waters.

        "comment":"I am concerned about the current proposal to establish a hunting season for the Double-crested Cormorant in Ontario. As a birder and someone who has studies avian conservation I feel the current proposal is flawed and has the potential to create great harm to the current population of Double-crested Cormorants.\nBird Studies Canada, an organization I trust, has outlined very clearly the many issues with the current proposal:\nThe following is a summary of the major concerns noted by BSC regarding the proposal:\n(1)   Lack of scientific credibility and justification\nThe proposal fails to demonstrate a sound scientific basis for the need for the hunt, lacking any detailed information about the species\u2019 population size.\nThe proposal\u2019s policy rationale indicates that the species\u2019 population is stable or declining, decreasing MNRF\u2019s justification for the hunt.\nThe proposal fails to address the potential impact of the hunt on the population of Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario, or the potential impact on other wildlife species which could be affected.\nThe proposal fails to adopt an ecosystem-based approach to wildlife population assessments and management, a key consideration for a species with such complex interactions with aquatic and terrestrial species and habitats. Among other things, it fails to describe a population management objective (population target) provincially or regionally. Nor does it describe a timeframe over which the proposal would be in place. Although it proposes a program to monitor cormorant population and trends in Ontario, it would be some years before any such program could provide solid estimates, leaving the first few years essentially unmonitored.\n(2)   Inconsistencies with standard norms for hunting and Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act principles\nThe proposed hunt is inconsistent with every tenet of wildlife management and hunting ethic, including failure to protect wildlife during the breeding season and permission to allow game meats to spoil. This proposed divergence from norms highlights the fact that this is not sport hunting by any standard definition, but is rather a broad-scale and largely unregulated cull \u2013 reminiscent of unchecked \u201cmarket hunting,\u201d which modern bird hunting regulations were designed to correct.\nThe proposed exemption to the requirement to protect against meat spoilage, coupled with a failure to retrieve or even report carcasses, renders population monitoring and enforcement effectively impossible, which could rapidly lead to large-scale mortality with population level impacts.\nThe hunting of Double-crested Cormorants during the breeding season is again inconsistent with wildlife management and hunting principles and ethics; such hunting will inevitably lead to failure of nests and starvation of chicks, which are issues of concern relating to both population management and to inhumane treatment to wildlife.\nThe proposed open season from March 15 to December 31 each year represents the entire duration of the species\u2019 natural annual occurrence in Ontario \u2013 effectively resulting in no meaningful closed season in the province.\n(3)   Impact on Double-crested Cormorant populations, native biodiversity and ecosystems\nThe proposed bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no possession limit over a nine and a half month open season is exceptionally high, unsustainable, and without precedent under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for its failure to address the need for population sustainability. It is not unlikely that such a level of hunting would lead to local and\/or regional extirpations, as well as reduction provincially to token remnant populations. The likelihood that this proposal would have only a \u2018neutral\u2019 impact is baseless.\nThe proposal allows for shooting of Double-crested Cormorants on breeding colonies which could lead to mortality of other colonial waterbird species which often nest in close association, such as Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, and Black-crowned Night Herons.\nDisturbance by hunters will disrupt other wildlife nesting in and near Double-crested Cormorant colonies, including the above-noted heron family members, as well as other species such as Caspian Terns, Common Terns, and Great Black-backed Gulls.\nThe increased level of shooting over water could lead to an increase in toxic shot deposited in lakes and rivers since not all shooters may abide by the proposal\u2019s requirement for non-toxic shot.\n(4)   Public safety and enforcement of proposed changes\nThe proposal allows for unrestricted shooting in Ontario, both in terms of season and location, potentially permitting hunters to be in unsafe proximity to boaters, cottagers and other outdoor recreation enthusiasts. The lack of a closed season in spring and summer increases the public safety risk due to the overlaps of the open season with the peak of outdoor recreation.\nThe proposal to permit hunting from a motorboat increases risk for public safety, which is contrary to migratory bird hunting regulations.\nThe large scale of the proposed hunt, the permission to discard carcasses and let meat spoil, and the exceptionally long open season render the hunt (including the daily bag limit) unenforceable by conservation officers.\nThe proposal\u2019s broad scope and exceptionally high quotas would require intensive and greatly expanded enforcement, as well as greatly increased resources for population monitoring; such resources are not likely to be available at a time when public expenditures are being cut back.\nThe Ministry\u2019s intent not to provide additional opportunities for public comment, should the proposal proceed, is a concern for due process relating to Ontario legislation, regulations, and policies.\n",

There is no clear rationale for the proposal. \"Concerns expressed by some groups\" is not a rationale.\n2. There is no data supporting the supposed rationale.\n3. The proposal's description of the health of double-breasted cormorant populations is inconsistent.

        "comment":"I have several concerns about the proposal to create a hunting season for Double-crested cormorants (DCCO) in Ontario:\n- breeding season - can the OMNRF cite any other species (mammal or bird) that are allowed to be hunted during the time of year when they have young that are dependent on their parents for survival?  Can the OMNRF point to any other locations in Canada or elsewhere that allow a bird to be hunted during its breeding season?  I recognize that Ontario (and elsewhere) have had cormorant culls however I believe that this has typically been conducted by trained staff, not by creating an open hunting season.   Is the OMNRF concerned about the outcome to cormorant eggs\/young birds that are left orphaned in a nest when parents are shot or when parents abandon a colony due to the disturbance caused by the shooting and the disturbance caused by hunters roaming thru colonies retrieving shot birds?\n- impact on non-target species that nest in same locations as cormorants  - many species of birds utilize the island nesting locations favored by DCCO (colonial waterbirds such as gulls, terns, herons, egrets; songbirds; waterfowl; shorebirds). Has the OMNRF studied the negative impact that hunting DCCO will have on these other species of birds (some of whom are Species-at-Risk)? The impacts may include a bird being outright shot by a hunter (either on purpose or accidently by being in the wrong place at the wrong time), but will also include the impact of being disturbed during their breeding season (by the shots and by hunters wandering thru colonies retrieving their kills)  which may cause these non-target species to abandon their nests leading to reproductive failure for that year.\n- enforcement - does the OMNRF have the necessary resources\/personnel to enforce the current hunting regulations for animals in Ontario?  Does the OMNRF have the additional resources\/personnel that will be required to enforce the hunting regulations proposed for cormorants?  What is proposed is a very long hunting season (9.5 months) and since most of the hunting will occur offshore does the OMNRF intend to have enforcement officers out patrolling the Great Lakes and other inland lakes where hunting cormorants will occur?\n- monitoring - does the OMNRF have the necessary resources\/personnel to monitor the impacts of hunting cormorants in Ontario? How exactly will this monitoring be conducted? Will the OMNRF be instituting a survey of colony sites and colony sizes throughout Ontario (Great Lakes and inland lakes) to see where DCCO relocate too when they are disturbed from one colony location to another?  Does the OMNRF have data from 2018 that they will be able to use to see the impact if hunting begins in 2019? If \"no\" would it not make more sense to have a cormorant hunting season begin in 2020 and use 2019 to conduct the above mentioned field studies and gather baseline data on the colony sites and sizes of DCCO throughout Ontario?  Is the OMNRF concerned that one impact of hunting DCCO will be to displace them into urban nesting sites in southern Ontario (i.e. Toronto Harbour, Hamilton Harbour) where there are restrictions against discharging firearms and hence hunting will not be allowed to occur?  These urban areas are already having human\/cormorant conflicts as DCCO have begun nesting on shorelines (not just offshore islands) and hunting cormorants elsewhere in the province will lead to more DCCO nesting in these urban locations as they seek non-hunting areas.  Hunting DCCO in the Great Lakes may also have the impact of dispersing DCCO to more interior\/inland lake locations ... the same locations favoured by many Ontarians for their recreational opportunities (i.e. camping, cottages).\nIn conclusion I think that this proposal to allow hunting of cormorants is short sighted and has many negative impacts and will create many more problems than it will solve.   If the OMNRF is concerned about DCCO they should try to solve the problem themselves in specific locations rather than opening it up to the public by way of a province-wide 9.5 month hunting season.  If the decision has been made by the current provincial government to kill DCCO why not have a hunting period that matches the period when one is allowed to hunt waterfowl (ducks)? It would be easier to enforce and would not disturb non-target species during their breeding season.\n",

        "comment":"We are strongly opposed to the proposal to establish a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario. It is an unprecedented slaughter that has no place in modern times \u2013 rather it is a throwback to another century when, out of ignorance, entire species were annihilated.\nThe concern expressed by commercial fishing interests is not supported by science-based evidence. Through careful analysis, the Canadian Wildlife Service has repeatedly found that only 2% of Cormorant\u2019s diet consists of commercially valuable species. In fact, Cormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies. It is the commercial fisheries in Lake Erie and other lakes that are depleting fish populations, not Cormorants.\nCormorants are not overabundant in the Great Lakes. In fact, their numbers are modest, now stabilized and dropping in many areas.\nWith respect to the impact that Cormorants have on vegetation, we must keep in mind that these are natural processes, as colonial water birds, like other species, do impact their environment. This dynamic process is part of all ecosystems. In fact, on viewing the vegetation on islands in the Great Lakes, you can see this evolution. Although some trees die, the bird\u2019s nutrient-rich guano results in new plant and animal life. Just because it looks different, does not mean there is a problem, in fact this is normal, ecosystems are not static, they do change and evolve.\nInstead of making cormorants a scapegoat for environmental problems they have nothing to do with, attention should be given to addressing the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, over-fishing and a broad range of other issues.\nThe proposed \u201chunt\u201d will cause unimaginable cruelty by allowing the wholesale, uncontrolled slaughter of cormorants across the province, wounding adults and leaving young in the nests to suffer and die. It will be repugnant to the vast majority of Ontario residents and should not be the reputation the current Ontario Government wants as its legacy.\n",

        "comment":"I am a University Professor and teach Biodiversity Science and Conservation.  I am aware of the Cormorant population in this proposal.  I am writing to say that I find the proposal to be unacceptable from a scientific, social and moral perspective.\nScientifically, the Cormorant population has already begun to self-regulate through density-dependent feedback loops, and is not a threat to the ecosystem but a member of it.  Shooting the bird brings it below the natural carrying capacity and therefore encourages the same inherent population growth that led to its current size.\nSocially, this proposal encourages a misunderstanding in society that culls are needed to manage wildlife.  Second, it encourages a misunderstanding that humans have dominion over all other life. Third, it encourages an outmoded perspective that killing of life is fun.  From the extermination of the passenger pigeon through the decimation of bison, the concept that killing for fun is socially acceptable has justified actions that today we recognize as unacceptable.  In short, this proposal encourages a backward step in society's growth to understand our relationship with wildlife.\nMorally, this is a sentient animal and therefore deserving of a life without undue pain and suffering.  Harassment by hunters displacing it from feeding and breeding grounds;  wounding and death by shock, blood loss, drowning; abandonment of dependent offspring; loss of mates; and so forth are cruel and morally unacceptable actions and should not be promoted and not allowed in Ontario.\n",

I can understand the need to control these birds in very specific situations, but this proposal basically opens up these birds to mass slaughter. I have seen these birds on a remote northern lake where they are not bothering anyone. The idea of hunters coming in to kill these birds in mass throughout most of the  year is just not acceptable. I realize that the proposal speaks to monitoring of populations, but by the time it is recognized that there is a problem, it may well be too late. Unfortunately these birds are not appreciated by many people, and there is a risk that some would like to see them entirely wiped out. Since they tend to flock together in groups, and are large, they will be easy targets to those that would like to eliminate them. Please make changes to greatly shorten the proposed season, and to greatly reduce the daily bag limit. A limited season in the fall, with small bag limits would be better to ensure this species does not end up back on the endangered list. We need to treat all of our wildlife with respect and ensure long term sustainability, even for those creatures that are not always very popular or appreciated.\nThank you.\n",

Defining it as such, establishing a hunting season and generous bag limit, then having a special regulation change to allow waste of edible meat (although I've never heard of anyone attempting to eat a cormorant) is utter political nonsense that caters to special interest groups like Cormorant Defenders Int'l and the like. DCCO should be treated like the common crow, English sparrow, cowbird, common grackle, and other overly abundant non-native and native pest species - allow hunting year round and properly dispose of carcasses when required. I would agree that shooting with a shotgun using steel shot is the method to use, as the birds generally nest, roost , and migrate near and over water bodies. The use of rim fire rifles should also be allowed, especially in roosting and nesting areas, as the close distance required to shoot with a shotgun could cause undue disturbance to the nesting activities of other colonial nesting waterbirds (such as Great Blue Herons, Black Crowned Night Herons, etc.) which typically nest amongst DCCO.\n",

The view that awaited us was magnificent: a symphony of  foliage colours stretched across the horizon, framed by the reddening sky and the deep blue water.  And all around us, the ground was strewn with spent beer cans and shotgun shells.  Repulsed by that sickening aspect, and the vulgarity it introduced to this otherwise pristine environment, we left the site and hurried home, doing our best to erase that trip from our collective memory.\n    Allow this cormorant culling proposal, and add to this picture piles of dead and dying cormorants and their young.  And don't forget to include this picture in your Ontario tourists brochures, as it is certain to delight those in the angler-hunter community\u2014limitless booze, limitless live target practice\u2014those whom this proposal was meant to please; those, and scarcely anyone else.\n    But of course, this follows a familiar pattern: we allow abusive treatment of our resources\u2014over-fishing, in this case\u2014and then find a soft target on whom to blame the effect: wolves, seals, cormorants, and then proceed enthusiastically kill it too.   And how grotesque it is to cite local tree-damage as justification for this culling, when the damage inflicted by us on the environment is accelerating on a planetary scale and is so profound as to raise the spectre of a new epoch of mass extinction, with our very own existence in question.\n    That the cormorant happened to be jet black is very convenient, of course.  Like the crow and the grackle and the red winged blackbird and the starling (and the black cat, for that matter), the culturally nurtured human aversion to black birds, to some, will soften the edges around that vignette of the dead and wounded birds.  Would this happen if the cormorant sported a blue plumage, rather than black?  I rather doubt it.  And that vignette is redolent not of rotting fish, but of political lobbying.\n",

Today this bird species is our success story of cleaner waters. Today this bird is being threatened with an unwarranted slaughter that will also seriously imperil other colonial nesting water birds in Ontario.\nWhen I was a youth, I remember seeing pictures in the national media showing young Double Crested Cormorants with crossed bills. These young birds were from cormorant nests on the Lower Great Lakes.  This birth defect was the result of contamination of PCB\u2019s in the adult birds. The PCB\u2019s were bioaccumulated in the adults as a result of eating contaminated fish.  Some eggs never hatched because the egg shell was too thin because of DDT contamination. Their food, small fish, had acquired the pollutants that were found in high levels in our waters. As a result, many cormorants could not reproduce successfully in the Lower Great Lakes Basin.\nSimilar disturbing stories were happening with so many other important predatory bird species. Bald Eagles, Peregrine Falcons and Ospreys along with others all saw precipitous declines in their populations because of DDT contamination.\nThe cormorants and the other declining bird species were the \u201cCanary in the coal mine\u201d and did society a great favour by warning us of the dangers ahead. They were the early indicators that something terrible was happening to the environment with the introduction of long lasting pesticides and industrial pollutants like PCB\u2019s and DDT.\nIn 1962 Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring, a book forecasting the demise of species because of pesticides and industrial pollutants being released into the environment. Society has worked hard to correct our ways since then.\nFortunately today, especially in Hamilton, we are witnessing a comeback of many species that were on the brink of extirpation in our part of North America. Today there is one Bald Eagle nest in Cootes Paradise. There were 28 Bald Eagles overwintering in Hamilton Harbour last winter. There are three active Peregrine Falcon nests in Hamilton with the best known on the Sheraton Hotel. There are about 10 Osprey nests in the Hamilton area now. With this comeback we are seeing several hundred Double Crested Cormorants nesting in the Hamilton area.\nWhy, because the water quality of the Lower Greats Lakes has been tremendously improved by the elimination or significant reduction of DDT,  PCB\u2019s and other  pollutants in our waters.\nThe numbers of cormorants that we are seeing today is quite simply our success story.\nLegalizing a slaughter of Double Crested Cormorants in Ontario, as being proposed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, is not a way to celebrate.\nThe idea of shooting cormorants at their breeding colonies during the breeding season is absurd. I support hunting but I do not support an unnecessary slaughter. Double Crested Cormorants share their breeding colonies with many other colonial nesting birds like Common Terns, Caspian Terns, Black Crowned Herons and Great Egrets. Allowing shooting in the breeding colonies during the breeding season will have a horrendous disruptive effect on the other species let alone on the cormorants.\nIf Ontario wishes, for whatever reason, to open a hunting season on cormorants then let it fall within the dates of the fall Waterfowl season. The new regulation would allow for 50 birds per day to be shot from March 15 to December 15.  With no requirement to gather the birds there is absolutely no way of determining how many cormorants have actually been shot. Yes, many will die but the injured ones will languish and die slowly as nature takes it course.\nThe proposed regulation for the cormorant hunt would allow the hunters to allow the meat of the cormorants to spoil. No other game bird\u2019s meat is allowed to spoil.\nAs to animal cruelty, the proposed hunt is a recipe. I cannot imagine the number of young cormorants in nests that will be left alone to die of starvation and dehydration by the absence of shot adults and also the young of other bird species that nest in the colonies with parents that are forced to abandon their nests because of the shooting.\nYes, cormorants are in greater numbers than before. This is to be celebrated, as the \u201cCanary in the coal mine\u201d is telling us we have better water quality. There is no concrete evidence that cormorants are causing a decline in fish populations. They feed mostly on non-native fish like Alewives and Round Gobies. Yes, they also can feed on small game fish but so do we.\nIf anglers are really concerned about game fish success I suggest they steer their efforts to ongoing sedimentation flowing into our waterways, combined storm \/ sewage outflows, the high nutrient levels flowing out of sewage treatment plants and the fish gender changing pharmaceuticals in them.

Don\u2019t we all need our space. We\u2019ve all got to live.\nIn Florida, where so many Canadians travel to in the winter, breeding bird colonies of mostly white and pink birds are a tourist attraction and seeing Mangroves covered in white wash is an indication of a healthy bird colony and environment.

As a result, in 1927, Cootes Paradise was set aside as a wildlife sanctuary, providing a foothold for the Royal Botanical Gardens. 100 years later we do not want to see a retrograde step into the thinking of over 100 years ago with market hunting, bounties and slaughters of Buffalo and Passenger Pigeons and strychnine poisoning of predators.\n",

There is no scientific justification for this hunt. This wild native species has rebounded from historic lows in the 1970s and populations have been stable or declining since the 2000s.\nAccording to the Canadian Wildlife Service, cormorants are not competing with commercial fishers as they feed primarily on small, largely non-commercial, shallow-water fish. Only a small percentage of their diet consists of \u201csport fish.\u201d\nConcerned property owners already have recourse, under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, to harass, capture or kill cormorants if they\u2019re causing property damage.\nThe extreme bag limit allowing an individual to kill 50 birds a day for nine-and-a-half months of the year, including the breeding season, is without precedent and could cause significant harm to this and other native wildlife species.\nI urge you to abandon this ill-considered proposal.\n",

        "comment":"Comments of EBR Policy Proposal to Establish a Hunting Season for Double Crested Cormorants in Ontario.\nRegistry Number 013-4124\nI am appalled at what MNRF is proposing here and do not support the establishment of a hunting season for double crested cormorants!  Do not implement this in any part of the province!\nHere is what I see as playing out here.  MNRF is under pressure from certain groups to do something about double crested cormorant populations in specific locations in the province.  However, MNRF recognizes that this wildlife control issue will be very controversial and could cost a lot of money.  So rather than deal with this issue in a thoughtful manner, MNRF is trying to place move this issue onto the hunting community in order to insulate themselves from the controversy and possibly make some money. However, the long-term effects of this proposal could be devastating to hunting in Ontario.\nFirstly, the public optics on this proposal are quite simply awful!!!  Under the guise of \u201chunting\u201d lets kill a species that has no value for food and let the harvest spoil.  Any reasonable person would not find this proposal acceptable!  This will only add fuel to the \u201canti-hunting\u201d groups out there.  In addition, this could move people who don\u2019t hunt, but are not opposed to hunting at this point, to take an anti-hunting stance.  The overall result could be a further decline in hunting opportunities and participation in the future.  Your SPA revenues will subsequently decline.\nThis proposal is also inconsistent with the principles of Ontario\u2019s Heritage Hunting and Fishing Act. Shooting a species that can\u2019t be consumed and then allowing the carcasses to spoil does not support the concept of wise resource use that is part of Ontario\u2019s hunting heritage.  Why do you think that there is currently a provision in the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act that makes it unlawful to allow spoilage. This is because it is considered an unacceptable practice from both a wildlife management and ethical hunting perspective.\nThis proposal would also have the effect of degrading the value of this species as an ecosystem component.  Yes, this species is a problem in certain areas but it is still a part of the ecosystem and should be respected for the role that it plays.  Remember, that the current problem is, to a large extent, the result of human activities.  You could find that this proposal might also encourage disrespect for other species. Not a good thing as more and more species come under pressure from climate change and other human activities.\nFrom a law enforcement perspective this proposal is quite likely to cause a lot of issues. You are going to have folks (I won\u2019t call them \u201chunters\u201d) driving around in boats blasting cormorants where ever they find them.  There is going to be safety issues and possibly illegal harvesting of migratory birds.  In addition, I can see rotting carcasses left in places that are not acceptable to the public.  Once again, these things would add to the negative optics that this \u201chunting opportunity\u201d has to the general public.\nLastly, I find it insulting to me as a Wildlife Biologist and a hunter that MNRF would propose this management action to deal with a nuisance wildlife issue. This proposal does not match up with any wildlife management principles or the reasons why I hunt!\nWhat I would suggest is that MNRF recognize its responsibility as the provinces primary resource management agency and take the lead in managing this nuisance wildlife issue.  MNRF needs to look at the science and use control methods that are humane and effective.\n",

I don't understand why the changes will be made and then a \"cormorant monitoring program\" will be implemented to determine trends and status of populations. Should this not be completed in entirety before changes are made?\nMy concerns are as follows:\n- the hunting season would be during the breeding season which could add to the overall negative affect\n- particularly in Southern Ontario, the summer months are spent at cottages along the water. Has there been any thought as to the negative feedback from cottage owners on increase gun fire\n- hunters are now allowed to leave the meat to spoil and an excessive bag limit per day. What will happen when dead birds start washing onto shorelines and beaches?\n- do hunters have the appropriate skills to identify this particular species?\nI do agree that the populations need to be managed. However, this seems to be a large swing in the other direction. Are there not intermediate steps that can be taken to control populations? Oil eggs? This step seems drastic and detrimental.

        "comment":"Dear Public Input Coordinator,\nSubject: ERO Number 013-4124: Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\nOn behalf of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH), its 100,000 members, subscribers and supporters, and 740 member clubs, we have reviewed the proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario and submit the following comments for consideration.\nGeneral Comments\nThe OFAH has been advocating for the management of overabundant cormorant populations for over a decade. The ecological damages caused by densely populated cormorant colonies are well-documented, and we commend the government for acknowledging the issue and proposing action.\nIt must be acknowledged that associating cormorant control with regulated hunting has the potential to negatively affect the image of hunting; indeed, evidence of this is already emerging. A key part of the OFAH mandate is to promote a positive image of hunting as an important component of conservation. It must remain clear that this proposal is not to provide new hunting opportunities, but rather its sole purpose is to use hunters to assist in the control of overabundant cormorant populations. A simple way to avoid this association would be to add double-crested cormorants to the list of species in Section 5(2) of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. Combined with an accessible system to distribute depredation permits in areas where the public cannot discharge firearms, this would enable effective cormorant control without negative impacts on the image of hunting. However, if the government is unwilling to consider this route, then we support the proposal with exceptions.\nOther stakeholder groups have voiced their opposition to the proposal on various grounds, including the potential for conflicts between hunters and other outdoor recreationists during the summer months, and the risk of orphaning young cormorants. These risks are low and exaggerated by opponents to cormorant control, but could be reduced even further by making some key changes to the proposal.\nIf the government decides to proceed with the implementation of a regulated cormorant hunt, we ask that you consider the following changes to the proposal in order to mitigate some of the social concerns being voiced without significant effect on the expected management outcomes.\nSeason Dates\nConsideration should be given to closing the season during the majority of nesting and peak summer outdoor recreational activity until the beginning of other waterfowl seasons. This could occur by splitting the season into two separate parts (March to May, and September to December). This option, if properly implemented, would help address some of the opposition from other stakeholders. Killing adult cormorants in the summer will remove individual birds, but those birds will likely have already bred and caused tree and vegetation degradation. Targeting the season to pre-nesting, when the birds first arrive in the spring, would prevent them from nesting in the first place and limit their impact before it occurs.\nPermitting spring and fall hunting would better align with the migration times of cormorants as they move north in early spring through May and move south in October through November (UW Sea Grant 2007). There is precedent for a split season \u2013 this approach is already being implemented by the federal government in their control of overabundant snow goose populations. In Ontario a special conservation harvest period is in place for overabundant snow geese from March 1 to May 31, and is in addition to the regular fall season from September to December. Despite this spring season, and similar spring seasons in Quebec, the overall population of snow geese has remained relatively stable, indicating that there is no population-level concern with having these two seasons with a high daily limit (20 birds a day with no possession limit and 50 a day in the Hudson-James Bay area) (CWS 2017). A similar season structure could be implemented for cormorants to reverse population growth while not posing a conservation concern.\nClosing the spring season at the end of May would have the additional benefit of removing the need for the proposed exception relating to Northern and Central Ontario\u2019s June to August small game licence restrictions. This would further align the cormorant regulations with other game birds, minimizing confusion. Additionally, as cormorants typically breed between April and August, this spring hunting season would remove most adult birds before they get a chance to lay eggs (Ward 2000) and prevent the orphaning of chicks. For the reasons stated above, the OFAH, recommends season dates of March 1 to May 31 and September 15 to December 31.\nPopulation Monitoring\nIt is essential to get robust data on cormorant populations and distributions in Ontario, including accurate baseline data, in order to inform a provincial management plan. It is encouraging to see the addition of the monitoring plan in the proposal, but it\u2019s important to ensure this monitoring covers the entirety of the province, not just the Great Lakes region. A significant concern regarding growing cormorant populations is their expansion to inland lakes and their potential impacts (e.g. sensitive Brook Trout lakes). Understanding their current distribution and relative abundance will ensure we are preventing them from expanding into more vulnerable lake systems. This information can be used to alter bag and possession limits in the future if the population changes significantly.\nIn addition to population and distributions, it would be beneficial for the government to test and monitor toxin loads within cormorants. Studies have shown that PCB contamination is a concern for cormorants in Ontario, and that it varies geographically (Bishop et al 2016). As such, a consumability study should be developed for the province in a similar way as the Guide to Eating Ontario Fish. This would also be a beneficial way to monitor the health of the cormorant colonies.\nBest Management Practices\nSince the government is looking to utilize hunters as a management tool to control cormorant numbers, they need to work with the OFAH to give hunters the information needed to implement control effectively and efficiently. The OFAH would like to work with the MNRF to develop outreach materials for hunters. These best management practices could include the proper disposal of carcasses and how to avoid conflicts with other users. Most conflicts can be easily avoided, but if they are not, it can lead to unintended consequences like negativity towards hunting in general or specific issues like discharge bylaws that will hinder cormorant control efforts and hunting opportunities for other species.\nProvincial Management Plan\nThis proposal would give individuals the ability to participate in cormorant control on Crown land; however, the province also needs to control cormorant overabundance, particularly when and where hunting will not be permitted. Currently, control measures can be undertaken by municipalities, provincial parks, and landowners when they experience property damage from cormorants. In many areas, no control measures are taken. In other areas, control efforts are too small in scale or focus on ineffective non-lethal actions. In practice these measures are not adequately controlling cormorant overabundance. Even where large scale control is taking place, cormorant numbers are increasing. For example, the Toronto Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) is undertaking non-lethal control of cormorants in Tommy Thompson Park on Toronto\u2019s waterfront with a specific focus of decreasing tree damage. Their efforts have successfully reduced tree nesting by 44% from 2008 to 2016, but in doing so, increased ground nesting by 899% (McDonald et al 2018). This has allowed the population to increase from 6,717 nests to 14,515 nests in the same 8-year span (TRCA 2018).  Additionally, the Ontario Government is not effectively managing colonies on public properties. Presqu'ile Provincial Park implemented lethal management of cormorants between 2003 and 2006, which reduced the number of nests from 12,082 to 3,855; however, the lethal management was canceled in 2011 and nest numbers increased to 5,425 by 2015. In the absence of continued lethal control, cormorant numbers increase. This showcases the importance of lethal control in managing overabundance of cormorants and the need for landowners to implement that control. Without a holistic province-wide management plan, there will still be areas that are negatively impacted by overabundant cormorant colonies.\nThe OFAH appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed hunting season for double-crested cormorants.

        "comment":"The killing of 14000 of these birds PER SEASON is an inhumane policy and further research from your council  needs to be brought to your attention because  there is a lot of misinformation here!\nThe argument that these birds destroy ecosystems is ridiculous, they are a naturally occurring native bird, so basic ecology and common sense would tell us they would not survive as a species if they destroyed their own ecosystem.\nAnd while their droppings can kill their nesting trees, the nutrient-rich guano will lead to a new round of healthy plant and animal life.  As for the fact that they are 'eating all the fish', they do eat fish, but only 2% of their diet consists of commercially valuable species, and they actually eat invasive fish species.\nTherefore,the mass killing of cormorants will not be beneficial to our all ready threatened ecosystem.\nIf you in fact, proceed with the process of killing them you willl force other bird species to vacate the colony sites they share.\nCormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial, non-forage species.  It is the commercial fisheries in Lake Erie and other lakes that are depleting fish populations, not cormorants!!\nThe mass killing being proposed by the Ontario government is a political response to anecdotes, unsubstantiated claims and complaints by a small group of radical fishermen, supported by special interest groups. There is no substantive body of scientific evidence supporting their position. Instead of making cormorants a scapegoat for environmental problems they have nothing to do with, attention should be given to addressing the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, over-fishing and a broad range of other issues.\nThe proposed designation of cormorants as game animals, along with a non-utilization exemption that allows the carcasses to rot should be an affront to every hunter who believes in sportsmanship, fair chase and ethics.\nRemember the removal of wolves from Yellowstone Park?  The elk population grew so enormously because there were no preditors;, that they destroyed the Aspen seedlings and other plant life that other animals depended on . Wolves from Calgary had to be brought back in to normalize the situation.   Nature always looks after her own. When man interferes he does more damage than before, costing the taxpayer millions of dollars.\nPlease reconsider supporting this Commorant slaughter.  It's grossly inhumane and troubling to our fragile environment.\n",

To respond to these concerns, the Ministry is proposing to create a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario.\"\nTo paraphrase, someone complained so a widespread cull has been initiated.  There is no presentation of any analysis of the ecology or population dynamics of this species.  There is no reference to ANY data that may serve to validate any of the various claims made be self-interest groups.  There is no analysis of the potential efficacy, or adverse impact, that the hunt may have on the target or non-target species.  There is no analysis or discussion of the generally poor efficacy of culls as a means to control wildlife populations.  In other words, there is no reliable evidence that there is in fact a problem, nor is there any proven merit that the proposed hunt would effectively solve the unproven problems.\nOverall, the proposed hunt is CLEARLY and COMPLETLY lacking in any thought and is completely without justification.  While this would not be a surprise as a knee-jerk proposal from an ill-informed politician, the fact that this proposal is proffered through an agency that has an obligation to apply good science and make evidence-based decisions is gravely concerning.  As a taxpayer, I expect that all government agencies do their job properly and objectively.  I hope that at some level the MNRF invokes good science and retracts this proposal, or at minimum conducts a sound analysis of the issue before any thoughts of moving forward.\n",

        "comment":"I'm incredibly concerned about this proposal for a few reasons; #1, a 50 bird per day per person limit seems incredibly high, and may not be sustainable for this species, depending on how many people take up hunting them. #2, in the area in which I live, there are several active cormorant nesting colonies in very close proximity to major roadways and homes; it seems exceedingly dangerous for hunting to occur in these areas.  Although hunting in these urban areas with firearms is not allowed with a small games permit regardless, it would make sense for these areas to have posted signage prohibiting hunting at areas close to major roadways and urban areas (these are the most visually accessible cormorant colonies that have likely prompted most of the complaints about the species in the first place). #3, allowing 50 birds per person per day to be allowed to \"spoil\" will put a huge bacterial load in the water\/land areas these birds inhabit; it is likely to impact local ecosystems, and studies should be carried out to determine what this impact would look like (would it encourage\/increase numbers\/types of scavengers? Would it foul the water for local fish populations? Would it interfere with water sources meant for human consumption?). #4, Cormorants often nest in close proximity to other species of birds.  With the proposal allowing the hunting of nesting birds, this may put other species nesting in the same areas at risk. #5, other species of birds can look similar to cormorants in flight (ie, loons, other diving birds).  Will there be an educational outreach program for people intending to hunt cormorants, including a refresh on rules and regulations for holders of small game licenses, as well as species identification for birds that may look similar to cormorants? #6, along the same lines, it would be prudent to educate\/remind would-be cormorant hunters about regulations concerning types of shot to be used\/not used when hunting over\/near water (ie, Lead shot), which of course would have huge impact on a number of other species beyond the target species? #7, Will there be a substantial increase in the number of CO's in Ontario to deal with potential issues that this extremely aggressive proposed cull is likely to produce? #8, will there be any requirement for hunters to at least check shot birds to ensure the fastest, most humane death possible, and to subsequently not allow injured\/downed birds to survive if all shots are not immediately fatal?\n",

        "comment":"I do not support this proposal as it is a band-aid solution to a larger problem. There are far greater impacts to commercial fishing industry and island habitat then a native bird population that is a perceived nuisance. There is no concrete, scientific evidence that reducing the double-crested cormorant population will be beneficial to the aquatic or terrestrial environment and, in fact, it may result in higher numbers of invasive fish species and negative impacts on waterfowl. This proposal suggests not all cormorants shot down will be retrieved, which may result in scavenger birds and mammals to ingest lead bullets and result in a harmful bio-accumulation in the food chain.\nIf this hunt were approved it would set a precedent to manage wildlife instead of addressing the pressing and often irreversible man-made contributions (e.g. habitat loss and degradation, pollution, invasive species etc.) leading to the initial problem. If we continue to use short-term, scientifically unsupported methods to improve the lives and lifestyles of a few special interest groups we are only creating a larger, long-term issue for all people and wildlife in Ontario and beyond.\n",

Once considered abundant and a nuisance, they now longer are, they simply no longer exist.\nIn the past I have thought of cormorants as nuisance birds, observing the foliage and vegetation on the island across from Southampton as it disappeared under the colonization of the birds.\nI am curious about the science and studies related to cormorant populations.  I wonder if population studies have been conducted.  I wonder what the tipping points are within various ecosystems for damage and habitat loss caused by the birds.   I wonder what the research indicates, but am concerned as this proposal does not seem based on measured scientific outcomes.\nI am shocked by the proposed hunt.  I am shocked by the number of birds each hunter would be permitted to kill on a daily basis.  As presented, the intent of this hunt seems to be a complete extirpation of cormorants in Ontario.    I find this strongly repulsive.\nI understand and appreciate that may be a need for population management and control.  I also appreciate that calculating an appropriate balance within ecosystems is a delicate challenge and that this balance may be different between various ecosystems in the province.  I do not think that the proposed legislation reflects careful consideration of the interconnectedness of ecosystem populations.\nI do not want to see cormorant populations hunted to extirpation, or near extirpation in our province.  I think population control should be managed by professional biologists on a site specific basis, using techniques like egg oiling or nest disruption.\n",

We collectively find this proposal to allow the hunting of large numbers of cormorants odious. Not only will it condone the wanton and unnecessary killing of vast numbers of cormorants (50 birds\/day per hunter which is a ridiculously high number!), but the birds apparently will not even need to be consumed!\nWe also find any form of violent killing of innocent beings without consumption to be a particularly offensive and utterly cruel waste of life generally undertaken for nothing but sport or malice. Such behavior must thus neither be encouraged nor tolerated among humans as it starts our species down a tragically slippery slope into obviously unethical behavior when it comes to our fellow creatures.\nFurthermore,  no human ever needs to consume animal flesh if sufficient plant foods are available, so there exists no valid necessity argument for this excessively lenient hunt, and the flimsy reasons cited are both questionable and have other, kinder solutions. Neither is there any valid case to allow the utter travesty of killing off our precious remaining wildlife without consumption.\nInstead of permitting deviant humans to act out their violent impulses by cruelly killing these poor birds, we instead propose taking steps to encourage population growth among the cormorants' natural non-human predators and to protect such predators to the fullest extent of the law from all forms of killing. Allowing nature to manage its own populations typically makes much more sense than allowing humans to attempt to do that for mere perverse entertainment purposes.\n",

In some cases, cormorant colonies have destroyed entire island ecosystems.

I participated in research that took place on bird islands where cormorants nested.  Yes, their guano killed vegetation in their colony, but the devastation of flora was restricted just to their nesting area- the vast majority of the surface area on these islands. While walking through the cormorant colonies, it became clear to me that these birds were eating many different kinds of fish, including fish that most fishermen would actually WANT the birds to eat, like round gobies. The cormorants were also eating zebra mussels, and other Great Lakes invasive species.\nCormorants are absolutely essential to the Great Lakes ecosystem. The damage done by the cormorants pales in comparison to the damage that we would be doing to our Great Lakes environment if we started hunting these birds. Other birds nest right alongside cormorants, so wiping out their colonies could be devastating to other bird species in the Great Lakes. This proposal  would allow for hunters to decimate colonies in a matter of just days. This should never be something that we, as humans, do to creatures who share our ecosystem.\nI urge the Ontario government to drop this proposal entirely, but even reconsideration of the terms of the proposal would be a good start.\n",

The highest number is for Snow or Ross's geese at 20 per day\/person. That seems high...but I am reading that Cormorants are to be 50 and their carcasses are to be allowed to rot as hunters are not required to retrieve them.\nI thought that Biodiversity meant something in Ontario and Canada.\nWhat is being described is eradication because cormorants eat the food that humans also like. Humans have a choice to eat other food, wildlife do not, so why is it that human needs come first?\nOk, their guano alters the landscape. Look around you folks! The amount of non-permeable pavement humans lay down, causing heat pollution as rainwater travels the pavement to our lakes carrying all the garbage and disposable plastics we waste with the rain...instead of water entering the soil on the spot like it is supposed to. Flooding is on the rise due to this practice, and will only increase due to climate change...another human imposed condition on Earth.\nWhen I compare human behaviours with a simple water birds behaviour, the cormorant is more 'natural' and not as impactful.\nI think it very unreasonable to dislike a bird that helps support natural water systems and improves biodiversity by being apart of the natural web of life.

        "comment":"Being a 32 year employee of the Ministry of Natural Resources has left me with many memories of the Double Crested Cormorant. The first colony I ever say was from the front seat of a Turbo Beaver on a small rocky island in the Grand Traverse Bay area of Lake of the Woods in 1978. They shared the island with White Pelicans. My next observation was in Jarvis Bay south of Thunder Bay on Lake Superior in 1980 when I saw one bird. That to me was a good sign of a recovering species returning. Throughout my career with the MNR I promoted and put in place plans and municipal zoning that protected shoreline habitat in South eastern Lake Superior and the St. Marys River. I watched cormorant populations increase over the years fully understanding that the species success was directly linked to the gap in the ecosystem that was created due to the species previous decline due to the various human chemical inputs into the ecosystem. In my career I was responsible for the creation of the Great Lakes Heritage Coast through Ontario's Living Legacy program (a Conservative initiative I might ad). In that program (1999-2004) I worked with the Georgian Bay Biosphere and the Georgian Bay Association so I understand the \"politics of the Bay\". Yes, at that time the cormorant populations were a concern.  The science was not great and considerations were being made of the how to control or reduce the population in a humane manner.\nToday, I do not see any need reduce the population of Double Crested Cormorants as the are now fitting into the nitch they once had in our functional ecosystem. The proposal being considered by the Conservative government in Ontario is a totally unnecessary proposal. It is symptomatic of the \"politics of the Bay\" which contains many Conservative votes. The concept of allowing people to shoot over water in a highly busy recreational area to kill a bird is the most UNSAFE concept I have ever heard of. It's a lot less safe then shooting across a road, which will remain illegal. I total OBJECT to this bill. It is inhumane and totally unnecessary.  The Double Crested Cormorant is simply a recovering species that is re-establishing it's place in Ontario's ecology.

With wildlife habitat being wiped out in an alarming rate and animal species becoming extinct this is a time when Ontario and we as a people need to be making history to protect our wildlife and biodiversity not eradicating it.  Cormorants fulfill a valuable ecological role.  They help generate healthy fish populations and healthy plant and animal life.\nIt seems that Cormorants are being blamed for depleted fish stocks but the real truth is these birds are not the problem as the majority of their diet consists of invasive fish species such as round gobies and alewives, fish that are not commercially viable.  It\u2019s humans that have and are depleting the fish in our lakes and oceans.  It\u2019s greedy fishing industries and fishermen that are to blame.  Don\u2019t use the Cormorants as the scapegoat!

We have a few concerns regarding the proposed cormorant hunting season.\nOur community is receptive to the idea of a hunting season for cormorants although the proposed 10-months could be more than is required for a number of reasons.\nOur first concern is how it will affect public safety, in particular the Lake Couchiching area.  The lake is a popular tourist destination and we are concerned about the hunting of cormorants during the summer months.  This could pose some serious challenges to community safety in that Ship Island where they nest is very close to our community and an area popular with boaters.  We are especially concerned about the exemption to allow hunting between June 16th and August 31st.\nOur second concern is the potential for cormorant carcasses to be left behind after they are shot.  We understand that it will be mandatory to retrieve the dead birds but since cormorants are rarely used for anything we have concerns that they will be left behind. This would be unsightly and could lead to water contamination.  We will receive phone calls\/complaints from our own members and the public at large. Rama does not have the man-power to deal with such calls.  How will enforcement be addressed?\nAlthough we would prefer a proper consultation period and have requested an extension, we have a number of initial suggestions including:\n1.\tLimit the hunting season for the double-crested cormorant. This could coincide with the duck hunting season (September to December). By limiting the hunting season, public safety would be protected due to hunters being prohibited to shoot their guns in the summer months in areas that have high boat traffic.\n2.\tThe creation and implementation of a safer management plan for the double-crested cormorant such as the oiling of eggs, population monitoring, etc.\n3.\tThe creation of a plan by the MNRF to ensure birds are collected once they have been shot.\n4.\tLimit\/reduce the number of birds an individual is allowed to kill in a day. 50 per day is excessive.\nAgain, our preference would be to have time to engage our community and once again, we request that an extension be granted.\n",

        "comment":"Re: Proposal to establish a hunting season for the double-crested cormorant in Ontario\nI understand that there may be valid reason for establishing a hunting season in order to control the number of double crested cormorants in Ontario. Establishing a season from March 15 to December 31 with a daily bag\/possession limit of 50 birds sounds more like a slaughter than a hunt.\nPerhaps many consider these birds to be a nuisance but they are no more of a problem than Canada geese have become. As a naturally occurring species in our environment, they deserve our tolerance and protection.\nIf an open season is declared for the double crested cormorant:\n\u2022\tDaily bag and possession limits should not exceed those set for other migratory game birds such as Canada geese or mallard ducks.\n\u2022\tThe open season should be limited to the Fall season, not to exceed the duration of the Canada goose season.\n\u2022\tBirds should be taken on the wing and not shot while nesting, perching or on the water. To allow these birds to be taken while swimming will endanger the common loon. It is difficult to distinguish a cormorant from a loon while these birds are on the water.\n\u2022\tUnder no circumstances should the regulations allow the birds to be disturbed or shot during the nesting season. To kill the adults while they are caring for the young is inhumane.\n\u2022\tHunting of water birds should be avoided during the height of the boating and canoeing season, for the safety of boaters.\nThe ideal situation would be to not establish a season and allow the numbers of birds to regulate naturally.\n",

This is not factual and no evidence exists to support this premise.\nNationally it exposes Ontario's lack of scientific regard by allowing a native species to be killed in non-sustainable numbers\nThis recommendation pushes the cormorant back to endangered status, necessitating full protection.\nWhat we do know is that while their colonies may be dense, colonies are NOT numerous across the Great Lakes.\nCormorants feed exclusively on live fish and are considered to be a skillful predator. Anglers have always hatred cormorants for this reason. This recommendation would therefore be welcomed by the anglers as well as the hunters who will enjoy and benefit from an open season hunt.\nThis summer at Tommy Thompson Park, hundreds of cormorants died of Newcastle Disease, a disease that paralyzes portions of their bodies causing them to drown or fall from the sky.  Toronto Animal Control collected dead cormorants from Lake Ontario and across the city. New castle Disease, and predation is a natural population control for cormorants.\nThis disease along with other predation will in effect decimate the cormorant population in Ontario.\n",

It would allow shotgun hunting from stationary boats, with no requirement to retrieve the injured or dead birds from the water.  So, it is easy to picture rotten, stinking cormorant corpses floating down the river and up on our shores.  Imagine the perennial sound and danger of gunfire throughout the summer as hunters, and no doubt others in their boats, fire off shotguns at whatever flies, claiming they thought it was a cormorant.  I pity the loon population, for example, which looks quite similar to a cormorant, especially when in flight. Worse than that, imagine buckshot raining down on the water,  into boats, canoes, paddlers or swimmers all just trying to enjoy the peace and tranquility of a nice day on our lakes and rivers with their families and friends.\nThis proposed cormorant slaughter is inhumane, obnoxious and dangerous and cannot be allowed to proceed as proposed.  What is probably required is a targeted controlled cull, with proper removal of corpses, not a free-for-all mass slaughter left to rot.\nI listened to the Minister on CBC today at noon and he stated that there must be proper disposal, yet the proposal itself alludes to doing away with this requirement...which is it?\nAlso, the Minister stated that this was an inexpensive way of remedying the problem....what other methods were considered and has the department factored in any additional resources for conservation officers and OPP to handle violation complaints?\nI believe this proposal should be abolished.  At a minimum, i think the proposal should be reissued, stating clearly what the appropriate collection and disposal methods must be; and what other options were considered and discounted and why.\nI would appreciate a reply to this e-mail to know it as been received and considered.\nThank you\n",

From what I have seen it looks like cormorants are already starting this dive in population which makes me worry about over hunting, especially with a limit of 50 a day. If there is to be hunting I suggest a much lower limit, something like 10 a day.\nThis species causes damage but also they play a role as a food for endangered species such as the bald eagle and also introduce phosphorus and nitrogen into an ecosystem through guano (limiting nutrients in ecosystems).\nSo, while the population needs to decrease there are elements that have not been accounted for which need to be looked at before hunting policy is put in place.\n",

Links should be provided to the applicable science-based evidence.  Many of these \u201cconcerns\u201d are partially or substantially unjustified, exaggerated or very localized.\nAccording to the information posted on the EBR the hunt would be allowed \"from a stationary motorboat\". Even a non-motorized boat is not entirely stable in the water and this could lead to inhumane injuries rather than clean kills, and 'accidental' miss-hits on nearby non-target species.\nThe posting notes that hunters \"could allow cormorant to spoil\". This would be an unprecedented, careless and inconsiderate threat to human and environmental health. It is an unethical and irresponsible hunting practice.  Retrieval and disposal can simply not be properly monitored on a province-wide, 10 month hunt. Cormorant carcasses washing up on shorelines would create environmental and human health issues, as well as aesthetic and other collateral damage issues.  Shoreline property owners should not be subject to having to assume responsibility for the irresponsible effects of an ill-conceived  proposal.\nThe posting notes the proposal would \u201cestablish a bag limit of 50 cormorants\/day with no possession limit\u201d. This, combined with the provision to allow cormorant to spoil, could cause water pollution, health, aesthetic and ethical issues.\nHunters will be \"reminded to avoid conflicts with migratory game birds and other waterbirds\". It does not state that breeding sites be avoided. With cormorants nesting amongst other colonial-nesting and island-nesting species, some of which are species of concern the risk potential for \u201ddisturbance\u201c of other species is extremely high.  Any disturbance anywhere in the vicinity of other species during nesting season would constitute a \u2018\u2019conflict\u2019\u2019 capable of disrupting if not destroying their breeding cycles.  With proposed hunt dates from March 15 to December 31, nesting season is not being avoided.  Chicks of colonial-nesting and island-nesting species could be left parentless & abandoned leading to slow and inhumane death by starvation.\nThe posting indicates that cormorant populations are \u201ccurrently stabilized and even on the decline\u201d and that the \u201canticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral\u201d.  These statements confirm that an open season hunt would not be an essential \u201cpopulation management tool\u201d.\nThe cormorant is being used as a scapegoat for broader environmental problems. No wildlife management plan should be proposed in the absence of consideration of all factors involved including climate change, pollution, control of invasive species, over-fishing, etc. These factors are not mentioned or addressed in this proposal.\nThis is not hunting in the time-honoured, traditional sense - for food, for the love of being in the great outdoors, with high respect for human, animal and environmental safety, and based on fair play and good sportsmanship. It is a hunt that promotes a killing-field mentality. No respectable, ethical hunter would engage in this type of free-for-all. It is irresponsible of the government to promote this form of slaughter, let alone hand it over to the general public to deal with under the auspices of a \u201cgamebird hunt\u201d or \"wildlife management\".\n",

They are extremely efficient killers of fish and have enormous appetites,  hunting in very organized packs of 10 to 100, diving down more than 100 feet, they can decimate schools of fish quite quickly. There is very little chance of escape from these packs especially in lakes with clear water and only a few weeds for fish to hid in. Flocks of sea gulls follow them, feasting on the fish they injure in their hunts, no escape even for the injured. I also live and work in the Toronto Grimsby corridor, The proliferation of Cormorants in the Hamilton harbour is unbelievable and there respective destruction of anything that grows along the shore.\nIn the 90's there were a couple, now there are  many islands in Georgian Bay  that are turned white with cormorant excrement, huge amounts of fish are needed to produce that volume of excrement.\nMost times when they cough up fish they are 2 to 5 inches long. Yes many chad and smelt, but all fish including sport fish go through this size phase. Further this size is what all the sport fish eat. Sport fish minnows are therefore their prey and if the sport fish is lucking to get bigger than 5 inches there is little for them to eat. I use to catch perch, pickerel, pick, bass on a regular basis in the 80's, and my sons would catch rock bass, perch sunfish and like from under our dock, now only minnows (less than 2 inches long) forage there, along with cray fish and like. Now I can fish all day and not catch anything. I gave up trying 4 years ago, I now  get my fishing fix in Great Slave Lake each spring.\nSmelt used to be 8 to 14 inches long, now you are lucky to get them 3 inches if at all.\nThere are no fish in Georgian bay to catch, and I blame the Cormorants. Further when I am out fishing there are no other boats fishing. Sport fishing is non-existent in the Bay.

        "comment":"I\u2019ve resided on Balsam lake for the past 5 summers. Initially the cormorant population appeared to be centred around one small island called Hogg Island.  They have absolutely destroyed a little island off to the side of this island but it was sort of interesting to watch these birds at the time.\nSince then the cormorant population has grown immensely.  We were boating along the south end of Balsam this past summer and came across two huge flights of cormorants. I did not count them but I would suggest in the range of 40 to 50 in each flight. The following week a large flight landed in North Bay (Balsam Lake). A local was out on their wave runner trying to scare them off. He was successful.\nThe concerns are:\n- that the population of the cormorant has grown exponentially and if not curbed it will continue to climb, and\n- that continual growth will not bode well for the fish population, and other small islands in the area due to the destruction of vegetation.\nI totally support a controlled hunt of the cormorant, as it appears that it has no predators to manage the continued population growth.\n",

I hunt waterfowl annually and have participated in the Environment Canada Migratory Bird Harvest Survey for several years.  These cormorants are an invasive species which has been depleting the fish populations in many Ontario water bodies and are also displacing native bird species from their feeding and nesting grounds.  I have seen the cormorant population explode and have seen flocks of cormorants which must number in the thousands.  The droppings left by the birds in such great numbers are obviously contaminating the lake waters.  They must be culled to protect our native fish and bird species and to control their numbers.  Therefore the proposed 9 month hunting season and 50 bird bag limit with no possession limit are all appropriate.  These are very fast flying tough birds and appropriate shot sizes would be high velocity goose loads -- No. 4 in Hevi-shot, No. 2 in steel shot.\n",

We envision an Algonquin to Adirondacks region that is a resilient, with an ecologically connected landscape which sustains a full range of native wildlife. A critical component of this vision is conserving natural ecological functions and based on objective scientific evidence and respect for wildlife.\nThe Algonquin to Adirondacks Collaborative (A2A) is strongly opposed to the proposal to establish a hunting season from March to December for Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario with a bag limit for individual hunters of 50 per day, to reclassify cormorants as \u201cgame\u201d birds, and to permit hunters to leave the carcasses of dead cormorants to rot.\nDouble-crested cormorants are an important component of natural ecosystems in Ontario. There is no scientific evidence to support the need for a mass slaughter of cormorants that will result from the proposed hunting season and bag limit.\nThe Great Lakes cormorant population of the Great Lakes region suffered a steep decline from the 1950\u2019s to the early 1970\u2019s, largely as the result of the introduction of toxic contaminants such as DDT and PCBs. Following a ban on most DDT uses in the 1970\u2019s and the phase out of PCBs, and aided by the expansion of the aquaculture industry in the United States, the population experienced a large and rapid increase. Since the early 2000\u2019s, the cormorant population in the Great Lakes has been stable or declining slightly (as described in the Ontario government\u2019s own ERO posting for the current proposal). Clearly there is no need to conduct a massive cull of a population that is currently stable or in slight decline!\nIndeed, the government, in its ERO posting, has provided no scientific rationale as justification for proposing a cormorant hunting season.\nThe proposals in this ERO posting must be rejected for many reason, including those summarized below:\n(1) Permitting individual hunters to kill up to 50 cormorants per day (ie. up to ~14,000 cormorants per year) amounts to a slaughter, not a hunt.\n(2) A slaughter of cormorants will have significant negative effects on natural ecosystems in Ontario of which cormorants are an important element.\n(3) The proposed cormorant slaughter will result in the death of many cormorant young as the hunt includes the nesting period. It will also result in the death and disturbance of other species that share the same habitat and\/or nesting sites.\n(4) Based on studies by Environment Canada, cormorants do not consume large numbers of \u201csport\u201d fish as sometimes alleged. Rather they feed in large part on  \u201dnon-sport\u201d species such the Alewife, a species native to eastern North America that has invaded the upper Great Lakes, and the Round Goby, an invasive species that is native to the Black and Caspian seas region of Eurasia.\n (5) The proposal to classifying cormorants as a \u201cgame\u201d species is illegitimate and appears to be simply to facilitate the proposed slaughter. Game species are those that are hunted for food or other products (e.g. fur), and for sport. This does not apply to cormorants, which are not normally eaten by humans.\n(6) Allowing carcasses of cormorants that are killed to be left to rot, as in the current proposal, is unethical (as it is for other species) and must not be permitted.\n(7) The cormorant population in Ontario is not out of control, and indeed is stable or slightly decreasing in the Great Lakes region, as described in the government\u2019s own documentation. Habitat suitable for cormorant nesting sites occupy only a very tiny fraction of the Great Lakes region, mainly on a few small islands and peninsulas.\n(8) The government in it\u2019s ERO posting has provided no scientific rationale for the proposed cormorant slaughter.\n(9) There are major safety concerns for Ontario residents and tourists because the proposed hunting season will include the summer period when large numbers of residents and visitors pursue recreation activities in the outdoors.\nFor all of the above reason we ask that the current ERO proposal be rejected.\n",

The birds are also very aggressive fishers and, as far as we can tell, are responsible for almost eliminating the entire fish population around our cottage and in other areas we try to fish.\nI'm also a hunter and hold a small game license and the only concern I have with this proposal is that I wouldn't want the season to coincide with the cottage\/boating summer season, so I would recommend keeping the season closed from June 16th to August 31st.   This is for a few reasons including;\n- Hunting these birds will take place on or around water where sound travels far.  Shooting a shotgun off throughout the day could be annoying to those in close proximity.\n- These birds are located around popular locations for those camping, fishing, boating, enjoying the outdoors.  Mixing in hunters, even though it is with shotguns which have limited range, I think is dangerous to the public.\n",

Fraser, Faculty of Environmental Studies, York University (http:\/\/gsfraser.blog.yorku.ca\/research\/conservation\/proposed-cormorant-\u2026).\nAs a proposal coming from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF), this proposed cull of a native species should be evidence-based with a strong justification based on scientific evidence, not on anecdotal evidence based on the self-serving interests of \u201csome groups and individuals.\u201d\nIf a disinterested needs analysis that takes into consideration impacts on bird and fish populations determines that a cull is justified, as Dr. Fraser has noted:\n\u201cThe OMNRF should have a full and detailed rationale to provide justification for this proposal, as well as population modelling exercises, population level targets to support the extreme daily bag numbers being proposed, exactly how the cormorant population will be monitored to determine effects of a hunt and an evaluation of the negative impacts on non-target species.\u201d\nTo call this potential wholesale, unprofessional slaughter \u201ca population management tool\u201d is an insult to anyone who has any respect for a principled, evidence-based approach to wildlife management, which should be the default modus operandi of the Ministry. If a cull is necessary, it should be carried out by trained professionals if for no other reason than to limit the collateral damage to non-target species.\nAs it stands, this proposal comes across as a reckless, badly thought-out draconian ad hoc approach to resolving a \u201cproblem\u201d using a highly inappropriate and unnecessary \u201csolution\u201d\u2014literally overkill. While appealing to some private interests, this proposal as it stands may very well not be in the public interest and, by the time this is demonstrated, it may be too late to rectify the error.\nIt seems too often that people create the problems and then the animals pay the cruel price.\n",

Lots of birds nest in pairs, not in hundreds.\nI support a cull and wish that people who do not see the destruction would keep comments to themselves or take the time to see the destruction.

The process did spend some time in discussions about the Double Crested Cormorant and its effect on fish species and habitat of Lake Nipissing.  Various presentations from stakeholders suggested that this bird was causing a reduction in walleye population and threatened habitat.  We implemented more broadly based fisheries management plan that focused on spawning stock, partnering with First Nations and protecting juvenile fish in 20 year fisheries management plan implemented in 2013. The results have seen a reduction or stabilization in the double breasted cormorant population, an enhancement in spawning walleye stock and improvement in the overall fisheries in the Lake. In my opinion this shows that proper management of fisheries and habitat are effective means of managing the cormorant and not the wholesale slaughter of a species.\nI am also concerned about hunters shooting Double Crested Cormorants throughout the summer potentially wounding or killing swimmers, canoeists, fisherman, cottagers, etc., accidentally. No other game is allowed to be hunted during these busy periods on our waterways.  Killing birds in this way is not a sport or game hunting and will attract a very unsavory group of hunters who can kill up to 50 birds a day, leaving them to rot, resulting in serious damage to the environment and those actually using the waterways of our province.

There are problems with this species in terms of their now-large population size and negative impacts on environments and other vulnerable species. In this respect, culling in the form of opening a hunting season on Double-crested Cormorants may be a reasonable management strategy.\nHowever, this proposal is not a management strategy. With over half of the world's species estimated to be in decline and at risk of extinction, and with bird species being particularly vulnerable, any changes to hunting regulations must be based on robust scientific evidence that includes population estimates, estimates of population trends (increasing, decreasing stable), estimates of effective population size (number of reproducing individuals of each sex in the population), other potential threats to the species, and so on.\nI would seriously consider supporting a Double-Crested Cormorant management strategy that involved opening a hunting season on the species if population reduction goals and pouplation stabilization targets were set, but only if these targets were based on sound scientific data including robust population surveys, and if the information was made publicly available as part of a future or modified proposal.\nIt is irresponsible to propose opening a hunting season on any species without first ensuring the planned season length and bag limits will not cause the population to suffer. As it currently stands this proposal appears to have no data to back it up, and I therefore strongly oppose it.\n",

Even if no accidents occur, the hunters will totally disrupt the recreational aspect of being on the lake.

There is usually more pieces to the puzzle when identifying fish stock declines and population fluctuations, and only identifying one bird species as a root cause sounds a bit like a witch hunt, or scapegoat.\nCulls are a bandaid solution, and more effort needs to be put into identifying and resolving the root cause of their recent population fluctuations. Too often is hunting used as wildlife management's only tool to deal with the imbalances in nature we Canadians have created, with solutions to the root of problems often overlooked or passed up for easier methods. Why not first look at ways of reducing the populations of invasive fish species that are supporting the cormorant population?\nThere is already legislation in place for property owners to protect their properties from pests, so rewriting\/duplicating regulations on the same subject is a waste of time. Let the original regulations stand and be used.\nThe Fish and Wildlife Act prohibits anyone from allowing game wildlife meat to spoil for good reason. Hunting without recovery is just senseless, and promotes unfavourable hunting practices. Why should cormorants be any different?\nThe limit of 50 birds per day is too high if there are no restrictions on the maximum number of cormorants killed in a season, and could easily swing the cormorant population too far to the other end of the spectrum. There should also be a restriction on hunting them at nesting sites, as other bird species often share the same sites and would be affected negatively by the cormorant hunting. If other birds populations are not able to nest comfortably while the cormorant hunt is happening, then the positive effects on terns and herons are going to be largely negated.\n",

This is untrue as they mainly eat species not directly sought as sport fish.\n   c) Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has wiped out thousands or tens of thousands of cormorants on the Great Lakes during the 1990s and may do so again. MNRF has no knowledge as to the number of cormorants eliminated from the Great Lakes in the last epizootic and it seems is unlikely to be taking this and other 'natural' controls of the Great lakes cormorant population into account in this proposal.\n2) the proposal violates the basic tenets of conservation and hunting. Thus, as a hunter, I am strongly opposed to this proposal.\n   a)Game animals are sought after for consumption and as such are kept by the hunter taking the game into possession. To not do so with game animals is disrespectful of nature, demeaning of the sport of hunting and in violation of acceptable laws of conservation as supported by ethical hunters.\n  b)Making this proposal into law is a huge discredit to any and all of the hunters that I know and would wish to associate with and encourages the non-hunting citizens of Ontario to have an increasingly negative outlook toward the sport of hunting, toward hunters and towards firearms used legally for hunting. Perspectives on legitimate legal hunting are having a difficult time within much of the dominant urban populations of Ontario without the Minister of MNRF overtly making matters worse!\n   c) MNRF and Ontario citizens do not and should not support the harvesting of any game animals by hunters during the early period of the season of production of young of game species. It is despicable to think that the government, MNRF or anyone calling themselves hunters would choose to violate this basic tenet of conservation of game animals.\n3)citizen concerns about defoliation and death of trees on a specific localized basis are understandable. However, this is no reason for the government of MNRF to endorse a cormorant hunt considering that the government and MNRF purposefully defoliate hundreds of square kilometres of deciduous trees on an annual basis in support of promoting  coniferous trees for harvest by the forest industry and doing so despite the reliance on deciduous plants by a wide diversity of herbivores including but not restricted to moose, deer, beaver and many other species important to the people of Ontario.\n4) The bag limit will not be enforceable for at least two reasons. This of critical importance as recognized by the late C.H.D. Clarke, the first 'father of game management' in the Department of Lands and Forests, the precursor to MNRF. Clarke wrote eloquently that we citizens should respect and follow regulations and that if regulations cannot be effectively enforced, then citizens will not respect the regulations and this disrespect of regulations will be transferred to perspectives on other regulations and encourage increased violation of regulations.\na) A 'bag limit' can only be established in two ways: a) checking the number, sex, species and other relevant features associated with the regulation if the hunter is in possession of the harvested game or b) if enforcement officers can trace specific hunters to specific abandoned game. Shooting and disposing (e,g, through burying or whatever) dead cormorants during a day of hunting does little to establish possible exceeding of bag limits.\n   b) there are insufficient funds to hire enough conservation officers to effectively enforce current fish and wildlife regulations without placing this added burden on them. Hopefully I am right in assuming that with our limited enforcement resources that there are higher priority species and regulations to be addressed than harvesting of cormorants.\n",

        "comment":"I'm making a comment on the proposal to establish a hunting season for the double crested cormorants in Ontario. The reason this proposal is being made seems to be due to the dwindling populations of fish which is affecting sport and commercial fishing. It seems to me that a logical solution would be to place a ban on fishing to give the fish stocks an opportunity to recover. A ban would go right to the root of the problem; the dwindling fish stocks, and would enable the cormorants to maintain their place in the natural world without disturbing the balance and interconnectedness of nature.\nPlease refer to the 16 points from Animal Alliance which are included in the supporting link below. They have included valid points not to go ahead with this proposal which serves to upset the balance of our natural eco system.\n",

        "comment":"This proposal is obscene.\n1. Allowing a mass slaughter of anything should never be permitted. A 10 month season with no bag limit enables each hunter to take 15,000 birds (50 x 30 x 10). So 100 hunters could take over a million birds. This is a slaughter, not a hunt.\n2. The MNR's own proposal admits that the population of Cormorant has peaked and is stabilized, possibly declining.  So there is no need to slaughter them as nature will obviously seek its own balance without any need for intervention.\n3. Finally, the proposal seems to be motivated by the desire to appease commercial fishing in the Great Lakes - yet has no territorial limits. So even if one were to accept the motivation as warranted, which I do not, it is preposterous for it to justify slaughter of Cormorants across Ontario.\nIn summary this proposal is offensive and should be discarded.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Premier Ford:\nYour government's proposal to kill the double crested cormorants allows licensed persons to kill 50 birds per day or 14, 250 for the entire season multiplied by the number of so-called hunters.\nThe cormorants are benefiting other water birds (herons, egrets, pelicans) that live with the cormorants. Attacking the cormorants will also kill the other birds with them. Any that survive will leave the site. Cormorants are beneficial because they eat large numbers of invasive alewives and round gobies , and other non-commercial and non-forage species.\nMass killing the cormorants will damage the  environment because they will be left to rot in huge numbers. This will interfere with the natural ecosystem and create a terrible stench.  There is no way to kill cormorants humanely. Injured and crippled birds will die of their wounds or starvation including their nestlings. This proposal is inhumane, cruel, ill considered, an affront to any sportsman worthy of the name  and beyond decency.\nThe Ontario govt is responding to an emotional and political lobby of special interest groups. Neither the Ontario govt. nor the special interest groups have provided any third party expert information to support this massive killing. Eradication of a species is  misguided. and certainly can not be called wildlife management.\nInstead of scapegoating the cormorants, direct attention to the issues that actually do affect fish populations such as over fishing, pollution,  shoreline and habitat destruction, etc..\nThis proposal is repugnant in the extreme and will appeal only to those of less than civilized tendencies.  Killing brutalizes the killer.  Ask military servicemen who have been in combat. The licensed persons will have guns, and the frenzy of this massive killing will have psychological consequences. Furthermore, this proposal will bring public scorn on the Ford government and vilification of government officials in charge. History will not be kind to either Doug Ford, or to the Minister in charge.\n",

Have analyses been done to evaluate the potential effects on cormorants of a 50-bird-per-day limit?  Why has this limit (as opposed to others) been proposed?   There is no indication in the proposal of adequate analyses having been conducted to support it.\nFurther, there are no indications of objective assessment of the impacts of cormorants.  The proposal cites as its basis - impacts on fish populations, impacts on island habitats, and impacts on aesthetics.  How have these impacts been calculated, and why are they not provided in an objective manner in the proposal?\nThe proposal also seems inconsistent with present-day ecological and societal values regarding resource use.  Allowing carcasses to spoil seems wanton.  Further, does the MNRF truly believe that hunters will gather the carcasses of birds that have been killed, and does it have sufficient enforcement capacity to police that requirement?\nWhile there may be legitimate concerns regarding the impacts of cormorants, without providing a much sounder and detailed basis, this proposal comes across as poorly conceived and not based on objective, science, and designed to appeal to the subjective opinions of a small minority of the province's citizens.\n",

Therefore, I do NOT support this proposal, for the reasons listed below.\n1. The agenda for this proposal seems to be largely driven by self-serving people with game-fishing and sailing hobbies, who are putting human recreation ahead of the survival of an important native species which serves as a top predator in lacustrine and marine ecosystems.  The cormorant is being blamed unfairly for taking game fish. See item 11 below.\n2. The cormorant population is said to be stable at this time, after recovering very low numbers prior to 1970.  Admittedly, there are large concentrations of cormorants on some islands in the Great Lakes, harbours, and other areas.  However, the way to deal with large concentrations is not through an open 9.5-month-long hunting season that allows licenced hunters to kill 50 cormorants\/day using shotguns, which does not focus specifically on areas of high concentration and could seriously deplete cormorant numbers in other areas where numbers are stable or low.\n3. There is an unacceptable chance that co-lateral damage to other species of birds, such as egrets and herons, would occur when shooting of island-inhabiting cormorants from offshore \u201cstationary motorboats\u201d takes place.\n4. The requirement for cormorant hunters to retrieve and dispose of the bird carcasses properly according to regulations as yet outlined, is likely to reduce the number of hunters who would be interested in hunting cormorants because of the expense they would incur in buying shotgun shells and the time they would have to spend in retrieval and disposal of birds.  Therefore, a proposed daily bag limit of 50 cormorants seems unrealistic.\n5. It would make more sense to have MNRF sharpshooters continue to reduce numbers of excessively large vegetation-destroying colonies of cormorants by culling on an annual basis, as has been happening on Middle Island in Lake Erie in recent years.  This would be preferable to opening hunting to licenced game-bird hunters across the province, including areas where cormorant numbers are low.  Other options would be oiling of eggs or disruption of nesting by loud noise in large nesting populations of cormorants.\n6. Cormorants are part of ecosystems and their removal would upset the balance of the ecosystem especially where the cormorant numbers are stable or low.\n7. Claims that cormorants are depleting game-fish stocks in the lake need to be supported by up-to-date scientific evidence provided by qualified people with knowledge about the management of cormorants.  No references to such articles are posted on the Environmental Registry with the proposed policy.\n8. The public should have been consulted prior to the proposal of this policy, alternative options should have been provided, and only after the MNRF had chosen the preferred option should the proposal have been posted on the Environmental Registry.\n9. Current numbers of cormorants are not mentioned in the proposal, nor the areas of very large concentrations of the species.  The 2010 census of the Double-crested Cormorant showed a downturn in the population.\n10. The cormorants are facing threats from Newcastle Disease virus throughout the Great Lakes Basin. Newcastle disease virus has caused major mortality events in wild double-crested cormorants in North America (https:\/\/www.northeastwildlife.org\/disease\/newcastle-disease).  In this way, Nature is controlling cormorant numbers, with declines in numbers said to be reaching 70% in some areas.\n11. The MNRF should identify the exact areas where a problem exists with cormorants affecting the  numbers of game fish, and provide scientific backing.  Evidently, the Canadian Wildlife Service claims that cormorants do NOT take the fish species that game-fish hunters target.  If the MNRF is stocking lakes with non-native predatory game fish for sport, why it is concerned about a native bird species that probably prefers to eat other fish species than game fish and is likely not having much impact on game fish numbers?\n12. The MNRF states that monitoring of cormorant numbers will be done.  If monitoring of the hunt is left to Conservation Officers, of which there are only about 40 in Ontario, the monitoring will likely be very inefficient and inaccurate.\nIt is my opinion that the MNRF has not made its case for the proposed hunt, and a serious review of the proposal is needed.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\n",

It is an unscientific slaughter reflecting ignorance and slaughter of an entire species - genocide.\nCormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies. It is the commercial fisheries in Lake Erie and other lakes that are depleting fish populations, not Cormorants.\nThe concern expressed by commercial fishing interests is not supported by science-based evidence. Through careful analysis, the Canadian Wildlife Service has repeatedly found that only 2% of Cormorant\u2019s diet consists of commercially valuable species.\nCormorants are not overabundant in the Great Lakes. In fact, their numbers are modest, now stabilized and dropping in many areas.\nThe proposed \u201chunt\u201d will cause unimaginable cruelty by allowing the wholesale, uncontrolled slaughter of cormorants across the province, wounding adults and leaving young in the nests to suffer and die.

        "comment":"We are profoundly opposed to the proposal to establish a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario.  The duration and extent of this slaughter is almost beyond comprehension, and demonstrates both 19th Century callousness and blatant disrespect for our ecology.  The estimated result of such a hunt would result in the wiping out of 1, 500 cormorants per month, and up to 14, 250 cormorants for the entire proposed hunting season.\nDRACONIAN MEASURE\nThis proposal is a draconian reflection of the Ministry\u2019s disregard for the protection of our ecology.  It ignores that these birds have already been almost wiped out through hunting on two previous occasions due to persecution by humans and pesticide poisoning.  They have only begun to stabilize in recent years.  This hunting program would wipe out all previous efforts to stabilize both the cormorants and the ecologies in which they live.\nThere is no way to kill cormorants humanely.  Even past controlled, organized culls have resulted in large numbers of birds being injured and\/or crippled and left to die of their wounds, or to starve to death, and this includes, of course, nestlings and fledglings.\nNATIVE SPECIES\nDouble-crested Cormorants are native species.  They are not overpopulating the Great Lakes. In fact, their populations are modest, stabilizing, and in some localities, dropping.   The entire North American Double-crested Cormorant population is estimated to be less than the human population of Toronto, with about 250,000 in the entire Great Lakes Basin and considerably fewer residing in Ontario.  There is no need for a hunt to \u201cmanage\u201d them.  Therefore, this is not a management strategy, responding to the loudest, most callous voices in our society.  To do so would bring about government-fostered cruelty, and would lead to unbelievable suffering and death, and, in short order, extinction, all for the entertainment of those who demonstrate no compassion for non-human sentient beings.  Their voices should be being countered by science!\nNOT SUPPORTED BY SCIENCE\nScience-based evidence by the Canadian Wildlife Service has repeatedly found that only 2% of cormorants\u2019 diet is derived from commercially-viable species.  Rather, these birds\u2019 diet consists of environmentally-beneficial consumption of primarily invasive fish species such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial, non-forage species.  Clearly, it is commercial fisheries\u2019 overfishing which is depleting fish populations, not the fish consumed by cormorants.\nAs well, anyone who knows anything about the environment knows that nothing in nature is ever destroyed.  It is simply used as transformative material, as life renewal.  Cormorants are a necessary and beneficial part of the cycle of nature. Their excrement, which initially kills some trees, is rich in nutrients and results in new plant and animal life.  Their guano is part of nature\u2019s renewal, part of the change and evolution of ecosystems, part of the interdependence of species.  Cormorants have a valuable role to play in their environment.\nIn addition to the environmental need for cormorants, they are part of an interdependent dynamic within their ecology, and their slaughter causes havoc whenever it occurs.  The process of killing the cormorants will cause other bird species to vacate the colony sites they share, while the presence of cormorants benefits other colonial water birds, such as federally protected herons, egrets and pelicans, all of which are stable or growing populations wherever cormorants are found.\nFurthermore, the number of trees that die in colonial waterbird colonies across the province is extremely low and wouldn\u2019t even equal the number of trees in a single medium-sized woodlot, and would not come near to matching the number of trees  cut down in one day by Ontario\u2019s logging industry.    To blame these birds for ecological destruction, when the composition of vegetation in and around bird colonies is vibrant, healthy and dynamic, is a blatant lie.  Humans are causing ecological destruction and losses, not cormorants.\nEASY TARGET FOR THE CRUELTY-MINDED\nDouble-crested Cormorants are vulnerable to hunters in many ways.  They are larger birds, so are easily seen.  They are black, a colour which seems to be viewed by the superstitious as evil.  They congregate in colonies to nest on exposed islands and peninsulas (only about 3% of potential island sites in the Great Lakes are suitable.)  And because of their grouping behaviours, small congregations could be wiped out in a just a few minutes or an hour, while larger colonies could be destroyed in just a few days or a week.  Years of effort and thousands of dollars to recover the species would be lost in a few days.  Furthermore, since this proposal runs right through migration periods and nesting intervals, and since parent birds are such good protectors of their little ones and try against all odds to protect their babies, they make the epitome of vulnerable prey for the hard-hearted.   In addition, their migrations also make them an open target, a time of total vulnerability to those who enjoy killing.  So what this proposal does is increase an appetite in the most cruel of our human population for uncontrolled murder.\nThis kind of cruelty has already been witnessed in Ontario.  Cormorant-haters have already attacked colonies under cover of night, destroying nests, stomping on chicks, and killing adults.  There have been no repercussions for this cruelty.    And once the proposed changes to the law come into effect, people will be given free reign to destroy and maim as many cormorants as they want.  It wouldn\u2019t take long for people to wipe out most cormorants in the province, leaving perhaps a few small groups of their population in a few protected areas, driving them to near extinction or worse in Ontario.  And with the gene pool basically gone, the remaining birds would be highly susceptible to disease and early death.  Is this how Ontario treats its native wildlife?\nIn light of the above, it is aggregious that this Government\u2019s proposal would allow 50 birds to be killed at a time, day after day, week after week, month after month, by the same person, with no requirement that the \u201cmeat\u201d be used.  This is cruelty beyond cruelty.   And it is ecologically disastrous for our Province\u2019s natural balance.  It is disgusting, and will become Ontario\u2019s shame!  We did not vote for this!\nDESIGNATION AND CONTAMINATION FROM CARCASSES\nThe proposed designation of cormorants as game animals, along with a non-utilization exemption which allows the carcasses to rot should be an affront to every ethical hunter who believes in fair chase, ethics and sportsmanship.  And the contamination of the places where these killings occur will only further pollute our land and water.\nUNSUPPORTABLE CLAIMS\nThe mass killing proposed by this government is a political response to unsupportable anecdotes, unsubstantiated claims, and complaints by a small group of radical fishermen, supported by special interest groups.  There is no scientific support for their claims, and as such, in the name of ecology, should be ethically disregarded.  Rather, they should be presented with facts and the MNRF should respond according to the facts on behalf of all Ontario\u2019s citizerns.\nCONCLUSION\nIn summary, this hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants must NOT GO FORWARD.  Ontario citizens are not cruel.  They value all the wildlife in our ecology, they recognize interdependence among species, and they do not wish to legalize the wholesale, uncontrolled slaughter of cormorants, leaving behind a trail of wounded adults and young left to suffer and die in their nests as their parents are killed above them or trying to find food for them.  Ontarians value watching migrations and migratory birds, and they value our native species and ecologies.  They appreciate our wildlife in all its diversity.  Their appreciation comes from both science and compassion, and, as such, they DESERVE TO BE HEARD, AND THEIR WISHES HONOURED.  Most important, MNRF policy should reflect the will of the majority, based on science, not just the loudest, least scientifically-supportable voices!  If it continues not to do so, the MNRF should be privatized to the users who pay fees for licences, and a proper, citizen-based provincially-funded ministry set up to address environmental (including wildlife) protections and climate change.\nRather than using these native birds as a scapegoat for all that humanity is doing wrong, this government should be addressing the issues which actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, including pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction and \u201cdevelopment\u201d, overfishing, climate change, and other issues created by, and exponentially increasing because of, human activity.\nPLEASE STOP THIS PROPOSAL FROM GOING FORWARD.\nTHANK YOU.\n",

Only a small number of islands (less than 3%) and peninsula sites are suitable for cormorants and other colonial waterbirds to nest on.\nThe return of cormorants, a native wildlife species, to the Great Lakes Basin is part of a natural process and should be celebrated.  Cormorants are not overabundant in the Great Lakes. In fact, their numbers are modest, now stabilized and are dropping in many areas.\nThe proposed designation of cormorants as game animals is ridiculous, since they are inedible.  Allowing a carcass to rot goes against the ethics taught in any hunting course.  There are also very real safety issues where hunters are permitted to discharge firearms throughout the spring, summer and fall season when lakes and natural areas are populated by cottagers and tourists.\n",

I believe that it will cause huge devastation to a bird species with major negative impacts on biodiversity and the environment in general.\nThe proposal states that there are concerns by \u201csome groups that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species as aesthetics\u201d. However, there is no real analysis provided to confirm any aspect of this and certainly no analysis about the need for any of the actions in the proposal. Logically, the only response that we should be doing about these concerns is validating how real they are, performing proper scientific and environmental analysis, and determining a course of action based on the results of proper analysis.\nDouble-crested cormorants are native to Ontario and an integral part of our province\u2019s biodiversity. Contrary to what the proposal states, cormorants are an ecologically beneficial species, being major predators of invasive fish species. So, in fact, they are aiding us in this regard and we should not hamper that. The entire population of cormorants in Ontario currently is not huge at all, with estimates of around 250,000 in the entire Great Lakes Basin, a huge area, not all of which is in Ontario.\nThe proposal as it stands is just insane in my view, incredibly cruel to a native animal, with no thought to the devastation that would be created. With the proposed new limits, it would not take very long to wipe out the whole population. The correct course of action is to do a proper and transparent scientific analysis before taking any other action.\n",

Allowing people to hunt from boats would mean that many species of birds, other than the cormorants, would be killed as cormorants nest with  herons, egrets and pelicans.   Cormorants diets include alewives and round gobies as well as non-commercial species.  Mass killing of cormorants will damage the environment and disrupt natural ecosystem processes.

Anyone who has spent time on or near the water from the Great Lakes to Algonquin Park has seen the damage that these birds (especially in large flocks) have done to the landscape. Closer observation also highlights the amount of fish that they can eat.\nAs proposed, I'm hopeful that an open hunting season starts to at least control their numbers but time will tell. My concern is, will there be enough birds taken as there are less hunters year over year. If this proposal fails to work, then ongoing controlled culling must be done.\nAgain, thanks for the proposal and yes, I am absolutely in favour of the proposed action.\n",

As a child growing up in the early 60 on the Lake Ontario shore in the Hamilton area they were just never encountere. I recal seeing a flock in the early 80 was astounded to see them come closer, sure that they CAGO. Now along the Bay of Quinte this fall, there was flocks lasting several minutes fly overhead, certainly in the several thousands if not more.\nThe impact to fauna is devastating, with once flourishing islands reduced to stinking piles of deadfall trees with no life. They certainly have a place in the ecosystem, but left un-checked the numbers will continue to grow and the devastation will spread to smaller lakes which may not be able to support this once native bird which now apparently has no predator or other means to keep populations in check.\nAn open season is truly required to balance the ecosystem and contrary to what some media may have discussed I don\u2019t believe everyone with a gun will be out there shooting 5O birds a day. It\u2019s just too time intensive and cost prohibitive. More realistically, just as I will if so enabled, folks will go out a couple of times in the summer and shoot a box or two of shell, trying to support a good cause.\nRegard,\nGary\n",

Cormorants have destroyed the vegetation on many of our very beautiful islands in the area.  They have contributed greatly to the reduction of our fish stocks which local game and fish clubs have worked so very hard to protect and increase.   Other control methods such as egg oiling have been tried and have not succeeded in controlling the populations so I feel that it is time to move on and attempt to reduce the overpopulation by means of an enacted hunting season.   It is unfortunate that hunters will not be able to consume these birds but as a Province we have allowed carp derbies to control the number of carp.  I doubt that there are many of these fish being consumed.  If a considerable number of people find the 50 bird per day cormorant limit threatening to their way of thinking about controlling the large number of birds, perhaps a compromise would be to enact a lower limit to be shot per day?

I eat what I kill and catch all the fish I want, despite cormorants, loons, otters, and the other piscivores I compete with.\nI think an open season on cormorants will have many unintended consequences without solving the problem (assuming there is one).\nCormorants are not an alien species and should be able to carry out its ecological role.\nThe proposed legislation gives the worst kind of hunter greater exposure (killers for the sake of killing,  disregard for lead shot in waterways, etc.).  This in turn aggravates tensions between responsible hunters (painted with the same brush) and non-hunters.\nThere will be conflicts with noise , non-retrieval and wounding of the birds, during precisely the time of year when cottagers are on the lakes for peaceful enjoyment.\nWe would be sending the wrong message to new hunters and non-hunters about shooting game not intended to be used.  Let's keep the ideas of \"vermin\" and \"noxious predators\" in the past where they belong.\nI doubt that opportunistic shooting will have any effect on the population, especially once the birds learn to be more wary and difficult to approach.  Also, most hunters are reluctant to use expensive ammunition for something inedible, and for dubious purposes.\nThe most effective way to deal with cormorant reduction is at the breeding grounds.  Contrary to what is contained in the information release, low populations in past decades had little or anything to do with pesticides, as in terrestrial ecosystems.  In fact, commercial fishermen were the main culprits who quickly learned that the birds were most vulnerable at the rookeries, and acted quietly in their interests.\nNoisy shooting at the rookeries will lead to mega-problems in public relations.  There are more efficient and socially acceptable ways of lowering cormorant nesting success.\n",

Acknowledging that large successful numbers of the bird in colonies could have measurable impacts on ecological systems, a management approach may be warranted only when other contributing factors are also considered. For example, urban development encroaching into natural areas that should have been protected, or, designated natural areas like provincial parks used by people beyond the carrying capacity of the park and the ecological systems that should function there.\nThe fact that the bodies of dead birds would be permitted to rot and not be harvested (the real definition of the word harvest) tells me very clearly the proposal is poorly conceived. And, the Ministry should be concerned about how the proposal would impact its public image and reputation among the general public.\nAnd, the double breasted cormorant is a native bird species ... so where are the natural wild predators of this bird? What else have humans done to interfere with the natural balance to date? Something does not add up. It remains unclear what the unintended consequences of the proposal might include.\n",

In the early 80s a large rock island on Lake Huron, visible from the properties appeared to be white, as it was covered with seagulls. Ten years later, this same island appeared as black, due to the large influx of cormorants. This was my first introduction to the bird as I live in the Sudbury district and had never bumped into these birds. Nowadays, it is not uncommon to see cormorants on some of the lakes northwest of Sudbury. There are a number of remote lakes northwest of Sudbury where my son and I have fished for years. Some of these  lakes have small groups of cormorants now established on them. We can actually smell where the birds are living before we can actually see their habitat. The fishing in these remote lakes has dropped off to the point where it is hardly worth the effort to portage in to enjoy the fruits of fishing or even the once pristine environment. There is obviously the chance of other environmental factors that may have affected these fisheries, however, having frequented these lakes since my childhood with my father, the most obvious change is the introduction of these crafty, gluttons!\n",

Waterfront property owners represent one of the single largest rural constituencies \u2013 over 250,000 families, located in hundreds of Ontario municipalities and who collectively own and steward 15,000 kilometers of the Provinces shorelines, and over 50,000 hectares of economically and environmentally important lands.\nFOCA\u2019s members are local stakeholders, landowners, and outdoor enthusiasts, and are involved and interested in the state of our waterways, shorelands and our biodiversity.\nAs members of Ontario\u2019s Biodiversity Council FOCA maintains an active role in promoting thriving ecosystems and sound policy when it comes to managing our lands, waters and wildlife.\nFOCA has some significant concerns with the proposal which we outline, below.\nAs representatives of rural and waterfront families, FOCA has some fundamental safety concerns about this proposal. The proposal allows for unrestricted shooting in Ontario, both in terms of season and location. An open season especially during the busy spring summer and fall seasons poses a significant public safety risk. The proposal to permit hunting from a motorboat in particular increases the risks to rural residents, boaters and other water enthusiasts.\nFOCA\u2019s mission is To protect thriving and sustainable waterfronts across Ontario. As part of achieving this, FOCA recognizes that wildlife biology can be complex and by definition the management of species in complex systems requires careful consideration and the use of the best available science. This proposal should be science-based.\nWe also appreciate that there are concerns about double-crested cormorants and their local impacts, including from some of our members.  With respect to the proposed policy and changes to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act and related regulations:\nThe proposal does not appear to include an ecosystem-based approach to wildlife populations. The proposal fails to quantify the potential impact of the hunt on the population of Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario, or the potential impact on other wildlife species which could be affected. There are a considerable number of other bird species which could be disturbed from humans on or near colonies; and hunting activities will be detrimental to wildlife adjacent to cormorant populations.\nAmong other things, there appears to be no population management objective (population target) provincially or regionally. From the proposal, the objective of reducing overall populations (from what number, to what target number?) seems unsupported by the MNRF\u2019s existing data that indicates that the species\u2019 population is already stable or declining.\nNor does it describe a timeframe over which the proposal would be in place.  The MNRF should have a full and detailed rationale to provide justification for this proposal, including population level targets, describing how the cormorant population will be monitored (and this monitoring funded) to determine effects of the hunt and an evaluation of the negative impacts on non-target species. Should this proposal proceed, how will the impact on other species be monitored?\nNon-lethal management, deterrence and knocking down nests are not considered in this proposal, though according to the literature on the subject, these local, small scale management (such as deterrence and targeted culling) may be most appropriate.\nNesting failure caused by a cull may result in the dispersal of adults to other sites, and to the establishment of new colonies. There is no mention of this risk in the proposal.\nThere may be significant rationale for MNRF to consider a more tightly controlled, focused management approach, which would include the opportunity to consult the public.  Such targeted local action would allow for data to be collected (i.e., date, location, the number of birds shot); a target of the number of birds to be killed would be articulated; and disposal would properly occur, versus the current proposal which allows for spoilage of dead birds.\nWe hope that these comments are useful and will help to develop a more robust management strategy for cormorants in Ontario\nTerry Rees\nExecutive Director\n",

But I do not agree with the proposal being put forward by the MNRF. This proposal is simply doing harm to the reputation of hunters. The television stations have already picked up this story and interviewing some bird lovers and naturalists who are using this management proposal to portray hunters as trigger-happy bird killers. The proposal should not in any way be called a hunt. Enabling hunters to assist in cormorant population management is fine , providing it is called exactly what it is, and that is a cull. An option could be to add double-crested cormorants to the the list of species in Section 5(2) of the \"Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act\", and allow depredation permits to be issued.\nThe MNRF needs to engage in a media campaign to inform and educate the public on the reason for the need to take action to reduce the cormorant population. The MNRF should not be using hunters to short-circuit a necessary management process  that should include educating the public and managing the cormorant population without associating the term \"hunt\" in their proposal.\n",

However I feel very strongly that aggressive hunting is not appropriate or responsible. As others have pointed out, the population of cormorants will be re-balanced by natural forces in a far more effective manner.

        "comment":"Re: ERO number 013-4124\nThe Ottawa Field-Naturalists\u2019 Club strongly opposes the proposal to create a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants. The proposal will create major conservation challenges and negative ecological impacts. There are multiple reasons for this, outlined below.\nThe proposal states that certain groups and individuals have expressed concerns that Double-crested Cormorants are \u201cdetrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\u201d This statement is problematic and is not supported by scientifically valid evidence. All species interact with their environment and compete with other species; while at times this interaction can have an effect, this is a normal ecological process. As a native species, the participation of Double-crested Cormorants in the ecosystem should not be categorized as \u201cdetrimental\u201d but rather as \u201cnatural\u201d. While cormorants do eat fish, as do a multitude of other wildlife species, they do not specifically target game fish, and have been shown to put desirable predatory pressure on invasive species such as Round Goby and Alewife. Local tree death can occur in high-density nesting colonies and on some small islands, but on larger islands or within island groups, this is shown to increase the diversity of habitat and the diversity of insects present. Increased biodiversity contributes directly to increased ecological resiliency. \u201cAesthetics\u201d \u2013 whether a reference to the birds or their nesting habitats \u2013 is an entirely subjective concept unrelated to sustainability, and cannot be a basis for sound conservation management.\nThe proposed hunting season (15 March to 31 December) is excessively long and includes the nesting season. Conservation management programs typically protect the nesting season to ensure the sustainability of the managed species; this case should be no different. Historic experience shows that allowing hunting during nesting season can create rapid population declines, as well as lead to full or partial destruction of nests and nestlings, which is unjustifiable from either conservation or animal welfare perspectives. As well, other birds that share the nesting colonies of Double-crested Cormorants, including various species of gulls and herons, would also be disturbed by both hunting and carcass retrieval and thus subject to reduced nesting success.  The proposal permits an individual hunter to kill 50 cormorants per day, or a staggering 14,000 birds per hunting season. Given that cormorants tend to nest in a few dense and often readily-accessible colonies, a handful of hunters could wipe out much of the Ontario Great Lakes population in rather short order.\nAs well, the proposed hunting season includes the entire summer period, when other recreational uses (including boating, swimming, fishing, and birdwatching) of areas in and around cormorant habitats are common. Having an open hunting season throughout this time creates a significant human safety risk and denies the enjoyment of lakes and waterways to all other recreational users.\nFurthermore, the lack of a possession limit will make enforcement of the proposed bag limit and carcass recovery provisions extremely difficult. Allowing cormorant meat to spoil is a waste of a natural resource, and effectively permits wanton slaughter, which is inconsistent with responsible and sustainable conservation management.\nPerceived abundance is neither an indication of sustainability nor of a need for control. \u00a0The recent growth in the population of Double-crested Cormorants is not a new phenomenon, but rather a recovery from severe population declines caused by past persecution and the use of the pesticide DDT. Their continued presence may also facilitate the further recovery various birds of prey, which also suffered steep declines due to DDT but have been slower to rebound. Their recovery is a conservation success, and a return to an ecological role from which the species had been absent. As the proposal indicates, populations have recently \u201cstabilized or declined slightly,\u201d suggesting that adding hunting pressures would cause populations to decline once again. To protect biodiversity and ecological integrity, all of Ontario\u2019s native species should be permitted to thrive in natural environments, including those subjectively disliked by some people.\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Ottawa Field-Naturalists\u2019 Club encourages the Ministry to reject the proposal.\nSincerely,\nDiane Lepage\nOttawa Field Naturalists\u2019 Club President\nOwen Clarkin\nChair of the Conservation Committee, Ottawa Field Naturalists' Club\n",

He writes:\n\"The Government of Ontario's current proposal to introduce an open hunting season on Double-crested Cormorants from March 15 to December 31 each year has no basis in scientific knowledge and neglects the interests of a wide variety of citizens who interact with wildlife without killing them. This document offers a critique of the government's proposal while citing the relevant scientific knowledge. Often-repeated concerns by some hunters and recreational anglers that cormorants negatively impact fish populations, forest habitat, and other species have been thoroughly qualified or debunked. Notably, lethal management of waterbirds does not address the root causes of fish population instability or decline, and directly contradicts current conservation measures at local, regional, national, and international levels.\nThe government's hunting proposal is gratuitous, irresponsible, and cruel.\"\nHumans are the most destructive species on the planet and sadly no superior being gets the luxury of deciding to kill us all. Why are we doing that to other beings? This government needs to evolve and stop killing animals.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing today to strongly opposed the new proposal regarding cormorants hunting and listing them as \"Game Birds\". The opinion of small groups of people with a biased opinion on cormorants does not justify the mass killing of cormorants. Birds will be virtually used for target practice, and because they are inedible, these birds can be left to suffer, diet and rot. These birds are filled with shot - most of which is lead which means other species could be poisoned and our environment will be further contaminated with a highly toxic heavy metal. The opinions and complaints of a small group should by no means, lead to the annihilation of entire colonies of a native Ontarian species and putting them at risk of extreme suffering. Hunting of cormorants aren't new but this proposal is at a whole new level and it will lead to decimation of entire colonies. Not only is this proposal environmentally unsound and will not solve the problem, but leaving injured and dying birds to waste and rot is unethical and wasteful. Witnesses have seen horribly injured birds left suffering in the water and on land after hunters have moved on.\nI find overall that this proposal is deeply disturbing, and it is highly doubtful that cormorants are to blame for reduced fish stocks and pollution. As we know, human activities are the leading culprit of environmental destruction, habitat destruction, environmental deterioration, species extinction, and fish stock depletion due to over-fishing.\nCormorants are native to Ontario and have a strong presence in our natural environment and ecological balance. There is no scientific evidence showing cormorants are to blame for fish stock depletion or environmental degradation. This proposal is aimed simply to appease a small group of biased members of the public including hunters and home-owners who would benefit from this expanded hunt and is not justifiable by any means.\nI would like to see our Ontario government focus on wildlife protection, conservation as well as habitat preservation. This proposal on Cormorant hunting is barbaric, cruel, wasteful and I strongly oppose this from moving forward. Wildlife numbers are continually diminishing in Canada and cormorants being native to Canada, need to be protected. I further ask that the Ontario government to take steps to tighten up the protection of our natural environment and wildlife to prevent them from groups of interest who want to continue to exploit and degrade our natural environment and resources further. I think that extensive field studies from marine biologists, scientists, zoologists and environmentalists need to be done to come up with an ethically and environmentally responsible solution. This current proposal is unsound and I urge you to dismiss it immediately.\nThank you for your time.\nToktam,\n",

The Kawartha Lakes have been facing declining walleye populations for years and the cormorants are the largest problem in my opinion, among other problems. A cull may allow the walleye populations to recover.\nIf the MNR and OFAH were truly interested in making the cull a success they would allow shotgun plugs to be removed and allow the shooting of them from a moving boat. This should be allowed for the time period outside of the migratory game bird season. During the migratory game bird season regular laws should apply. Non toxic shot only makes sense all year round for waterfowl. With these two changes I'm sure the success rate of the cull would be greatly increased. In my opinion, a complete success would be no more cormorants anywhere outside their traditional range which would be limited to the St. Lawrence and the Atlantic coast.\n",

It will suck up enforcement time and social media management time that should be devoted to other more pressing problems.\nFinally, this smacks of a kill the predators (or the ugly) and feeds the groups of hunters who believe predators should be suppressed for the benefit of ungulate hunters\/ turkey hunters etc. The question is what is next and why would MNRF say no to any proposals.\nI imagine loons should be on the list however they have distinctive looks and a haunting call.

In particular, the proposal to allow hunters to kill 50 cormorants per day could feasibly permit the eradication of the entire species from the Great Lakes in a single year, assuming below average hunter engagement. More specifically, if only 1 in 100 Ontarian hunters each killed only 50 cormorants over an entire hunting season, this would still be enough to eradicate the species from the Great Lakes entirely. The Double-crested Cormorant is a native species to Ontario whose population has only recently recovered from human persecution and pollution-induced declines. This is no time to be stepping backwards. This species has a right to exist and feed on its native land, and the government has an ethical and legal responsibility to ensure its relative health.\nEthically speaking, such a proposition is unacceptably inhumane and could easily destroy the relative health that this species' population has only recently begun to enjoy.\nDo the math: The Canadian Nature Survey (FPTGC, 2014) reports that about 709,500 Ontarians participate in hunting activities. If only 1 in every 100 of these hunters participated in this type of kill, this would lead to nearly 8 million dead cormorants in a single year alone, not adjusting for nestling and fledglings mortality due to parental death [Calculation note: 14,190,000 x 5% = 709,500 number of hunters in Ontario (5% of total Ontario population figure taken from the Canadian Nature Survey - FPTGC, 2014). 1 in 100 hunters: 709,500 x 1% = 7095. This many hunters killing 50 cormorants a day for 22 days in a year: 7095 x 50 x 22 = 7,804,500 cormorants dead.]. The entire Great Lakes population is estimated at only about 250,000 birds, and the entire global population is estimated at about 2 million (Dorr et al. 2014).\n",

His lack of knowledge was notable.\nHe hadn't bothered to find out the limits and seasons for other game birds. He didn't have any particular reason for allowing 50 cormorants\/day per hunter from March 15 to December 31, which includes the breeding season. He merely said that they had to float a number to make a proposal. Allowing 14,000\/year for each hunter without research to back up the number is irresponsible.\nTo our eyes, cormorants may be \"destroying\" the environment and may be perceived as a \"nuisance.\" But neither of these things relate to sustainability; basing hunting decisions on them isn't sound conservation management. Cormorants are effective at controlling invasive species of fish and don't target game fish specifically. Local tree death occurs but this is shown to increase the diversity of habitat and insects, increasing biodiversity that contributes to ecological resiliency.\nThe timing on this is also unfortunate. Why now? The population of cormorants has recently stabilized and even declined slightly after having been almost wiped out by DDT. 18 years is a very short time in terms of ecology. Why not wait, get the appropriate information, then make a decision based on real data? Maybe the population will stabilize on its own. Maybe the population \"explosion\" is just part of a natural recovery. We just don't know yet.\nI'm also concerned about a hunting season that overlaps with other seasonal recreational activities  near cormorant habitats. This create a safety risk for people who are boating, swimming, bird watching, etc. Shouldn't recreational users, who bring significant economic benefits, be allowed to enjoy lakes without worrying about being accidentally shot?

        "comment":"To the MInistry of Environment,\nI am writing because I feel the current proposal of the Cormorant hunt is both excessive and not based on sound science.  Based on the suggested numbers this hunt would lead to extinction of a species which I find bewildering.  Dwindling fish for recreational fishing is not a result from a species that is naturally part of a ecosystem but government mis-managment of fisheries and monitoring and controlling of pollution in our great lakes. To kill of a species is not going to solve that and our fisheries is still going to decline. To quote from Edward Kroc in his blog:\n*** Dozens of studies over the past three decades have repeatedly shown that cormorants do not have a significant negative impact on commercial fish populations, with most of these studies targeted specifically on the Great Lakes. For example, studies on Lake Ontario indicate that fish most attractive to human fishermen (Lake Trout and Salmon) comprise less than 2% of cormorant diets, and that cormorants consume about 0.5% of critical prey fish, an insignificant number especially when compared against the 13% taken by sport fishermen (Weseloh & Collier 1995). Many other studies that fail to show a meaningful impact of cormorants on open fisheries are discussed in Reed et al. 2003. Moreover, it is well known that cormorant diets consist of mostly nonsport fish species like the invasive Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) (e.g. see Belyea et al. 1999, Reed et al. 2003). Anglers have been shown to impose far more stress on their preferred fish populations than cormorants do on theirs (Ridgway et al. 2012)..\nPlease suspend all plans for this hunt and look for more humane and reasonable solutions to the problems in our fisheries.\n",

        "comment":"The regulatory impact statement of this proposal reads:\n\"The anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral.\"\nand\n\"The anticipated economic consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral but depend on levels of hunter participation.\"\nYet, the proposal states that the proposal is a response to concerns of the commercial fishing industry [among others], and prompted by the effect of cormorants on island habitats, other species. The proposed hunting season is referred to as a \"population management tool\".\nThere seems to be a contradiction between the purported objective of the proposal and the expected outcome. In fact the impact statement amounts to an admission of the expected ineffectiveness of what is proposed toward its objectives.\nThis leads to the conclusion that the proposal might be motivated by other interests, put forward by certain special interest groups that the proposal alludes to. This includes the fishing industry (cf proposal, 2nd paragraph) and \"Those interested in hunting cormorants\" (cf regulatory impact statement), as well as \"property owners\"  (cf proposal, 2nd paragraph) who are concerned about aesthetics.  In other words, the proposal is solely designed for the benefit of groups who like to kill and groups who don't mind killing for aesthetical reasons.\nThe conclusion that one has to reach is that the proposed measure is for the benefit of special interest groups. It is morally doubtful. It should not be passed.\n",

Cormorants are an invasive \u201cvirus\u201d and if they aren\u2019t controlled, they will continue to prey on actual native species (ones that contribute to outfitters and tourism success, and the overall enjoyment of Ontario residents) until they decimate these fisheries and move on to the next one to destroy.

I enjoy the out-doors.\nThis proposal has nothing to do with skills required for hunting, it is clearly a slaughter of a native species from a parked boat 10 m away from a breeding colony of several species including protected water birds. Shooting birds sitting on a nest or flying into nests feeding young was never something any serious hunter has supported. Hunters do not like to shoot any wildlife just to shoot for the kill only and the thought hundreds of un-retrievable carcasses washing up on beached during the summer month, is disgusting and no serious hunter should allow.\nAs a OFAH member for 25 years, I was surprised to received no consultation about this,\nThis reads as it was written by suspender wearing politicians with a hate for wildlife.\nAs a fisherman, I was concerned years ago that cormorants are reducing game fish in Lake Ontario, where I regularly fish for 30 years.\nHowever I have not seen a reduction of game fish during all these years. Finding several studies, indicating that cormorant are mostly feeding on invasive fish species and only 3 % of game species are taking, does not comes as a surprise.\nThis proposal will only increase the hate for hunting and fishing by the public and people will right fully use the name blood sport against us.\nPlease do stop this proposal, there is no need for it.\n.\n",

This wild native species has rebounded from historic lows in the 1970s and populations have been stable or declining since the 2000s.\nAccording to the Canadian Wildlife Service, cormorants are not competing with commercial fishers as they feed primarily on small, largely non-commercial, shallow-water fish. Only a small percentage of their diet consists of \u201csport fish.\u201d\nConcerned property owners already have recourse, under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, to harass, capture or kill cormorants if they\u2019re causing property damage.\nThe extreme bag limit allowing an individual to kill 50 birds a day for nine-and-a-half months of the year, including the breeding season, is without precedent and could cause significant harm to this and other native wildlife species.\nI urge you to abandon this ill-considered proposal.\n",

Their numbers began to increase rapidly from the 1970s to the early 2000s, with the latest information indicating Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly.\nNo further information is supplied to explain why the population allegedly \u201cincrease[d] rapidly\u201d, nor why it might now be in decline. Nor is any evidence (population counts, for instance) supplied to support the statements in the paragraph.\nIn my view, the Ministry does a disservice by inviting public input without making readily available the data upon which you relied to make these statements. If you have statistics to back up these statements (and I would be very disappointed to learn that you don\u2019t), you should provide them or offer a link(s) to the data. Not providing this information calls into question your claim that this is a species that needs to be \u2018controlled\u2019 in some manner (i.e. killed). You should back up your position with readily available, provable facts.\nThe proposal\u2019s second paragraph reads:\nThere continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\nPresumably the word \u2018aesthetics\u2019 is a reference to the fact that, like every other species on earth, cormorants poop. But surely the Ministry cannot consider that sufficient cause for the proposed change under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act that would clearly create the potential of extirpating this species completely.\nThe primary driver of this proposed hunting season would appear to be, then, to satisfy complaints and concerns from commercial fishers. With respect, the science is abundantly clear that commercial fishers and cormorants are not seeking the same prey. Whatever other concerns commercial fishers might have, they can\u2019t defend a position that cormorants are competing for the same fish as the fishers.\nThe proposed regulatory changes are unwarranted, ill-considered, and not in the public interest:\n\u2022\tThe proposed changes are unwarranted because the Ministry has offered no evidence to support that this is a species that has worn out its welcome and needs to be dramatically cut down to size. Since you don\u2019t offer any evidence to support the need for the hunt, I can presume it is being proposed simply to placate commercial fishers who don\u2019t appear to understand who are their real competitors, and to satisfy hunters who enjoy the simple pleasure of killing things, just because they can.\n\u2022\tThe proposed changes are ill-considered because of the cavalier way the Ministry proposes to implement them. Let\u2019s begin with the numbers of cormorants hunters will be permitted to kill. The bag limit of 50 birds per day over a 291-day period (March 15 to December 31) means every hunter can kill at least 14, 550 cormorants per year \u201cwith no possession limit\u201d. I say \u2018at least\u2019 because there will be no practical way to monitor how many they really kill, since it is also proposed to grant permission to just leave the birds lying around to rot. And since they can shoot the birds from stationary boats (your proposal says motorboat but I presume non-powered boats will also have this privilege), dead birds can bob along in the water until they wash up on a shoreline somewhere.\nAs well, shotguns fired into a cormorant colony are going to end up killing more than just cormorants. This will include many other species who nest or feed in close proximity to cormorants.\n\u2022\tThe proposed changes are not in the public interest because they will allow for shooting of birds in Toronto. In case it has escaped MNRF notice, Toronto is a densely populated city and it will only be a matter of time before some hunter misses the birds and hits a kid. It is also not in the public interest because, frankly, why would the public be eager to have lots of dead birds lying on the ground, rotting and stinking (or floating in the water, rotting and stinking)?\nYou must realize as well those carcasses will attract a substantial rat population \u2013 perhaps you should canvass the public on whether they\u2019d prefer to leave the birds alone or to invite an explosion of rats and other carrion-feeders.\nPerhaps you should also survey the public to determine how they feel about the inevitable large numbers of birds who are shot, but not killed. Ask them how they feel about the birds being left to die from starvation or the lingering effects of bad marksmanship.\nYour proposal also notes:\nTo accompany the proposed hunting seasons, the Ministry will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends. Monitoring of cormorants will allow the Ministry to assess the impacts of the hunting season and to adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns about population sustainability.\nWith respect, isn\u2019t that the sort of survey that ought to be undertaken before the birds are killed?\nIn short, there is no merit to these proposed changes and the Ministry is encouraged to withdraw the proposal unless (or until) proper investigation is undertaken to determine that there is any supportable rationale to moving forward with it.\n",

As a canoeist and a hunter I've seen Island that were previously green and full of trees reduced to barren rocks once the Cormorants take over. Dickson Lake in Algonquin park would be one example, Islands on the lake are completely destroyed due to these pests. This may also explain why the blue green algae is taking over the lake although I can't say for sure. As an invasive species Cormorants are spreading out in a way that can only be negative for the areas affected. I don't remember seeing a single Cormorant on the French River prior to about 15 years ago and now they are everywhere and the effects are in plain sight, dead trees, particularly on small islands that Moose use when calving. Provincial parks clearly will not benefit from this legislation as hunting is prohibited and there should be additional measures to keep these invaders in check in those locations as well.

As a citizen who owns a cottage on Big Rideau Lake (Rideau canal system) in Eastern Ontario, certainly, we`d like to see their numbers go down, but we can also live with the colony that is currently existing on the lake.\nmy only real concern relates to safety.  The idea of waterskiing, swimming, boating around hunters shooting these birds raises a bit of a safety concern.  Thus, I would think a limit on the hours of the day during the summer or similar restrictions during boating season might be a good idea.\nFor example, on Big Rideau Lake, the cormorants largely gather on one very small island and there is a major boat mooring area in the immediate vicinity on Colonel By island for travellers of the Rideau System as well as local boaters.  The idea of hunters shooting the birds while all these boaters are around seems like very contradictory uses of the lake and represents a bit of a safety issue in my mind.\nIf issues like this were addressed, I would likely have no strong objection to a cormorant hunting but would want to ensure they remain a part of the ecosystem.\n",

Establishing a 9 month hunting period (March through December) that includes the months of heavy recreation use such as pleasure boating, fishing, swimming, kayaking \/ canoeing and cottagers is not acceptable.  The general activity of hunters shooting shotguns from boats and the noise penetrating tranquil summer settings will be intolerable.\n2. This policy states that killed Cormorants need not be retrieved. Guidelines endorse leaving Cormorant carcasses to decay. Exposure to the sight and stench of multiple rotting birds is not compatible with what the general recreational user and shoreline resident expects of Ontario lake and river management policy.\n3.  This policy encourages the hunting of Cormorants during the same months as other desirable birds such as Blue Heron nest. The Blue Heron use similar environments for nesting as Cormorants. The noise and activity produced by Cormorant hunting would significantly disrupt nesting and survival of young desirable birds.\n4.  My experience with hunters is mixed. Unfortunately, not all hunters respect guidelines and identify (knowingly or unknowingly) the legal target. How many loons, and ducks will be doomed by the trigger happy and misinformed?\nThis policy as proposed requires massive revision. Consultation with a broad range of stakeholders and biologists should generate a superior common sense, evidence based policy.\n",

According to the posting on the Environmental Registry, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responding to \u201cconcerns expressed by some groups\u201d (commercial fishing industry, property owners) about impacts of cormorants on fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics. This so-called \u201cpopulation management tool\u201d is lacking, however, in any scientific justification or evidence. The extreme bag limit allowing an individual to kill 50 birds a day for nine-and-a-half months of the year, including the breeding season, is without precedent and could cause significant harm to this and other native wildlife species.\nOntario Nature is a charitable conservation organization that protects wild species and wild spaces throughout Ontario. Established in 1931, we represent more than 155 member groups and over 30,000 individual members and supporters across the province.\nThe David Suzuki Foundation, through a combination of sound science and active public engagement, motivates Canadians to take action on the environmental challenges we collectively face. Since 1990, DSF has worked with communities, government, business and conservation allies to help people find solutions for living within the limits of nature.\nFor the reasons outlined below, our organizations urge the Government of Ontario to withdraw the ill-advised proposal to establish a hunting season for double-created cormorants.\n1. No science-based justification for the hunt.\nCormorant populations have rebounded from historic lows in the 1970s, after the species suffered steep declines because of exposure to environmental contaminants. Their recovery is considered a Great Lakes conservation success story. As recognized by MNRF, cormorant populations in the Great Lakes have stabilized or declined slightly since the early 2000s. This fact alone would suggest that the proposed hunt is unwarranted.\nFurther, this purported \u201cpopulation management tool\u201d is lacking in any scientific justification or evidence. There is no information provided about the current cormorant population size, the population management target, the rationale for the high daily bag limit, or the plan to monitor and assess impacts. The proposal fails to consider the complex interactions of double-crested cormorants with other aquatic and terrestrial species, including fish populations.\nRegarding the concern that cormorants are impacting fish populations, Professor Gail Fraser at York University notes that there are many factors that could impact the abundance of a fish population, including predation by humans, fish and other waterbirds, competition with other prey, water temperature and climate change. Consequently, in order to understand these relationships \u201crigorous scientific studies are required for each fish population consumed by cormorants.\u201d (http:\/\/gsfraser.blog.yorku.ca\/research\/conservation\/proposed-cormorant-\u2026).\nSome studies indicate that cormorants can have a negative impact on local fisheries, such as yellow perch (Brian S. Dorr and David G. Fielder, http:\/\/wildlife.org\/the-rise-of-double-crested-cormorants-too-much-of-a\u2026 ). According to the Canadian Wildlife Service, however, cormorants feed primarily on small, largely non-commercial, shallow-water fish (e.g., non-native rainbow smelt and alewife). Only a small percentage of their diet consists of \u2018sport fish\u2019 such as lake trout or salmon (Environment Canada, 1995, Fact Sheet: \u201cThe rise of the Double-crested Cormorant on the Great Lakes: WINNING THE WAR AGAINST CONTAMINANTS\u201d). A study on the Niagara River showed that up to 85 percent of the cormorants\u2019 diet during the breeding season consisted of the invasive, non-native round goby (Jeremy T. H. Coleman et al., 2012. \u201cEating the Invaders: The Prevalence of Round Goby (Apollonia melanostomus) in the Diet of Double-Crested Cormorants on the Niagara River,\u201d Waterbirds). Professor Jim Quinn from McMaster University likewise confirms that studies he has been involved with show that cormorants are feeding mostly on problem fish such as non-native round goby and alewife (https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/9059210-nature-not-bullets-should-co\u2026).\n2. Inconsistency with standards and norms for wildlife management and hunting under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.\nThe proposed hunt is inconsistent with basic standards of wildlife management and hunting. Notably, it would allow hunting to occur throughout the breeding season and at breeding colonies, likely leading to nest failure and chick starvation. Since both members of a cormorant pair are required for nest success, the killing of either parent would result in chick starvation.\nThe proposed hunt also includes a plan to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act which currently prohibits anyone who kills game wildlife from allowing the meat to spoil. The Ministry intends to add provisions so that hunters could allow cormorant carcasses to spoil. Permitting this wastage of a \u2018game\u2019 species would be unprecedented in Ontario. Though classifying cormorants as game is questionable in and of itself, since the bird is inedible.\n3. Potential to cause significant harm to double-crested cormorants, a wild native species in Ontario.\nWe challenge the government\u2019s misleading claim that \u201cthe anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral.\u201d Anyone with a small game hunting license will be able to kill up to 50 birds a day, with no possession limit, from March 15 until December 31 each year. That\u2019s potentially more than 14,000 birds per hunter per season \u2013 essentially unlimited killing. As noted by Bird Studies Canada, \u201csuch a level of hunting would lead to local and\/or regional extirpations, as well as reduction provincially to token remnant populations.\u201d\n4. Potential to harm other wildlife species in Ontario\nAs noted by Professor Gail Fraser and by Bird Studies Canada, the proposed hunt poses a risk to other waterbirds, particularly those nesting with cormorants such as great blue herons, great egrets, black-crowned night-herons, Caspian terns, common terns and great black-backed gulls. Because the hunt is to be allowed throughout the breeding season and at breeding colonies, other nesting birds may be displaced or even killed.\nThe proposed hunt also endangers common loons, as they are difficult for many to distinguish from cormorants on the water.\n5. Lack of enforcement capacity.\nGiven the scope of the hunt (nine-and-a-half month duration, high daily bag limit, no possession limit, permission to let carcasses rot) the enforcement capacity of MNRF would need to be greatly expanded to enable monitoring and ensure effective enforcement of the law. Additional resources for monitoring and enhanced enforcement are unlikely to be available given the government\u2019s ongoing efforts to cut back on public expenditures.\n6. Risk to public safety and enjoyment.\nThe government is proposing that hunters be able to shoot cormorants from stationary boats throughout the open water season \u2013 when boaters, cottagers and other outdoor recreationists are also out on the water. This poses a safety risk as the hunting season will overlap with the peak period of outdoor water-based recreation (spring and summer).\n7. Property owners already have the power to address concerns about property damage.\nRegarding concerns about property damage, the proposed hunt is unnecessary as property owners already have recourse, under section 31 of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act,  to harass, capture or kill cormorants if they\u2019re causing property damage:\nProtection of property\n31 (1) If a person believes on reasonable grounds that wildlife is damaging or is about to damage the person\u2019s property, the person may, on the person\u2019s land,\n(a) harass the wildlife for the purpose of deterring it from damaging the person\u2019s property; or\n(b) capture or kill the wildlife.  1997, c. 41, s. 31 (1).\nIn closing, we agree with the assessment of Birds Studies Canada that \u201cthe proposed bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no possession limit over a nine and a half month open season is exceptionally high, unsustainable, and without precedent under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for its failure to address the need for population sustainability.\u201d\nWe urge you to abandon the proposed hunt.\nYours truly,\nDr. Anne Bell\nDirector of Conservation and Education\nRachel Plotkin\nOntario Science Project Manager\nThe David Suzuki Foundation\n",

Formed over thirty years ago, OFO\u2019s 1,200 members include people from all regions of Ontario and all walks of life including scientists, environmental consultants, wildlife biologists and general bird watchers.\nOFO is opposed to the proposed hunting legislation for the Double-crested Cormorant. While OFO acknowledges that many people do not like cormorants or their colonies, aesthetic preference in no way justifies a hunt.  The proposal ignores much of the scientific evidence regarding cormorants, puts protected bird species at risk and dismisses proven, non-lethal methods of managing cormorant populations.\nApart from the impact on cormorants and other bird species, the legislation potentially puts others who share the waterways during the proposed hunting season at risk.  Shooting from boats during the summer months: June, July and August, is not compatible with recreational uses of our lakes and rivers.\nReasons Why OFO is Opposed to the Cormorant Hunting Proposal\n1)\tKilling Cormorants During Breeding Season\nWith a hunting season extending from 15 March to 31 December, the bill would allow hunting precisely during the regular breeding season of cormorants, approximately April - July. This would include the time when cormorants have young in the nest and when those young are totally dependent upon constant care from their parents.  The young of adult cormorants, who would be shot, would die from exposure and\/or starvation. No other \"game\" bird is hunted during its breeding season or on its breeding colonies or while tending its nests.\n2)\tRisk to Protected Bird Species\nCormorants seldom nest alone, by themselves, in single species colonies. In Ontario, they almost always nest with one or more of the following groups of colonial water birds: gulls, terns herons, egrets and pelicans. These species are protected by federal migratory bird legislation or provincial legislation.\nDischarging shotguns at or near cormorant nesting colonies, including shooting at flying birds and shooting adults on their nests \u2013 both in trees and on the ground, would be an enormous disturbance to all of these co-habiting species. It is almost a certainty that these protected species will be accidentally killed or will abandon their nests due to disturbance or associate incidental predation and consequently their young would also die. Thus, shooting cormorants on their nesting colony and causing disturbance (or injury or death) to other nearby or interspersed nesting colonial water birds (which would be inevitable) would be a violation of the Migratory Bird Convention Act. This would put provincially licensed cormorant hunters at risk of legal prosecution on violation of federal migratory bird statutes.\n3)\tPublic hunting is not the appropriate method for Managing Ontario\u2019s Double-crested Cormorant  Population\nSince cormorants are virtually inedible, the only possible rationale for a cormorant hunt is to attempt to reduce their populations. The evidence is mixed on whether cormorants have a significant effect on sport fish populations.\nThere is strong evidence that Ontario\u2019s cormorant population has stabilized and has even declined in some areas of Ontario (Lakes Huron and Superior) due to regime shifts in their food supply. There is no need to shoot cormorants to stabilize or reduce their population. Population reduction can be achieved through less intrusive methods than shooting, e.g. egg-oiling.\n4)\tShooting is Not Required to Manage Cormorant Colonies\nIf management is deemed necessary to restrict colony expansion at specific sites and limit further damage to trees, less intrusive\/non-intrusive methods have proven extremely effective and do not harm protected species nesting in, or adjacent to colonies.\nMethods which do not require killing hatched birds include: human presence during nest site selection and post-breeding dispersal, egg oiling, provision of ground nesting materials and destroying nests prior to egg-laying. Egg oiling is a very effective means to limit cormorant productivity and has already been used to great success on some ground-nesting cormorant colonies on the Great Lakes.\n5)\tDaily Bag Limit is Unenforceable\nThe proposed daily bag limit of 50 birds with no possession limit is essentially unenforceable. At the end of a full week, a determined hunter could legally shoot 350 cormorants. What is less certain is how many would be retrieved due to the location of hunting (some might fall into crotches of tree or tangled vegetation) or because of their weight, or because of shooting on open water (some might be lost underwater, etc.).  Unretrieved birds would jeopardize a hunter's claim to have stayed within the daily limit, if confronted by a conservation officer requiring proof.\n6)\tSocial Impacts\nOFO notes that there is a suite of negative social impacts to the proposed legislation. Among these are:\n\u2022\tLoss of confidence in the Ontario government's support for environmental protection, ecosystem management and conservation principles\n\u2022\tExacerbation of strife and conflict between hunters and non-hunters\n\u2022\tThe mis-conception of this as a \"hunting season\", which it is not. Classifying cormorants as \"game\" under the FWCA does not make this proposed activity hunting. Hunting involves eating what is procured.\n\u2022\tHuman safety (e.g., shooting from boats, shooting with shotguns over open water, shooting near areas where recreation is occurring during the highest water-based recreation time in the calendar year). This invites conflict with the non-hunting recreational public.\nIn conclusion, OFO urges the Ontario Government to withdraw the proposal. If a cormorant management strategy is required, it should be founded on strong science and should not impact protected species. Apart from any other consideration, the danger to others, who also use the waterways, should be of foremost concern.\nOntario Field Ornithologists (OFO)\n",

Real hunters would not want to shoot anything they cannot eat and leave the carcasses to rot.  So who is left to shoot these birds? Only those who get a thrill out of shooting.\n4. Hunting should never be permitted during breeding season as proposed.  It is inhumane.\n5. There is no scientific evidence to support that cormorants are destroying the fishing industry nor that the cormorant population is out of control.  It is a population that has stabilized itself.  Nature has a way of doing that without human interference.  However, if you feel and can show that it is a population that is causing harm,then there are better ways of controlling that population.  Egg-oiling is one way.\n6. Shooting during the summer months when the lakes are crowded with people enjoying recreational activities just puts the public at risk. It will not be long before someone gets shot and if you think there is a public outcry now, just wait until then.\n7. Other species, protected species, nest in the same area as cormorants.  As protected species, they cannot be harmed and yet there is a danger they will be, and if not actually killed, shooting will disrupt their nesting ability.\nPlease seriously consider abandoning what can only be classified as a ridiculous proposal.\n",

I'm not opposed to a DC Cormorant hunting proposal on principal or in general, but I truly can't believe how poorly justified or thought out this proposal seems to be.  The only justification I can find in this proposal is that:\n\"There continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\"\nIs this it?  And if so, so what??  Concerns aren't science, and concerns shouldn't be acted upon without a good understanding of the consequences.  Furthermore, as a government agency, a proposal shouldn't be put out to the public for comment without outlining your understandings of the issue, the science, and with a thorough explanation of why your decision was made.  Where's the science that says DC Cormorants are truly a problem to fish, to forest habitat?  Where's the science that shows this hunting proposal will help fix it, and that it won't have other consequences (for example, impacts to other colonial nesting birds or a bunch of rotting dead Cormorant carcuses laying around or hanging in trees)?  Better yet, where's the counter-information, i.e., why not include information on the concerns expressed by (what I assume) are the many groups opposed to this proposal so that the public can be informed before they decide on the merits and provide comments on your proposal?\nWithout any of this info provided I am completely  opposed to this proposal.\n",

        "comment":"I would like to express my deep concern about the proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario.  I am specifically concerned about:\n1.  The safety danger the hunters will pose to families pursuing recreational pursuits such as walking to enjoy natural areas near water bodies and boating or fishing on our waterways.\n2.  The impact on other wildlife species.  All species exist in an inter-related ecosystem and there may well be serious and long-term side effects that will be a surprise to those proposing the hunting.  As a bird watcher I am particularly concerned about the collateral damage to other bird species that nest with cormorant colonies such as gulls, terns, herons, egrets and pelicans.  There is also the risk that uneducated hunters will confuse other species such as loons in the water with cormorants and kill them too.\n3.  I am concerned that many dead carcasses will be left in place to rot or will be collected and then dumped in natural areas or weighted down to sink into lakes.  These will attract and increase the numbers of vermin, insects, and scavengers with unknown effects.  There is also the risk of increasing the spread of diseases to other wildlife and to humans who are out enjoying nature.  The stench of rotting meat will probably be much worse that the guano smell that some complain about now.\nWhile I am not opposed to hunting for sustenance purposes, I am opposed to this specific proposal to amend the hunting regulations.\nI urge you to base any proposed regulations on science not just on concerns from some members of the public.  Where studies show that a reduction in cormorant numbers is warranted in specific local areas then there should first be consideration given to many other techniques that have proven effective in similar situations such as egg oiling or human disturbance in nesting areas that do not have the same dangerous side effects.  Specific targeted culling by professionals using firearms should only be allowed by special permit where these other measures prove ineffective.\nThank you for your consideration in this urgent matter,\nA concerned taxpayer.\n",

While cormorants appear to be a nuisance to some landowners, the proposed solution is extreme. This bird population has already undergone significant declines and has had to rebound one before. The extremely high bag limit puts their populations at risk and seems wildly disproportionate to the damage that they currently cause. This is particularly stark as this regulation would allow hunting during the breeding season, unlike any other game bird, and allow spoilage. The proposed hunt is simply a license to slaughter needlessly, particularly when there are other methods of deterring cormorants which have been proven to be effective. Moreover the quantities allowed could potentially wipe out the Great Lakes population of cormorants entirely.\nAll scientific evidence flies in opposition to this policy. Cormorants are not significantly problematic to sport fishers, nor do they cause problems to other wildlife. Scientific monitoring should already be in place before any policy decisions such as this are made, not after.\nReject this proposal and indeed, if it is necessary to control the cormorant population, establish a better strategy with decisions based off of evidence.\n",

Perhaps it could be considered game or prey to other predatory species, but not for human hunting. Introduce and increase the populations of other predator species in Ontario in order to control prey populations. This proposal is simply another example of the provincial government being fiscally wasteful, inefficient, ineffective, and prioritizing pro-hunting lobbies over Canadians and Ontario wildlife.  The range of these birds in Ontario only spans the southern border and great lakes, and most of this is breeding territory. Hunting could have a devastating impact on nesting birds and babies and may drive the species out of the province entirely. This proposal looks to erase the biodiversity of Ontario and drive away lucrative ecotourism opportunities.\nThese birds have been previously decimated by human activities including the widespread use of DDT and through culls initiated by local fishing industries when these birds are simply consuming the fish they need to survive. It is thought that the great lakes populations have rebounded due to the abundance of non-native alewife fish. Perhaps the more logical approach to the population control of this bird species would be to focus efforts on enhancing and promoting the survival of native fish populations.\nAn open hunting season from March to December is effectively the entire span of time they come to breed and enjoy living in Ontario. With regards to hunting from a stationary boat, what kind of power\/ability will government authority have in enforcing this? This seems like a rule that is impossible to enforce, will be largely ignored, and even if a hunter is caught and properly prosecuted it won't matter much to the victim. This is not a game of tag where if the predator does not follow the rules the prey gets another chance.\nThis Ontarian says do better. If fisherman and hunters want to eliminate something that is considered inedible and overpopulated, they can hunt each other.\n",

I think it is an interesting and good looking bird, and it is native to our province.\nI am dismayed to learn that all it has taken to open the hunting season on these birds is: \"concerns expressed by some groups\". What concerns? Are these concerns backed-up by some authoritative observation and study?\nI am dismayed to hear that all it takes to move my government to such drastic action is: \"concerns expressed by some groups\". This seems to be a politically-motivated action on the part of the government, and motivation such as this cannot make for good legislation.\nSince I do not see any legitimate basis or justification for this proposed hunt, I am 100% opposed to it. Make the effort to provide justification and you may gain my support.\n",

How many property owners, for example, complained that the cormorants were doing damage to their properties or impacting their enjoyment of their properties. Will the indiscriminate slaughter of 1000s of cormorants actually even solve these problems? The case hasn't been made.\nTheir seems to be an expectation that hunters will buy into this program. I spoke with a couple of hunters that are friends and they said they wouldn't be wasting any of their money or time [i.e. gas for boats, etc] to hunt cormorants. In fact they were upset that the government was expecting them to do their [the government's] \"dirty-work\"\nIn closing, I am totally opposed to the indiscriminate, widespread slaughter of cormorants as a way to solve a supposed problem that is not carefully defined. If there needs to be some control at a very local level other commenters have carefully laid out how this has been successfully done in other jurisdictions.\n",

        "comment":"Attn: Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and the Ontario Government,\nI would like to submit my strong formal objection to this proposal. I believe this is purely a political move, bending to whim of certain stakeholders, such as those in the commercial fishing industry, who's general beliefs about the Double-crested Cormorant are not founded in scientific study, but in generational myths.\nDouble-crested Cormorants (DCCO) are a native Ontario bird who's population is just recently stabilizing after nearly being wiped out by the use of environmental contaminants several decades ago. Their return to the Great Lakes has been heralded as one of the greatest environmental success stories in recent times. As the proposal itself states, the population is considered \"stable or declining\". If that is the case then why is this CULL, being disguised as a hunt, even being proposed?\nDCCO are social colony nesters, and just like most other seabird colonies, they can nest in great numbers and reduce vegetation in very localized areas in their nesting sites. Perhaps to some it may be unsightly, but it is a natural ecological process, and aesthetics alone is a very weak reason to cull a native species. These barren nesting sites and dead vegetation benefit other species of plants, animals and insects, which thrive in that type of environment.\nCormorants rarely nest alone - they often co-nest with other species which are protected under the Migratory Bird Convention Act, such as Great Blue Herons and Black-crowned Night Herons, Great Egrets, Ring-billed Gulls, Herring Gulls, Caspian and Common Terns and Ontario's only American White Pelicans. Many of these other sensitive species are declining in Ontario, and hunting activity surrounding Cormorant colonies are likely to disturb or incidentally kill these other birds, which would be a direct violation of the Migratory Bird Convention Act. Also of concern is the close resemblance on the water that cormorants bear with other protected diving birds, such as Common Loons and Grebes, and rare visitors during migration such as Red-throated and Pacific Loons.\nI am frankly shocked with the so-called \"season\" proposed (March 15 - Dec. 31). This would have it open before these migratory birds return to the Great Lakes to breed, and well after most of them they have migrated south in the winter. Allowing these birds to be culled during their nesting season, besides the disturbance to other sensitive co-nesting species, is incredibly unethical and inhumane, as both parents are required for nest success. If even one parent does not return to the nest the chicks are likely to starve to death.\nThe changes that are proposed to be made to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act which will allow hunters a bag limit of 50 per day, no possession limit, and allow the meat to spoil, are alarming and unprecedented. With the excessive bag limit, and no proposed mass hiring of new Conservation Officers or Wildlife Enforcement Officers, these limited regulations are just simply not enforceable.\nFurthermore I strongly disagree with the Double-crested Cormorant being designated a \"game bird\", as it is largely considered inedible. Even so - all other game bird species in Ontario, including Canada Geese (which many people believe to be a nuisance) - have a well-defined season from September - December which does not overlap with their main breeding season.\nMy greatest concern, which I'm sure will be shared by many people - even those who do not necessarily favour Cormorants - is the potential public health issues surrounding the dead birds washing up on shorelines all across Ontario, especially throughout the summer months. Who will be paying for the proper disposal of these carcasses which will inevitably be left behind on the water? Public safety seems to have also been overlooked, since hunters will be allowed to shoot these birds from the water during the summer months. At the very least, waterfront recreation will suffer in many communities, particularly smaller municipalities which rely on it to fuel their local economies.\nIf further scientific study indicates a need for local population control of colonies of Double-Crested Cormorants, I compel the MNRF to consider the alternative control methods which have proven to be successful in the past, such as egg-oiling, ground-nesting encouragement and localized pre-breeding season culls carried out by MNRF technicians or contractors.\nIt is irresponsible and entirely inappropriate to leave the population control of a native species up to the general public, and open an indiscriminate hunting \"season\" without clear rules and regulations, or regard for public health and safety. I find it extremely disappointing that the current Ontario Government would push forward such a proposal without scientific evidence and the backing of the scientific community. I strongly urge the government to do further scientific study, and to work to reduce or eliminate the many other factors that present far greater threats to our lakes, watersheds and fisheries.\nAs a taxpaying citizen of Ontario, a public servant by profession, an avid conservationist and environmentalist, as well as angler by hobby, I whole-heartedly reject this ridiculous proposal as it stands, and I plead with all other Ontarians to do the same.\n",

The species is widely acknowledged to be virtually inedible and its genus does not feature in human diets anywhere on the planet. Hence the hunt is definitely not aimed at allowing the harvesting of nutritious wild game. The 'allow spoiling' provision means that the Ministry expect the bird to be disposed of immediately, in the fashion of a cull.\nAs the bird is a slow and ponderous flier, it does not provide anything approaching 'sport'. What this proposal apparently intends is to make the species target practice for people who wish to kill things for no good reason. The proposal acknowledges that the species is not increasing and claims that the population of double-crested cormorants will not be affected by the hunt. Hence it will not have the effect of diminishing the various damages that have (mostly erroneously) been attributed to the bird. I do not believe any true hunters will be interested to hunt cormorants, so this proposal will simply allow live target practice for killers.\nMany years ago our society allowed practices that we now find abhorrent (wife-beating, slavery, the incarceration of people for sexual orientation, capital punishment, corporeal punishment of children, etc..). I think that this proposal is a throwback to those times, when people just shot living creatures for fun, without any of the knowledge or skill of the true hunter. As such, it represents an extraordinarily regressive initiative and one that I wish to strongly condemn.\nThere are many other arguments against this initiative on biological and environmental grounds. It appears to me utterly senseless and can only have been proposed by those who are totally uncaring of animal cruelty, and unconcerned about wildlife conservation. I was as shocked to read this proposal as I would be to hear that children will be allowed to torture cats, or that husbands can rape their wives.

In my opinion, the concerns raised (impact on fish, other species and aesthetics) makes for a weak rationale with no supporting scientific information or data.\nThe parameters of the hunt seem rather arbitrary (9-month season, 50 bird per day limit) with no stated objective as to what the current cormorant population is and what population targets have been set to achieve whatever the desired effect is. In addition to this lack of clear reason for the hunt, the predicted impact is expected to be neutral at best. I do not think it is wise to make major changes to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act with provisions to allow the meat to spoil based on a weak rationale that is not supported by evidence and for which there are not significant benefits expected.\n",

Shooting from boats during summer months is a very dangerous idea.\nHunting this bird during it's breeding season (April to July) is a terrible idea.  What happens to the young if the parents are killed?  No other bird is hunted during it's breeding season.\nShooting near a nesting colony is extremely likely to endanger other birds.\nHunting should mean eating.  Nobody is going to eat these birds.

It has no basis in scientific knowledge and neglects the interests of a wide variety of citizens who interact with wildlife without killing it. Often-repeated concerns by some hunters and recreational anglers that cormorants negatively impact fish populations, forest habitat, and other species have been thoroughly qualified or debunked. Killing waterbirds does not address the root causes of fish population instability or decline, and directly contradicts current conservation measures at local, regional, national, and international levels.\nThe government's hunting proposal is gratuitous, irresponsible, and cruel. If only 1 in 100 Ontarian hunters each killed only 50 cormorants over an entire hunting season, this would still be enough to eradicate the species from the Great Lakes entirely. The Double-crested Cormorant is a native species to Ontario whose population has only recently recovered from human persecution and pollution-induced declines. This is no time to go backwards. This species has a right to exist and feed on its native land, and the government has an ethical and legal responsibility to ensure its relative health.\n",

        "comment":"I request as a Canadian citizen, Ontario resident, taxpayer and voter, that the Government of Ontario reject the \"Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\".\nThe idea of allowing people to shoot the species over nine and a half months each year, at a rate of 50 animals per day per person and allowing carcasses to be left behind, makes it clear that the intention behind the proposal is simply the mass slaughter of these birds.\nThe proposal debases hunting, and the very notion of citing \"aesthetics\" as an argument for killing wildlife just goes against any common sense.\nAllowing such a \"hunt\" would be massively destructive given the size of the cormorant populations, not to mention how cruel it would be, as many would certainly be left injured and their chicks would be left to die slowly.\nIt runs contrary to any sensible notion of conservation, natural resource management, and basic humanity.\nThe species in question inhabits internationally shared waters, and therefore Ontario has a responsibility to protect this shared wildlife, if not out of respect for the species, at the very least out of respect for the Ontarians who do value it and out of respect for our neighbours.\nI take the opportunity to request that our provincial government replace the proposal in question with a new initiative to strengthen the protection of double-crested cormorants in Ontario and, as part of such an effort and also as a clearly needed social service, to allocate resources towards providing psychiatric assistance or psychological counselling to individuals who show an urge to massacre birds.\nShould the latter individuals and any proponents of the \"hunting season\" in question insist that double-crested cormorants are damaging fishing stocks, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry should make an effort to recruit them into work that addresses the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, overfishing and irresponsible motorboat use in fish feeding and spawning grounds.\nThe arguments being put forward to justify the proposal don't hold water. The proposal to unleash a mass killing of cormorants seems to be a political response to anecdotes, unsubstantiated claims and complaints, the product of one or more persons who hold a deeply irrational dislike for the species. Those individuals are most likely far fewer than those who, like myself, completely oppose the proposal -and quite importantly, here is no substantive body of scientific evidence to support the proposal.\nOn the other hand, it is known that the presence of cormorants benefits other colonial water birds, such as herons, egrets and pelicans, all of which are stable or growing where cormorants are found. The mass killing of cormorants would not be beneficial. In fact, the process of killing them would force other bird species to vacate the colony sites they share.\nQuite importantly, there is no way to kill cormorants humanely. Even controlled, organized culls in other regions have resulted in large numbers of injured and crippled birds being left to die of their wounds or starve to death, including nestlings. Also, the killing of large numbers of cormorants that the proposal would certainly unleash would damage the environment and disrupt natural ecosystem processes.\nCormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial, non-forage species. The return of cormorants to the Great Lakes is part of a natural process.\nLast, but certainly not least, cormorants are not overabundant in the Great Lakes. In fact, their numbers are modest, now stabilized and are dropping in many areas. Changes in the composition of vegetation in and around bird colonies are a sign of vibrant, dynamic natural ecosystem processes. The number of trees damaged or destroyed in colonial waterbird colonies across the province is miniscule and wouldn\u2019t even equal the number of trees in a single modestly-sized woodlot. Only a small number of islands (less than 3%) and peninsula sites are available for cormorants and other colonial waterbirds to nest on.\nFor the above and numerous other reasons, including our provincial Government's duty to protect our wildlife, promote responsible enjoyment of our resources, and its duty of care, I urge the prompt and definitive rejection of the \"Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\".\n",

Their return to the Great Lakes has been heralded as one of the greatest environmental success stories in recent times. As the proposal itself states, the population is considered \"stable or declining\". If that is the case then why is this CULL, being disguised as a hunt, even being proposed?\nDCCO are social colony nesters, and just like most other seabird colonies, they can nest in great numbers and reduce vegetation in very localized areas in their nesting sites. Perhaps to some it may be unsightly, but it is a natural ecological process, and aesthetics is an very weak reason to cull a native species. These barren nesting sites and dead vegetation benefit other species of plants, animals and insects, which thrive in that type of environment.\nCormorants rarely nest alone - they often co-nest with other species which are protected under the Migratory Bird Convention Act, such as Great Blue Herons and Black-crowned Night Herons, Great Egrets, Ring-billed Gulls, Herring Gulls, Caspian and Common Terns and Ontario's only American White Pelicans. Many of these other sensitive species are declining in Ontario, and hunting activity surrounding Cormorant colonies are likely to disturb or incidentally kill these other birds, which would be a direct violation of the Migratory Bird Convention Act. Also of concern is the close resemblance on the water that cormorants bear with other protected diving birds, such as Common Loons and Grebes, and rare visitors during migration such as Red-throated and Pacific Loons.\nI am frankly shocked with the so-called \"season\" proposed (March 15 - Dec. 31). This would have it open before these migratory birds return to the Great Lakes to breed, and well after most of them they have migrated south in the winter. Allowing these birds to be culled during their nesting season, besides the disturbance to other sensitive co-nesting species, is incredibly unethical and inhumane, as both parents are required for nest success. If even one parent does not return to the nest the chicks are likely to starve to death.\nThe changes that are proposed to be made to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act which will allow hunters a bag limit of 50 per day, no possession limit, and allow the meat to spoil, are alarming and unprecedented. With the excessive bag limit, and no proposed mass hiring of new Conservation Officers or Wildlife Enforcement Officers, these limited regulations are just simply not enforceable.\nFurthermore I strongly disagree with the Double-crested Cormorant being designated a \"game bird\", as it is largely considered inedible. Even so - all other game bird species in Ontario, including Canada Geese (which many people believe to be a nuisance) - have a well-defined season from September - December which does not overlap with their main breeding season.\nMy greatest concern, which I'm sure will be shared by many people - even those who do not necessarily favour Cormorants - is the potential public health issues surrounding the dead birds washing up on shorelines all across Ontario, especially throughout the summer months. Who will be paying for the proper disposal of these carcasses which will inevitably be left behind on the water? Public safety seems to have also been overlooked, since hunters will be allowed to shoot these birds from the water during the summer months. At the very least, waterfront recreation will suffer in many communities, particularly smaller municipalities which rely on it to fuel their local economies.\nIf further scientific study indicates a need for local population control of colonies of Double-Crested Cormorants, I compel the MNRF to consider the alternative control methods which have proven to be successful in the past, such as egg-oiling, ground-nesting encouragement and pre-breeding season culls carried out by MNRF technicians or contractors.\nIt is irresponsible and entirely inappropriate to leave the population control of a native species up to the general public, and open an indiscriminate hunting \"season\" without clear rules and regulations, or regard for public health and safety. I find it extremely disappointing that the current Ontario Government would push forward such a proposal without scientific evidence and the backing of the scientific community. I strongly urge the government to do further research, and to work to reduce or eliminate the many other factors that present far greater threats to our lakes, watersheds and fisheries.\nAs a taxpaying citizen of Ontario, a public servant by profession, an avid conservationist and environmentalist, as well as angler by hobby, I whole-heartedly reject this ridiculous proposal as it stands, and I plead with all other Ontarians to do the same.\n",

Cormorants are a native species which plays a significant role in the ecology of our lakes and rivers. Their recovery from the DDT disaster does mean they are overpopulated, rather it indicates their importance to our environment.\n2. The proposal presents NO scientific evidence that the current cormorant population is damaging the fishing industry. In fact, the studies that have been done demonstrate that cormorants play a key role in limiting the population of invasive fish species in the Great Lakes, such as the Round Goby and the Alewife. Blaming cormorants without evidence is akin to the egregious claim that ending the Atlantic Coast seal hunt explained the collapse of cod stocks. The science does NOT demonstrate your claims.\n3. The proposed hunting season extends for virtually the entire time cormorants are in Ontario, including their nesting season, which would endanger other species that nest with cormorants, including several species of gulls and herons. It would also prevent Ontarians, such as myself, from watching migratory birds or fishing on a lake or stream, due to the noise and the danger of random bullets. There are solid reasons why hunting seasons are virtually all limited to a few weeks in the fall.\n4. The proposed limit is beyond belief. It would allow hunters to kill up to 14,600 birds a year. So many that a handful of aggressive hunters could push the cormorant back into endangered status within a few years.\n5. Reclassifying the cormorant as a game bird also seems designed to facilitate mass killing, as if the purpose were a mass cull, not a sport. Game birds are those species which provide meat for hunters, and the cormorant is inedible.\nPlease reconsider this misguided proposal. I will be writing to the Minister and to my representative at Queen's Park to urge them to drop it.\n",

It will allow the effective extermination of a species whose population has stabilized according to your records.  The dead birds have no economic value and ruthless killing of them will, at best, cause only slight benefit to a very limited clientele.  On the other hand it will deprive us of one more harmless species in our natural environment.  Therefore I oppose as strongly as possible the implementation of this proposal.\n",

        "comment":"THE COMMENT I SUBMITTED THIS MORNING CONTAINED AN ERROR. PLEASE REPLACE IT WITH THE FOLLOWING. THANK YOU.\nTo the Ministry of Environment:\nI am writing to voice my objection to the proposal to allow hunting of double-crested cormorants. Here are my reasons why:\n1. Cormorants are a native species which play a significant role in the ecology of our lakes and rivers. Their recovery from the DDT disaster does NOT mean they are overpopulated, rather it indicates their importance to our environment.\n2. The proposal presents NO scientific evidence that the current cormorant population is damaging the fishing industry. In fact, the studies that have been done demonstrate that cormorants play a key role in limiting the population of invasive fish species in the Great Lakes, such as the Round Goby and the Alewife. Blaming cormorants without evidence is akin to the egregious claim that ending the Atlantic Coast seal hunt explained the collapse of cod stocks. The science does NOT demonstrate your claims.\n3. The proposed hunting season extends for virtually the entire time cormorants are in Ontario, including their nesting season, which would endanger other species that nest with cormorants, including several species of gulls and herons. It would also prevent Ontarians, such as myself, from watching migratory birds or fishing on a lake or stream, due to the noise and the danger of random bullets. There are solid reasons why hunting seasons are virtually all limited to a few weeks in the fall.\n4. The proposed limit is beyond belief. It would allow hunters to kill up to 14,600 birds a year. So many that a handful of aggressive hunters could push the cormorant back into endangered status within a few years.\n5. Reclassifying the cormorant as a game bird also seems designed to facilitate mass killing, as if the purpose were a mass cull, not a sport. Game birds are those species which provide meat for hunters, and the cormorant is inedible.\nPlease reconsider this misguided proposal. I will be writing to the Minister and to my representative at Queen's Park to urge them to drop it.\n",

Secondly, allowing hunting during breeding season of any bird is not a sustainable practice, and will be detrimental to populations of many other species of animals who are also breeding at that time, but will be unable to do so thanks to yet more human activity.\nThirdly, the wetland areas, lakes and lagoons included are the places that we, the hard-working and voting public go to relax, unwind from our hectic lives and to be able to commune with nature and enjoy the natural world for a while. This policy will change that aspect of living in Ontario for the worse. Please do not be short-sighted and archaeic in your decision-making and allow this to happen!\n",

During the spring, summer and early fall, I live at a cottage and use the waters close to cormorant nesting and feeding areas. I am concerned that hunting would be dangerous to boaters and cottagers alike. Secondly, the proposal allows the birds to be left where they fall and I would expect that many would wash up on the shore line near the cottage which is irresponsible and would significantly detract from my enjoyment of the property. Thirdly, the need for a cull does not appear to be supported by science. If it were, there are safer and more effective ways to do so without creating dangers to humans or to other protected species.

As a waterway resident and user of of the waterways for pleasure during spring, summer, and fall I object to sharing the waterways with hunters shooting into the waterways from the shore and \/or boats.  This is a safety issue.\nSimilarly, the proposal to allow hunters to let carcasses spoil after collection is a public safety issue.  Supervision and regulation of this aspect of the proposal is not tenable.  The thought of rotting corpses floating in the waterways or washing up on the shorelines is not only repulsive, but poses a human health risk.  I think that to assume that hunters will voluntarily collect corpses and dispose of them properly is extremely naive.\n",

It is stated that this proposal is in response to \"concerns\" expressed by some individuals such as commercial fishers, hunter and anglers, and those who find cormorant colonies unpleasant. Where is the scientific evidence that supports these concerns? Everything has to live somewhere and cormorants, which are a native species, need nesting islands.  There appears to have been no attempt to study the situation by consulting with environmental groups and scientists who study cormorants and how they fit into our environment.\nWhy would you not consult with those who study and know about the situation before you make such a drastic and unethical proposal?  Your government insisted on studying injection sites before it would allow them.  They were already well studied and their efficacy in saving lives and helping addicts was proven. Surely you should engage in a thorough study of the alleged cormorant problem, or if there is a problem, how it can be properly handled.  In all likelihood, if there is a problem it could be handled on a case-by-case basis, not by a wholesale slaughter.\nMy strongest objections are:\nThis hunt would run the entire year for cormorants in this province, meaning they could be shot during the breeding season and hunters would kill the adults and leave the chicks to starve. This is unethical.\nHunters can sit off the nesting islands in an open motor boat and shoot nesting birds, including the young.\nOther species of birds such as herons, gull and terns, which share the nesting colonies, would also suffer because of this poorly thought out policy. Surely this is illegal.\nHunters can shoot up to 50 cormorants a day and leave the bodies to rot.  In other words, they are unaccountable.  This is totally unacceptable.\nThere is no evidence presented that the concerns expressed are justified or that the solution proposed is anything other than a Government-sponsored slaughter.\nIt is my hope that the Ontario Government will reconsider this ill-conceived, unethical and cruel proposal and consult with those who are qualified to give them guidance on this and other environmental matters.\n",

First these birds are native to Ontario and are therefore not an invasive species.  They feed on both native and non native fish so in the case of non native fish, cormorants are actually providing a vital service.  Cormorant numbers have increased since their numbers were decimated years ago, however, nature has its own way of \"culling\" as seen this past summer at Tommy Thompson Park in Toronto where Newcastle disease was responsible for numerous deaths.  The shear numbers that have been put forth in the government's proposal to cull are astronomical.  Now obviously it is unlikely that each person hunting would take 50 birds\/day everyday during the hunting season, but still the numbers proposed are ludicrous.  Another concern I have is that many other species of birds nest in close proximity to cormorants namely the night heron so the disturbance to other species would have a detrimental impact.  Many places where cormorants nest are also places that are migratory bird stopovers both in the spring and fall.  This would also have the potential to be very detrimental.  In closing, I strongly feel that any \"culling\" should be left to nature to rebalance numbers not artificially done by man.  Upsetting the natural balance can have devastating consequences.\n",

Any attempt to decimate the species is short-sighted. Less than half a century ago they were rather uncommon - and they will be again when nature corrects their number.\nAs you know there was a massive cull on Middle Island. The idea was to protect certain rare Carolinian flora. Ironically the flora was only there because it had established itself on soil formed from Cormorant guano over the centuries. The cull was short-sighted, the result of thinking only of the present.\nWe already find cormorants that have been shot by duck hunters washed up on beaches.

The overarching reason is the lack of science supporting that there is a problem, and that the theoretical problems that cormorants may pose are not best addressed with this method of population control (thus the stated goal is not supported by the proposal). This proposal is written as a global solution to what may be a local problem that should therefore have local solutions.\n1. There is no scientific research given as background information to support any of the claims made by this proposal. Indeed, the phrases used ('concerns expressed by some groups') indicates this is an emotional reaction to a perceived issue, instead of an issue documented by research. This is a problem because humans are not good at accurately judging when something is truly an issue, as in most cases people assume that correlation equals causation, and subjective biases all too easily come into play. Detrimental effects on native fish populations have been extremely hard to document, especially in large systems like the Great Lakes, where cormorants are feeding heavily on non-native alewife and round goby (e.g. see Andrews et al 2012). If the concern is about other lake ecosystems where non-native prey are not established, then the proposal should be focusing on those issues and not confound what is happening on the Great Lakes with what may happen in inland lakes.\n2. The proposal states that Great Lakes populations have stabilized or slightly declined. If true, this indicates a possible carrying capacity has been reached. How will hunting result in any long-term and large-scale population reduction (see Lennox et al 2018)?\n3. The ecologically sensitive areas that may be affected by cormorant's nesting behaviour are likely ones where hunting is prohibited. Thus hunting as a solution to habitat destruction in these areas cannot be achieved. A proposal for local solutions to these local problems would be much more sensible, likely using trained employees and not the general public.\n4. There is no information given on population targets for reduction and how this will be measured. At what scale, especially as these mobile birds may simply move to another location when disturbed? For how long? Is there current monitoring to provide baseline data? Will population reduction of cormorants be the only targeted outcome? What about documenting increased fish abundance? Regrowth of vegetation? Nesting success of black-crowned night herons, great blue herons, etc, that cormorants supposedly impact? Seems that if the proposal claims cormorants are causing these negative effects, the ministry's goals should include establishing that reducing cormorants numbers actually reverses these effects. Otherwise it's just a hunt for the sake of shooting birds to make people feel better.\n5. There is no information given on how shooting may affect non-target species, especially species at risk (e.g. nearby nesting birds that may be disturbed by firearm discharge).\nFor these reasons, the proposal does not meet the standards for burden of proof that cormorants have these effects, and that the proposal would result in these effects being reversed, and so it does not warrant being considered further.\n",

        "comment":"I am quite concerned with this proposal.  It seems to me the underlying goal of this proposal is to reduce the cormorant numbers in Ontario.  Regardless if that is a worthy goal or not, the idea of controlling them having an open hunting season is seriously flawed for a number of reasons.\n1) To call this a hunt and then to allow spoilage completely goes against the concept of ethical hunting.  By adding a species to the Fish and Game Act that allows killing and spoilage weakens the overall effectiveness of an act that governs hunting.  It gives hunters a bad name and undermines the concept of ethical hunting that all responsible hunters and hunting groups endorse.\n2) Allowing hunting through the summer breeding season can cause great harm to other species.  Many colonial waterbirds such as gull, herons, terns and pelicans nest with cormorants in super colonies.  These species are almost all on the decline.  Causing disturbance in these colonies during nesting can have catastrophic results.   A single shotgun blast at the wrong time of the year can have every heron chick in a colony leap from the nest before they can fly.  Leaving the nest at that stage results in 100% mortality in the chicks.  Ground nesting gulls and terns that are disturbed off their nests leave their young exposed to other hazards such as predation, over-exposure to sun or cold, again resulting in chick mortality.\n3) Allowing hunting in our lakes and rivers during the summer recreation season is a scary proposition.  Certainly there will be increased hunter-non-hunter interaction.  There is a safety concern  of course but also many local and visiting tourists don't want to hear guns going off or worry about shooting while \"relaxing\" on vacation.  This could result in lower attendance and loss of revenue at some lodges and tourist facilities throughout the province.\n4) Effectiveness of an open hunt on actually reducing cormorant numbers is in question.  Such a method was tried in New York state on Lake Ontario a number of years ago and without a sustained effort that most hunters did not want to take on, little reduction actually occurred.  Also the two largest cormorant colonies in Ontario - Leslie Street Spit and Presqu'ile Provincial Park are off-limits to hunting.\nIf a reduction in cormorant numbers is the goal than  the government should say so and take responsibility for doing the job properly rather than foisting it off on the hunting public.  Cormorant control operations, including lethal controls should be a considered on a case-by-case bases and carried out by professionals following a plan put together from scientific knowledge of cormorant biology and behaviour at each location.  I do not support this bill as it stands.\n",

I have also watched them dive into the water in search of what I\u2019m told is one of their main sources of food the goby and the alewife.  From what I have read there is still much research to be done on what their actual diet is rather than relying on anecdotal evidence.\nThis bird, a native species of Ontario, has made a remarkable recovery from near man-made extinction and deserves to be controlled through natural population management wherever it is deemed necessary.  It would be a shame to take a population that has purportedly levelled off and decimate it once again.\nSomehow shooting these inedible birds seems to be such a backward step in modern wildlife management when we have so many tools and wildlife experts.  Who knows how many carcasses will wash up on our shores and pollute the beaches or how many loons and other birds will die or be disturbed in the process?

Shouldn\u2019t our natural resources be managed on scientific evidence to ensure their sustainability?7\n",

The proposed limits would allow entire colonies to be killed in a single day, which not only sounds cruel but could negatively impact local ecologies.  Jason Weir, an associate professor of biology at the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus, has suggested lowering the daily limit and instituting a seasonal maximum.  This seems entirely sensible as it would be more humane and prevent such extreme events from occurring, while still allowing some control of the cormorant population.\nAdditionally, other bird species that nest in the same areas as cormorants have breeding seasons that overlap with them (e.g., the common tern and the great blue heron).  To minimize the impact on other bird species, the proposed hunting season should be changed to avoid the breeding seasons of other birds that nest in the same areas as cormorants.\n",

On a small lake, this is devastating.\nTourism is decreasing ; as our lakes are not plentiful and enjoying a few hours on the lake fishing for small fish has ended.\nWe used to be able to fish off the edge of a dock and catch small rock bass with our children... that has ended.   There are no more rock bass on our lake.\nAlthough other defining ecological problems like blue algae and pollution have also negative affects on our lakes; the cormorants, which are not a native species, have a major role in the fish stock reductions and should be controlled to ensure the future of our lakes.\nThank-You\nFrom the young, the old and the future fisherman of Ontario.\n",

Ontario should let the ecosystem find its own equilibrium - or at the very least better understand the perceived problem before proposing a solution. More often than not, humans trying to 'fix a problem' by introducing or removing a species do more damage and cause even more grave problems.\nTo allow hunting nearly all year round, particularly during nesting season, is a cruel and unjustifiable practice.

We can see the purpose and usefulness of hunting game and even some pests, which have been shown to have a detrimental effect on native wildlife, such as raccoons.  However, in the case of double-crested cormorants, which we have watched over the past 40 years, slowly recover from extremely low numbers due to pesticde use ect. to numbers where they can be seen on a regular basis, we are strongly opposed to establishing a hunting season for a bird that cannot be eaten and presently has no scientific evidence of negatively impacting fish populations in Ontario.  In the case of ruining island vegetation with their guano during nesting season, there are surely better ways to prevent this damage without mass shooting of the birds.  About 20 years ago, we use to band the corrmorants nesting on the industrial lands adjacent to Hamilton Harbour.  It was a very smelly and dirty endevour, but one thing I remember was even then the birds were feeding their young mostly round gobies and other introduced species.   The proposed wanten hunting of these birds will certainly have a negative impact on hunters because it will paint them as blood thirsty killers of helpless birds and not as responsible harvesters of game and caretakers of the environment, which is a part of our human heritage.  Please consider the negative fallout from the proposal at present and consult those who know and understand the issues surrounding this species.\n",

Since the Great Lakes are surrounded by individual homes, large companies and densely populated municipalities my thoughts are that the Ministry should be looking at other alternatives instead of eliminating a large portion of these birds.  The Ministry states many reasons for the need to cull these birds but it is how they have set up the rules that I find is quite disturbing.  The mere fact that this is a 10 month hunt allowing a hunter to kill 50 birds a day as well as having the right to destroy their nests is absolutely disgusting.  This is not a responsible hunt, this is a slaughter.  I have a few thoughts if this hunt is to go forth, As I stated above, I live in the area of their nesting grounds which also has walking trails by the lake.  How is the Ministry going to  protect myself and the many people who use these walking and biking trails from gunshots? Who is monitoring the amount killed?  Since cormorants and loons look very similar in the water, how is the Ministry going to protect the loon?    Lets look at a better and more humane solution.  The Ministry states that there is a decline in fish population as well as destruction of personal property caused by the over population of the Cormorants.  If this is the case, the Ministry should be looking at the companies as well as municipalities are dumping contaminates into the Great Lakes at an alarming rates. This could be part of the cause of the decline in fish populations.   As for personal destruction of property, there are many humane devices to keep birds off the property.  This is a quick fix idea that the Ministry has come up with at this time but it is my opinion that a greater issue is at hand and the Ministry does not want to trod on the feet of big business.\n",

It also states that \"some groups\" are concerned that cormorants are negatively impacting the environment. Where is the scientific evidence to support these latter claims? What fish populations, specifically, are being detrimentally affected - Species at Risk, recreational fisheries, the commercial fishery - and in what way? How do we know that any changes we are seeing (in species abundance, distribution, and habitat) as a result of a rebounded cormorant population are not a natural environmental balance?\nWhat is the recreational benefit to this proposal?\nI support the wise use and management of natural resources, including hunting for food and clothing. What I do not support is killing for the sake of it. Cormorants are a native species that appear to have currently reached a stable population balance in our present, heavily human-modified environment. Cormorants, as fish-eaters, are not palatable; no part of their bodies are used for any purpose. Hunting cormorants is not going to feed anyone, it is not going to clothe anyone. There is no rationale to designate the double-crested cormorant as a \"game bird\".\nThis proposal, as it stands, is nothing more than an unnecessary public cull and glorified target practice. Ontario should be ashamed of any policy that proposes allowing game meat to spoil. Already, those of us living along the Great Lakes regularly experience washed-up waterbird carcasses from regular botulism outbreaks, and it isn't pretty. Additional dead waterbirds on our beaches can and should be avoided. Not to mention polluting our waterbodies with spent plastic caps from shotgun shells -- hard to collect when hunting from a motorboat. And how does MNRF (soon to be MECP) plan to enforce the proposed \"bag limit of 50 cormorants\/day\"? [Hint: it won't -- there are too few Conservation Officers left in our province to have any effect.]\nIf private landowners wish to protect their \"island forest habitats\" they can continue to apply for a special permit to cull cormorants, as has worked well in the past. Commercial fish harvesters should be expected to share the ecosystem with other species and manage their resources in an appropriate, holistic manner. Government could consider efforts to make island habitats less appealing to cormorants -- after all, regardless of how much food is available, cormorants (or most bird species, for that matter) won't nest somewhere that they don't feel safe.\nI DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL as it is not based on any scientific argument or recreational benefit. The environmental costs far outweigh any \"anticipated positive social consequences\".\nThe MNRF is dissolving soon into the new Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, whose website states the following as the first bullet under \"What we do\": \"use science and research to develop policies, legislation, regulations and standards.\"\nDo you really?? Prove it - use science to develop your hunting regulations.\n",

This encompasses the entire breeding season of cormorants (mid April to mid June in Ontario). This means that even if only adult cormorants are shot, nests will be abandoned influencing future generations of cormorants as well. While I recognize this may the goal of population control, there is no research currently showing how much of an influence this will be.\n-The proposed bag limit is higher than any game bird species. A bag limit of 50 cormorants per hunter per day could wipe out entire colonies.\n-Cormorants do not normally nest alone so on mixed species colonies there is a potential disturbance to habitat for species under the Migratory Bird Act (e.g. gulls, terns).\n-Yes, cormorant numbers have increased since the 1970s but that is because their population was almost decimated by contaminants such as DDT and they are native to Ontario.\n-Yes, cormorants eat fish almost exclusively. But some of the species they are eating are invasive (e.g. alewife and round goby).\nI am not saying that there shouldn\u2019t be any population control - OMNRF has a responsibility to manage our natural resources.

While I am not saying they do not cause damage in some areas, I am saying that there should not be a province wide hunting law. I am saying this because how can it be proven that these bird cause the fish population to go down? These studies (which I have provided through links, and are peer reviewed) show that there is no proof that the number of cormorants affect the number of fish in a lake. What is not said in this proposal is how much the humans are hunting the fish. How do we not know that the humans aren't causing these low numbers in fish populations? Therefore I feel there should be hunting laws by area that ARE affected, with scientific evidence, because this provincial hunting law will make these birds endangered again. I want to be able to see some cormorants in Ontario when I grow older.\nI would like the say that even the proposal is pure speculation, it is not based on scientific evidence. Just like many cases, this one proves correlation does not equal causation. Some of the areas with cormorants, have other endangered species. This will put those other species at risk. This proposal affects not only cormorants, but other birds. Also, if most of the cormorants in one area are hunted, the fish populations will go up (if it is not fished by humans). This will lead to less food for the fish, as most of it will be eaten when the population grows, in the body of water, killing a lot of fish.  This also decreases the amount of oxygen and increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the water, leading to algal blooms (which kill a lot of fish, see link below). This shows that cormorants are important because it stabilizes the biodiversity.\nAnother problem with this proposal is that these birds can be left there to rot. The problem isn\u2019t them rotting but the fact that most cormorants have a high amount of mercury in them. The carcasses will be eaten, bio-magnifying the mercury into other animals. It will also leach into the soil, then be taken up into the plants. These plants will be eaten by herbivores, then possibly hunted by humans and eaten.\nAll in all, I do agree they should be hunted. BUT do not do it the way that the proposal is saying. What could work is controlling the populations in specific areas, with a low limit. I worry that the numbers will rapidly go down and they will be back on the endangered list. The hunters will have to dispose of them when they hunt them instead of leaving them there to rot.\n",

        "comment":"A cormorant hunting season can be consistent with responsible management of the species, however I have a few suggestions to improve the proposed legislation based on my experience as a hunter in New Brunswick, where cormorant hunting is legal, and as a biologist.\n1) The proposed hunting season can conflict with the nesting period for birds protected under the Migratory Birds Act. Hunting Cormorants on their colonies should be strictly prohibited to ensure that no disruption to other nesting birds occurs. There should be a buffer zone around Cormorant colonies, both to avoid disruption of non-target species and to ensure that the effects on cormorant populations are limited to the number of birds killed.\n2) In NB, one can hunt cormorants during the usual hunting season with a small game permit. Hunting outside the period where a small game license is valid is accomplished by purchasing a separate \u00ab\u00a0varmint\u00a0\u00bb license during this time period. It would be simpler to create a separate license for \u00ab\u00a0nuisance\u00a0\u00bb species than to amend regulations on existing small game licences. In this way, cormorants would not have to be listed as a game bird. Also, funds from the sale or cormorant licenses could be easily identified\/tracked and used for monitoring programs.\n3) Since this is a new and controversial program in Ontario, I suggest that cormorant hunters should have mandatory online reporting of their daily harvests, at least for the first few years. This would make it simpler to manage \/ adjust seasons and harvest limits to achieve management targets.\n4) By and large, hunters dislike waste. With a number of birds killed\/harvest and no use for the carcasses, there will be quite a lot of material that could be mobilized for scientific research. Every effort should be made to ensure that hunters are able to connect with interested biologists\/researchers and provide samples or observations.\n",

These birds have recovered from very low populations and we need more time for their numbers to stabilize in harmony with other birds and with their predators.  I realize that they are not very attractive birds, but that does not mean that they are not worth saving.  I live in the Whitchurch-Stouffville rural area, so I do not live near the birds, but I always enjoy seeing them when I drive on the QEW to and from Hamilton.

        "comment":"I am in favour of the proposed changes to regulations surrounding double-crested cormorants; however, I have 3 primary points that I feel should be considered.\n1. Establish quantitative regional population management goals. If the ultimate purpose of having a \"hunting\" season for double-crested cormorants is to reduce their overall population numbers, than it is critical that the MECP establishes clearly defined goals for this objective.\n2. The wording should be changed to call this population management and not hunting. Hunting in Ontario, and across Canada is being given a bad name and many people already believe that the people who participate in hunting have a desire to kill animals. This over shadows the true hunting purpose for many people: high-quality meat and closeness to nature. If the cormorant season continues as proposed, with wasting of animals the ultimate goal, this further darkens the feelings around hunting, particularly those who are not hunters themselves. Relisting this season as a population management season, or other similar name, would better represent the true nature of the activity.\n3. Regulations surrounding the killing of cormorants must be tightly controlled and enforced. There are thousands of cormorants around the areas that I typically fish and boat each summer. That being said, I would prefer to see hundreds of living birds than dozens of dead birds lining the shores of lakes and waterways. Furthermore, with the hunting season being open through the warm summer months, firearm safety must be the number 1 priority as this is when there are the highest number of people enjoying the environment, and the majority of those would be unfamiliar with hunting, especially when cormorant hunting will be conducted out of boats.\nAll in all, I agree that steps should be taken to reduce the number of cormorants throughout Ontario, but management and safety must be put forth as a priority to ensure the continued use of environmental areas and enjoyment of wildlife for all Ontarians.\n",

        "comment":"To whom it concerns.\nRe: EBR ERO Number 013-4124 and OFAH\u2019s Comments.\nThis is to urge in strongest terms to prevent the egregious plan to redefine \u201cgame\u201d and how game is to be utilized in order to placate misguided individuals who want to kill off Ontario\u2019s cormorants, returning to an era when the species was endangered in or extirpated from most of Ontario.  The proposal ERO Number 013-4124, is unbelievable.\nAssuming this terrible scheme is generated by the mistaken belief that the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) speak with knowledge and authority, and knowing that real experts have already responded to this horrific plan, I shall restrict myself to commenting on OFAH\u2019s letter of support, OFAH FILE 413C\/794.\nUnder the heading, General Comments, OFAH uses the term \u201coverabundant\u201d for the Double-crested Cormorant population.   I believe that the problem is encapsulated within the term \u201cshifting baseline syndrome\u201d https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shifting_baseline, whereby, put simply as it relates to conservation, the experience of being familiar with an impoverished biomass during one\u2019s formative years of exposure to the natural world forms a subjective \u201cbaseline\u201d whose subjectivity tends not to be recognized.  The assumption is that the number of cormorants remembered from one\u2019s formative years was the \u201cright\u201d number, against which anything significantly over that number is seen as inherently wrong.\nAs Wires and Cuthbert (http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1675\/1524-4695%282006%2929%5B9%3AHPOTD\u2026) show, the species is less common now than it was in historic times.   Ecosystems are not static.  The carrying capacity of the Great Lakes, may be greater now, as a result of the presence various invasive fish species, but there is no way to know.  Certainly cormorants were present in earlier eras.\nOFAH states the \u201cecological damages caused by densely populated connorant (sic) colonies are well-documented\u201d.  In fact, \u201cdamage\u201d is a naively subjective, value-laden term.  Those not familiar with ecological interactions often assume \u201coverabundance\u201d is a biological term, but it refers only to what is subjectively determined by whomever uses it.\nWildlife can create habitat, and in the case of the double-crested cormorant, in the very few places where it occurs in nesting colonies of significant size, it can enhance habitat for other species.  Great blue herons co-exist with cormorants and habitat that has been rendered devoid of trees is best suited for such island-nesting Ontario birds as the Caspian tern, common tern, ring-billed gull and American white pelican (now increasing and showing indications of expanding breeding range into the lower Great Lakes, but previously a provincially endangered species).   These species are a part of the ecological whole whose presence contributes to biodiversity.\nThe same sort of argument OFAH makes against the double-crested cormorant has been levied against the savannah African elephant, on the grounds that its prodigious appetite for trees and shrubs prevents the growth of such vegetation to the benefit of the greater number of wildlife species who utilize forest habitat.  But scientists have found that biodiversity is enhanced overall by virtue of the support given to savannah inhabiting wildlife species, and since they occur in larger numbers than forest species, biomass is also enhanced by this activity.\nSimilarly, it was once assumed that all fires should be totally suppressed, but we now know that in both prairie and forest habitat fire plays a pivotal role in enhancing biodiversity overall.\nOFAH has stated that what is planned \u201chas the potential to negatively affect the image of hunting\u2026\u201d\nOFAH, the National Rifle Association (NRA), Safari Club International (SFI) and other proponents of hunting wildlife argue that hunting is \u201csport\u201d that utilizes \u201cgame\u201d as defined by dictionary and modern tradition both.  It is often claimed that hunting is \u201chumane\u201d.  The rubric that hunting is \u201cnecessary\u201d to \u201ccontrol\u201d species is increasingly doubted by a populace with enhanced access to information about wildlife and ecology and the importance of apex predators, in conjunction with increasingly broad and sophisticated knowledge about basic ecological interactions between predator, prey and habitat.  This is all unfolding during a time of increased destruction of the natural world, with an unprecedented loss of species and individual wild animals and plants.\nSince \u201ccivilization\u201d began about ten thousand years ago, some 83 percent of all wild animals has been lost to anthropogenic causation.  If we add the human biomass to livestock maintained in support of the humans we learn that some 96 percent of mammals are humans or domesticated species, and only about four percent are wild species, and yet we happily continue to persecute what is left if, in any way or to any degree, it is profitable to do so or if they annoy us.\nEven among birds, some 70 percent of the bird biomass constitutes domestic poultry (mostly one species of pheasant, the chicken) and other domesticated birds in service of one species, us, while only thirty percent are wild, and yet the Ontario government, and OFAH, deems that to be too many.\nThe exact figures vary (see for example: https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2018\/may\/21\/human-race-just-001\u2026 and for a technical analysis of world biomass overall see https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/115\/25\/6506 ) but the bottom line is that we are experiencing the greatest extinction event in over sixty million years and it is of anthropogenic origin, and that fact is well known to educated people with access to social and mainstream media and various educational sources.\nThe old way of thinking, characteristic of the era preceding the study of ecology, when animal species were deemed \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d depending on their immediate value to us, is not working in the interests of conservation.  With this loss of biodiversity, and with the results of climate change fueled by intentional, willful ignorance, even politically-motivated disdain, of science, we see a continuing loss of the ability of the environment to support us, to support human endeavor.  In spite of OFAH\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of high \u201cmembership\u201d and \u201csubscribers\u201d, increasing numbers of Ontarians are turning away from consumptive wildlife use and increasingly valuing nature in its own right.\nAccording to the 2016 U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, & Wildlife-Associated Recreation, the licensed hunting population of American hunters has decreased from 17.9 million in 1975 to 11.4 million as of the time of the latest survey.  The annual dropout rate is roughly 6.3 percent, while annual recruitment of about five percent.  Particularly noteworthy is the fact that hunting participation is lowest among teenagers, and that is of concern to the hunting fraternity, and government workers whose jobs depend on them, because hunters are most likely to begin hunting in their early teens.  That is why organizations such as OFAH are continually seeking to find some level of socially acceptable rationale for the act of killing wildlife.\nOFAH\u2019s letter claims it seeks to \u201cpromote a positive image of hunting as an important component of conservation\u201d but OFAH is faced with two problems.\nFirst, hunting is not an important component of conservation.   The American eel, eastern sand darter, northern madtom, redside dace, river darter, shortnose cisco, spotted gar, warmouth, Allegheny mountain dusky salamander, Fowler\u2019s toad, Jefferson\u2019s salamander, northern dusky salamander, small-mouthed salamander, unisexual (small-mouthed dependent) salamander, blue racer, Butler\u2019s gartersnake, common five-lined skink, gray ratsnake, massasagua rattlesnake, queensnake, spiny softshell turtle, spotted turtle, wood turtle, Acadian flycatcher, barn owl, golden eagle, Henslow\u2019s sparrow, king rail, Kirtland\u2019s warbler, loggerhead shrike, northern bobwhite, piping plover, prothonotary warbler, red knot (rufa subsp), yellow-breasted chat, American badger, eastern small-footed myotis, little brown myotis, cougar, northern myotis and tri-colored bat are all listed on the Ontario government\u2019s own website as provincially endangered species.\nIt is not explained, nor do I see how, hunting can help conserve any of these species, although I can see how hunting, fishing and trapping \u2013 consumptive use \u2013 could harm some of them.\nThe only way hunting can conceivably contribute to the conservation of these species, is via the provision of funding for licence fees.   But in a circular arrangement most such funding goes into the expenses required to regulate consumptive use because it is consumptive.  The absence of constant monitoring and adjustment and habitat modification paid for out of consumptive use permitting revenues, will lead to endangerment.\nHow terribly ironic that two species of birds not on that list of provincially endangered species are the double-crested cormorant and the American white pelican, both formerly endangered in Ontario.  Their recovery to date is the very thing OFAH is opposing: a conservation success story, albeit their opposition to such success is currently indirect in the case of the pelican.  However, with regard to that last caveat, what is being proposed will certainly bring risk to pelicans as they co-habit and associate with cormorants.  It opens the door for the elimination of any wildlife species, including the American white pelican, deemed undesirable by a small minority of the population.\nOFAH claims the \u201c\u2026sole purpose [is] to use hunters to assist in the control of overabundant connorant (sic) populations.\u201d\nWithin the hunting community there is great concern about the decline in hunters (see, for example: https:\/\/deltawaterfowl.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/LoomingCrisis.pdf) and understandably OFAH is fighting back, and in this case is doing so by lobbying to have a legislatively legitimized return to the kind of hunting that appeals to those  who don\u2019t hunt for food or sport, but for pleasure derived from killing birds in flight.\nThere are many ways to hunt, and many motives (see https:\/\/www.feelguide.com\/2016\/11\/07\/hunting-linked-to-psychosexual-ina\u2026) but hunting game, as defined and regulated in Canada, requires use of the animals\u2019 meat, elements of \u201cfair chase\u201d, and a variable degree of skill.  Not all people who want to hunt want to be bothered with such impositions, and what is proposed allows, as does the (more American than Canadian) tradition of \u201cvarmint hunting\u201d, to simply kill animals.\nI fear that OFAH realizes the value of reversing the decline in hunters to its membership has led it to abandon the pretense of \u201cwise use\u201d, of hunters as \u201cstewards\u201d and \u201cconservationists\u201d, and appeal to that demographic within the hunting community who just want to kill.   Ontario should not have any part in assisting this goal.  There is nothing inherently wrong in people enjoying nature without need to kill anything,  (see https:\/\/biodivcanada.chm-cbd.net\/documents\/canadian-nature-survey) and there are economic benefits to non-consumptive wildlife use that greatly eclipse those of consumptive users.\nWhile OFAH says the purpose of their support for this appalling proposal is not to provide new hunting opportunities, obviously the proposal will do exactly that.\nOFAH wants to see the cormorant listed under Section 5(2) of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.  Each bird species listed under Section 6(2) of the Act, the American crow, brown-headed cowbird, common grackle, house sparrow, red-winged blackbird and starling (common starling, Sturnus vulgaris) has been so listed for many decades.  Two are non-native.  All are common and widely distributed.  None has ever been listed as endangered or threatened.   All are in the order Passeriformes (song birds).  None are colonial nesting species.   All occupy a broad range of habitats and most benefit directly from human presence.\nNone of that applies in any way to the double-crested cormorant.  Unlike the species listed it is highly vulnerable, as history clearly shows, to persecution.  OFAH (or the Ontario government) would have no claim to a conservation mandate by listing the cormorant under this section of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.\nOFAH claims that risks of conflicts with \u201cother outdoor recreationists\u201d (ie., the vast majority of Ontarians and out-of-province tourists) are \u201clow\u201d and \u201cexaggerated\u201d by those of us horrified by this proposal.\nWhat is meant by \u201clow\u201d?   Most recreationists will be where there are no cormorants for the simple reason that most of Ontario lacks cormorants at any given moment.  Where cormorants are concentrated, however, they often are so in the kinds of places that attract \u201cother outdoor recreationists\u201d.  Many thousands of visitors to Tommy Thompson Park come in close contact with the largest of the province\u2019s colonies of cormorants.\nAs to the risks of orphaning, the young are cared for by both parents, and in the absence of either one, will be exposed to a very cruel death.\nMy biggest fear is that the whole MNRF-OFAH approach is designed to present a patently egregious, over-the-top proposal with the intent of dialing it back to look like a \u201ccompromise\u201d while doing OFAH\u2019s actual bidding.   Thus OFAH makes the obvious proposal to reduce the season proposed in the EBR, from March to May.  Closing the season at the end of May will assuredly not protect young, but leave them orphaned when they are most vulnerable.\nBut even earlier than May there is still the issue of both parents being required to tend the eggs and young.   In other words, killing the female leaves the male to incubate, and then tend the young, and vice versa, which can\u2019t be done.  Re-mating is a possibility, but only if there is a surviving partner, and the whole idea is to remove as many birds as possible from the population thus reducing the potential for another pair bond to form, if, in fact, it would.\nThere is a particular naivete in saying, \u201cKilling adult cormorants in the summer will remove individual birds, but those birds will likely have already bred and caused tree and vegetation degradation. Targeting the season to pre-nesting, when the birds first arrive in the spring, would prevent them from nesting in the first place and limit their impact before it occurs.\u201d\nIt is true that a dead bird won\u2019t nest, but it is not true that, minus a massive elimination of all birds, nesting won\u2019t occur.  Yes, in the absence of human persecution, natural attrition will result in the odd single bird left to tend nesting duties, but cormorant biological imperatives are predicted on the presence of large enough numbers of \u201cbachelor\u201d birds to compensate for such incidental losses as occur in nature. And dependent young continue to occur well into summer.\nOFAH states, \u201cIt is essential to get robust data on corrnorant (sic) populations and distributions in Ontario, including accurate baseline data\u2026\u201d   I agree, but what is meant by \u201cbaseline data\u201d?   Such data cannot be obtained when the baseline is being altered through the massacre envisioned by OFAH.  We already know (as the EBR itself stated) the cormorant population has, according to best estimate, peaked and leveled off.\nOFAH, in its letter, calls for the province to monitor not just the Great Lakes, but the entire province, however neither it, nor the EBR posting, states where the funding for such monitoring will originate.  The private sector, with government support to be sure, already monitors breeding bird populations in Ontario but the need to do so would be enormously increased by the removal of significant numbers of birds.\nWhat, exactly, would be the number of cormorants that would trigger a cease to them being \u201chunted\u201d?   Why have \u201crobust data\u201d if those data are not used?  And if they are to be used, at what point would the number of cormorants satisfy OFAH and\/or the MNRF that there are now not \u201ctoo many\u201d? At what point would protection kick in?  How would it be determined that such a point had been reached and how would the protection be applied?  What would seem to be a most essential consideration is missing from both the EBR, and concerns from OFAH, that seem to have led to its creation.\nOFAH states: \u201cA significant concern regarding growing connorant (sic) populations is their expansion to inland lakes and their potential impacts (e.g. sensitive Brook Trout lakes).\u201d   In the MNRF\u2019s own website (http:\/\/www.latornell.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/files\/presentations\/2017\/Lat\u2026 ), which lists many causes for actual or predicted declines in brook trout, cormorants are not mentioned.  It does state: \u201cClimate change models have predicated that the number of watersheds in Ontario with Brook Trout will be reduced by 50% in 2050.\u201d\nIt\u2019s clearly easier to kill birds than to combat climate change.  There is no evidence, nor is any given, that brook trout are in any way vulnerable to cormorant predation.  Worse, the casual allusion to a \u201cgrowing\u201d population of cormorants is disingenuous, given that the population of cormorants in Ontario has not, based on best available evidence, been shown to be growing, although if that were to be shown to be the case, it would be a good sign as the presence of cormorants, especially breeding colonies, indicates healthy fish populations, thus a healthy environment.\nThe OFAH letter states that understanding the current \u201cdistribution and relative abundance [of cormorants] will ensure we are preventing them from expanding into more vulnerable lake systems.\u201d  But that would already be assured if this horrific plan were to be enacted.  Among other things it will justify, in the minds of many, the belief that cormorants are \u201cbad\u201d and should be eliminated.  There can be no doubt that cormorants occurring anywhere the discharge of firearms is legal will be met with gunfire.\nThe OFAH letter states that \u201cClosing the season at the end of May would have the additional benefit of removing the need for the proposed exception relating to Northern and Central Ontario\u2019s June to August small game licence restrictions.\u201d   But cormorants have dependent young through May, so it would assure cruel deaths of orphaned young.\nOFAH states that such a closed season would \u201c\u2026further align the corrnorant (sic) regulations with other game birds, minimizing confusion.\u201d   The OFAH letter then says such a season \u201cwould remove most adult birds before they get a chance to lay eggs (Ward 2000) and prevent the orphaning of chicks.\u201d The reference given by OFAH is actually Kirschbaum and Ward, and is a simple species account that in no way implies or states that the birds would not have dependent young in May, when, in fact, there would be the peak number of the most dependent young.\nThe OFAH letter states that the proposal would allow cormorant control on Crown land, which, I remind you, is my land no less than OFAH\u2019s and is land my children and I want to access free from gunmen killing nesting birds, and then goes on to state, \u201c\u2026the province also needs to control connorant (sic) overabundance, particularly when and where hunting will not be permitted.\u201d\nActually, no; that already happens.  The largest double-crested cormorant colony in eastern North America, perhaps anywhere, is very well managed in the absence of hunting, with its management goals well met.  The use of \u201coverabundance\u201d is, as I\u2019ve alluded, a value judgement.  Even if \u201coverabundant\u201d is defined as meaning a species has surpassed carrying capacity and is starving, I know of no instances of such starvation among our cormorants.   Food is not a limiting factor in cormorant population size in Ontario!\nBut OFAH continues, \u201cCurrently, control measures can be undertaken by municipalities, provincial parks, and landowners when they experience property damage from cormorants.\u201d\nExactly.  There is therefore no need for this legislation. In instances where property damage, including actual monetary loss, can be demonstrated.  And while, as the situation in Toronto, where management is science-based, has shown, it need not be lethal.\nOFAH wants to work with the MNRF but here is a better idea.  Why would MNRF not work with actual experts, both stakeholders who have long been involved with protecting cormorants, and scientists and biologists, particularly from academia who, in theory, lack vested or political interests, to find out what the situation really is.\nThe OFAH letter just touches on \u201cproper disposal of carcasses\u201d, without saying where the funding for \u201coutreach\u201d will come, let alone how the carcasses are to be disposed of, which leads me to wonder why that was not determined before the decision was posted on the EBR?  I expect a better level of competence from the government.  The realty is that there is no simple way to dispose of the number of carcasses that will be produced in a way that does not cause health risks, let alone any means to come close to enforcing any such regulations even if they had been suggested, which they were not!\nOFAH is absurdly na\u00efve in saying \u201cmost conflicts can be easily avoided\u201d, but is accurate in predicting that they will lead to what they call \u201cunintended consequences\u201d and what I would call invariable consequences, that will further exacerbate what they see as a problem, that being the understandable decline in public support for hunting.  It has been my experience that there is tolerance for hunting when it involves skill and utilization but a decline in support for wanton killing.\nMany people can easily be convinced that the effect that cormorant guano has on plant life can be ecologically damaging in absolute terms.  But it is also true that people can be educated, and that naturalists\u2019 organizations, scientists and animal protection groups will be motivated to provide such education, further undermining any belief, however ill-founded, that organizations like OFAH, NRA and SCI have credibility.\nOFAH states, \u201cIn many areas, no control measures are taken.\u201d  Of course not.  Why would they be?  I get that OFAH members go out and kill wildlife, but a greater number of us do not; we go out to enjoy it, and a waterbird colony is exciting for us to experience.\nOFAH states, \u201cIn other areas, control efforts are too small in scale or focus on ineffectual non-lethal actions.\u201d  The non-lethal methods used by the Toronto Region Conservation Authority have been very effective, while protecting a vibrant, mixed colony of double-crested cormorants, black-crowned night-herons, great egrets, ring-billed gulls, and herring gulls, with some welcome management success with breeding common and Caspian terns.  The whole purpose was to increase ground nesting of cormorants, and yet OFAH presents the ability to do so as a failure.  It is a resounding wildlife management success.\nAlong the lines of cherry-picking data, OFAH talks about the increase in ground-nesting at Presqu\u2019ile Provincial Park, but fails to mention that the shift to ground nesting occurred only after lethal culling stopped, and that the presence of the tree-nesting cormorants attracted great blue herons as a nesting species for the first time in the park\u2019s history.   In both instances the goal was not to eliminate cormorants but to help maintain tree nesting habitat for heron species.   This is a value-judgement, of course.  The fact is that nature is not static, not a museum diorama, but always in a dynamic state of change.\nThe double-crested cormorant is a native bird.   For reasons beyond the scope of this letter for me to explore, it can, like the wolf, the shark, and, in earlier times, the loon, hawk and owls and virtually any and every predatory animal, evoke primitive, irrational hatred.  I understand all that.  But that should not motivate the government in its wildlife management policies.  Please reject this proposal out of hand.\n",

Implementing high-density widespread hunting permitted without any scientific method being applied to me is putting the cart before the horse. We should not in our society be implementing untested policies that could have unintended and severe consequences, resulting in ecological damage that cannot be reversed.\nConcerns\nMy specific concerns relate to the effects on the environment, cormorants, and taxpayers:\n1.\tThe extent of the hunt: 50 cormorants\/day over 9.5 months of the year. That represents over 14,000 birds per hunter per year. It also runs through the cormorant\u2019s breeding season and appears to have no boundaries; in other words, it doesn\u2019t matter whether an area has a \u201ccormorant problem\u201d that needs to be managed in order for it to be included in this cull. Has the government decided that the survival of cormorants is of absolutely no concern? Have you researched the ramifications on the ecosystem of the species disappearing? To me, it appears that you are not proposing a population management plan but an uncontrolled slaughter. Have other population management methods other than hunting even been considered?\n2.\tThe Ministry is looking to enable hunters to permit the meat to spoil, which is not the case for any other game species. How will carcass disposal be managed? Will bodies be left to rot or will taxpayers have to foot the bill for Conservation Officers to monitor the entire province of Ontario to ensure proper disposal methods are being undertaken? How many Conservation Officers or other officials will be required to monitor this and would it mean that their attention is being diverted from other important issues?\n3.\tHunters will be allowed to shoot cormorants from standing boats during recreational and cottage season. What effect will this large of an uncontrolled cull taking place in our shared waterways have on the public\u2019s rights to safety?\nResearch\nThere is a variety of research papers on wildlife management, in general, and the effect of these cormorants on fisheries. I include some of them below:\nSpecifically on double-crested cormorants, Diana et al. (2006) conducted a study on the effect of double-crested cormorants in a case study of Les Cheneaux Islands in Lake Huron. They determined that cormorants resulted in <6.3% of mortality for all ages of perch and they concluded that control measures to limit their populations were not warranted at that time. http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.3394\/0380-1330(2006)32%5B306:DICPTS%5D\u2026\nOstman et al. (2013) studied the effects of cormorants on fisheries of the Baltic Sea. Their study indicated \u201cthat the degree of competition between cormorants and humans varies substantially between areas\u201d. They concluded \u201cthat for the commercially most important species, eel and cod, the estimated economic impact of cormorants on fisheries was low.\u201d https:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/comments?id=10.1371\/journal.p\u2026\nCanadian researchers have given thought to fisheries management and should be consulted by the Government of Ontario before implementing any population control for double-crested cormorants.\n\u2022\tLennox et al. published a review paper in 2018 and concluded that management must consider the role of the predator within the ecosystem and potential consequences of its removal. In their review of the literature, they determined predator removal was typically an ineffective and costly approach to conflicts between humans and predators. (http:\/\/www.fecpl.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/1-s2.0-S0006320717310418\u2026)\n\u2022\tPost et al. (2002) felt that Canada requires \u201c(1) fishery independent assessments of the status of fish populations, and (2) changes in the management of recreational fishing that increase the visibility of fish population declines to agency biologists, the public, and politicians. We must also recognize, quantify, and incorporate depensatory processes, where and when they exist, into dynamic management models to identify thresholds of population abundance that are necessary to sustain fish populations and the social and economic value that they provide. Only then can fisheries management, and society as a whole, hope to respond in a timely fashion to avoid the collapses and costly mistakes that have characterized the science and management of many of the world\u2019s commercial fisheries.\u201d http:\/\/faculty.forestry.ubc.ca\/hinch\/486\/2015\/Post%20et%20al.%202002%20\u2026\nConclusion\nThe proposal being put forth by the Ontario Government to introduce an extended hunting season for the double-crested cormorant is a whole-sale cull that appears to have no planning or metrics in place to manage the severe ramifications that will likely occur. I expect our government to make evidence-based policy decisions that are measured and in consultation with expert advice, in this case wildlife researchers. I urge you to delay your decision to introduce this hunting season until you\u2019ve had an opportunity to work with wildlife management specialists on a restricted hunt that focuses on an area where cormorants and fisheries are in conflict and have success metrics in place that will allow you to measure the effect of the cull on the entire ecosystem. I appreciate the opportunity to provide comments.\n",

        "comment":"Re: EBR # 013-4124\nThe EBR document online states that Double-crested Cormorant \u201c\u2026populations declined significantly in the Great Lakes from the 1950s to the 1970s primarily due to environmental contaminants affecting reproduction.\u201d That does not address the fact that even as the species was suffering the effects of \u201cenvironmental contaminants\u201d it was still also experiencing extensive persecution.\nIt is widely believed that while there can be no question that, when primarily Eurasian colonization took hold in the Western Hemisphere the Double-crested Cormorant\u2019s range extended from Alaska to Newfoundland and Labrador, and south into the subtropical regions.  But it was also believed that the species somehow missed the Great Lakes, a preposterous belief, but one based on a near absence of viable specimen or other objective material indicating it was a Great Lakes breeding species, east of Lake of the Woods, prior to the 20th Century.\nBut, prior evidence of a greater North American abundance of the species overall was well document by Wires and Cuthbert (http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1675\/1524-4695(2006)29%5B9:HPOTDC%5D2\u2026) .  The evidence of breeding birds in the Great Lakes prior to the 20th century is thin, but not absent.  Space does not allow me to provide verification of the contention but it exists, partly based on what was provided by Charles Fothergill (1782-1840) and Thomas McIlwraith (1824-1903) and remains from 16th century kitchen middens.  The Double-crested Cormorant was eliminated, or nearly so, from the Great Lakes not once, but twice.\nWildlife populations are neither static nor stationary\nThe subject is complex, but a good non-technical and simplified tutorial on the subject as it relates to the first part, population size, can be found here: https:\/\/www.uaex.edu\/environment-nature\/wildlife\/youth-education\/TR%20B\u2026.  It is important that such basics be understood in order to comprehend the inanity of the EBR proposal under discussion.\nAs a rule, elected governments base policy decisions on scientifically-obtained information, on what is the latest best evidence, and not simply on what one less-informed group believes, and that is what I urge be done here.\nIn balance, there is no serious cormorant-caused depredation, directly or indirectly, to those species of fish of interest to sport anglers and commercial fishing interests has been demonstrated by numerous studies that date back over a century and this fact should not be ignored.\nThe question is not if some people think cormorants eat \u201ctoo many\u201d fish, or compete with human consumers for desired fish stocks --- that assumption has been made for every familiar native bird species that eat fish, including loons, Ospreys, all three native mergansers, grebes, Belted Kingfishers, herons, pelicans and so on.  Third-party academic research shows that, with appropriate caveats, this concern about cormorants is contradicted by facts.    See:\nhttp:\/\/www.torontobirding.ca\/toc-docs\/CormorantsAOU07ConservationAddn5\u2026)\nThe reason people think cormorants eat too many fish, indeed, have an irrationally visceral hatred of the species overall, is multifaceted, and I have tried to offer a general account of why I think this opprobrium exists here: https:\/\/www.animalalliance.ca\/why-so-many-people-hate-cormorants\/.\nHowever, that is somewhat a different question from the one of why people think cormorants eat too many fish, which in good part has been answered by the Ministry of Natural Resources for the State of Wisconsin (https:\/\/www.dnr.state.mn.us\/birds\/doublecrestedcormorant.html):\nThe problem is that for people not schooled in ecology, or only lightly so, the concept of complimentary mortality is unknown.  In their minds, without knowing the terms \u201cadditive\u201d and \u201ccompensatory\u201d in this context, the assumption is that all predation is additive.  This was, indeed, the prevailing concept of the 19th century, when essentially all predators were deemed \u201cbad\u201d if they ate \u201cgame\u201d, such prey being \u201cgood\u201d, because we could use it.\nEven now it an often-held view.  It was a concept highly motivating to the late Jack Miner (1865 - 1944) who was widely influential to the generation preceding my own, and who trapped and killed all birds of prey, mammal predators or species he didn\u2019t like, and was greatly honored in his day.\nWhile Miner and this kind of na\u00efve thinking has been repudiated and condemned by biologists from Miner\u2019s time forward, clearly it still lingers, as the EBR under discussion attests.  It embarrasses me as on Ontarian that in 2018 we still see the risk of government policy reverting to these 19th century concepts, and yet it is exactly the kind of rationale in play in the EBR.\nExceptions where there has been a temporary but discernable decline in fish following an increase in cormorants (which may or may not have been the primary factor in the fish decline) are therefore extremely rare, but invariably cited by those who hate cormorants.\nThe Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is, at least supposedly, a good, best-evidence-based indicator of population size of the species to which it is addressed, and also, over time, a good indicator of trends in fish population size.  Below we see the TAC for two important commercially and recreationally harvested fish stocks in Lake Erie over the time when Double-crested Cormorant numbers peaked.  The data clearly show that the cormorants did not produce any discernable impact on numbers of such fish.  Here are the figures for Lake Erie Yellow Perch and Walleye over the last 18 years.\nTo look at the same question in another light, statistics from the Glenora Fisheries Research Station (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources) are used. In 1991, for example, there were about 6.1 million sport fish in eastern Lake Ontario. The average annual food consumption by a single Lake Trout is 6.5 kg. The average annual intake of a cormorant on Lake Ontario is 65 kg. In other words one cormorant eats about as much as ten Lake Trout. Approximately 30,000 cormorants fed in eastern Lake Ontario in 1991. Thus, these birds would eat the same amount of fish as 300,000 Lake Trout. Since there are about 6.1 million sport fish in eastern Lake Ontario, this means the cormorants are eating the same amount of fish as only 5% of the sport fish. Hence, scientists and fish managers conclude that the amount of fish which cormorants consume in eastern Lake Ontario is not a serious threat to the sport fish.\nThe information is available here: http:\/\/publications.gc.ca\/site\/archivee-archived.html?url=http:\/\/public\u2026\nThe document is incorrect in saying that the Double-crested Cormorant is the only species of cormorant of the six found in North America that inhabits inland lakes and waterways.  The Neotropic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) does as well.  In other parts of its range, so does the Great Cormorant (P. carbo). Both species are known to occur in Ontario but are ignored in the EBR listing under discussion, I address them, below.\nWhen commercial fishers off our sea coasts see swarms of such birds as gulls, shearwaters and gannets above a broiling sea they know it means that there are a lot of small fish concentrated in the area, chased up by bigger fish.  They don\u2019t shoot the gulls, gannets or other birds; they know that the gulls represent a healthy number of fish that the fishermen want \u2013 not the ones the gulls are eating \u2013 but the larger ones attracted to the smaller ones, of which only a tiny portion is actually consumed by the birds.  Cormorants are also a sign of lake health and robust fish populations no less than feeding frenzies in sea waters.\n \u201cIsland forest habitats\u201d are also identified as a matter of concern to those advocating for a reduction or total elimination of, the Double-crested Cormorant.   Their concern is understandable.  Remembering a near or total absence of cormorants many people are disconcerted by the most noticeable and undeniable result of the species\u2019 recovery.\nI would generally characterize that result as a return of island habitats to their original state, as they would have been had cormorants never been wiped out in the first place.   Taking into account that the carrying capacity for cormorants in Ontario (but not North America overall, as the above cited Wires and Cuthbert paper.\nThere is nothing inherently \u201cwrong\u201d or ecologically destructive about letting nature act naturally.   The cycles and incomprehensibly interconnected interrelationships between all the various parts of the environmental whole adhere to a cause and effect universe within the laws of Newtonian physics, nothing more or less.\nThe law already allows actions, up to and including lethal removal of cormorants, in that instance.  A new and unenforceable, Draconian measure is not needed.\nEven in the absence of an economic concern the means to protect trees from having cormorants already exist.\nThe unknown (and unknowable) number of trees killed by the presence of cormorants, either in absolute terms or as a percentage of trees overall, is miniscule.  Simply eliminating that part of the Ontario government\u2019s omnibus bill 66 that will allow \u201cdevelopment\u201d in the Green Belt and on the Oak Ridges Moraine will lead to the saving of significantly more trees, and more benefit from those trees, than would occur from eliminating all cormorants, pelicans and herons from the province.  A minor reduction in allowable tree removal by the forest industry would do the same.\nThe EBR also mentions as a rationale for this truly egregious policy concern voiced by members of the public for \u201cother species\u201d, none of which are specified.  Certainly the proposal itself puts a wide range of species at direct or indirect risk, including loons, pelicans, the other two cormorant species known to occur in Ontario, herons and egrets and terns.\nThe EBR makes no mention of funding to increase the number of Conservation Officers, or to provide them with necessary training and resources to protect other fish-eating birds.\nThe EBR states: \u201c\u2026the Ministry is proposing to create a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario. This new population management tool would allow persons who hold a small game licence to hunt these birds.\u201d\nIt is not \u201chunting\u201d as the term is defined in Canada.\nIn all previous instances following the 19th Century, \u201cseasons\u201d for game (including the trapping of furbearers) defined within Canadian legislation have been predicated on the need to \u201charvest\u201d individuals of native (and even non-native) species only on a sustainable level, usually by protecting them at times when either they are unsuitable for use (consumption, or commercial sale in the case of furbearers and commercially captured fish species) or are breeding or attending dependent young.  The only \u201cclosed\u201d season on Double-crested Cormorants will be from Jan first to March 14, when they are almost completely absent from the province.  The foundational precepts of post-19th century hunting have been sustainability, utilization and, albeit to a lesser degree, \u201cfair chase\u201d.\nThere can be little or no \u201csport\u201d involved in shooting cormorants.  They have no choice but to return to their nests and, as observations of culls have demonstrated to me, will fly back to their colony even when being shot off their nests, even when their mate is killed.\nThe EBR says:\n1.\tList the double-crested cormorant as a \u201cGame Bird\u201d.Hunters would be required to have an outdoors card and small game licence to hunt double-crested cormorants, similar to other species of game birds.\nWhat is being proposed is not remotely similar to what outdoors cards and small game licences allow with regard to \u201c\u2026other species of game birds.\u201d   All \u201cother species of game birds\u201d are hunted in the exact opposite manner, requiring utilization of the meat, bag limits and seasons set to prevent reduction of their respective populations, and at least a relative modicum of \u201cfair chase\u201d.\nThe EBR calls this eradication programme a \u201cnew population management tool\u201d.  It is not \u201cmanaging\u201d the population as the term is traditionally defined. No game management is predicated on eliminating the species being \u201cmanaged\u201d and wasting it as well.\nEach cormorant weighs about 4 pounds.  Any hunter filling the limit for a day\u2019s hunt would have to dispose of approximately two hundred pounds of waste.  The EBR provides no mechanism that would either enforce this happening, nor explain how it could.\nCormorant plumage is not nearly as waterproof as that of ducks, geese, and swans, and so those not retrieved from water quickly will sink. It is not normal for larger numbers of animals the size of cormorants to do so without deleterious effects to the water column overall.\nThere is no description of what \u201cregulations to implement the exemption and requirements\u201d could even be created, let alone an estimate of costs and source of funding.\nThe EBR states:\nTo accompany the proposed hunting seasons, the Ministry will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends. Monitoring of cormorants will allow the Ministry to assess the impacts of the hunting season and to adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns about population sustainability.\nThe proposal makes no mention where the source of the funding for population monitoring is to come, or how it is going to be applied given the rapidity by which significant population reduction will occur.\nThe take that will be allowed is not remotely \u201csustainable\u201d.  There will be colonies that be protected by enlightened management informed by basic scientific knowledge and the precepts of conservation, yes, but no indication is given in the EBR of any effort to determine how that will prevent the near, and possibly complete, eradication of the species as a breeding bird in Ontario within a relatively short period of time.\nThe EBR states: \u201cThe anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral\u201d.  The cormorant is an apex predator thus cannot help but be part of the environment, so a reduction in its numbers cannot help but produce \u201cenvironmental consequences\u201d.\nThe EBR states that, \u201cThe double-crested cormorant is abundant in Ontario and anticipated levels of harvest aren\u2019t expected to affect sustainability.\u201d\nIf there is no effect on sustainability, and the population is expected to remain stable, as it is in the management of other game birds, why do it?  It requires monitoring of the cormorants and at a time when Conservation Officers, already underfunded, are busy with regulations pertaining to sport fishing; they will also have to monitor cormorant hunting.\nNo one \u201charvests\u201d anything so that it can be thrown away.  What is being proposed is not a \u201charvest\u201d by the furthest stretch of the term and should not be so called.\nThe EBR states, \u201cHunters will continue to be reminded to properly identify their targets to avoid conflicts with migratory game birds and other waterbirds.\u201d\nHow?  An unenforceable law is not good legislation.\nThe EBR states that \u201cMonitoring of cormorant populations will allow adjustments in cormorant hunting regulations as necessary\u201d.  How will that be done and at what cost?\nThe EBR states: \u201cThose interested in hunting cormorants or who believe cormorants are having detrimental impacts will likely support the proposed changes.\u201d\nWhy would those who believe cormorants are having detrimental impacts likely support changes that will not have any impact on population size?  The proposal is to placate those believing cormorants are destructive to stocks of fish of interest to them, and that they damage the landscape to the detriment of the environment and esthetic values.  The EBR says so.\nThe EBR does not address the reasoning, the science or lack thereof, behind either proponents of the proposal, nor its detractors, implying equal weight to all arguments, without addressing any.  Individuals and groups do support or oppose the proposal, but the issue should be why, and the reasons judged objectively.  This is not happening and there is no opportunity, with the possible exception of future court challenges for it to happen.\nHunters motivated by oft-stated \u201cethics\u201d of hunting will not likely obtain permits to shoot cormorants.  Those ethics include fair chase, sustainability, and utilization.  They did not legislatively exist during the 19th century and earlier, we there was loss of many very common, even abundant, native species.  We learned that abundance alone is no guarantee against extinction.\nAs Environment Canada explains:\n\u201cit [the Migratory Birds Convention Act] only protected migratory birds considered either useful or harmless to humans. \u2026 several species of migratory birds which were excluded due to their \u201cundesirability\u201d to humans. For example, pelicans, cormorants, hawks and owls\u2026 These birds have since been recognized for their importance to both humans and the environment and have become protected under provincial and territorial legislation.\u201d\nHunters who would not waste meat or kill more than they thereby need, or kill for the sake of killing are not necessarily versed on cormorant diets and may assume that cormorants are, indeed, deleterious to desired species of fish, and may \u201cbuy into\u201d this plan and shoot cormorants, but the appeal is to those for whom killing is the attraction.\nThere is real risk of conflict between such hunters and the public, given that the \u201cseason\u201d proposed extends through the peak holiday season on lakes in Ontario where cormorants occur.  The majority of people who enjoy and use the out of doors are not hunters, and this demographic is being ignored in favour of those who are, and, I would suggest, the worst-motivated of those.\nHaving been observing cormorants for 61 years, I have come to be fascinated by them.   Many happy hours have been spent in or at the edge of colonies or in a boat observing them fishing or flying overhead or tending their young.  As an artist I have frequently portrayed them.  I have borne the scars of wounded ones I\u2019ve rescued, a small price to pay for saving so vibrant a life, when possible.  I literally know them inside out, having dissected many.   Most of the places one goes, they are not to be found, making the places I can see them all the more special to people like me.\nWhat is being proposed will leave many young to die from effects similar to be putting into an oven.  Others will die of hypothermia, dehydration does, or starvation.  One parent alone can\u2019t prevent such lingering deaths.\nUnder the Criminal Code of Canada (Criminal Code Part XI: Wilful and forbidden acts in respect of certain property: cruelty to animals) everyone commits an offence punishable on summary conviction who, \u201c(a) wilfully causes or, being the owner, wilfully permits to be caused unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to an animal or a bird\u201d.\nThe language is archaic and the law outdated, but it seems possible that the Criminal Code would apply to killing parent cormorants with dependent young.  Any such culling would easily be demonstrated as being willful even if the plan is to disguise the practice as \u201chunting\u201d.  Addressing something by a name other than what it is does not make it so, in the laws of the law.\nOntario\u2019s provincial legislation, the OSPCA Act (R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.36) is relevant in defining cruelty to animals.  It does include birds, and defines \u201cdistress\u201d as \u201c\u2026the state of being in need of proper care, water, food or shelter or being injured, sick or in pain or suffering or being abused or subject to undue or unnecessary hardship, privation of neglect.\u201d\nThe killing of parent birds might meet this definition.  The proposal is moot on the issue of euthanizing such young \u2013 hardly \u201chunting\u201d \u2013 which at any rate would not be possible with regard those in high tree nests, nor if the colony itself is protected.  It is a badly conceived idea on so many levels that I find it hard to believe it was ever put forward, let alone done so in such cavalier fashion.  Ontarians deserve better.\nThere is other cruelty that will derive from this proposal and that includes the inevitably high wounding rates that will occur.  In ordinary waterfowl hunting the rates are around the thirty percent mark, so far as we can determine from what little research has been done, although the range of estimates is broad (see, for example, https:\/\/kb.rspca.org.au\/what-are-the-wounding-rates-associated-with-duc\u2026).   It should be noted that when wounded birds can do so, they tend to seek to land on shore before their less than waterproof plumage slowly drags them under, so it will not necessarily be a case of \u201cout of sight out of mind\u201d, but rather a further source of distress to the non-hunting majority of people who enjoy nature and our waterways.\nWe are long past the time when we should see nature and natural forces as adversarial to our interests.   It is, in the end, the environment that supports us, and all we do.\nI strongly as I can urge rejection of this proposal.\n",

        "comment":"I object to this proposal for the following reasons:\n\u2022\tThis proposal has not provided sufficient evidence that there is a biological need to control cormorant populations. The proposal states that \u201cthe latest information indicating Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly\u201d. The Minister misled the public when on CBC radio he discussed cormorant diet and inferred their average consumption of 1 kg\/day was of game fish. Peer reviewed scientific studies have indicated that cormorant diets vary locally and are dominated by non-game fish species. I am not aware of any studies that have demonstrated lake wide harmful impacts to fish populations attributable to cormorants\n\u2022\tAllowing hunting of cormorants during the breeding season of many other colonial nesting birds and other rare birds that share these nesting islands will cause disturbance to non-target species resulting in lower nest success and possible abandonment of nesting sites over the long term. For example, piping plovers have been recently recorded at the Limestone Islands Provincial Park. Cormorants also nest there and on several other islands in the vicinity. Allowing cormorant hunting in these areas during the nesting season may prevent successful reproduction of plovers, or the re-establishment of other nesting sites in the area\n\u2022\tDespite regulations, it is unethical to hunt and harvest wildlife only to let it spoil\n\u2022\tAllowing a bag limit of 50 birds is not consistent with sport hunting in Ontario. This magnitude of harvest is not consistent with sustainable harvesting\n\u2022\tEncouraging hunters to participate in the mass killing of cormorants will denigrate hunters in the minds of the public and towards hunting in general. This is not what we want in Ontario\n\u2022\tMany nesting colonies are in remote locations. There will not be sufficient enforcement at these locations to ensure hunters do not leave carcasses at the kill site or floating in the waters around the colonies\n\u2022\tExisting legislation already allows a property owner to seek authority to harass cormorants on private property in order to protect valuable vegetation\n\u2022\tI believe that the environmental consequences of this proposal would be negative for the biological and social reasons stated above.

As well, I urge the government to not create a hunting season for these birds. There is no need to kill these migratory birds, and I am very disturbed by this proposal.\nPremier Ford promised to represent all Ontarians, not just the elites. Most of us do not kill wild animals for sport; and the demands of one lobby group, the sport hunting and fishing lobbyists,  should not determine environmental policy for our province. I have witnessed for myself a colony of Double-Crested Cormorants nesting with other migratory birds. I see that some trees do die, but understand that this is part of a natural process, and that nature regenerates itself without human interference. I believe that this proposal stems from a blood lust in the hunting community. There are hunters who kill for food. But there are those who hunt because they enjoying killing and it seems that they can never have enough animals available to kill. They seem to never  be satisfied and always want more and more animals available for them to shoot. Please do not give in to this selfish lobby group.

To kill for sport is unethical and immoral. Humans are the only species that continue to systematically exterminate other living beings for selfish egoic reasons with no sense of its impact on ourselves or the health of our ecosystems which sustain us here on earth. This proposed legislation is shameful and, if allowed to proceed, will rob our children and grandchildren of the joys of watching the cormorants fly, fish, and dry their wings. We need to be teaching them how to live in harmony with nature, not how to destroy it. It will cause unnecessary harm to innocent creatures of beauty. What we do unto others we do to ourselves. There is absolutely no excuse or argument that could provide valid reasoning for passing of this proposed legislation. It is a crime against humanity and the natural world that it\u2019s even being proposed. I hope you will, with love in your heart, with consideration of your children and grandchildren, respect and gratitude for nature, and the connectedness of all living things - vote NO to legalized hunting of comorants. Thank you!\n",

Yes, I know there are a few areas where cormorants are a problem, but why not a controlled cull in those areas rather than wholesale slaughter?\n  Just who is asking for this?  Is it OFAH?  I can't think that concerned professional biologists would be in favour of this.\n  What about the lethal danger to loons who look much like cormorants and are often found in the same areas?  This kind of wholesale slaughter could also threaten Great Blue Herons, who have a similar effect on vegetation when they roost.  And if people are concerned about nuisance species, then will there be similar programs for Canada geese, gulls, starlings and sparrows?   There is plenty of evidence that shows the detrimental effect on other species and the ecosystem when a particular species is targeted in the manner being suggested.\n   I have yet to see scientific evidence that shows cormorants cause any significant damage to populations of game fish species.  Is it not true that the presence of cormorants, herons, terns, gulls and loons in a lake system indicates a healthy fishery?\n   I earnestly request that the Ontario government rescind this legislation which can only damage our environment.\n",

If they are killed off on a large scale, this will upset the natural balance of the area. Why do some people want to kill them off? OK, they kill the trees in their colonies. But this is the natural balance. Their colonies are stable, they are not moving or spreading. It may be an eyesore to YOU, and the emphasis is intentional, my response is, don't go to that area. Many others care only that they belong in the place they are. They eat a lot of fish. Do they eat the fish that you want to eat? They eat different species than what we eat. Then there's the problem of the pollution in this area. Dunno about you, but I wouldn't eat anything that was pulled out of Lake Ontario... Then there is the big problem of the method used to kill them. You intend to shoot them. Can you guarantee no humans will be hurt or killed? One human injury is unacceptable. Also, can you guarantee that only cormorants are killed? Killing any other animal would further upset the ecological balance. Then there is clean up. If the remains, the biological waste, is not cleaned up fully, this will further upset the ecological system.\nIn summary, the proposed cormorant cull is irresponsible and badly thought out. I oppose it.\n",

        "comment":"While a hunting for comerants is, on the surface a method for pressuring populations, the scale needed would be so large that the number killed by hunters will almost certainly fall within the compensatory mortality of this species. This hunting season will undoubtly result in some terrible publicity for hunters and hunting culture as the general public could possibly see these animals go to \u201cwaste\u201d as this bird is not likely to be harvested for food, feathers, hide or any parts. This season won\u2019t be a \u201chunting\u201d season, it will be a culling season. If there is a necessity for culling - which has been clearly indicated by the evidence - the ministry of natural resources and forestry should manage our valuable commercial and sport fishing resources though a cull which includes the destruction of nests and eggs during the vulnerable nesting season - done by ministry employees. Not only would this method have the potential to actually reduce comerant populations (additive mortality), it would also not rely exclusively on a small section of the general public that hunts (and will even bother to hunt) for comerants - especially at the expense of the already damaged image that hunters have within the general population.\nThis is a situation where good management of a resource is possible - despite it not being good politics.\nThe fact that the ministry of natural resources has even suggested that hunters should be responsible for this type of culling is an example of the degree of mismanagement that many have come to expect for our natural resources.\n",

        "comment":"I am shocked that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry is proposing a virtually unlimited lethal intervention to control the population of the double crested cormorant. No scientific proof has been provided to support the two main reasons that are cited to justify the proposed hunt \u2013 namely the claims of the commercial fishing industry and private property owners that cormorants are detrimental to island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\nAnyone who has seen a cormorant colony will know that their feces are toxic and can destroy trees and other plant life. This in itself is no reason to allow hunters to have the ability to kill up to 50 birds a day with no season limit anywhere in Ontario.\nThe fishing industry has indicated that the cormorant is a threat to commercial fishing. However, much of the food sources for the cormorant are invasive, non-native fish species, such as the goby, that actually have a negative impact on sport fish, such as small mouth bass.\nThere may be cases where a cormorant colony threatens a species at risk. In these limited cases, it may be warranted to control a local cormorant population. However, there are many alternatives to a wide-spread virtually uncontrolled hunt.  Any alternative proposal should be supported by scientific evidence that there is a problem in the first place.\nOther aspects of this proposal that are unsupported and\/or may set dangerous precedents for other species include:\n\u2022\t50 day bag limit with no overall season limit\n\u2022\tNo limitation to geography\n\u2022\tAllowing hunters to hunt from boats\n\u2022\tEliminating the obligation for hunters to recover the carcasses of the birds they kill\n\u2022\tPotential disruption and impact on populations of other water fowl, including great blue herons that nest in the same locations\nI believe this proposal should not be implemented. If sufficient scientific evidence can be presented that demonstrates specific situations where the double crested cormorant is threatening species at risk, then a proposal should be brought forward that uses other non-lethal methods to limit the impact of specific colonies that pose the threat. Such as proposal should us other methods such as oiling eggs, introduction of birds of prey, and relocating\/removing nests. Only if these other methods are not successful should a limited hunt be recommended.\n",

Hunters are allowed to shoot them from boats on lakes and rivers and the risk to the general public who are walking, bathing, boating etc in the areas where cormorants are is just too great. How can you ensure that the public will remain safe while this is happening?\nI am also concerned about the environmental effect. How can you ensure that these birds are then picked up and disposed of properly?\nEvery species has a purpose and contributes to the web of life. Since the cormorant population has stabilized and is in possible decline, how can you ensure that these birds are not completely eliminated given the numbers and the length of time that they can be hunted within a year?  This will effect the populations of many other species in the long term as it always does.\nIf nature is allowed to take its natural coarse the cormorant population will stabilize over time (it appears that it already has). I am completely against hunting of this bird at this time. If the population has stabilized then a wait and see policy seems a more viable option.  This extreme measure -hunting 9 months of the year and 50 birds per day by each hunter in unacceptable to me.\n",

We teach fishing knowledge, skills, etiquette, ethics and conservation. We work to protect urban anglers continued rights to access Toronto\u2019s watersheds and shorelines. As stewards of our sport we support and actively participate in the conservation of Toronto\u2019s growing fisheries, fisheries biodiversity and the protection of watersheds and fish habitat. We have more than 2300 members on social media Facebook. Approximately 1800 of those members actually fish in Toronto and the GTA and are current Ontario Outdoors Card and Fishing License holders.\nThe areas we recreational fish encompasses Zone 20 Lake Ontario and Zone 16 Inland Waters. Lake Ontario provides the bulk of our fishing opportunities and fisheries. There are nine Lake Ontario Tributaries that flow through the GTA that have recreational fishing value. We have several storm water ponds scattered throughout the GTA. A few natural ponds and very small lakes across the top borders of the GTA.\nToronto Urban Fishing Ambassador (TUFA) Stance on the Cormorant Management Proposal:\nToronto Urban Fishing Ambassador supports the ERO# 013-4124 Proposal to list Double-Crested Cormorant as a game bird and create a hunting season in Ontario for population management.\nOur Observations:\nThe GTA fishing experience from spring to late fall includes sightings of Cormorants eating fish in any and every watershed. They can be found anywhere fish can be found. The open waters of the lake, near shore waters, embayment and harbours. Every decent fishing hole on the nine tributaries is clearly marked by the presence of Cormorants. All storm water ponds no matter how small have a couple pairs of Cormorants. The smaller lakes north of Toronto have their share of Cormorants as well.\nWe have observed Cormorants eating every fish species we fish for with the exception of Gar. The Cormorants obviously eat some species of fish in their juvenile or young adult growth states before they are of breeding size.\nOver the last six years, Cormorants have attended every Family Fishing Event we have held at Toronto Islands, Humber Bay Park, Topham Pond and Grenadier Pond. We often have kids excitedly commenting that the black birds have caught a fish and ate it. On event days when fishing has been slow the Cormorants have often out fished our entire group of 200 kids. The impact of our investment to promote recreational fishing and the enjoyment of our guests is diminished by the impact the Cormorants have had on the fisheries of the watersheds we use for Family Fishing Events.\nAcross the watersheds of the GTA we have observed a steep decline in populations of native fish species such as Blue Gill, Pumpkin Seed, Perch, Bullhead, White Suckers, Rock Bass, Small Mouth Bass and Largemouth Bass.\nThroughout the summer and fall of 2018 our members observed hundreds of sick or dead Cormorants. We reported some of our observations in the early summer and were informed the Cormorants were dying of Newcastle Disease.\nTypical signatures of Cormorant destruction of natural habitat have been observed at Tommy Thompson Park, Toronto Islands and Humber River. These changes to tree canopies and shorelines are visibly changing the biodiversity of birds and wildlife we observe in those areas.\nOur Concerns:\nDecrease in prey fish abundance.\nDecrease in populations of sport fish.\nChanges to the biodiversity of fisheries, birds and wildlife through the influence of Cormorants.\nDestruction of habitat in our Parks caused by the nesting practices of Cormorants.\nDecrease in novice sport fish fisheries (pan fish, Perch, Bullhead and Bass) utilized in Family Fishing Events and to promote fishing to new anglers.\nRecommendations to the Proposal:\nWe are concerned that the hunting proposal as it is proposed will not have a significant enough impact to control and decrease the numbers of Cormorants in the GTA. Hunting is not allowed in the GTA in areas surrounding the established Cormorant populations.\nWe are asking for further control measures to be directed at the established GTA Cormorant populations.\nThe measures we are proposing are egg oiling and nest removal at Tommy Thompson Park, Toronto Islands and Humber River.\nWe would like a one-time cull early spring before nesting begins at Tommy Thompson Park that significantly reduces the number of mating pairs.\nSummary:\nToronto Urban Fishing Ambassador supports (with or without our recommendations included) the ERO# 013-4124 Proposal to list Double-Crested Cormorant as a game bird and create a hunting season in Ontario for population management.\nThank you for your consideration.\n",

        "comment":"There are several issues with the current proposed cormorant \"hunt\" from my perspective.\nThe ethics of hunting itself generally dictate that the animals hunted are to be used for food or livelihood. There is no evidence that this is the case here so presenting this as a hunt is false advertising and will only serve those who actively campaign against hunting. To promote the shooting and disposal of dead animals does nothing to promote responsible use of our natural resources. Do not enact this as a \"hunting season\" but withdraw this quick fix and enact this as what is truly is, a wildlife control measure and conduct it as a management program rather than a marginally managed hunting season.\nIf this hunting season were to be implemented, what, if any, ongoing monitoring and related recovery actions are to be implemented to assess the impacts on cormorant populations and the anticipated benefits of reduced cormorant populations to fish stocks and terrestrial habitats. What, if any, are these measureable\/anticipated goals and how are they proposed to be measured. What will be the impact to existing wildlife programs of dedicating resources to new efforts to monitor a new hunting season. Self reporting by hunters should not be the only measure of impacts and even mandatory reporting comes with its own biases. I would suggest it will not be revenue neutral as there will be few, if any, new hunting permits issued as a result of this proposed regulation so funding will have to come from the already low funding in the budgets of MNRF. At what point will further interventions be considered as the proposal already seems to suggest that this hunting season is anticipated to have small impacts. Also, what is anticipated in terms of movement of cormorants into new areas as a result of hunting pressure on existing colonies-what sites might be vulnerable to establishment of new colonies-and will there be any consideration of sites in Ontario which should be closed to cormorant hunting\/shooting activity due to other sensitive features?\nWhat is the anticipated participation rate of Ontario hunters in this proposed season? how long might the effort continue until there is participant fatigue and what will happen then? Other than giving hunters and fishermen the opportunity to target an animal they see as a competitor for sport fish stocks I see that as proposed there will be limited opportunity for effective management or control of the cormorant population in Ontario as a result.\n",

The closest thing to scientific data that I read was that Great Lakes cormorant populations have  stabilized or declined slightly.  Therefore the conclusion that I make is that this proposal is being made to please a select few...ie...a political proposal, not one based on science.\nOnce killed  it is proposed that cormorants  be allowed to spoil.  We can get some extremely hot temperatures here.  Rotting flesh in the heat does not seem too appealing. What diseases could be the result of this? Also will the birds of prey population expand due to this new food source? What will be the impact on other animal and plant species as they have to adapt to this unnatural occurrence?\nI am an avid kayaker.  The west arm is dotted with islands. What assurance do I have that I will not be hit by a bullet from a hunter if he shoots at cormorants on an island that I have just paddled behind and am out of visibility?\nThis proposal allows cormorants to be killed during the nesting season. Please explain to me how it is humane to kill a parent and leave the chicks defenseless. What about other species that are nesting nearby at the same time?  Unintended casualties?\nI know that the Great Lakes are stocked with non native species for the sport fishers. The cormorant is a native bird.  Humans have altered the natural ecological order.\nI would like to see an education program put forth explaining why the cormorants exist, the part they play in biodiversity, and explain that the cormorant has a valuable role to play in the Great Lakes ecosystems. Humans have no problem changing the ecosystem to their advantage and just because one or two powerful vocal groups that align with the current provincial government wants them culled is not a scientific reason to do so. One of the vocal groups is property owners.  From my viewpoint of living on water I have observed owners decimating their property to bring city like conveniences to their rural setting. They have no trouble bulldozing down trees, blasting rocks etc, but they want the area surrounding their property to be pristine, hence they do not like to see an island where the trees have died due to cormorant habitation.  In other words the invasive species  called humans have no trouble altering the natural beauty of their own property but do not like to see a native inhabitant, the cormorant spoiling the view of the surrounding area.\nAs you can tell from reading my comments I have many questions.  I would very much like to see the scientific basis on which this proposal is based.\nI look forward to your reply to my questions.\nThank you for allowing me to submit my comments.\n",

In Georgian Bay, cormorants have been aggressively reducing small fish, on which salmon, whitefish and trout depend.  This is unlike any other wildlife effect anywhere I've seen across Canada because they are aggressive and destructive. This bird has taken advantage of the abundance of freshwater lakes in Ontario.\nThis is an invasive species. Cormorants need to be controlled and removing them from Ontario is warranted.\n",

        "comment":"I am very strongly opposed to the proposal to allow a hunting season on cormorants. The population is stabilizing and is serving as prey for eagles and other predators, who will be disadvantaged in their own recovery if the numbers of cormorants suddenly plummet. We are seeing a return to a more natural state after the decline in bird population because of pesticide use. Now is no time to interfere in the cycle. The proposal to allow carcasses to spoil is repellent and allowing shooting from a boat is hazardous. Altogether this proposal will encourage irresponsible shooters whereas responsible hunters will not be interested in slaughtering a large number of birds considered inedible. It is indeed sad that certain treasured islets have lost vegetation because of cormorant guano. To reduce this development, along with the levelling off of the population of cormorants, the Ministry could investigate constructive ways of discouraging them from settling in some areas. In trying to solve problems with maximum efficiency and firepower we have often created more problems and lost many benefits offered by the natural world. Let's be smart and avoid the regrettable and irreversible side effects this time. Thank you.\n",

This tells me that they are expanding their range and fast!  It is high time that we can cull the population as the devastation they cause is enormous. They eat large quantities of bait fish and deplete the feed for other species of fish and birds, like the ospreys and bald eagles ( now residing around Rockland).\nI am all for this proposed cull.\nThank you\nM  :)\n",

Not only is the extremely high amount of birds allowed to be killed daily disturbing, but that you want to increase the days of hunting to almost a year...so really, this birds will never have any relief to just live their lives. I'm sorry people decide to go build their cottages in their territory, that is their own fault.\nAt what point will  humans decide to live among nature, rather than constantly trying to destroy and subdue it?\nCormorants eat fish! you cannot change this so please reconsider destroying them for it! In the proposal there is a line saying you want to even allow the hunters to waste the meat? This is nothing but arrogance.  I have seen what happens when humans try and 'control' a species, or make things better.\nplease do not allow this proposal to go through! we need to stop taking over every inch of our wild spaces,  then kill off anything that may be competition with not our 'needs', but simply our frivolous wants.\nthank you\nbetty\n",

I am in the line of fire.\nWhile Cormorants transit the property daily I have not witnessed established birds.\nIn my 40+ years on the water, specifically in and around this area I have seen a population explosion of Cormorants. I have seen the damage they can do to property, (The Brother's; Snake; The Spectacles, etc.).\nDo I support a \"cull\",....Absolutely!\nMy preference is to oil eggs,...but I think numbers, (of nests); manpower; and environmentalists all contribute to nixing this as viable solution.\nSo, do I support a \"hunt\"?

A system in which individuals, (landowners, fishermen, hunters; properly licenced of course!) are used as the tools to deal with the \"problem\".\nIt really is passing the responsibility and therefore the dirty work of dealing with the problem from MNRF onto individual citizens.

Without research to prove that these aquatic birds are harming the broader ecosystem, no hunting season should be put in place.\nWe should reevaluate our use of waterfront spaces and consider that pristine lawns and beaches aren\u2019t needed everywhere.  Property owners need to blend with the environment, not bend the environment to fit their aesthetic.\nThe proposal mentions that these animals are just returning from the decimation of the 1950s.  Perhaps we should stop evaluating timeframes in comparison to our relatively short human lifespans and start thinking in longer terms to allow nature to rebound with more vigour.  Predators were not mentioned in the proposal, and I am wondering if there is a balance to be struck if their natural predators can re-establish themselves.\nFinally, where is the funding coming from to allow for the monitoring, enforcement, and prosecution of those who do not follow the hunting guidelines?

        "comment":"Wildlife Section\nPublic Input Coordinator\nMinistry of Natural Resources and Forestry\nPolicy Division, Species Conservation Policy Branch\nDecember 31, 2018\nRe: ERO 013-4124: Proposal to establish a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario\nThe North Pigeon Lake Association (NPLA) represents members in the Municipality of Trent Lakes and the City of Kawartha Lakes. NPLA supports actions that preserve and promote the welfare of the shoreline and the waters of north Pigeon Lake, its catchment area, and more broadly across Ontario. We also promote good government, including sound environmental stewardship.\nNPLA strongly opposes the proposal to establish a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario. NPLA is not opposed to hunting per se; however, we oppose this proposal as it stands because it lacks any supporting scientific evidence, lacks any clear objectives, poses a risk to co-nesting species, and potentially places water-based recreationalists at risk.\nThe following is a summary of why NPLA opposes this proposal:\n1.\tLack of science-based evidence\nIn 2013, after public consultation (EBR 011-7540), the then Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) published the policy document: Modernizing natural resource management: A policy framework for modernizing Ontario's approach to natural resource management. That policy reaffirmed that:\n\u201cEvidence-based policy, informed by sound science and information, is a cornerstone of MNR\u2019s natural resource management philosophy. This standard will continue to be applied when managing over broader landscapes.\u201d (OMNR 2013).\nAmong the many flaws in this proposal, the most obvious is a lack of any science-based evidence to support the policy. This is disappointing given the abundance of scientific literature available, much of it from MNRF scientists. Although by no means an exhaustive list, we reference some of the pertinent science below.\n2.\tDouble-crested Cormorant population status and trends\nThe proposal states: \u201c\u2026numbers began to increase rapidly from the 1970s to the early 2000s, with the latest information indicating Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly.\u201d\nWhile this statement is essentially accurate, no data on current population status or trends are presented to support the proposal. The statement ignores the fact that Double-crested Cormorants are native to Ontario and that the low population levels of the 1970s were a result of environmental contaminants. The recovery of Double-crested Cormorant populations in Ontario has been hailed as an environmental success story (Wesloh and Collier 1995).\nPopulations that have \u201cstabilized or declined slightly\u201d would indicate that instituting a \u201chunt\u201d as a \u201cpopulation management tool\u201d is unnecessary. Neither a target population size objective is presented in the proposal, nor how the proposed open season (March 15 to December 31), nor how the daily bag limit (50\/day) are intended to meet the (unstated) objective.\n3.\tImpacts of Double-crested Cormorants on fish populations, island forest habitat, other species and aesthetics.\nThe proposal states: \u201cThere continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\u201d\nNo evidence is presented to support this statement.\n3a. Impacts of Double-crested Cormorants on Fish Populations\nOntario\u2019s Provincial Fish Strategy (OMNRF 2015), presented the results of an environmental scan to understand the key trends and emerging issues affecting Ontario\u2019s fisheries resources. Double-crested Cormorants were not identified as a stressor to fish populations in that scan. If more recent information refutes that, the evidence should have been presented in the proposal.\nProvince-wide commercial fish harvest statistics indicate that, after declines in the late 1990s and early 2000s, landed weight has stabilized and landed value has increased to its highest level since 1994 (OCFA 2018). Most of the commercial fish harvest comes from the Great Lakes where Rainbow Smelt, Yellow Perch, Walleye, and Lake Whitefish make up approximately 80% of the harvest by weight (OMNRF 2015). Commercial harvest levels are influenced by many factors and the commercial fishing industry has expressed no concerns about (nor presents evidence for) cormorant impacts on fish populations (http:\/\/www.ocfa.ca\/).\nIn the Great Lakes, a number of recent studies have shown that cormorants are feeding primarily on invasive species rather than the commercially important species listed above. A study comparing Lake Ontario (Hamilton Harbour) and Lake Erie cormorant diets estimated that Lake Ontario diets consisted almost entirely of Alewife (51\u201356%) and Round Goby (25\u201342%), while Lake Erie cormorant diets were dominated by Round Goby (70%) (King et al. 2017). Another study concluded that declines in cormorant density in Lake Huron (North Channel and Georgian Bay) was likely due to the loss of Alewife that preceded the drop in cormorant numbers by about a year (Ridgway 2010).\nIn southern Lake Michigan, Alewife, Round Goby, and White Perch, collectively contributed over 80% and 90% of the diet of cormorants by biomass and number, respectively (Madura and Jones 2016). In Saginaw Bay, Lake Michigan, the three most common prey species observed by number (%) and biomass (%) were Round Goby (56.6%, 42.1%), Emerald Shiner (25.2%, 12.5%), and Yellow Perch (8.0%, 14.1%) (DeBruyne et al. 2017). In the Niagara River, Round Goby can make up to 85% of the biomass in cormorant diets during the breeding season (Coleman et al. 2012).\nThe evidence about whether cormorant predation impacts sportfish populations is mixed. There is some evidence that cormorants can impact sportfish populations on a local level and will respond to local cormorant population management (Fielder 2008, Fielder 2010); however other studies, in the same area, imply little impact of cormorant predation (Diana et al. 2006).\nThere are few studies on cormorant predation on inland lakes in Ontario. One study examining the relative demand for fish production by Double-crested Cormorants and anglers from Manitoulin Island lakes, found that, on Lake Kagawong, the three most common prey species consumed by cormorants by number (%) and biomass (%) were Rock Bass (31.5%, 38.3%), Yellow Perch (25.0%, 30.3%), and Smallmouth Bass (7.4%, 8.4%). Yellow Perch and Smallmouth Bass were the only species harvested by anglers and there was little overlap in size with those consumed by cormorants. For all lakes in the study, anglers generally harvested a greater percentage of fish production in the large size segments they targeted than cormorants consumed in the medium size segments (Ridgway et al. 2012).\nFish community changes are a result of the interactions of many environmental, biotic, anthropogenic, and other factors operating at multiple geographic and time scales (Jackson et al. 2001, Strecker et al. 2011, Chu et al. 2016).\nEstablishing a province-wide \u201chunt\u201d on Double-crested Cormorants in order to address (presumably local) \u201cdetrimental effects\u201d on fish populations is unlikely to achieve whatever unstated objectives have been established.\n3b. Impacts of Double-crested Cormorants on island forest habitats.\nBecause Double-crested Cormorants nest in large colonies, it is true that they can impact island forest habitats (Herbert et al. 2014). It is also true, however, that they occupy a very small percentage of island habitats (Wires and Cuthbert 2010). Damage to those habitats tends to be localized and should be addressed by local actions supported by good evidence (for example, the actions taken at Presqu'ile Provincial Park). In addition, non-lethal techniques have been effective in deterring tree-nesting by cormorants (McDonald et al. 2018) and should be considered where island forest habitats are impacted.\nA province-wide \u201chunt\u201d will not effectively address any local forest habitat objectives.\nFor private citizens who are concerned about damage to their trees or other property, Section 31 (1) of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (Protection of Property), already gives property owners the legal right to harass, capture, or kill cormorants if they are causing property damage. There is, therefore, no need for this additional \u201cmanagement tool\u201d to protect property.\n4.\tImpacts of hunting during breeding season for cormorants and co-nesting species.\nThe proposal would: \u201cCreate an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to December 31 each year across the province.\u201d\nThe proposed open hunting season includes the breeding season for Double-crested Cormorants. Shooting cormorants on nesting colonies will cause mortality of nesting adults and nest abandonment resulting in starvation of chicks.\nShooting cormorants on nesting colonies could also cause disruption or mortality of protected co-nesting colonial water-bird species such as Great Egrets, Black-crowned Night Herons, and Great Blue Herons as well as terns and gulls.\n5.\tPublic safety and conflicts with other lake users.\nThe proposal would: \u201cCreate an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to December 31 each year across the province\u201d; and \u201cAllow hunting from a stationary motorboat.\u201d\nA province-wide spring and summer waterfowl hunting season would be unprecedented in Ontario. Shooting cormorants will occur when recreational water use is at its peak. This poses a safety risk to cottagers, anglers, boaters, and others involved in outdoor recreation activities.\nNPLA is especially concerned about this aspect of the proposal. Putting non-hunting outdoor recreationalists in conflict with hunters, and in potential danger, is unacceptable.\n6.\tRegulatory Changes\nThe proposal states: \u201cEstablish a bag limit of 50 cormorants\/day\u201d;  \u201c\u2026amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to add provisions so hunters could allow cormorant to spoil\u201d; \u201c\u2026would be subject to conditions that require the person to retrieve and dispose of the carcass.\u201d\nThese changes describe a province-wide cull, not a hunt. NPLA believes the bag limit and retrieval provisions would likely be unenforceable.\n7.\tMonitoring Program\nThe proposal states: \u201cTo accompany the proposed hunting seasons, the Ministry will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends. Monitoring of cormorants will allow the Ministry to assess the impacts of the hunting season and to adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns about population sustainability.\u201d\nIn order to determine if the hunt is impacting \u201cpopulation sustainability\u201d a monitoring program needs to be in place prior to initiating the hunt in order to determine current population status. Benchmarks and indicators need to be established based on clear, measurable target population objectives. If the proposed \u201chunt\u201d is intended to \u201cimprove\u201d fish population status, then the same conditions apply to a fish community monitoring program. This proposal has no stated objectives for the hunt (neither for cormorant nor fish population targets), therefore it is unclear what will be measured.\nNPLA urges the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to withdraw this proposal. The proposed province-wide \u201chunt\u201d ignores scientific evidence and represents poor resource management.\nYours,\nNPLA Board of Directors\nLiterature Cited\nChu, C., Lester, N.P., Giacomini, H.C., Shuter, B.J. and Jackson, D.A., 2015.

We cannot assume this population will simply remain in place.\n    There is not enough data to suggest this will remain as a fixed population of\n    birds.\nIt is known that the area between Adirondacks and Algonquin is the largest\n    land connectivity we have with the US.

        "comment":"Dear Minister:\nI am writing to you to express my concern\u2014and my disgust\u2014with the proposal to allow \u201chunting\u201d of Double-Crested Cormorants in Ontario, as outlined at https:\/\/ero.ontario.ca\/notice\/013-4124. A daily bag limit of fifty birds per hunter, over a nine-and-a half-month hunting season, with an unconscionable dispensation allowing them to discard the carcasses to spoil, is an unreasonably permissive license, especially since the proposal fails to provide any indication of the motivation for this drastic measure. It is certainly a dramatic about-face from the celebration of this species\u2019 recovery from the effects of pollution, as expressed in the Environment Canada fact sheet The rise of the Double-crested Cormorant on the Great Lakes: Winning the war against contaminants (http:\/\/publications.gc.ca\/collections\/Collection\/En40-222-2-1995E.pdf).\nIn her comment on this proposal posted at https:\/\/gsfraser.blog.yorku.ca\/research\/conservation\/proposed-cormorant\u2026, Professor Gail Fraser expresses better than I could the ecological concerns regarding this proposal\u2019s impact on the species population and on the overall ecology; I refer you to her very direct and readable article.\nAs this concerns a migratory species, this is a matter of not only provincial and federal environmental and ecological concern, but also is relevant to our compliance with international treaties. Specifically, the Double-Crested Cormorant is covered by the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (1918), and the Ramsar Convention (1971), as described in The Cormorant Conflict (https:\/\/www.animallaw.info\/article\/cormorant-conflict), a 2006 brief by Nathan LaFramboise. The risks outlined by Professor Fraser show that the proposed regulations almost certainly violate the terms of these treaties to which Canada is a signatory.\nThe most absolutely unacceptable element of the proposal is the waiver of the normal hunting requirement that the killed birds not be allowed to spoil. Eliminating this dispensation would likely reduce hunters\u2019 impact significantly, because as the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources notes in https:\/\/www.dnr.state.mn.us\/birds\/doublecrestedcormorant.html, cormorant meat is usually considered unappetizing due to their diet of fish. Nevertheless, it is edible, and with some effort, can apparently be made palatable, according to an article by Adam Nicholson in The Telegraph (https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/comment\/personal-view\/3614362\/Cormorant-ste\u2026) and another (unattributed) in The Irish Times (https:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/opinion\/yes-people-do-eat-cormorants-1.128380).\nAt the webpage linked in the previous paragraph, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources outlines much more reasonable measures for managing the impact of these birds on property and fisheries. They have demonstrated due consideration for the birds\u2019 welfare as a species and individual dignity as animals deserving humane treatment, while also addressing human priorities for safety and property. I urge you to follow their example, and will be monitoring the issue as policy is set and regulations are updated\u2014and I vote.\nYours sincerely.\n",

Forty per cent of Bald Eagle nests contain cormorant remains, so they are clearly supporting those populations.\nAn unregulated cull will also result in damage to the Heron, Egret and gull colonies that nest near the Cormorant colonies.\nAttacks on cormorant populations have resulted in dispersal of them, and establishment of colonies in other parts of the province.\nThe rotting carcasses of birds, used for target practice, is an affront to the values of Native Canadians, who are teaching us to honor our fellow creatures, and treat them with respect.\nA cull may be appropriate, but should be carried out by professionals who do it in a way that is not dangerous for the public, who are fishing, boating, spending time on the beach and wildlife viewing on the Spit.\nPlease consult Gail Fraser at York University who is an expert on this subject and has published papers on the subject.\n",

Human beings do not have to live everywhere in pristine conditions.  There may be some game fish eaten, but I have not heard any quantification of the numbers and the true effect of the Cormorants on the game fish population.\n\u2022\tMy suggestion is to set the annual cull number per person at 10 per day, rather than the recommended 50, a number which seems to have no scientific basis, according to an interview with the government minister.  The reason for the suggested lower number is:\no\tIt could be \u2018a slaughter\u2019 of the population, if under the recommended number of 50 per day, a hunter shot 14,600 birds over one season, multiplied by a number of hunters across Ontario.\no\tApparently, hunters are required to dispose of the dead birds in a proper way, not just let the carcasses rot in place.  For a hunter trying to track down 50 birds each day and dispose of them properly would be hard to do.  Enforcement would be difficult, too.\no\tSome hunters and fisher people are so venomous in their comments about the presence of Cormorants in Ontario, that I believe they would willingly shoot 50 birds a day, not worrying about the disposal issue.\no\tA smaller number of birds that can be culled each day would help to keep the process in check, meaning that a manageable number of birds could be shot and disposed of properly, each day of the hunting season.\no\tThank you for recommending a Cormorant monitoring program be put in place.\no\tAccording to the EBR, the number of Cormorants is stabilizing or declining slightly. Culling some birds makes sense, but don\u2019t take down the whole\/most of the population.\n\u2022\tWhere did the hunting season length of March 15th to December 31st come from?

        "comment":"While I applaud a positive step in recognizing the need to control cormorant populations I feel that creating a hunting season is not sufficient by itself to provide effective control of the incredibly large flocks that are currently experienced, in my case, in the Lake Nipissing area. I have been active on the Lake for over 40 years and have seen the expansion of their flocks from zero over several decades to hundreds in single sightings. I also have  observed that hunting these birds will prove to be somewhat difficult in that they do not decoy effectively and immediately move to different locations with boat activity. Hunting will be principally limited to shoreline stalking and taking several birds from a flock of hundreds provides very low rates of reduction. I would also like to mention this places the onus of reduction on the general population at individual expense (as you are no doubt aware of the cost of steel or equivalent shot, not to mention firearms).. I would like to question why the MNR is not more proactive in this issue and why, for instance, the \"oiling \" of cormorant eggs  is not a useful additional tool in conjunction with the hunting proposal?\nThe need to control these sizeable flocks from an environmental point of view is also apparent from my perspective when one observes the guano covered rock islands in the vicinity and intuitive water quality impacts from runoff in the vicinity of these nesting sites. Impacts on fish fry also cannot be discounted from their large scale feeding habits. In conclusion I support a hunting proposal but feel that is insufficient in and of itself.

What is the basis for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s view that the population is stable or declining?  In the absence of an accurate determination of the population size, there is no rationale whatsoever for any sort of season on cormorants.\nThe proposal fails to describe a population management objective (population target) either for the province as a whole, or for any particular region.\nI reject the concept of a hunting season that would run from March 15 to December 31.  This is contrary to the fundamental principles of wildlife management and ethics of hunting.  A key principle of wildlife management must be protection of wildlife during the breeding season.\nThe proposed bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no possession limit through a season that extends more than 40 weeks of the year is exceptionally high.  This proposal is also without precedent under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for its failure to address the need for population sustainability.  Hunting at this level would lead to local and\/or regional extirpations.  The suggestion that this proposal would have only a \u2018neutral\u2019 impact is completely unfounded.\nThe policy proposal allows for shooting of Double-crested Cormorants in breeding colonies.  This could lead to disturbance and mortality of other nesting birds, including Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, and Black-crowned Night Heron.  Shooting at nesting colonies could also cause disturbance and mortality to other species, notably Caspian Tern, Common Tern, and Great Black-backed Gull.\nThe policy proposal makes reference to concerns from some individuals that cormorants may cause adverse impacts on fish populations.  The appropriate response to these concerns would be for wildlife managers to focus on a thorough and factual study to properly understand the food habits of the Double-crested Cormorant.\n",

The proposal did not produce any scientific evidence backing up claims that there is an overpopulation of these birds nor supporting data of the so called damage they create. These birds are native to Ontario and part of a balanced ecosystem. The hunting proposal of 50 birds per hunter is extremely excessive under any circumstance and problematic. These birds are not edible and the hunt then just becomes a cull  by private citizens. Further, the disruption to nesting areas that are shared with other birds will cause damage to other species. The retrieval of dead birds is another problem with the proposal, realistically there would be many birds left in places where they could not be picked up as well as the loss of chicks in their nests that die after one or both parents are killed.\nThis type of wholesale hunting should not be taking place in this day and age.

This includes spring and fall migration and the entire summer \u2013 when almost all peaceful recreational activities around wetlands and waterways take place, including birding.\nThe birds are inedible, yet would be simultaneously classified as game and allowed to spoil.

This species has recovered from low levels in the past - it is vulnerable to this again under this proposal. If, in certain locations the cormorant population has exceeded the carrying capacity of the place, or is causing a nuisance effect then a controlled hunt based on the evidence should be conducted, not this widespread shooting gallery type of response that is proposed.\nI am very concerned about the collateral damage to other species. With government cutbacks the manpower needed to monitor this hunt proposed to take place all over Ontario will certainly not be up to what is needed.  I support the science and evidence that is currently available about the cormorants and strongly suggest that the experts on cormorants be consulted and that they play a major role in the adjustments or cancelling of the proposal.\nThe sensible approach is to investigate the populations to see how they are affecting the local ecosystems and to take action based on the evidence that is gleaned.

        "comment":"All native species matter. The double -crested cormorant is a native species that has suffered serious declines in the past and is currently making a come back. While it is perhaps not the most attractive bird species, admittely consumes fish and is not considered an aesthetic enhancement by some these are not valid scientific reasons to try and exterminate this species.\nTrying to disguise this potential extermination effort  by proposing to  declare the double -crested cormorant  a game species  and giving hunters a virtually open season  to hunt them  defies conservation wisdom and should be beneath OMNR.  When   you consider that the double-crested cormorant is considered by most to be inedible obviously the object is not to provide hunters with a source of good quality game to hunt to eat and ensure that the  so called game species the double -crested cormorant population can be sustained for hunters.\nThis leaves one to ponder the real intent of this proposed legislation. Is it to provide \"hunters\" with endless \"hunting\" opportunities throughout the year and copious bag limits and in the process of doing so to appease fisherman (commercial and private individuals)  endless complaints by those who believe that the double -crested cormorant is eating their potential fish catches? Interestingly the maligned double -crested cormorant is probably doing them a great service by eating invasive fish species and habitat loss, increasing poor water quality, wetlands loss, stream alteration, agricultural runoff, cottage development, climate change, illegal and excessive fishing all of which affect fish habitat and fisheries sustainability are ignored. Is it the OMNR needing to pander to cottagers  loss of \"aesthetics\" complaints. How convenient and abhorrent  for OMNR  to try and solve the desires and misconceptions of hunters fisherman and those who complain about the loss of \"aesthetics\" by creating in effect  the legalized extermination of a native species under the guise of an creating a hunt for a species that (will be virtually unsustainable) for a species virtually nobody would consider eating. By the way how would all these unwanted carcasses  be disposed of by the hunters that want to shoot the double -crested cormorant but have no use for them?  Will they just be left to rot in the water or on land wherever they are shot?\nIn addition there is the potential harm permitting this hunt to take place will bring with it. Allowing it to take place during the nesting season of the target species and all other bird and other species of our biodiversity is disruptive  and makes no conservation sense. Finally what about all the rest of the residents and visitors to Ontario. Do they not deserve to be able to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of nature around Ontario's lakes and rivers with out being disturbed or threatened by the gun shots of  hunters in a  virtually open season on the double -crested cormorant.\nPlease drop this ill advised , environmentally damaging  and unjustifiable  decision in terms of sound, sustainable conservation  to make the double -crested cormorant a \"game species\" and  legalize its   extermination  through hunting.\nOMNR needs to demonstrate  a real commitment to protecting what should always be its primary focus that being the long term protection  and sustainability of Ontario's  fragile and essential biodiversity and natural ecosystems  to ensure that they are there to support , and  provide the life supporting ecosystem services that they currently provide us for the next seven generations and beyond. To do any less is  both irresponsible and a dereliction  of OMNR's duty to all Ontarian's now and for the future.\n",

Besides the ethical reasons for traumatizing, killing and maiming innocent birds, I worry about the effect of dead birds floating around, about bullets that can kill whatever else gets in the way, about the lead from the bullets and about natures equilibrium in general. I was aghast at the statement about how much FUN it would be to go kill them. Please, do not do this. I live next to Georgian Bay and have never felt that they are an imposition in any way. I hardly see any !! Teach people that every life should be treated with respect and that includes cormorants and that killing is never fun. Those birds were here long before we were and they did fine without peoples interference. Please read the article on the Animal Alliance website regarding their history.

And, I'm the Director of Toronto Residents for Cormorants and Nature that convinced Toronto mayor David Miller to declare April 12th \"Cormorant Day\" to celebrate these \"amazing and magnificent birds\".\nPremier Ford, I'm surprised that your government would present such an ill considered policy as EBR Registry Number 013-4124.  Even, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, whom I suspect was given this policy as a political gift, has reservations about it as you can view in their EBR submission here: https:\/\/www.ofah.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/ERO-013-4124-cormorants\u2026\nProblems with EBR Registry Number 013-4124:\n- made up \"problem\" to solve\n- there is no scientific justification\n- would harm co-nesting birds and their dependent young many that are federally protected species\n- would cause cruelty to chicks as they'd starve and \"cook\" to death in the sun and elements\n- would cause wounding and great suffering (I've witnessed this at Presqu'ile Provincial Park and in a  video of a bird wounded at Middle Island)\n- would exterminate cormorants from the province - depending on participation rates, in less than one season\n- would create public safety risks for cottagers and tourists on lakes\n- unenforceable\n- paints hunters and fishermen as mindless extremists\n- paints the government as mindless extremists\n- is a waste of my tax dollars\n- is simply a disgrace\nDouble-crested cormorants are a native species that has recovered from persecution and environmental contamination (DDT etc...) to form healthy colonies on secluded islands and peninsulas near abundant supplies of small fish - mostly non-native fish i.e. round gobies and alewives. The fact that a few trees in this marginal habitat will die due to the bird's guano, is a natural process to be understood and supported not \"tidied up for you\" by a massive slaughter of these birds. Toronto's Tommy Thompson Park has the largest colony of Double-crested cormorants on the Great Lakes, a spectacular sight to be viewed. The TRCA promotes the Park as \"provides excellent fishing opportunities in the many small bodies of water around the park that attract many different types of fish\" please find details here: http:\/\/fishingtoronto.ca\/tommy-thompson-park.html  While I understand that fishermen don't like anyone to be fishing near-by, it is unforgivable that the government would seek to demonize and exterminate these birds to appease fishermen. There is no conflict between fishermen and cormorants. It's a \"made up\" problem.\nThis policy is based on persecuting a native bird species and for political grandstanding. It has no merit and needs to be stopped.\nPlease protect these birds by supporting the listing of cormorants on the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act. It's the right thing to do.\nThank you for this opportunity to comment.\nRespectfully submitted,\n",

        "comment":"The proposed plan to allow persons to kill up to 50 cormorants a day is an ill-conceived strategy designed to address a problem that does not even exist. The cormorant is a native species whose population declined in years past before rebounding with the banning of dangerous and lethal pesticides. Its population is currently stable, and it is not a threat in any way.\nHowever, even if it were an issue, the proposed solution to allow this hunt to take place throughout the entire spring summer and fall would be a serious threat to many other species whose nesting habitats are in close proximity to cormorant populations. To allow hunting in those spaces, particularly during breeding season, would have a similarly negative effect on the population of species such as gulls, herons and bald eagles, for example, not to mention the disruption to humans trying to enjoy some time outdoors.\nIt's difficult to understand how this proposal was conceived, on what basis and how the idea of 50 birds per person per day was arrived at. It is outrageous and hopefully the proposal will be abandoned once you have had a chance to study it further.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment!\n",

        "comment":"I am totally against the proposal to establish a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario. This proposed hunt is completely unnecessary. I have done considerable work and study on the cormorant issue since first hearing of the proposed hunt in early December.\nThe populations of cormorants had almost completely collapsed due in a large part due to chemical poising in the 1950's and 60's but they made a spectacular comeback but by all accounts numbers have peaked and have since stabilized and recently there has actually been a decline in numbers in recent years. One researcher says that they have reached a 'zero population growth'.\nScientific evidence shows that the presence of cormorants indicates a healthy fishery and a large part of cormorant diet is alewife and gobies that are non-native fish. They are part of the ecosystem and yes their nesting habits have killed trees but evidence indicates that tree nesting cormorants does not have had a negative impact on other tree nesting birds such as herons. It is my understanding that where cormorants have been a nuisance effective control measures have been put in place to control their numbers. To that I am not opposed.\nThe 'concerns' about the numbers of cormorants seem to come from a few people or organizations.  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters seems to be the source of hatred of cormorants in Ontario. They always seem to mention emotional points such as smelly guano and the destruction of vegetation. Guess what other species do the same so my fear is first a cormorant hunt and then what?hunting of great blue herons, maybe seagulls or whatever the flavour of the day is. No hunting is not the answer, a proper well balanced ecosystem is. That is largely achieved by allowing nature to runs its own course and only interfering in grave instances such as when there is a threat from invasive species. On the Ontario commercial fishery webpage there was no mention of cormorants.\nI had a trip to Newfoundland last spring and one of the highlights of my visit was a boat tour of the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve. Along with visitors from around the world I witnessed the presence of thousands of seabirds on the offshore islands that make up the reserve. I will not bore you with the details except to say that it was truly a magnificent sight and is billed as nature's greatest wonders anywhere in the world. I would not disagree. Perhaps we could someday have something similar in Ontario some day.\n",

Also ammending various environmental acts for  this purpose could be a slippery slope and lead to more ammendments in the future to the detriment of the wildlife they are meant to protect.\nHunting during nesting season will effectively increase the bag limit as the young will be left to starve. For every 1-2 birds expect another 3-5 to die.\nOther migratory birds nesting and foraging in the same habitats as the cormorants will also be negatively effected during their nesting season as well.\nI think a lot more thought needs to go into such a decision.

There is evidence that the guano, while having a negative impact within our time frame on some vegetation, is also facilitating vegetation.  Who is to choose which is better?  It just is.

Among PSG's members are biologists who have research interests in Pacific seabirds, government officials who manage seabird refuges and populations, and individuals who are interested in marine conservation. PSG members serve as scientific experts and conservation leaders within their local communities. Collectively, the Group\u2019s members have a great deal of knowledge and experience with respect to seabird conservation.\nThere is no scientific evidence that a 10-month open season on Double-crested cormorants will bring the desired result. The analysis to support this management objective appears to be based on incomplete scientific information. Dozens of studies have repeatedly shown that cormorants do not have a significant negative impact on commercial fish populations, with most of these studies targeted specifically on the Great Lakes. For example, studies on Lake Ontario indicate that fish most attractive to human fishermen comprise less than 2% of cormorant diets, and that cormorants consume about 0.5% of critical prey fish, an insignificant number especially when compared against the 13% taken by sport fishermen (Weseloh & Collier 1995).\nIt is well known that cormorant diets consist of mostly non-sport fish species like the invasive Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) (Belyea et al. 1999, Reed et al. 2003), and the invasive round goby Neogobias melanostomus (Seefelt 2018). Indeed, the Great Lakes ecosystem has been severely damaged by more than 180 invasive and non-native species that ultimately degrading habitat, out-competing native species, and short-circuiting food webs. Using the Double-crested Cormorant as a scape-goat is inappropriate given the damage people have done to the Lake ecosystems.\nThe proposed hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants, March 15 to December 31, includes killing adult birds provisioning young during the breeding season. This amounts to unethical animal treatment. Untold numbers of carcasses  would be left in the field, luring scavengers (e.g., vultures, eagles) into areas where they could be mistaken for target species and caught in the crosshairs. Additionally, widespread rotting carcasses pose a local threat to water quality and human health while negatively affecting the public\u2019s access to wildlife viewing.\nLethal management tools are not effective at decreasing fish predation, and may simply allow other invasive species to take the cormorant\u2019s place. The proposed management of cormorants does not address the root causes of fish population instability or decline, and directly contradicts current conservation measures, locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally.\nThe Government of Ontario should pursue a structured, adaptive decision-making approach and first test the effectiveness of alternative cormorant management (via egg control, etc.). The benefit of this formal, repeatable approach is that sensitivity analyses and monitoring programs pre\/post management provide data on the impact of the decision. This is in contrast to the current, ad-hoc approach, which could lead to undesirable outcomes misaligned with the Government\u2019s values and objectives surrounding the recovery of native fish populations.\nThank you for reconsidering this proposal.\nSincerely,\nMark Rauzon\nVice-Chair for Conservation\nPacific Seabird Group\n4701 Edgewood Ave.\nOakland, CA 94602\nconservation@pacificseabirdgroup.org\nLiterature Cited:\nBelyea, G.

This proposal seems to me a political move to please certain constituents, not for the greater good of humanity.\nSecondly. I object to the government deciding which animal should live or die on a human and moral ground. I feel it is a total abdication of the government's responsibility to turn to ordinary citizen to try and control other beings deemed \"undesirable\". We have a responsibility to protect all animals species, regardless of our human bias or desire to control what is acceptable when it comes to nature. The natural environment if not ours to decimate at will to please cottage owners or rich boaters on Ontario lakes.\nThird. I do not believe that most of the 50 animals per hunter would be consumed. My understanding is that the meat is not palatable. The birds will be left to waste after being killed and more likely maimed and left to die a painful death.\nFourth. Although we would like to believe that most hunters would kill the birds instantly, the reality is that the use of shotguns or single bullet rifles will only wound most of the animals and would be unretreavable in the water or islands.\nFifth. I don't think that hunters will be willing to spend a lot of money on permits, rifle, bullets, boats, gasoline, etc. To hunt cormorants. They are more likely to just kill the ones they see close to their waterfront property and be done with it. Who is going to check to see if the law was followed?\nSixth. How is the government of Ontario going to make sure the law is enforced and environmental regulation followed? Will the government police the shore lakes for months?\nSeventh. Nature has its own way of regulating overpopulation. Usually, diseases will reduce animal population in the wild. No need to for humans to intervene. Dead trees and unsightly areas caused by bird feces does not justify a decision to kill these birds or any animals.\n",

        "comment":"This is a very bad bill.\nIn my youth I loved nothing better than duck and grouse hunting: please realize that I appreciate and understand hunting culture.  However, this bill goes against so many of the principles of ethical hunting.  It is inviting people to be vigilante killers, not hunters.  They may slaughter dozens of cormorants every day, not eat them, and \"allow them to spoil\".\nGood wildlife management policies are evidence-based. It is bad management to allow such actions without first consulting the expert scientists who are familiar with the bird and its place in aquatic ecosystems.  There is no evidence that the Ministry has done this, and there is also no evidence that the Anglers and Hunters, who have lobbied for this, have undertaken any conclusive studies of their own.  There is no evidence presented that this bill will have its desired effects.  It is questionable whether cormorants have any appreciable effect on the populations of the species of fish that anglers are after.\nI request a copy of the correspondence, data, studies, and analyses  that this proposed bill is based on.  If you do not respond, I will take this to mean that the evidence is not there, and the Ministry has abandoned its responsibilities toward the public good.\n",

First off, I do not believe the Double crested Comorants should not be classified as a game bird - I do not believe people have any interest in eating the meat of this bird. Also the time frame and daily alottment are frightening. I am hoping the government of Ontario is not being swayed by lobbiests or listening to one side over others. The implementation of this proposal would have far reaching effects. The ecology system is very complicated with its own checks and balances. Before anyone starts acting as God, with the powers of life and death, I sincerely hope extensive research and consultation has been done. Once done this cannot easily undone - destruction is always easier than construction. I hope you reconsider this proposal and find an alternate way or compromise that is less destructive and palatable to all.\n",

        "comment":"This proposal regarding the Double- crested cormorant is not remotely like a hunt. It is a legalized slaughter. These are not game birds. They are not difficult to find or shoot. They do not require stalking or tracking. One does not have to scout out their locations or wait in blinds for them. They do not actually require any sort of \u201chunting\u201d prior to killing. There is no \u201csport\u201d involved, other than for those who simple enjoy wanton killing.\nPlus, they are not consumable, so they have no value as food. So, again, the \u201csport\u201d is pure killing.\nWhile I do not approve of sport hunting at the best of times, there is definitely nothing sporting about a \u201cfish in a barrel\u201d type of wholesale slaughter mascarading as a hunt.\nThe ecological consequences of large quantities of carcasses being left to rot on shorelines, in waterways, in shorebird nesting areas - and the subsequent attraction of scavengers (rats, flies, etc), impact on water quality, optics for other users of these area, as well as safety - also needs to be taken into account.\nA cull may be justifiable. But it must be controlled and quantifiable. This proposal, as it currently exists, is not.\n",

        "comment":"I am a Conservation Biologist in the US and have studied and monitored waterbirds in North America for the last 20 years, mostly while employed as a Research Fellow at the University of Minnesota and as a Project Coordinator for the US Fish and Wildlife Service. I have extensive experience monitoring colonial waterbirds, especially Double-crested Cormorants (DCCO) in the US Great Lakes, and I have been coordinating and reporting on monitoring efforts in this area since the late-1990s. I also have extensive experience researching human conflicts with fish-eating birds, and have worked with colleagues around the world studying and managing human-cormorant interactions.   As part of this work, I have reviewed and commented on every management proposal developed for DCCOs in the US since 2003, and I have also stayed abreast on management of other cormorant species in other parts of the world (Europe and Asia).  I have published several papers on numerous aspects of DCCO monitoring, research and management, and have hosted and participated in many workshops and symposia to address conflicts with DCCOs. Finally, in 2014 I had a book published by Yale University Press that provides a detailed history of the species in North America since the arrival of European settlers to the continent.  It includes a rigorous review of the science undertaken to document the cormorant\u2019s alleged impacts to resources, and examines whether the management that occurred through 2012 was supported by science. The book was specifically written to enhance understanding of cormorants and their presumed impacts, and as a resource for wildlife managers trying to resolve human-cormorant conflicts.\nComments: I can honestly state that of all the many proposals for cormorant management that I have reviewed, this proposal from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry is by far the most ill-conceived and irresponsible approach I have seen to date. It essentially misses all key criteria for a reasonable and rational approach to resolving conflicts with a native wildlife species.  I highlight a few points below in support of my objections.\nNo distinction between real and perceived impacts.\n1)\tThe proposal details do not provide a clearly defined problem statement.  Instead, the same old concerns that have been expressed about cormorants in North America since the arrival of European settlers (Wires 2014) appear to be the impetus for this plan. What evidence do you have to show that any of these concerns are valid? Why now? At what locations might they be occurring? At what scale? In what time period?  By not distinguishing between real impacts and concerns that may not be valid, you are simply authorizing large scale persecution of a native species that has an important ecological role in Ontario waters.\n2)\tDetrimental to fish populations, island habitats and other species.  Again, where is the evidence that detrimental impacts are occurring?  I have reviewed hundreds of scientific studies that examined the DCCO\u2019s interaction with fish, forests and other species. Based on my review, diminishing DCCOs in the VAST majority of locations is not going to benefit these resources.  Please see Wires (2014) chapters 12, 13 and 15 for thorough review of the scientific literature.  As well, consider that DCCOs consume many exotic fish species and in this regard provide beneficial ecological services. Moreover, a recent analysis by Wyman et al (2018) indicates that managing DCCOs may negatively impact other co-nesting colonial waterbirds.\nUnclear goals for hunting season\n1)\tWhat is the hunting season supposed to accomplish? Since it is being considered as an approach to addressing concerns about impacts to fish and other natural resources, I assume you will want to see positive benefits in these resources. But no plan is identified to describe how changes to fisheries, island habitat and other species will be measured.\n2)\tWhat is your population target for DCCOs? What are the criteria for evaluating this essential part of the management intended? Nothing is identified.\n3)\tIs the goal just some sort of hunter satisfaction? Even if this is the goal, no plan is described as to how this will be evaluated.\nFar too liberal bag limit\n4)\tThe bag limit of 50 birds \/ day \/ hunter is far too liberal. If participation is broad, this could easily result in massive losses in one season. Consider an example from the US.  In the state of South Carolina, a similar approach was instituted via a special permit under the Public Resource Depredation Order beginning in 2014. This permit allowed unlimited take of cormorants on just two inland lakes for one month in winter.  During 2014 and 2015, about 900 individuals were issued permits, and approximately 26,000 cormorants were killed in just two seasons (Wires 2015; Petersen 2016).  Though the Canadian proposal has bag limits of 50 birds per day, it is far more liberal in that: a) it allows hunting the entire time DCCOs are present in Ontario; b) there is no information to suggest that sites where hunting will be allowed will be limited; and c) it allows hunting during the breeding season, when far more birds are vulnerable because they are easier targets as they sit on nests, and additional mortality occurs to chicks and eggs when a parent is lost. Thus, if even 100 people were to hunt regularly, the potential for very large numbers of birds to be destroyed rapidly is very high.\nGreat Lakes population trends not clearly understood\n1)\tYou note that cormorants in the Great Lakes \u201cbegan to increase rapidly from the 1970s to the early 2000s, with the latest information indicating Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly.\u201d However, in US waters, data from biennial monitoring efforts indicate that  DCCOs have declined fairly steadily since their peak numbers in 2005.  Monitoring by F. Cuthbert and L. Wires (unpubl. data) regularly undertaken for the USFWS document a 36% decline in US Great Lakes between 2005 and 2016.\n2)\tOntario has not conducted a Great Lakes DCCO survey since 2007-2009, a decade ago.  Thus the province does not have up-to-date data on Ontario\u2019s population size or Canadian Great lakes trends.\nAssessing population level impacts of hunting\n1)\tAs migratory birds, cormorants in Ontario are part of a larger population.  They comprise a significant proportion of the Great Lakes population.  Since Ontario does not have up-to-date baseline data on DCCO numbers, how will you track the impact hunting may have, both in Ontario waters and Great Lakes-wide?\n2)\tBecause it takes two parents to raise a clutch, hunting during the breeding season will result in high chick and egg mortality through the death of at least one parent. This will occur through starvation or predation by gulls facilitated by human disturbance and removal of a parent. No mention of any precautions to avoid such inhumane circumstances is even made.  Years ago culling at a colony by OMNR was videotaped and made available to the public. The fact that chicks were being abandoned and or orphaned during the operation was terrible PR for the OMNR and led to the cull being stopped.   Much of the public will be horrified by the aftermath of such an undertaking and I imagine the strong group of animal rights activists will do all they can to publicize such information. This seems like the OMNRF is opening a can of worms that will cause an amazing amount of trouble and distrust of the agency among many Ontarians.\n3)\tIn addition to impacts to cormorants, no mention of the potential for massive disturbance to co-nesting species is made.  How are all of these impacts going to be monitored and what precautions undertaken to avoid them?\nDisregard for the US Cormorant management experience.\nIn 2003, the USFWS finalized an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate options for managing conflicts with DCCOs. The EIS resulted in the primary tools for cormorant management utilized between 2003 and 2016, the expanded Aquaculture Depredation Order and the Public Resource Depredation Order.  These regulations had no requirement for science-based evidence of impacts, and their implementation, along with limited use of depredation permits, led to roughly three quarters of a million DCCOs and an untold number of eggs and nests being destroyed between 2003 and 2016.  Finally, in 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled on a lawsuit brought against the USFWS for continuing with cormorant management under the depredation orders without rigorously evaluating the effect of the depredation orders on DCCOs and other affected resources (i.e. fish populations) or examining other management alternatives. The Court found in favor of the plaintiffs and the depredation orders were vacated in May 2016.  Currently, limited management occurs only under individual depredation permits and is not permitted to protect free swimming wild fish.\n1)\tThis effort was ultimately not sustainable for several reasons. One major one was that the USFWS did not conduct the rigorous science needed to evaluate the effects this management was having on cormorants and other resources.   Though the destruction of huge numbers of birds and eggs pleased certain groups of the public sector, it\u2019s impossible to link the scale of destruction with changes in targeted resources because the necessary monitoring did not take place.  This is partly because it is really hard and expensive to do the monitoring, and partly because documenting the impacts of management was not that high of a priority, as long as some members of the public were pleased.  As noted, this ongoing approach to management was found to be flawed by the Court, and the USFWS was exposed for overstepping the bounds of the National Environmental Policy Act. Given this context, the fact that Ontario\u2019s proposed approach is far less rigorous than the demonstrably flawed measure the US implemented should give the OMNR reason to pause and reflect.\n2)\tMoreover, hunting was initially considered in the EIS but ultimately rejected for the following reason: \u201cThe proposed action [depredation orders] is preferable to hunting largely for ethical reasons. From purely biological and economic perspectives, hunting might prove an effective way to kill numerous DCCOs at minimal expense to the government. However, we have serious reservations about authorizing a non-traditional species to be hunted when it cannot be eaten or widely utilized and feel that there are more responsible and socially acceptable ways of dealing with migratory bird conflicts.\u201d Launching an open season on a nongame animal that can\u2019t be utilized violates all the ethics that surround hunting.  It simply perpetuates the idea that cormorants are bad birds that harm human interests and should be killed.  Such an approach has the potential to leave a legacy far worse than the one the USFWS will be remembered for.\nDisregard for the successful approach taken and significance of the colony at Tommy Thompson Park.\n1)\tThe nonlethal management at TTP is possibly the best example of living with cormorants worldwide.  The research and management techniques here have been ground breaking and have established Toronto as a leader in alternative management practices. In addition, the colony there is a spectacular natural resource in the heart of a thriving urban environment.  What is the plan for this colony? Will it be protected?\nConcluding remarks: As noted above, most of the basic elements of a serious management plan are missing from this proposal. Unfortunately, as a result, the OMNRF emerges as highly unprofessional, misguided and na\u00efve.  This is surprising because in the past the OMNRF has proceeded much more carefully and embraced a higher standard for decision making and conflict resolution that included science and ethics.  Because not even a clear description of the problem is provided, it\u2019s difficult to offer meaningful suggestions for resolution.  However, it sounds like the same perception of a problem that has been with us for a long time is at the root of this proposal. But by allowing an open season on cormorants, the OMNRF returns to a 19th century anti-predator mentality that sets a wicked precedent for the mismanagement of fish-eating birds. I hope you will reconsider this plan, and start with a rigorous statement of the problem, which will guide the direction to pursue.  A perceived problem as outlined in the proposal may require a very different solution than the one now being considered.\nLiterature cited\nPetersen, B. 2016.

I have observed first hand how the volume of these birds devastate the environment.  I have witnessed with video proof what happens when 4000 to 5000 of these birds land right outside my home and devour a pound of fish EACH in one go.  It is no wonder that I have rarely even seen baitfish around the property.\nSecondly the large devastation they cause on shorelines due to their excrement, is both well documented and factual.\nTheir numbers have been allowed to balloon out of proportion with no checks in sight.  They are at the top of the food chain around here unfortunately because of lack of action and I am in favour of using whatever reasonable means the government has at its disposal to reduce their numbers.  If it is allowing them to be hunted at high bag limits and reduced 'spoilage' restrictions then so be it.\nHowever, a hunting season alone won't solve this problem. It rarely does.. Hunters are conservationists to the core.  What is really needed are mass organized culls or similar.\nIt is an out of control problem. I would be glad to share two videos I took on subsequent days in the summer of what 5000 cormorants look like when they land less than 50 yards from shore in a fish feeding frenzy.\nIt is time to make the difficult decisions and fix this mess that has gone on for too long.

        "comment":"I find this proposal alarming.  I am a retired biologist.  As I interpret it, a coordinated attack, which is entirely possible given the current social network, coupled with the number of people with Ontario hunting licenses, could eliminate most cormorants in Ontario in any given year. While most hunters are far too intelligent to participate, if even 2% did, at the \"harvest\" (read \"execution\")  rate of 50\/day ---???    The OMNRF biologists (I presume some were involved) who wrote the proposal do not provide any numbers for further consideration of this concern.  I have no confidence in the inclusion within the proposal for a \"cormorant monitoring program\",  unless the details are specified in the regulation.  From my experience, the Ontario Government will be reluctant to commit to any long-term commitment of funding for specific wildlife population monitoring -- especially for a non-game species.\nMy handwritten comments on the print-out that I made of the proposal almost equal the length of the proposal.  I will try to confine further comments on it to the following few points:\n1.  Pre-1950 \"populations\" are mentioned but no numbers are given for the size of these populations -- this is essential base-line information -- especially so after the apparent levelling off of populations over the past few years.\n2.   The cormorant population increases beginning in the 1970's seem to coincide with the beginning of the decline in alewife populations and their die-offs that were such a problem on Great Lakes beaches in the 1960's.  Has OMNRF done any actual research into the diet of cormorants?  Modern DNA research (i.e. eDNA) would seem to be a relatively easy tool tool to determine what they are eating.\n3.  I have an image of hunters sitting in their \"stationary motor boat\" (apparently canoes, kayaks, sailboats are not allowed) banging away at nesting cormorants on an island\/islet, then because of  regulation requirements, going on-shore to pick up the dead birds, so as to dispose of them somewhere -- all apparently without regard for any other nesting birds (gulls, terns, herons) on said island\/islet.  Am I missing something here?  And if adult cormorants returning to their nest are shot, what happens to the nestlings?  There is a reason why hunting seasons do not extend through the breeding season .  I think the word that best describes it is \"compassion\".\n4.  Re. disposal of carcasses:  Even if the proposed regulation were to provide specifics, I would have to question this.  I know many hunters, and all dispose of their deer and moose guts \"where the coyotes, foxes and wolves can feed on them\" -- mostly at the kill site.  I have never known a hunter who buried the offal.  We live in the country and know that come hunting season our dogs, who are trained to normally stay on our 100 acre property, will at times haul in deer legs and pieces of hide.  Fortunately I live well away from the Great Lakes -- where cormorant disposal is likely to become an issue under the proposed regulation.\n",

One only has to be up early at first light to witness these birds swimming down the bay in a line enmass diving for fish which have little chance of escaping, to realize the devastating effect these birds have had.  As a boy and teenager one could throw a fishing line in anytime to catch small crappies, perch or bluegills, now the commarants show up and within a week they clean all fish out of the bay.  To behold their structured attack swimming and diving in a straight line as they go down the bay is remarkable because I had no idea these birds were capable of such a coordinated attack.  The good news is 2- 3 weeks after the birds show up, 90% of them now leave and move on because the fish are all gone.  In my youth it was always possible to fish for bass, yellow perch, etc. all summer long, and we would feed the blue gills bread every night at dusk.  It still happens in the spring until the cormorant invasion shows up, then there is not a fish to be seen anywhere in the bay.  I assume the mild winters are also playing a part in their survival and longevity because many of the birds are very very large now and some look very old looking where as in my youth they were smaller. Please reconsider whatever it takes to slow these birds down so that future generations can enjoy the wonders of the water in the bay.  Without the fish after the birds leave the bay becomes a desolate dead looking pond with the turtles being the only life you see. Its a slippery slope in the food chain when you take out all of one species such as when the birds remove the fish.\n",

        "comment":"Comments on the EBR posting 013-4124 \u2013 Cormorants\nI do not agree with the proposal to list the double crested cormorant as a \u201cGame Bird\u201d. In my opinion the cormorant simply does not fit the definition of a game bird. The game birds listed in Schedule 3 of the FWCA are hunted for recreation (sport), but most importantly, they are hunted for consumption. Section 36 of the FWCA is intended to ensure these Game Birds are not wasted and allowed to spoil and be unfit for human consumption. Shooting cormorants should not be for sport and they are generally not considered suitable for human consumption. Shooting should only be used as a means of population control.\nPersonally, I feel a more suitable approach would be to list the Cormorant as not protected Section 5 (2) under the FWCA, but regulated which I feel could be accommodated by Section 5 (2) (d). A small game license would still be required as it is now for crows, etc.\nShooting Cormorants as Game Birds presents a very negative image of hunters and hunting \u2013 totally unnecessarily. Quite frankly it reflects badly on the hunting community and on the MNRF itself.\nSection 5 (2) (d) should also allow the Minister to apply restrictions and conditions. I am not concerned about the daily limit, but I am very concerned about the timing. Shooting Cormorants should not be allowed during the nesting period until the young are able to fly and fledge. I don\u2019t know the exact dates, but birds could be shot late winter\/early spring up until nesting season, then again after the young are able to fly (mid-August). The optics of shooting adult birds that are caring for their young, leaving the young to starve is very negative and simply wrong. It would also have potential for charges to shooters and MNRF under the Criminal Code. Sections 444 to 447 of Canada's Criminal Code constitute Canada's primary federal animal protection legislation. The Code prohibits causing \"unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to an animal or bird\" and \"causing damage or injury by willful neglect\". I believe there should be a period of protection from shooting. Cormorants are very vulnerable because they nest in very conspicuous colonies.\nI am fine with the other parts of this proposal. Shooters should retrieve dead birds and properly dispose of them. Realistically, some birds will not be retrieved. Dead birds drifting in the water or floating to shore during the peak of vacation season on lakes and rivers would also look very bad on hunters and on the MNRF for allowing it to happen.  The Ministry should be able to prescribe shot size, type, etc. Probably non-toxic shot since most birds would be shot over water. Having the ability to set a daily limit would be fine and allowing shooters to shoot from a stationary boat as per the MBCA is also appropriate.\n",

I carried out field research on diet in Double-crested Cormorants on Lake Winnipegosis, Manitoba, in the 1980s: cormorants are opportunistic feeders, as we all know, and will catch whatever species of fish is available. We found that the range of fish taken was extensive, but very few of commercially valuable species were caught, and their diet was primarily coarse fish such as White Sucker, a species which likely is harmful to more desirable fish (so the argument could be floated that the cormorants were actually beneficial to those desirable fish - a simplistic argument on a par with the argument that cormorants are \"bad\" because they eat a commercially valuable one). But \u2026 where is the evidence that they damage fish stocks? It appears to be anecdotal at best. And, if there is to be a reduction in population, what is the size of the population after this cull has ended? And, if the Ministry has determined that X is the size to be attained, then it should be reached by skilled professionals working for the government. The worst scenario is to throw the cull wide open to hunters, with no control on where and when, leaving the killing by error of other species a real probability, and a genuine abrogation of responsibility by the Ministry.\n",

We accordingly strongly oppose the proposal to create a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus).\nWe notice that in the \"Supporting Materials\" section of the EBR page on this proposal there is no link to any evidence that Cormorants need to be controlled, and this is in agreement with the general understanding that there is no need to \"control\" the Cormorant populations which have come back after the banning of DDT.\nThere is, of course, a long history of \"sports\" fisherman calling for the \"control\" of Cormorants on the basis of the hypothesis that Cormorant predation is the reason they didn't catch anything on some particular outing. This has led to many studies of such predation - as recounted in the Cormorant song -\nOh to be Phalacrocorax,\nOh to give bass fishermen fits,\nso they pick through all your castings,\nand do isotopes on your shits.\n- which have, of course, found that Cormorants do not cause reduced populations of sports fish. The fact that this hatred persists in the face of the data suggests that those who advocate for \"control\" of Cormorants are among those who need to sustain their sense of selfhood by having some enemy to hate. It's frequently seen that they're already shooting at Cormorants, as in the case of this one found on the beach in Burlington -\nhttp:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/_pmTzHVznnGY\/TMCjoaNXdnI\/AAAAAAAAAYk\/eAQ8SWOCc\u2026 -  \"Protected by legislation from near extinction, Cormorants are hated by some fishermen, who regard them as competitors. This will be my subject for today's painting. On its other side I see an open wound, attesting to a violent death. It reminds me of the Gannet I painted at Cap Lumiere, New Brunswick.\" [the Gannet had also been shot, as had another on that beach].\nCormorants are as as close as any extant species to the ancestral modern Bird, and because of their statuesque loveliness, their co-operative foraging, the control they exert on invasive alien fishes, the grandeur of their breeding colonies, and the way they transfer nutrients from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems, they deserve all and more of the protection and appreciation which they have traditionally had.\nThe proposal that they be slaughtered by \"hunting\" deserves to be treated as a mental heath disorder of a narrow hatred-motivated segment of the human population, and should inspire outreach to show the advocates of this slaughter how they can learn to appreciate and support Ontario's biota and ecosystems.\n",

It is not an easy way of life and if the taking of life should ever get 'easy', I will have to stop what I am doing.\nI can only agree to the proposal if the cormorant hunt was for food. The amendment to allow the carcasses to spoil, absolutely disgusts me. As a hunter, it is my responsibility to honour the life that I take. It is abhorrent to me to kill something and let it rot where it lies. At least feed it to something else... a dog or raccoons or whatever.\nLikewise, the daily bag limit of 50 birds seems irresponsible. How can someone take 50 lives per day and for 8 months?! And as stated previously, for what? It is not for food but for pot-shots at another animal who is trying to live and raise its young. Is this some perverted way to deal with gun violence? By letting people shoot off guns at other creatures?\nAs for the 'blight' that the cormorants cause with their guano, why can we not harvest it and use it? Guano used to be a valued and internationally traded commodity. Perhaps the government should put out a RFP in the harvesting and processing of guano for fertilizer... certified organic at that!\nWhat I feel is really at the heart of the 'problem' is the modern human need to control nature and the very shallow sense of appearance over value (value over and above human uses and needs). Good on the cormorants in making a comeback.\nI used to live in Toronto and I would visit the Leslie Spit regularly. The Spit is an aggregate dump. Humans made it. Perhaps it is time to let nature do its thing. Perhaps the Spit wants to become a tree-less island for birds... maybe just for cormorants.

For example, a cormorant cull is already in place on Middle Island by Parks Canada. Therefore no change in the rules is needed if the motivation is to prevent the birds from doing damage.\n(3) If cormorant numbers need to be reduced, the best way to do it is through systematic efforts by professionals, such as the decade-long cull on Middle Island. Random shooting by members of the public is not efficient and is unlikely to be effective in the long run.\n(4) Hunting cormorants is likely to prove more of a public nuisance than the birds themselves. Since hunters will not want to eat the birds, they will have little incentive to retrieve the bodies and so we will have piles of rotting cormorant corpses instead of smaller amounts of bird droppings.\nPlease do not open a hunting season for double-crested cormorants.\n",

The opinion of small groups of people with a biased opinion on cormorants does not justify the mass killing of cormorants. Birds will be virtually used for target practice, and because they are inedible, these birds can be left to suffer, diet and rot. These birds are filled with shot - most of which is lead which means other species could be poisoned and our environment will be further contaminated with a highly toxic heavy metal. The opinions and complaints of a small group should by no means, lead to the annihilation of entire colonies of a native Ontarian species and putting them at risk of extreme suffering. Hunting of cormorants aren't new but this proposal is at a whole new level and it will lead to decimation of entire colonies. Not only is this proposal environmentally unsound and will not solve the problem, but leaving injured and dying birds to waste and rot is unethical and wasteful. Witnesses have seen horribly injured birds left suffering in the water and on land after hunters have moved on.\nI find overall that this proposal is deeply disturbing, and it is highly doubtful that cormorants are to blame for reduced fish stocks and pollution. As we know, human activities are the leading culprit of environmental destruction, habitat destruction, environmental deterioration, species extinction, and fish stock depletion due to over-fishing.\nCormorants are native to Ontario and have a strong presence in our natural environment and ecological balance. There is no scientific evidence showing cormorants are to blame for fish stock depletion or environmental degradation. This proposal is aimed simply to appease a small group of biased members of the public including hunters and home-owners who would benefit from this expanded hunt and is not justifiable by any means.\nI would like to see our Ontario government focus on wildlife protection, conservation as well as habitat preservation. This proposal on Cormorant hunting is barbaric, cruel, wasteful and I strongly oppose this from moving forward. Wildlife numbers are continually diminishing in Canada and cormorants being native to Canada, need to be protected. I further ask that the Ontario government to take steps to tighten up the protection of our natural environment and wildlife to prevent them from groups of interest who want to continue to exploit and degrade our natural environment and resources further. I think that extensive field studies from marine biologists, scientists, zoologists and environmentalists need to be done to come up with an ethically and environmentally responsible solution.

There is much misinformation surrounding this species and the potential impacts to fisheries which this proposal does not address.\nThere is no scientific evidence provided in support of these proposed actions. Since any impact of cormorants on fisheries has not been quantified, there also cannot be any meaningful threshold for control of the species. The 50 bird bag limit is arbitrary and there is no way to know how hunting is influencing fisheries or if over-hunting is occurring. There has also been no evidence suggesting how hunting could improve commercial fisheries which operate on only some of the largest waterbodies in the province. If impacts are occurring solely from cormorants these would be localized issues and control and management would be justified. A widespread hunting season is not the solution to something which may be an issue in one particular location, or potentially nowhere at all. It is acknowledged that cormorant control is a part of wildlife management in the Province, especially in areas with sensitive species.  Hunting cormorants has the potential to cause impacts to sensitive bird species and other wildlife, especially as the proposed season is extensive and overlaps with breeding seasons.\nThe basis of ethical hunting is the humane procurement of food. Shooting cormorants is therefore not hunting or harvesting game, but simply killing an undesirable species. Changing the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act and supporting regulations to allow cormorants to spoil will do great damage to how hunters are perceived in Ontario. Hunters already face much opposition and this unethical hunt will convince otherwise supportive citizens that hunting is not an acceptable practice. It is also not fair to hunters to have them engage in what many hunters believe is non-native, invasive species removal when ultimately there is no evidence of impacts and no mechanism to track if the hunting season is successful.\nThe proposal as written cannot address any of the concerns that some in the province have expressed and it will be detrimental to wildlife and hunting culture in Ontario. Therefore, the Ministry should not proceed with any such proposal.\n",

It is not a game bird and shouldn't be treated as one.\nI'm concerned that the proposed change to the hunting regulations will result in significant damage to natural ecosystems and habitats and also have negative impacts on non-target species.\nThe provision to allow cormorant carcasses to spoil is completely ridiculous and may result in additional health hazards for natural and human populations.\nMoreover, having an open hunting season on a non-game species is irresponsible. It promotes a non-sustenance related gun culture and violence towards wildlife. It could also endanger the public by allowing hunting during the summer season when lakes and other natural areas are highly-utilized by Ontario residents and tourists.\nI urge the Ontario government to study the situation more closely, provide more information about the current population size, set a population management target, develop a plan to monitor and assess impacts before taking any population management actions.\n",

        "comment":"I am appalled at our provincial government's proposed change to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act that will designate Double Crested Cormorants as a game species. The hunting season which runs from Mar 15-Dec 31, covers the nesting period of these birds. Chicks will be orphaned and die from exposure. The staggering numbers that hunters are allowed to kill and leave to rot, if they so choose, is a disgrace. These native birds, once on the brink of extinction, will be completely eradicated and there will be numerous deaths of other bird species that nest with Cormorants. This will cause irreparable damage to the natural ecosystem.\nWorld renowned wildlife scientists predict that since 1970 and by 2020, 2\/3 of the world's wildlife will be gone. Ontario and the rest of Canada is not immune to this. We have to end the culling of our wildlife species before it's too late. This planet will not survive without them. If left alone, nature balances itself naturally.\nLastly, this encourages the worst form of irresponsible hunting. The spring, summer and fall is when our lakes are populated by cottagers and tourists and yet you go as far as allowing shooting from stationary boats. Are you out of your minds?\nI voted Conservative. Had I known about this proposed, outright slaughter of our wildlife, I would not have done so.\n",

Having people with guns for most of the year in sensitive aquatic habitats is not a good idea.  There are hundreds of other bird species that may be negatively impacted by hunting.  And how can one call this hunting?  It is a wholesale slaughter.  It is not the cormorants fault that they are successful. And the birds will die for no particular reason other than their numbers are too high according to some particular scientific authority? An unlimited kill during most of the year? The cormorants are not the problem and if they are, it is because of us.  How could any government agency aligned with protecting the environment advocate any kind of slaughter of any animal in sensitive aquatic habitats?  The passenger pigeons were once troublesome with their numbers.  Another slaughter solved that problem.  What can you do?  Never advocate hunting.  It is arrogant by any government wildlife agency to think that they can 'manage' wildlife by unleashing an army of hunters with no limits.  How can anybody call that management? We need knowledge before we go about reducing this and augmenting that.  Humans have shown that they have little success in 'managing' wildlife.  We have changed the fauna of the Great Lakes to such an extent with exotic species, it is no wonder that certain native species may take advantage of us fiddling with the diversity for the sake of fishing.  Look at the coyote.  A southwestern species that is spreading over the continent in spite of an open hunting season and 'management'.  Please do further studies on the cormorant situation.  Mass killing is not the solution.  Pay for the science. Help us to understand how to tweak the already massively dysfunctional Great Lakes ecosystem, to benefit living organisms other than Homo sapiens.\nThanks.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed open season on Double-crested Cormorants is shocking in its cruelty towards a native species and dismaying in its lack of care for the environment.\nIt should not proceed, for the following reasons:\n1 It has no scientific rationale: Where is the research to support this change? None is cited. There is reference to \u201cconcerns\u201d with only the sketchiest of anecdotal evidence provided. It really is stunning that the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, which one presumes still has qualified and knowledgeable biologists on staff, would put forward such a weak justification for so drastic an intervention in the management of our natural heritage.\n2 It is unethical: Failing to protect the species during the breeding season, allowing game meat to spoil, shooting birds on the nest \u2013 these all violate an ethical framework that has made hunting an acceptable element of wildlife management in Ontario.\n3 It is cruel: Hunters are to be allowed to kill the birds during the breeding season, ensuring that young will be left to starve. Unlike other waterfowl, both members of a cormorant pair are required for nest success, so the chicks and fledglings will starve even if one parent is left alive.\n4 It is punitive: The exceptionally long open season covers the entire time this migratory species is under the stewardship of the province of Ontario. Taken as a whole, the proposal appears designed to inflict the maximum amount of suffering on a bird that belongs here and has a role to play in the ecosystem.\n5 It is based on confusion about natural processes: Just as some confuse weather and climate, supporters of this measure extrapolate the localized effects of colonial bird nesting sites to the entire Great Lakes. They refuse to take into account research that indicates:\na.\tThe Great Lakes cormorant population has stabilized and even declined;\nb.\tA very small proportion of available island forest sites are occupied;\nc.\tCormorant diets include little sport or commercially desirable fish, or their prey, and do include invasive fish species.\n6 It lacks perspective on the issue of vegetation: The destruction of vegetation by cormorants and other colonial birds is extremely localized. In comparison, development and agriculture devastate native plant and animal communities with effects that spread far beyond their immediate footprint. Guano accumulation is a natural process that plays out over a long timeframe, so we should not allow \u201caesthetics\u201d to lead us into making unjustified and na\u00efve assumptions. In situations where it\u2019s felt action should be taken to protect unique species of trees or plants, non-lethal measures are the best response. Tommy Thompson Park has demonstrated that these work.\n6 It fails to consider ecosystem effects: Removing a species from an ecosystem \u2013 and this measure has the potential to cripple if not eradicate the Great Lakes cormorant population \u2013 will have unintended consequences if not undertaken with great care and forethought.\na.\tWe know for sure that other colonial birds \u2013 American pelicans, great egrets, great blue herons, black-crowned night herons, various gulls and terns - that share cormorant nesting sites will be disturbed and their breeding will be disrupted; that the cormorant is a prey species for bald eagles that may be adversely affected; that fewer invasive fish will be consumed.\nb.\tWill scavenger populations be boosted if large numbers of dead birds are left on the land and in the water, and will this adversely affect other species or be a nuisance?\nc.\tWill the kill promote the spread of Newcastle disease, presently found in a small number of cormorants, to other wild birds, domestic poultry or other species by disseminating the virus through decomposition or removal of contaminated carcasses, or on footwear or equipment?\nd.\tWhat will the destabilizing effect of the kill be on a population that has levelled off?\nWe need answers to these and other questions before this highly disruptive measure is approved.\n7 It fails to set out a monitoring program: Where is the baseline? If the killing begins before a baseline is established, how will the sustainability of this measure be assessed? Will ministry staff count the starving chicks? How will the ministry ensure hunters appropriately report their kills? These questions need to be answered - so the public can comment on whether the monitoring is likely to work - before, not after, the proposal is approved.\n8 It is politically motivated: In the absence of any evidence of scientific thought driving this proposal, politics becomes the obvious explanation. The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, whose members appear have a visceral hatred of this beautiful and interesting bird, made addressing the \u201coverabundance\u201d of cormorants one of its key demands in the June 2018 election.\n9 It does not serve the interests of Ontarians: I\u2019m a birder, I enjoy seeing cormorants \u2013 and birding is nearly four times more popular than hunting in Ontario. Those who aren\u2019t interested in either pastime still want the ministry to protect wildlife from cruelty and carry out its stewardship according to scientifically supported principles.\n",

No scientific study has had time to seriously predict the impact hunting would have on the specie. The argument of too many birds, when it is about indigenous species, is irrelevant. It has been proven that they do not feed on fish the fishing industry is interested in. And the supposedly foul smell is insignificant compared to the smell of human pollution around the Great Lakes.\nMore important, the possibility for hunters to shoot from the shore and from stationary boats increases the danger to other humans.

I am a resident of Ontario.\nFirst, the cormorant hunt is mistakenly being touted as a solution to improving fish stocks in the Great Lakes. This is not supported by scientific evidence.\n\"There continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations\".\nThis statement omits the regulating authorities MNRF, DFO, Conservation Authorities and others responsible for fisheries in Ontario. It seems that the very Ontario regulators do not believe that this hunt will actually do anything to improve fish stocks. Where is the evidence to support that this proposed change will improve fish stocks?\nSecond, allowing meat to spoil sets a bad precedent and is counter to the ethical guidelines surrounding hunting.\nThirdly, the Minister said that the cormorants must be disposed of properly which is to say that they cannot be left where they were found. If one cannot eat the meat, where would the cormorants be disposed? Into our already stretched landfill systems?\nFourthly, I have some concerns regarding safety. I am hunter and practice best safety precautions during the deer, turkey and waterfowl seasons. During those seasons, I wear orange to prevent any accidents from occurring. Hunters are fallible and there are a number of reports each year where hunters fail to be safe. In 2013, at least 6 hunters were mistakenly shot and unfortunately one hunter died of a gunshot wound in 2012. I acknowledge that these hunters were using rifles and not shotguns, however, this could easily happen with someone failing to practise gun safety.  Having an open season for cormorants throughout the summer months where someone can shoot from a motorized watercraft is not safe, and may seriously endanger people. Also, this would also increase the burden on Conservation Authorities, as poachers (not hunters) can suggest that they are hunting cormorant with shotguns instead of more viable waterfowl.\nFifthly, it is perceived that the Ontario Government wishes to off-load some of the very successful cormorant reduction programs by MNRF onto hunters through this change in hunting regulation. Unfortunately, I believe that the amount of cormorants taken by non-commercial hunters will be negligible and if the Government is truly concerned about the cormorant population as it affects fish stocks then the control programs should be continued. However, given that cormorant populations were much higher before the 1950s and fish stocks were also higher, and with no supporting scientific evidence to the contrary, it appears that the fish stocks are not greatly affected by the cormorant population. Instead,  the reduction in fish stocks may be the result of commercial over-fishing, eutrophication, invasive species (i.e. sea lampreys), climate change and other significant environmental changes wrought by anthropogenic activities.\nThank you,\nAnonymous.\n",

The numbers that could be culled, given the allotment per hunter, are very large over the proposed hunting season and certainly will adversely affect the sustainability of the species.   Since the birds will not be collected for food, they will no doubt remain in the area where they have been killed or wounded, thus decomposing and causing pollution and a possible source of disease.  In addition, other birds species breeding in the same vicinity will undoubtedly get killed or at least have their breeding period severely disrupted.

I should like to add I am not opposed to hunting and feel it has a legitimate place as a sport.\n1. The proposal as written is not based on scientific evidence that it is necessary to have a hunting season. Similarly, there has been no scientific rigour applied to this proposal. For example, what does success look like? What does failure look like? What will be the follow-up strategy for success or failure, if any? How are either outcomes measured?\n2. It does not make sense to categorize the DCCO as a \"game\" bird if nothing is being done with the dead bird. To leave the dead carcass to rot is inhumane and goes beyond any idea of sport. It also looks badly on hunters that they would hunt an animal in such a cavalier way.\n3. It is unethical and barbaric to hunt any animal in a breeding season unless extraordinary circumstances exist. I do not see that extraordinary circumstances exist in this proposal. In fact, there is a provision in current legislation for landowners affected by DCCO nesting activities to be able to hunt them under extreme situations. This would seem to me to negate the necessity for further action to be taken.\n4. There is a significant risk that birds other than the DCCO will be mistaken for the DCCO and shot in error.

Human interference will only upset balance further so that the government can collect money to issue licences to kill another species until they are all gone.\nThe mass killing of cormorants will not be beneficial. In fact, the process of killing them will force other bird species (such as herons, egrets and pelicans, all of which are stable) to vacate the colony sites they share.\nCormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial, non-forage species.\nOnly a small number of islands (less than 3%) and peninsula sites are available for cormorants and other colonial waterbirds to nest on.

I am not a hunter myself but I was raised by one and I can not imagine that this proposal is being fought for by many in the ethical hunting community. A 10 month season that includes the summer? Fifty birds a day? Of a bird that no one wants to eat, and so would need special permission to spoil? What happened to don't kill what you can't use? This is not a proposal for a hunting season based on sustenance or sportsmanship - it's a proposal for a free-for-all slaughter.\nCormorant colonies may not appeal to some people, but they are a native species that belong here. In locations where there are specific concerns of a large colony impacting on other bird species or the health of trees or soil, management needs to be evaluated on a case-by case basis. Targeted harassment, nest destruction and egg oiling can decease the size of a specific colony when required without unnecessary cruelty and without opening up individual birds or small colonies of a healthy size to eradication. Wildlife management decisions should be made with care, not be off-loaded to local hunters.\nAs for concerns over the depletion of sport fish, aim efforts at restoring shorelines, controlling industrial and agricultural runoff to improve water quality, and reducing invasive species (such as the Round gobies the cormorants are known to eat). Restore forested wetlands near existing cormorant colonies to spread out the population. If stock fish are being released in a waterbody, do so at night when they can find cover before cormorants and others wildlife begin hunting by daylight. In other words, instead of a new hunting season, focus on doing the work that will increase fish numbers to the benefit of anglers and wildlife alike.\n",

It would appear that the Ontario Government has little understanding of ecology, or exactly how it works.  To plan this hunting season during nesting season is appalling, as it will impact scores of other species.  I urge \"the powers that be\" to discard this proposal.  Surely there are other more important matters that would require attention.  Most of our native species need all the help that we can give them.\n",

        "comment":"Carelessly slaughtering huge numbers of double-crested cormorants is deeply concerning because they barely cause any damage at all, especially compared to other species. Hunting them will arouse many problems and impact the stability of the species, and is addressing a practically non-existent problem.\nCormorants are harmless birds, which eat fish just in order to survive, and only a tiny fraction of it is actually \"sport\" fish. Why should we get mad at them just for eating small, shallow water fish like sunfish? They are barely even creating a dent on our large sport fish populations. Some people complain that they cause \"property damage\" and are destructive to areas like forested islands. Well, lets look at it this way. There are many other shorebirds with huge populations, such as herring gulls (seagulls.) Yet no one hunts them or tries making them a \"game bird\" because of reasons such as \"there's too many of them!\" or \"they poo all over our perfectly cultivated beaches.\" We just let them live and humans and the environment go along just fine. Cormorants do not do enough damage to be considered a problematic species, and the little damage resulting from them living happens with all wildlife species. Out of anything, there quite a few other destructive species that affect more than a few waterside property owners. Take squirrels, for example. They have managed to occupy every habitat and civilized area in Ontario possible, and create many more problems. People have experienced damage to gardens, orchids and attics from these rodents. They also attack birds and actually correlate to the absence and decline of birds in some areas (such as mountain bird populations, ranges and red squirrel interactions.) It's strange how squirrels can get away with creating so many problems and damage, compared to cormorants, and how they do relatively little.\nI find it unbelievable how the Minister of Natural Resources is allowing hunters to kill up to 50 cormorants per day for almost the whole year: March 15 until December 31. That's even during breeding season! That means that not only adult cormorants are vulnerable, but also their hatchlings and juveniles. Just think about how much this adds up to. If every hunter in Ontario hunted 50 cormorants every day, every year, this senseless act would pretty much wipe out the population. This is a ridiculously huge number of deaths per year, especially taking into account how much this could impact their populations over time. Many people take joy in watching cormorants and they are an iconic sight on the shore and by waterways. If they disappear, or are seen less often, many people will be disappointed or enraged. Also, the natural system of the environment will be disrupted and this will impact other wildlife.\nTo make cormorants game birds and to kill so many is absolutely senseless and is scientifically incorrect. There is no scientific justification for this hunt or reasons to prove it worthy of undertaking. This means that apart from a few people that just naturally hate cormorants or are overly concerned about how their property looks, this is a non-existent problem. We just celebrated a rebound in their population in the 1970's when they stabilized after suffering steep declines from environmental contaminants. Lets not damage their population again and cause peril to the species. I urge you to do what is best for the species, the environment, and anyone who cares about fair treatment of wildlife and enjoys their presence. Do what is morally right for the Double Crested Cormorant and discard this hunting proposal.\n",

Most of the trees are dead and dying due to these birds.  This is a problem that is long overdue it's attention.  Oiling of eggs is done for Canada Geese.  There should be other options discussed to remedy this bad situation with these cormorants.  The Ministries involved in controlling these birds will need funds to address all problems, remedies and the restoration of the damaged environment in regards to these birds.  The drive from Queenston, ON to Niagara on the Lake along the parkway is also infested with these birds.  The trees are dying.  The benefit of trees beside a waterway is priceless.  The amount of fish that these birds eat in the springtime off Jordan Harbour on Lake Ontario should never of become this much of a threat to the alewife, minnow and perch population.  The Burlington Canal in Hamilton is also a problem with these birds.\nAs the warm weather works it way further north, the destruction from these birds will follow and increase.

Well so do humans and humans kill more vegetation than any animal.  So should humans be on the okay to hunt list also?  The reasoning behind this proposal does not make sense.  50 birds a day to kill is way too high, especially since hunters are usually drunk and get off on killing things, they won't keep track of their kills if the limit is 50.  I live in a big deer hunting area.  I work with hunters and they do not have the right attitude for hunting.  They think it is their right to kill things to make the world a better place.  This is not the message to send people.  There should be less hunting as our Canada is not going to have any animals left soon.  They are all going to be hunted into extinction.  The reasons for this proposed hunt do not make sense to me.  Humans are trying to control nature too much and this is never a good thing.  Encouraging violence is never the right move, I believe that deep down this is part of the reason we have a violent society today.  Less guns and more animals will make Canada a better place.  People don't want to see hunting near beaches and public areas, it isn't nice to see things being killed for no reason other that the hunter can do it legally.  The last studies I have seen on hunting go against the reasoning for this proposed hunt.  The studies say hunted animals reproduce more to increase their population in order to survive.  How does this control the population of an animal?  Do the right thing and kill this proposal, it is not good for Canadians.\n",

Your own proposal document indicates that the population has stabilized or declined slightly.  There is every good indication that your proposed measures will make the \u201cproblem\u201d worse, not better.  Shooting cormorants at a nesting colony could readily cause surviving cormorants to initiate new nesting sites elsewhere, thereby increasing the number of nesting sites.\nDecades of research on cormorants, all over the world, have shown that they do not significantly impact game fish populations.  In fact, stomach content analyses usually show that a high proportion of the diet is composed of fish that fisherman don\u2019t want to catch.  Where are the published data that support the need to cull cormorants in Ontario?\nCormorants are again a vital part of Ontario\u2019s ecosystem and this proposal for such a slaughter (daily scale and duration) is completely out of sync with best wildlife management practices.\nIf this proposal is implemented, the proposed shooting of nesting cormorants must be restricted to sites where no birds protected under the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act are nesting.  Many cormorant nesting sites are associated with nests of protected species, such as herons.  Shooting cormorants in mixed colonies is likely to disrupt nesting of those species \u2013 a prohibited activity.\nIf cormorants are a genuine problem in a specific area, then the Ministry should send its own employees to solve the problem.  Opening up the Game and Fish Act in this manner will have detrimental consequences to your Ministry\u2019s scientific credibility in the future.\nEven assuming that a hunter was able to shoot his limit for half the number of days permitted, the magnitude of the permitted kill is simply too great.  Furthermore, not requiring the hunter to collect and properly dispose of the birds shot will lead to the spectacle and smell of rotting flesh on beaches.  That is simply not a good housekeeping practice nor is it good wildlife management.\n",

        "comment":"I have seen the damage that nesting cormorants can do to areas where they nest.  However, the shortage of suitable nesting locations is a result of previous poor political decisions to allow urban development along shorelines and environmentally sensitive areas for corporate profit.   So we created the problem, by destroying habitat, but does that validate us victimizing this species?  Before open season is allowed on the Double-crested cormorants, there should be scientific evidence that there really is a need to slaughter this particular species, not the just a want and the insistence of some politically powerful interest groups or industries.    Where is the scientific proof that these particular birds are affecting fish stocks other any other bird species?  This publication shows this is not a recent concern and did not support the fishing industry's argument\/claims, at least  in 1995:  http:\/\/publications.gc.ca\/collections\/Collection\/En40-222-2-1995E.pdf.\nThere should also be consideration that this is species extermination as this not game shooting. Changing the regulations to allow cormorants to be designated \"game\" birds opens a risky loophole on a slippery slope for other birds considered \"pests.\"   These birds are NOT game birds.  They are not edible so this is not game hunting; it is extermination.  The original Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act was worded in a specific manner to protect against such potential abuse of true \"game\" species.  Fifty birds a bag day for 9 months seems an irresponsibly high number over an extended period of time.   Shotguns are highly inaccurate as I can attest as I rescue many injured shot birds and take them to be rehabilitated or humanely put down by the Wild Bird Care Centre during hunting seasons.  I cannot support a policy that kills many more than the recorded number provided by the word of a hunter.  Are there any measures to prevent the complete and utter destruction of a particular cormorant colony deemed a \u201cnuisance\u201d and perceived to be in a \"non-desirable\" location by one of the fore-mentioned interest groups or individuals?  Who justifies and controls those judgments and decisions?   Private property owners who can now \"remove\" a colony at will?  The developer who wants to build yet another shoreline high rise?\nI am also absolutely opposed to any policy that allows killing of ANY animal or bird during the breeding season.  Again, you are not just killing an adult Cormorant with this proposal, you are leaving nestlings and fledglings to die of slow starvation, dehydration and even heat exhaustion if their parents are shot  when they out foraging for food.  That is NOT humane or acceptable behavior or policy of ANY government department that claims to protect the environment and manage wildlife.\nWhere is the scientific proof that this species is responsible for more damage to the ecosystem than beyond their natural role in that ecosystem?  Many other bird species nest and hunt for the same food in the same ecosystems as cormorants, especially during those critical breeding months.  How are you going to protect more sensitive species, such as herons and bitterns, from also being shot or generally being disturbed while they are nesting?\nMany recreational activities also occur in these areas during the proposed, extended,  hunting period.  How are you going to protect your public from getting shot by hunters if they canoeing, kayaking, hiking or bird watching in the ecosystems where cormorants and other species are found?  Finally, every species is in check and balance with their environment and part of the greater ecosystem.    Bringing a species to the brink of extinct to satisfy the demands of a few groups will have consequences.  Where is the scientific evaluation and research that validates risking elimination of this bird from its ecosystem? Who decides when the population has been reduced enough to meet the wants of those in opposition to the species, but leaves enough of a population to sustain the species?  Mankind has notoriously misjudged that balance in the past. Why is the hunting season so long compared those of other species?  Why does it include the breeding season when all species are most vulnerable?     I condemn and denounce this proposal as being without scientific prove of need, without stringent guidelines to prevent species extermination, without guidelines for the protection and prevention of disturbance of the breeding season of this species and many other sensitive species sharing the same ecosystem.\n",

They are once again playing an important role in the province\u2019s ecosystems. They must not be devastated once again \u2013 this time by a deliberate slaughter.\nI oppose the proposal for many reasons:\na. Cormorants are an important part of the Great Lakes ecosystem.

        "comment":"I am totally opposed to the proposed hunting season for Double-crested Cormorant (Cormorants)  in Ontario  for the following reasons:\nCormorants are native to Ontario and naturally abundant in Ontario.  They declined dramatically in the mid 1900s due to 1- human persecution, and  2- like many other species,  they were significantly negatively impacted by DDT which caused their eggshell to thin, which resulted in very low breeding success rate. Their numbers have since increased in number and stabilized.\nThe proposed hunting season is March 15 to December 31, it basically covers the entire time Cormorants can be found in Ontario.\nIt is proposed that a single hunter would be able to shoot 50 birds per day.  As there are not any yearly limits, in one hunting season, a single individual hunter would be able to kill over 14,000 birds.  Such numbers are not sustainable.  Using these figures, a very small number of hunters (less than 100) could wipe out the entire Ontario Cormorant population in one hunting season.  (Note that the North American population for cormorants is estimated at 2 million)\nCormorants are basically inedible but under this proposal they would be re-classified as game and their meat would be allowed to spoil.  This is obvious not a sustainable hunt for game meat;, it is a legalized extermination of a native species.\nWith the proposed hunting dates, hunting would be permitted during the nesting season for both Cormorants and other protected birds that often nest with cormorants including, herons, egrets, terns, gulls.\nDuring the breeding season, one or two hunters could go to a Cormorant breeding colony and wipe it out in a single day, shooting incubating adults on their nests and young birds still in their nest.  This would certainly cause all of the other protected species that nest within or alongside Cormorants at that colony (such as herons, egrets, terns, gulls etc.) to abandon their nest or at the very least it would be severely impact their chances of having a successful nesting season.\nThe proposed hunting dates from March 15 to December 31, virtually the whole year, include spring, the entire summer and fall.  This period includes when many Ontarians engage in peaceful activities like relaxing by a lake or river, paddle boarding, canoeing, boating,  hiking along a waterway, birdwathching, etc.  All these people will have their leisure activities negatively impacted by this ongoing proposed hunt.  Consequently, this proposed hunt may well result in a decline of tourism for the province of Ontario as people from |Ontario, other provinces and US states will no longer view Ontario as a quiet and peaceful getaway to enjoy our many lakes and waterways in the summer.\nCormorants are not the only bird species that eat fish.  Bald Eagles, Osprey, herons, egrets, gulls, terns, some ducts such as merganser, kingfishers, bitterns, night-herons, loons, grebes, etc. also eat fish.   One has to wonder as to why this proposal is singling out only Cormorants.\nSome species of fish may be declining but to blame it all on the Cormorant is a cop-out.  Issues like past introduction on invasive fish species in both the Great Lakes and  other Ontario lakes, species  such as lamprey, Round Goby and Zebra Mussel (just to name a few), have had devastating effects on our Ontario water  ecosystems.  Other things that have also had significant impacts on fish stocks over the past decades include 1- the significant loss (and severe degradation) of shoreline marshes and shoreline habitat around the great lakes and other waterways, 2- continued agricultural and industrial runoff in our lakes and waterways, and 3- deforestation, change in land use, and urban sprawl near waterways,  4- climate change-global warming.\nUnfortunately this proposed Cormorant hunt is not based on studies showing a need for a hunt; in fact no evidence is cited in support of the proposal or the way it is structured.\nOur natural resources should be managed based on scientific evidence to ensure their sustainability.    In fact, since early 2000 s, the latest information indicates that Great Lakes populations of Cormorants have since stabilized, or declined slightly.  It should be stressed that a stable population is a sigh of natural equilibrium.  Furthermore, having a hunting season that is permitted during the nesting season goes against sustainable conservation management.\nIf the proposed law is enacted it will set responsible conservation back in Ontario and cause ecological harm that will take decades to reverse.\n",

I do not see any research or documentation to justify adding Double-crested Cormorants to the Game Bird category. Over recent times the species has increased in many areas of the Great Lakes and other bodies of water. They have thrived due to conditions that allow them some of which us humans are responsible including the stocking of fish. Indeed they have an impact on the natural world, as us humans. If there are documented and researched site specific areas where these birds are deemed to have a major irreversible impact on the environment perhaps a site specific plan could be established to limit their impact at this location.\nThe thought of hunting\/culling\/killing\/blasting\/shooting at colonies anywhere, from boats or land seems ludicrous. Practically speaking, would hunters retrieve the dead animals and safely dispose of them in water, islands, and on land. There would certainly be \"collateral\" damage done to other species themselves and their habitat.\nIn conclusion, I suggest scientific research at individual locations in order to ascertain whether any management of a population is necessary over the long term and if so, design a plan in conjunction with all interested parties to limit their impact on the local environment.

        "comment":"To Whom It May Concern,\nRegarding EBR # 013-4124, this is to voice my strong opposition to the proposal.  It is so egregious as to be beyond comprehension.  I recognize that this posting is just an announcement.  However, given that the idea is to have an \u201copen season\u201d on these magnificent and unfairly maligned birds by March 2019, it sounds very much like a \u201cdone deal\u201d.\nThe information posted on the Environmental Registry is surprisingly scant, given the magnitude of what is being proposed.\nSo, as a retired person and taxpayer, I have a number of questions that I urge you to answer prior to making any decision as to how to proceed.  The questions are as follow:\n1.\tHow much will it cost to enforce, and what will the enforcement mechanism be?  Added to duties that Conservation Officers already struggle to uphold for lack of sufficient funding, they (or someone) will need to assure that other bird species co-nesting with cormorants, such as terns, pelicans, gulls, herons and egrets, will not be disturbed at a critical time in their life cycle.\n2.\tHow will Conservation Officers, with a limited budget make sure that other migratory birds\nco-nesting with cormorants be protected? How will compliance with the required carcass disposal be monitored, what would be the penalty for non-compliance and what constitutes proper disposal?\n3.\tHow will loons, geese and large grebes be protected?\n4.\tWhen was the last cormorant census conducted in Ontario?\n5.\tWhat is the current number of double-crested cormorants in Ontario, and what is the \u201ctarget\u201d number that will satisfy MNRF that there are not too many?\n6.\tSince shooting will occur in waterways at the height of the recreational season, what provision will be to ensure the safety of vacationers, tourists and other visitors?\n7.\tThe proposal calls for monitoring across a wide range of lakes and waterways; who will do that, how will it be done, how much will it cost and who will pay for it?\n8.\tWhich scientists and experts were consulted in formulating this proposal?\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n",

        "comment":"Cormorant populations have stabilized or are decreasing slightly.  That is what the proposal states.\nAccording to the new proposal anyone with a hunting license can legally kill 50 cormorants a day for 9.5 months of the year.  Thus, under this proposal one person can kill over 14000 cormorants legally in 2019.  That's enough to exterminate the largest population on the great lakes.  Even if one individual hunts only on weekends, that could result in over 4000 birds being killed.  Thus, the largest population in Ontario could be wiped out by four hunters hunting only on weekends.  That assumes legal hunting.  It seems clear that there are people more than willing to slaughter as many cormorants as possible, the hatred of them being so extreme.  Will such folks really restrict themselves to 50 a day?\nThe reasons for the hunt are largely that cormorants kill trees and their population increase coincides with a decrease in the fish that anglers like to catch.  The easiest way to get cormorants away from trees at a particular site is to disturb them during the nesting season.  That could provide employment for a few people in each area where cormorant nests are considered problematic.  As for cormorants causing a decline in important fish stocks - what is the evidence?  The number of environmental changes coincident with the timeline of cormorant number increase and the decline of some fish species is enormous: warming of the waters, spread of alien invasive species, introduction of various sport fish to stocked lakes.\nThere are no safeguards in the proposal to make sure that hunters are not firing near populated areas, near where recreational lake use is taking place, that they are not killing birds that might appear similar to cormorants in silhouette (such as loons) and there is absolutely no indication that any resources will be applied to either ensure that the limits are being adhered to or that the hunt is having the desired effect (unless the desired effect is really extermination of populations of a NATIVE Canadian bird).\nThe weakening of legislation to permit the hunting of a non-game species is a real slippery slope. What will come next?  Hunting of raccoons or gulls because they are a nuisance?\nThis whole proposal lacks a serious scientific basis, opens the door to extirpation of what has been something of a conservation success story, is potentially dangerous for people involved in recreational use of lakes and shores, has no plans for the enforcement of limits and as there is no plan for checking its success or reducing its impact if cormorant populations decline drastically, there is the serious risk of large scale extirpation of a native bird species.\nThe proposal needs to be entirely rewritten in a way that makes it clear that: 1) only those areas of the province where cormorants have been shown to be a serious issue have cormorant impact mitigation efforts undertaken - this will require prior scientific demonstration that large numbers of cormorants are THE cause of the decline of any valuable fish stock and 2) that the nest site issue be solved in ways that are safe for people in the surrounding area - such as disturbance of the cormorant nests in the trees where the trees are being impacted - rather than unleashing at least 50 rounds of fire per hunter per day.  Furthermore, IF any hunting of cormorants is to be permitted, it should take place outside of the timeline of the breeding season of any other bird species that nests near them - such as gulls and herons, to reduce unintended declines of non target birds.\n",

The proposal ignores much of the scientific evidence regarding cormorants, puts other protected bird species at risk, and ignores other non-lethal ways of managing cormorant populations. My specific concerns are listed below:\n1.\tNo scientific research exists that implicates the cormorant in the decline of sport fish. In fact, cormorants eat the round goby, an invasive species that has been shown to reduce populations of Ontario sport fish by competing for the same food and directly eating eggs and young.\n2.\tA hunting season extending from Mar. 15 to Dec. 31 allows hunting during the breeding season, causing unnecessary suffering. If there is indeed a rationale for controlling cormorant populations, other more humane such as egg oiling are well established.\n3.\tHunting in or near cormorant colonies would be an enormous disturbance to gulls, terns, herons, egrets and other colonial that nest alongside cormorants, in violation of the Migratory Bird Convention Act.\n4.\tSuch an extended hunting season puts hunters in conflict with non-hunting recreational public and raises serious safety concerns in provincial parks and other public areas.\n",

With that fact in mind, controls need to be in place to enable the species to persist without detriment to other species whose populations can be affected by the increased numbers of DCC; aesthetics and property ownership aside.\nIn order to satisfy the management criteria and ecosystem objectives put fourth through our various governing agencies and previous public consultation, management of the population of DCC is required.  The livelihoods of those relying on the sport and commercial fisheries are at stake.  We know DCC eats an abundance of the invasive gobies where it can, however, in uninvaded lakes or areas where coarse rocky substrates impede goby predation, the DCC are known to resort to predating on other species which form the foundation of many industries and livelihoods, not to mention threaten our fisheries heritage as a province.\nWe have chosen to manage the resources in order to protect them.  With this comes not only the satisfaction of stocking fish into the lake when populations decline, but also the responsibility to control proportions in order to keep a balance when mother nature sees the opportunity to fill a niche.  We have made this decision in the spirit of maintaining the great diversity for which Ontario is known, it is times like these we must recognize our responsibility.\nRegarding the spoilage of DCC, I am not in favour of any unnecessary waste or spoilage.  However, I understand this has been put fourth to enable the control of a species whose density has become an issue.  Should the lack of use of DCC for food or otherwise be present and ultimately prevent the control of the population, I would consider this to be a necessary waste in the spirit of maintaining Ontario's diversity and am in favour.\n",

        "comment":"I am a resident that lives by the water in the French River District and I also maintain a cottage in another part of Northern Ontario.   I fish, hike, camp and kayak many of the waterways of Ontario and have experience with Cormorants.   I disagree with the proposed cormorant hunt and I believe that there are far greater issues that impact the fisheries and natural landscape then cormorants.\nAt my cottage, which I have been going to since the 1970s there is the odd cormorant and it would be 100% safe to say they have no impact on the fisheries but yet the fisheries on our waterway is terrible which wasn\u2019t always the case.   Today\u2019s fisherman has better equipment (i.e. fish finders, GPS systems with fish maps, etc) to hunt fish.   This can\u2019t be changed but what they are catching and keeping is wrong.   Depending on the location and the characteristics of your waterway (using Pickerel\/Walleye as example) the typical female fish will not spawn until they are 2 to 4 years old.   They are approximately 18-19\u201d inches in size at that time.   The fisherman doesn\u2019t care about this.   Just go to your local camp or check out the fishing boats and look at the fish that are being caught and the number of young fish that being kept.   We are catching and keeping too many fish before they have a chance to spawn.  This has a significant impact on the fisheries especially over a period of time.  This has also be noted by the \u201cFrench River Stewardship Council\u201d when they assessed fishery concerns in this area.   In my cottage area we used to have great fishing and whereas today, you\u2019re lucky to catch one or two keepers over a few days and no cormorants.  You can\u2019t blame the cormorants because they don\u2019t exist on our waterway.   I can say with 100% certainty that this situation exists in other waterways of Ontario as well.  The problem in my area is the lack of MNR or self-regulation of what is being caught and kept.   In Ontario the fisherman complain about the cormorants eating too many fish while out East they complain about the seals eating too much cod.   The problem is the fisherman are over fishing year after year.\nIn the French River, Lake Nipissing area we have cormorants but we also have a problem of over fishing by fishermen (same point as above) and a commercial fishery by the first nations.  As some of the local elders have said, they are aware of some individuals taking advantage of the situation and it will be corrected in time.  There have been ghost nets found on the lake with large catches of dead fish.  This situation is a delicate situation and may not be solved.\nThere have been numerous studies done on the impact of the cormorants on the fisheries and none have found cormorants as the problem.   I find it interesting that the proposed cormorant hunt legislation does not reference any of the studies or references any comments from the scientific community.    I believe that this bill lacks any substance and is strictly being proposed for political reasons which is wrong.\nIf this bill is passed, it will impact the safety of campers, boaters and fishermen.  I for one try to avoid the waterways during the fall hunt to prevent from being shot.  Being an avid camper and kayaker that has camped or travelled by cormorants, I am concerned about the lack of safety and concern about being shot.  Bullets travel a great distance across open water.  This will not only impact myself but the northern tourism as well.\nThere is concern about the natural destruction of property by cormorants.  I find this hypocritical considering the Ontario government permits the spraying of glyphosate to kill deciduous trees for improved harvest yields for the lumber industry.  This chemical kills trees that are consider helpful in preventing the spreading of forest fires (due to their high water content), is dangerous to insects and many smaller creatures.   There are numerous studies for and against the use of glyphosate but by applying the \u201cprecautionary principal\u201d as referenced by the Supreme Court of Canada, glyphosate should be banned.   If you are concerned about the destruction of natural landscapes and eco-systems, there are far greater issues that should be addressed first.\nIn summary the proposed cormorant legislation lacks the scientific backing and consideration for public safety on our waterways.   I believe this legislation is political motivated and pandering to a few vocal organizations.    This legislation should not be allowed to be passed.\n",

The study found that cormorants caused less than 6.4% of perch mortality. They conclude that control measures weren\u2019t necessary at the time of the study. The study also mentioned the cormorants fed heavily during the April to May period. This suggests shrinking the hunting period to focus this period could have the desired effects of reducing fish mortality by cormorants, while keeping a sustainable population of cormorants.\n\\cite{ fielder2008examination} analyzed the literature and found the yellow perch population decrease in the 1970s to early 1980s was due to recreational fishing exploitation, not cormorants. In 1995, the population decrease of yellow perch was due to breeding reasons, most likely do to environmental factors such as water temperature and water levels. This study does suggest the cormorants had the strongest impact on yellow perch populations, but they weren\u2019t the only factors. This suggests that the fishermen\u2019s\u2019 concern of the population decrease of yellow perch may not be entirely due to the cormorant population.\n\\cite{fielder2010response} found that a decrease in cormorant population was correlated with an increase in yellow perch population. They also state that there are many other factors that affect the yellow perch population, including commercial fishing. It isn\u2019t only the cormorants\u2019 fault.\nThey estimate 1000 cormorants and 500 nests in the Les Cheneaux Islands location to be sustainable. However, if 50 cormorants could be killed by a hunter each day, then in 20 days a single hunter could destroy the sustainable cormorant population, or 20 hunters in a day. That isn\u2019t sustainable, even if the population was overpopulated initially. Decreasing the number of cormorants that can be killed by an individual would be better for sustainability.\n\\cite{ ostman2013estimating } found in its studies that cormorants do affect the catch rates of fishermen, however it isn\u2019t as substantial as some may think. Fish have to be a certain size to catch with a net,  and cormorants eat smaller fish. Cormorants were found to eat 13-34% of perch of size ready to be caught by nets. In other words, approximately 70% of fish cormorants eat aren\u2019t affecting fisherman\u2019s catch rate during that season.\n\\cite{ ostman2012cormorant } has found that a large cormorant population does decrease the population yellow perch, but have little effect on other types of fish. Therefore, the general decrease of fish species population cannot be completely attributed to cormorants.\nIt is also worth mentioning that hunting during nesting season isn\u2019t a sustainable practice. Other birds that nest with cormorants will get scared and leave their nests, decreasing the population of non-cormorants as a result.

        "comment":"Re: ERO 013-4124: Comment on Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed regulation.\nI oppose establishing a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario because:\n\u2022\tThe extreme bag limit allowing an individual to kill 50 birds a day for nine-and-a-half months of the year, including the breeding season, is without precedent, and is a virtually uncontrolled kill that may significantly harm both the cormorant species and other native wildlife.\n\u2022\tThe proposal is not rooted in logic: Cormorant populations in the Great Lakes have stabilized or declined slightly since the early 2000s. This fact alone would suggest that the proposed hunt is unwarranted.\nBird Studies Canada has noted \u201csuch a level of hunting would lead to local and\/or regional extirpations, as well as reduction provincially to token remnant populations.\u201d\nThe following are just a few of the problems attending the proposal:\n1.\tThe proposal lacks scientific justification\nThe proposal fails to:\n\u2022\testablish the current population size\n\u2022\tspecify the desired population size\n\u2022\tjustify the high bag limit (practically speaking, no bag-limit)\n\u2022\tpropose any means of monitoring the effect of the hunting on cormorants\n\u2022\tconsider the complex of interactions that will be triggered (The claim that: \u201cthe anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral.\u201d Is not justified and very likely to be incorrect)\nFurther to the last point above, Professor Gail Fraser at York University notes many factors that can impact the abundance of a fish population, including predation by humans, fish and waterbirds, competition from other prey, water temperature and climate change. (http:\/\/gsfraser.blog.yorku.ca\/research\/conservation\/proposed-cormorant-\u2026 ).\nCormorants rely on small, non-commercial, shallow-water fish: non-native rainbow smelt, alewife and round goby (https:\/\/www.thespec.com\/news-story\/9059210-nature-not-bullets-should-co\u2026).\nThe goby\u2019s diet is 90% zebra mussels, so controlling cormorants may put downward pressure on invasive zebra mussels but, conversely, the introduced alewife feeds avidly on lake trout eggs and fry, so native lake trout populations that are not doing well now may suffer even more.  \u2013 It\u2019s complex! The \u201cproblem\u201d needs a much more considered approach.\n2. The proposed hunting will harm other species\nThe proposed will allow hunting to occur throughout the breeding season and at breeding colonies. When motor boats are close to breeding colonies, and guns are in use, other bird species will be stressed at their breeding sites and displaced, if not killed in error.\nAs noted by Professor Gail Fraser and by Bird Studies Canada, the proposed hunt poses a risk to great blue herons, great egrets, black-crowned night-herons, Caspian terns, common terns and great black-backed gulls.\n3.\tThis is a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach\nThere are regions of Ontario where breeding cormorant are out of the way of cottagers and commercial fishing interests but may still be subject to severe depredations by hunters on both a casual and an organized basis. If the regulation is adopted (It should not be!) the sites and regions where hunting is allowed should be specified. The default should be \u201cno hunting\u201d.\nRegarding concerns about property damage, under section 31 of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, property owners already have recourse to harass, capture or kill cormorants if they\u2019re causing property damage, so is the regulation needed?:\n31 (1) If a person believes on reasonable grounds that wildlife is damaging or is about to damage the person\u2019s property, the person may, on the person\u2019s land,\n(a) harass the wildlife for the purpose of deterring it from damaging the person\u2019s property; or\n(b) capture or kill the wildlife.  1997, c. 41, s. 31 (1).\n4. In the current fiscal climate of cut-backs, can the MNRF administer this regulation effectively?\nAs the Ontario Government\u2019s priority is deficit-cutting, we may expect difficulties in administering this new and extra regulation.\n5.\tRisk to the public and recreational economic impact\nThe proposal envisions amateur hunters shooting cormorants from stationary boats throughout the open water season \u2013 where boaters, cottagers, birders and other outdoor recreationists are also on the water.\nWill large water areas be closed to the general public during the proposed hunt? What will be the economic effect on the recreation industry?\nWill the regulation exclude cormorant hunting from provincial parks and provincial wildlife areas?\nConclusion\nThe proposed regulation should be abandoned. I concur with Bird Studies Canada that\n \u201cthe proposed bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no possession limit over a nine and a half month open season is exceptionally high, unsustainable, and without precedent under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for its failure to address the need for population sustainability.\u201d\n",

As the cormorants are absent from Ontario  in the winter, the proposed \"season\" is essentially year long.  The year long season obviously includes the nesting season and this, together with the bag \"limit\" of thousands of birds per hunter per year, will undoubtedly ensure that double-crested cormorants are heading towards extirpation in Ontario within a few years.  This is not only an extreme environmental insult to the cormorants but also threatens other species which nest in the same areas as cormorants.  Further, the plan is quite frankly dangerous.  Allowing hunters to shoot alongside recreational boaters over the spring and summer will surely result in human injury sooner or later.  The proposal to permit this essentially unlimited hunt and then \"review\" it - once the birds are all but eliminated? - is thoroughly disingenuous.  If commercial and other fisherman must be appeased - landowners are permitted to cull anyway if their property is being damaged - a limited fall hunting season along the lines of a duck hunting season should be established and reviewed for effect.\n",

        "comment":"I am shocked and appalled that this proposal has been put forward and an very much against it.\nThe double-crested cormorant is a native species in Ontario and thus should not be subjected to action that has the potential to extirpate it. This proposal is severely flawed on the basis of several ecological perspectives.\n1. There is BSC data that suggests recent population declines. Thus, virtually unlimited hunting is ill-advised\n2.  The presumption that because the species is currently \u201ccommon\u201d it cannot be extirpated is wrong. One glance back to what happened with passenger pigeons tells us this is an incorrect assumption.\n3. This species tends to flock and thus is particularly sensitive to extirpation local population by local population.\n4. Under this proposal I and every other person in Ontario could kill 50 cormorants per day for 292 days of the year. That is, I could kill 14,600 birds. If even a small proportion of Ontario\u2019s human population does this the cormorant population impact would be catastrophic. This kind of unregulated hunting is ludicrous!  I have observed situations where people have pursued fishing by limiting- out daily so this scenario is certainly possible with cormorants especially as there would be no possession limit nor the moral imperative to consume what is taken. So easy to just go out and target practice on cormorants every day!  Shameful!\nThere are also several ethical or moral reasons why this proposal is misguided.\n4. It is disgusting that under this proposal cormorants could be used for target practice. I had thought that part of a hunting ethic was to eat\/use what is killed and to not waste an animal. This proposal allows killed cormorants to be completely wasted and encourages small-minded target practice on the animals. I find it disgusting to encourage the treatment of these living birds as no more than tin cans for entertainment.\n5. It is ethically wrong to simply decide that this species is \u201cannoying\u201d (eg it\u2019s poop ruins my dock\/boat\/view\/smells) and thus must be eliminated. What is \u201cannoying\u201d is undefinable because it is personal and is no way to \u201cmanage\u201d a provincial natural resource.\n6. Cormorants are a natural element of the Ontario ecosystem. If we have messed up the ecosystem so badly that the species appears to be out of balance, that\u2019s on us not the birds. We need to just suck it up and co-exist with them whether we\u2019re happy about it or not. If we\u2019ve been this bad at managing fish stocks, our human population and cormorant habitat to date we are certainly not capable of fixing it by killing them off.\n",

I have spent more than 55 years  fishing and undertaking nature observations on Lake Ontario and other bodies of water in Ontario, south of the French River. In doing so, I have on a first hand basis witnessed the unprecedented and exponential explosion in the Cormorant population (starting with a \"colony\" in Hamilton Bay back in the late 1970's), and have seen their incredibly destructive impact on both juvenile gamefish and prey fish species (not to ignore their negative impact on the land they nest on, and their squeezing out of other water birds).  Action such as this Bill, is long overdue (I also supported MPP Bob Bailey's private member bill related to Cormorants that unfortunately died when the previous Government prorogued) !\nAnyone who has spent any time on the water can likely relate numerous accurate anecdotes of witnessing the Cormorants plunder our fish species. This is a species whose population has exploded well beyond what can be sustained without more significant negative impacts. Historical records clearly indicate that that Cormorants were never common. Living very close to the Lake Ontario shoreline allows me to observe their activity daily. I cant help but notice that they seem to arrive earlier in April each year and leave later as well (I was still seeing groups of them along the Oakville waterfront as late as November 20\/18 this past fall).\nTo those who oppose this Bill, I would suggest that they are practicing conservation in a rather selective fashion - where is their concern for the fish species being plundered and decimated? To those who are now suggesting that the population of Cormorants has \"stabilized\" - how little comfort that provides as we watch this massive number of what in reality amounts to an invasive species destroy fish populations. There is no \"stability\" to this as these \"experts\" would suggest - in fact how very disingenuous of them to make these pronouncements, as though in doing so, citizens with real and valid concerns should be placated and remain quiet. Their population may have plateaued but these population levels are not desired, and not sustainable. They also are continuing to expand their range across the Province from Kenora to Cornwall and as far north as Algonquin Park.\nTherefore, hand in hand with introducing a legal hunt the Provincial Government will need to undertake regular spot culls across the Province (you cannot and should not download the entire responsibility for bringing their population under control on private citizens!). Further a major ongoing cull is required on Lake Ontario, which should continue until such time as the population becomes in balance with the watersheds environment.\nThe Government will need to ensure various municipalities (particularly along the Lake Ontario Watershed), allow for this hunt to unfold.\nPlease get this Bill passed and commence spot culls.\n",

        "comment":"Establishing a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario with the current proposed parameters  is both irresponsible and counterproductive to Great Lakes ecosystem management and conservation efforts. The per-day bag limit of 50 birds is far too high, and the potential for allowing all hunted birds to spoil leaves far too much potential for piles of dead birds rotting in areas where the cormorants would be hunted.\nAdditionally, the timing of the hunting is ludicrous. Other waterfowl, some which may be confused visually with cormorants for more inexperienced or less discerning hunters, for example diving duck species and loons, will be abundant within areas where the cormorants would be hunted. This sets up a strong potential for negative impacts upon these other species' populations, and many of them are also already under stress from other issues including habitat degradation and loss.\nCormorants are much-maligned in Ontario due to personal interactions with them on small scales- property owners, for instance, who observe short-term impacts of their feces. But there is little evidence for long-term impacts, since populations have only rebounded within the last few decades. There is no evidence that comparisons with other areas of long-term cormorant residency within the Great Lakes or otherwise has been done to speak to the establishment of this hunting season. In fact, it is noted in the opening paragraph that local cormorant populations have stabilized or declined after their recovery in the 1970s. Unfortunately, wildlife population trends need to be observed over a longer stretch of time for an animal that has a moderate rate of reproduction (1-7 chicks per brood, with 1-2 broods per year) and that lives to a max of ~17 years. We have had a mere 40-50 years since the populations of the Great Lakes began their recovery from the impacts of DDT use. The rate of hunting that has been proposed will likely wipe them out or come very close to doing so.\nInstead of a public hunting season, if management involving culls are required in specific areas of highly degraded habitat, this should be carried out by OMNRF officials with the proper training and identification skills, to limit the impacts upon other species. However, even before this is pursued, there should be clear evidence that the claims of negative impacts on economically important  fish species and habitats are indeed true and scientifically factual. Much evidence points to alewife being a large component of double-crested cormorant diets - an invasive species. Introduced game fish, like Chinook salmon, also feed upon alewife, but since chinook salmon are stocked in the lakes on a yearly basis, perhaps the real question should be - how can we find ways to support our native ecosystem, and make it resilient, rather than focusing on maintaining all of these populations of invasive and introduced species? There are still tons of stocked salmon for anglers to fish.  But a healthy great lakes ecosystem requires more than just sport fishing species.\nI am also inclined to point out the complete lack of consultation with local Indigenous Peoples about the double-crested cormorant, and the absence of Traditional Ecological Knowledge to inform this decision. If cormorants arrived in Lake Ontario only within the last 100 years, consultation and research should be conducted to confirm this is the case by consulting with Indigenous Knowledge Carriers, and again there must be a comparison with other areas in the Great Lakes and elsewhere to see what the long-term impacts of cormorants are on the ecosystems, and how they have been managed in the past. Looking at the current situation in isolation helps no one - applying this hunting season proposal without considering past and broader implications is short-sighted and weak-minded conservation and management, and is not the best choice for any Ontarians.\n",

They are starting to nest and appear in staggeringly large numbers, competing with multiple other local species for the same (limited) food source.\nIn this day and age, it is clear that a lot of wildlife management decisions are based moreso on emotions than scientific facts, which is quite sad. This proposal to introduce a hunting season for these birds is an example of that. Scientifically, it is clear that these birds have become over populated to the point they are spreading into new environments where they have never been seen before, and need to be managed properly. It's a little upsetting that the MNRF even needs to \"ask\" for the public's permission to manage our resources. We know there are always large groups of people (oddly from the southern portion of the province who coincidentally have no connection to the land what so ever) that are offended by wildlife management practices.\nHopefully the MNRF values our wildlife and our abundant resources more than the emotions of our ill-informed majority of Ontario's population.\nThese birds needed to managed long ago, but better late than never I guess.\nThank you to the person\/people involved at the MNRF in creating this proposal!\n",

The loss of trees in protected lands (e.g., East Sister Island, Middle Island. etc.) reflect on paucity of mature Carolinian forest in Ontario, in protected areas and elsewhere, rather than \"hyper-abundance\" of the cormorant.\nMost of cormorant species nest in colonies, often with other fish-eating birds, and because of this overall number of colonies is small.\nAs of the impact on fisheries... It is very likely that the cormorant increase, in part, relates to an increase in bait-fish, after the excessive removal of sportfish by anglers and commercial fishermen.\nThe double-crested cormorant is an integral part of the Great Lakes ecosystem and should be afforded protection as such, at least for the duration of the breeding season, and this protection should not be sacrificed to appease few interest groups.\nWhether cormorants should be hunted outside of the breeding season remains debatable, but if allowed, the bug limit should not exceed five bird a year per hunter. Although, I maintain that hunting merely for a desire to kill, and then to spoil, is unethical.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael Patrikeev\nOrnithologist and zoologist with over 30 years of work experience.\nOttawa, Ontario\n",

Encouraging what amounts to wholesale destruction of any species in this day and age in NOT acceptable in Canada.\nOther jurisdictions have managed to work out control management plans without total devastation.  it reminds me of the wholesale destruction of the buffalo in a past century, just as sport and not even for use of the animal.\nPlease do not go ahead with this.  There has to be a better way than just wholesale killing of anything.  This type of legislation will also open the door to other similar widespread culls  with side effects harming other similar species that are not targeted,\nAs a Canadian who has worked with wildlife, I am disappointed and disgusted you would formally propose this issue.\n",

The actual proposal does not produce an evidence-based problem diagnosis that directly correlates apparent commercial fish stock reductions to Cormorants anymore than to other causes - predation by other fish, over fishing, habitat loss and pollution. The proposed hunt is unethical in construct and will attract exactly the wrong type of hunters.  As a taxpayer and outdoorsman I am extremely disappointed in MNR leadership  and policy unit - this is DDT- era dumb policy making in my opinion. MNR should stand down this proposal to slaughter Cormorants and disrupt other species including people as there is no sound evidence presented to support a cull.

        "comment":"This proposed cormorant hunt is ill-considered and environmentally irresponsible as it is unsupported by environmental science and only institutes monitoring of its effects after potentially irreversible damage has been done.\nLet's assume however that cormorants are a problem in Ontario. Are they a localized problem, or are they a province-wide problem? If localized, as seems to be the case, then the solution should also be localized, not a province-wide hunt.\nAnd if cormorants are a problem, what sort of problem are they? Are the birds themselves a problem, are their colonies a problem, are their fishing habits a problem, is tree damage a problem? Each of these potential problems demands a different solution.\nAs it stands, this proposed hunt abandons the principles of conscientious game hunting. Since when were game hunters permitted to allow their kill to spoil? Never, until now. And what about a bag limit of 50 birds per day with no possession limit? The kill numbers those parameters allow sets up a slaughter, not a controlled hunt, of cormorants.\nMany other elements of this proposal are problematic: the potential by-kill of co-locating species (such as herons), the potential by-kill of birds mistaken for cormorants (such as loons), safety concerns, chick abandonment, and so forth.\nIf management of the cormorant population -- though apparently stable already -- is desireable, then that is best done by egg and nest management at the rookeries, not by an open season province-wide in an essentially uncontrolled hunt.\nThis disturbing proposal appears to be an exercise in target shooting, not game hunting, and certainly not species management. It is from all appearances a reprehensible sop to vocal and ill-informed hunting and angling special interests aimed at decimating a native species of bird now recovering from near extirpation in Ontario.\nFor these and numerous other reasons I object strongly to this proposed cormorant hunt.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to submit a comment with respect to the EBR 013-4124. Firstly, this inhumane proposal is unsupported in both scientific evidence and methodology for the conclusions by which the government carries as reasons to open a hunting season on the Double-crested cormorants (cormorants). Recreational fishing which brings in over 2.2 billion (media MNRF release) in revenue to Ontario does not indicate a decline in fishing opportunities. The government also halted any fishing license fee increase for recreational users to encourage more sport  fishing. As for commercial aquatic populations in decline or instability, other factors such as pollution, toxic dumping, over-harvesting by consumptive sectors such as commercial\/sport fishing play a significant role in populations, not the cormorants. If fish stocks are in decline, one would think the MNRF would just ban fishing sports. One can appreciate how ridiculous this angle is.\nBased on the simple math of one hunter per hundred killing 50 cormorants per season as suggested in the proposal \"bag limit', the population in the Great Lakes could be exterminated during the first year. The regulation manipulation to allow for spoilage of rotting cormorant carcasses flies in the face of ethics, conservation and healthy biodiversity. Attracting other wildlife species, the spread of disease to other nesting species (that occur naturally) in the cormorant colonies and the use of lead ammunition is a disgrace. There can be no responsible monitoring of all of these colony kill sites by MNRF personnel,  as boats will be used to access remote colonies to shoot nesting and fledgling birds and staffing is a deficit.\nThe Double-crested cormorant is a native species to North America including our very own Great Lakes. To consider any hunting season at all of a species that has been historically persecuted by humans is short on science and long on a legacy of our government bending under pressure to lobby groups that hunt and fish. This soft sell of all of the reasons these magnificent birds must be managed through aggressive and inhumane slaughter wreaks of a hunt\/fish propaganda campaign. It has been stated by hunting groups that they will shoot cormorants, use wires to attach the bodies to bricks and toss them in the water. Does this sound ethical? Does this sound humane? Does this sound sane?\nThis proposal is nothing but a smoke screen to provide an avenue for 'hunters' to kill with special consideration and access to Ontario's wildlife. There are many residents and tourists that enjoy the biodiversity that Ontario showcases, including the cormorant. Stop scapegoating wildlife, show integrity, courage and make the decision not to go through with this archaic, barbaric and scientifically challenged proposal. The science is not there to justify this proposal and our government's public trust is truly at stake.\n",

        "comment":"I am a wildlife biologist and Professor of Biology with more than four decades of experience, and much of my early career was spent working on colonial, fish-eating birds.\nMy assessment of this proposal is quite simply that it is maximally ill conceived.\nIt is based on little science, as the evidence that cormorants have a significant impact on fish species of commercial or recreational importance is slender at best. Overfishing by commercial and recreational fisheries has resulted in reduction of top-level predators such as walleye, and burgeoning forage fish populations. The cormorant increase appears to have lagged the decrease in predatory fish due to the effects of chemical contaminants, as research by the Canadian Wildlife Service has shown. It appears in recent years that after recovery from the pesticide-era, that cormorant numbers around the Great Lakes have stabilized.\nWhile the science of the effect of predator removal on commercially important fish species is uncertain, what is not uncertain is the effect of the proposed hunt on species protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act. Double-crested cormorants frequently nest in mixed-species colonies.\nIt is not possible to shoot cormorants on a colony without causing the abandonment \/ destruction of the nests of other protected species, such as terns, gulls, great blue herons, egrets and night herons. The non-target species will either abandon their nests, or have their nests destroyed by nest predators will disturbed away from nests. The architects of this proposal should be well aware that any disturbance of these species during the nesting season is a direct violation of the Migratory Birds Convention Act.\nA direct, predictable consequence of this proposal will be that Ontario hunters will engage in widespread illegal activity in violation of federal law. As such, this proposal should not be implemented. If it does go ahead, the architects of the proposal are culpable of condoning widespread illegal activity.\n",

I lived in Kingston in 1998 when hunters killed > 800 cormorants on Little Galoo Island. It was a truly outrageous act born out of ignorance about this species and the miniscule competition it represents to commercial and sport fishermen.\nA government-sanctioned kill such as you are proposing, with \"bag\" limits of 50 (!) is no better. No one eats a cormorant. You are simply encouraging mass vandalism against an ancient and innocent species, caving in to some special interest or other. You should be ashamed!\nIf this public consultation is worth anything, then listen to common sense and don't do it.\n",

        "comment":"As a avid hunter and wildlife management professional, I commend the Ontario government for acknowledging there is an over-abundance of DCC in Ontario and for considering hunters as a useful tool to manage their population.\nThat said, I believe this proposal opens hunters up to ridicule from the anti-hunting and non-hunting communities. To have a large \u201cbag limit\u201d such as 50 can only be sensationalized by the press and anti-hunting community. I read one op-ed from a Toronto paper where the author pointed out how many cormorants a hunter could harvest in a season; a sensational number around 14,000. That is just unattainable. I would argue that a wildlife management professional hired exclusively to cull cormorants would have a very difficult time killing that many cormorants in a year.\nCormorants are not a game species and are not fit for consumption. Cormorants will be harvested opportunistically by hunters while waterfowling, and there are no calls, decoys, or other hunting aids that will help attract cormorants to hunters. With that being said, as someone who spends an inordinate amount of time waterfowling in and around areas cormorants frequent, I don\u2019t feel that I would be able to harvest but a dozen or two annually by shooting them opportunistically.\nWhile this proposal is a step in the right direction, I feel that a much better move would be to simply de-list cormorants. That would mean there were no seasons or bag limits, but for all intents and purposes, such a move would fulfill the crux of the proposal as it is being laid out. The upside here is that hunters wouldn\u2019t bear the scorn of others when this proposal is brought up in the press.\nMost people will not be informed enough to know the ins and outs of the situation, and I too, would think that 50 sounded like a big number.\nAgain, I am recommending that the province de-list cormorants from the protected list.\nFailing my suggestion, I would support the proposal as it is laid out.\n",

        "comment":"I strongly disagree with the proposal to allow a hunting season for double-crested cormorants. The province has not put forward any scientific evidence or justification to support this proposal. This native species is part of the ecosystem of our province and Lake Ontario. The cormorant population suffered greatly in past decades from pollution such as DDT and has only recently recovered to the point where it is now, once again, thriving. We should be welcoming its return, rather than persecuting it.\nThis is a large colonial nesting bird, so it\u2019s not surprising that its colonies are noticeable. Nature often has a way of stabilizing populations that have undergone large swings; for example, predators (non-human) can take advantage of the newly available source of prey. This is already happening with the resurgence of bald eagles (another positive recovery story) which are preying on cormorant nests.\nIf any population management is found to be advisable, based on scientific evidence, there are much more sensible alternatives to declaring on open season on these birds. For example, mute swans, a non-native species, cause negative impacts on waterfowl nesting areas and are controlled by the Canadian Wildlife Service oiling their eggs \u2013 a low-key method that probably most of the public is unaware of. Imagine if cormorants were perceived as being as aesthetically pleasing as mute swans and an open season was declared on them! No doubt there would be a huge public outcry. Surely a scientific approach makes more sense than declaring war on a species that is big, black, visible in large groups and considered unattractive!\nCormorants are beneficial predators of invasive fish species, such as gobies and alewives. The argument put forward by anglers that this bird is hurting the sport fish stock is once again not founded in scientific evidence.\nI call upon the province to make full use of the scientific expertise available within the Ministry and in the research community, and to make the wise decision to withdraw this ill-conceived proposal.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"To Whom it May Concern,\nI am a resident of Ontario and am writing to express my opposition to the Proposal to establish a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants in this province (ERO # 013-4124). I add my voice to the others who object to the proposal on the basis that it offers no evidence whatsoever to support the rationale for a hunting season. Furthermore, the proposal offers no evidence to suggest that a hunt of this scale will not have detrimental impacts on wildlife other than cormorants and on the ecosystem.\nI am not opposed to hunting in general, and would be open to hearing a case for alternative measures to control Double-crested Cormorant population in certain areas. What I cannot agree with is a government basing decisions on \"concerns expressed by some groups\" as opposed to results of scientific inquiry that have been reviewed by professionals in a relevant area of expertise, such as ecology, wildlife biology, or fisheries science. Without looking at the evidence, how can we make any kind of prediction about what impacts - positive or negative - the proposed hunting season would have on fish populations, island forest habitats, or anything else?\nSome scientists have raised concerns that, since the cormorant hunt would be happening from March to December, it could create a disturbance to other bird species breeding in areas where cormorants are found, such as herons and terns. It is logical to suggest that birds nesting in proximity to cormorants would be disturbed by the gunshots and the presence of hunters, and that the reproductive success of these birds could be reduced. Before I could accept any proposal for reducing the cormorant population, I would have to see evidence that the proposed measures would not negatively impact the population of other non-target species.\nOnce again, I am deeply concerned to see a proposal of this nature coming from the Ontario government. Without reviewing scientific evidence, there is no way to make a decision with any level of confidence that it will be in the best interest of Ontarians and Ontario's natural heritage. The decision around this issue will greatly influence my attitude towards and level of trust in the current government.\nRegards.\n",

Humans are daily affecting the quality of water within this ecosystem and are responsible for the decline in numbers of fish.\nAssociate professor of biology at the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus, Jason Weir, says the daily limits of the hunt are too high, and that the cull could affect other bird populations such as Common terns and great blue herons.

Double-crested cormorants are among the few large aquatic bird species on northern lakes, and do not generally flock, nor reproduce in large numbers.  A hunting season with the suggested limits and duration will push the species to extinction, and their niche will likely be taken over by even less desirable water fowl like herring gulls. Other systematic environmental effects from eliminating a higher level species is also unknown, but prior experience suggests that there will be many unanticipated negative effects.\nThe idea of a smaller, limited season in the fall in which they are taken for consumption makes more sense.  The idea of encouraging killing for its own sake is anti-social verging on psychotic.\n",

But those concerns are largely just anecdotes, complaints and unsubstantiated claims that were debunked long ago.\nIn reality, cormorants are not overabundant, their numbers are relatively modest, have stabilized and are dropping in some areas. The entire North American double-crested cormorant population is estimated to be less than the population of Toronto, with only about 125,000 birds in the lower Great Lakes. Cormorant numbers on the US-side of the border have already dropped (naturally) by 30% or more.\nThe Ontario governments proposal is not science or fact based.

I do not support \"trophy hunting\", or the kind of gratuitous killing that  shows no respect for the creatures that are killed.\nAs a former public servant, I find the timing of this consultation problematic, primarily over the Christmas holiday season, but I also suspect that this underscores the lack of evidence on which the proposal is based.  This is not a criticism of the bureaucrats.\nThe Double-crested Cormorant is not a \"game\" bird - no matter what is put in a regulation - and allowing what is in effect a virtually uncontrolled \"hunt\", including during breeding season, would be a \"cull\" - and that is a kind way to put it.   This species is not generally considered to be edible, so to call it a \"game bird\" is not an appropriate way to reduce or control its populations, if this is indeed required - based on evidence, not the opinions of people who simply don't like them.\nI generally support the submissions of the organizations to which I belong, noted above.  If there is to be a cull, it should be done properly, as was at least attempted for Middle Island at Pelee (also controversial - and I attended consultations on that).  The experiences at Tommy Thompson Park and Presqu'ile have  shown there are effective alternatives to reduce and control populations, e.g. egg oiling, promoting ground nesting.\nThe proposal, if implemented, would create a system of public hunting of a so-called game bird, in order to reduce the species' population in Ontario.  It would more likely than not result in harm for other species, e.g., the Black-Crowned Night Herons, which nest in similar habitat alongside the Cormorants.  The \"hunt\", especially during breeding season, would disturb and interrupt the breeding time of other species, not to mention other forms of \"collateral damage\".\nIf there is a concern about the population, which you acknowledge seems to have stabilized or declined slightly, then strategies for specific culling or oiling eggs or other methods should be used.  To define this bird as a \"game bird\" and allow a public hunt, with few limits, is frankly horrifying and would be a tremendous setback in responsible policy-making in the environmental and conservation sector.\nThank you for your consideration.  I look forward to a more evidence-based approach to dealing with the concern about this species.\n",

In fact, the only suggestion of science states that the population may have stabilized or has declined. There is no summary showing cormorant population trends, diets, impacts to fisheries or if the proposed control approach has been used elsewhere and whether or not it was effective. Without fully understanding the issue and providing background rationale why this is an acceptable approach, I cannot support the proposal.\n2.\tThe proposed hunting season coincides with popular cottage and camping seasons. I am concerned that hunters will be shooting cormorants and may endanger the safety of other users.\n3.\tAs there appears to be no regulations against shooting birds while nesting or a restriction on the proposed season, I am concerned that hunters will (a) shoot nesting cormorants, (b) shoot other colonial nesting birds such as herons or terns and (c) enter colonies to collect and retrieve dead cormorants, possibly disturbing other nesting birds.\n4.\tThere is no requirement for hunters to report the number of cormorants that they shoot.\n5.\tThe proposed monitoring does not include fisheries assessments to directly link increases in fish populations to reductions in cormorant populations.\n6.\tThe discharge of firearms is not allowed in some areas with large cormorant colonies (e.g. Hamilton and Toronto) and as such, there won\u2019t be any control of these populations and there are no proposed alternatives for these locations.\n7.\tThis proposed hunt is a thinly disguised cull to be conducted by the general public.

I am a former employee of the Ontario Dept. of Lands and Forests and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.  My post-graduate research in Ontario fisheries was funded in part by the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters.  I am an occasional fisher but I have never hunted.  I am a keen boater on Lake Ontario and more than familiar with the Double-crested Cormorant with all its pros and cons.  Apart from the above statements, I have no vested interest in the welfare of the Cormorant nor in angling or hunting.  I consider myself to be keen and knowledgeable about our native species, but I do not claim to be an expert.\nThat said, I have to say that I am dismayed, even shocked, that the Government of Ontario would even consider the aforesaid legislation.  The proposed \u2018hunt\u2019 amounts to no more than a massacre of a bird species in a vain attempt to placate a small number of vociferous anglers and hunters.  The proposed cull has no basis in science or logic.  Such a massacre reminds me of the extermination of Passenger Pigeons in the early years of the 20th century and the near extermination of Bison on the Canadian prairies in the late 19th century.  Such a kill can only rebound against the Government of Ontario and cost it votes in the next election.  There are, after all, far more naturalists, birdwatchers and animal lovers in this province than there are anglers and hunters.\nThe proposed Cormorant hunt also poses a significant public health hazard.  Can you imagine the public outcry should a naturalist, a birdwatcher, a hiker or, dare I say, a child were shot by a careless hunter determined to reach his daily limit of 50 Cormorants a day?  Hunters say this is unlikely to happen.  But I can assure you that I have twice heard shot whizzing past my ears when trigger-happy hunters mistook me for a duck hiding in the bushes of cottage country!  It will be only a matter of time before a child is killed by a sloppy hunter firing into the bushes to kill a few more Cormorants.\n\tI sail a boat in and around Toronto harbour.  How long will it be before a hunter \u2013 focused on hitting a Cormorant -- blasts a hole in my sail with his shotgun?  How long before he blasts a hole in my wife or me?\nI also worry about the other species that co-exist happily with Cormorants.  Great Egrets, Great Blue Herons, Black-crowned Night Herons, Terns and Common Loons.  How many Loons will be shot by hunters who can say only:  \u201cOops.  I goofed.  I killed the wrong bird\u201d?\nLet me deal with a few numbers.  The proposed legislation would permit the hunting of up to 50 cormorants a day for 9.5 months a year.  That amounts to 14,250 cormorants per hunter per year every year.  This can only be described as a mindless slaughter.  One hunter could wipe out every cormorant in Toronto in less than a year.\nHunters argue that few, if any, hunters will strive for their daily limit.  Okay.  Let us assume that hunters will take it easy and kill just 10 Cormorants a day before getting tired and packing up.  Even so, it would take just five (5) hunters to wipe out every Cormorant in Toronto in less than a year.\nCormorant hunting is not even a sport.  It is target practice.  These birds stand on logs and docks airing themselves in the wind, just waiting to be shot.  Under one bizarre proposal, dead birds will be left rotting in the swamps, available to every rat, every vulture and every carrion feeder that happens by.\nThere is no benefit to shooting Cormorants.  It has been shown repeatedly that Cormorants, if disturbed, will just move to a new island, one mile or 20 miles away and establish a new colony and kill more trees.  It is far better to leave the Cormorants where they are, in highly defined locations where they have done all the damage they will ever do.  It is far better to leave them alone.  Let nature take it course.\nYes, it is true that Cormorants poop, just like you and me and every other animal on this planet.  And, yes, Cormorant poop does damage trees.  But, Cormorants live in small, tightly delineated colonies in specific locations.  Yes, they have killed a large number of trees on the Leslie Street Spit in Toronto harbour.  But they have disturbed only one small part of the Spit.  They have not relocated to other islands in Toronto harbour or nearby woodlands.  Moreover, the area they have taken over is hardly a beauty spot.  It resembles a construction site, full of chunks of concrete and rebar.  Why not leave them there?  Their numbers are apparently declining, naturally.  They have done all the damage they will ever do.\nYes, Cormorants smell.  But again, Cormorants prefer to live in small, isolated areas away from people and noise.  The smell they make is limited to a small area and a specific wind direction.  If hunters are allowed to shoot them, they will simply move to other islands and create more smells elsewhere.  Leave them be!  They have done all the harm they will ever do.\nOf course, Cormorants eat fish.  So do we.  But they do not eat sport fish, the Trout and Salmon and Walleye that anglers prefer.  Cormorants eat the \u2018garbage fish\u2019 that anglers do not want or like.  They eat Round Gobies and Alewives and young Carp, invasive species that are a nuisance to anglers.  Anglers should thank the Cormorants for keeping these \u2018pest fish\u2019 under some sort of control.\nIn conclusion, I simply do not understand why the Government of Ontario should be party to what can only be described as a senseless, gratuitous and irresponsible slaughter of an indigenous Canadian bird solely to placate a small but vociferous group of anglers and hunters who apparently have a hate-on for this species.  The legislation can only hurt the Government of Ontario in the long run.  Can you imagine the headline in The Toronto Star or The Globe & Mail the day after an innocent hiker, bird-watcher or, dare I say it, a child is shot to death by a sloppy Cormorant hunter?\nThe Doug Ford government will be compared with the people who encouraged the extermination of the Passenger Pigeon and the near extermination of the Prairie Bison.  There is nothing of interest for the Doug Ford government in the proposed legislation, nothing except the votes of a narrow group of hunters and fishermen, a group that is clearly outnumbered by the naturalists, bird-watchers, hikers and animal-lovers of this province.  Cease and desist, please, Mr. Ford.  You have nothing to gain from this legislation, but you have a great deal to lose.\nLiterature Cited:\nGail Fraser, Associate Professor, York University, and expert on Cormorants\nProposed cormorant hunt Dec. 4, 2018\nSubmission to EBR 013-4124:\nhttp:\/\/gsfraser.blog.yorku.ca\/research\/conservation\/proposed-cormorant-\u2026\nEdward Kroc, Assistant Professor, UBC\nOn proposed hunting of the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) in Ontario; a scientifically baseless and environmentally naive proposition Dec. 17, 2018\nSubmission to EBR 013-4124:\nhttps:\/\/ekroc.weebly.com\/uploads\/2\/1\/6\/3\/21633182\/dcc_on_dec2018.pdf\nOntario Nature\nSubmission to EBR 013-4124:\nAnne Bell, Director of Conservation and Education\nDec. 28, 2018\nanneb@ontarionature.org\nBird Studies Canada\nSubmission to EBR 013-4124:\nDecember 2018\nhttps:\/\/www.birdscanada.org\/news\/response-to-proposed-hunting-season-fo\u2026\nOntario Field Ornithologists (OFO)\nSubmission to EBR 013-4124:\nDecember 2018\nhttp:\/\/ofo.ca\/ofo-docs\/OFOCormorantProposalResponse.pdf\nOntario Federation of Anglers and Hunters\n\u25aa OFAH website: https:\/\/www.ofah.org\/issues\/cormorants\/\n\u25aa Letter to Manitoulin Expositor Dec. 14, 2018 by Mark Ryckman, Manager of Policy, OFAH: https:\/\/www.manitoulin.ca\/letters-a-rebuttal-to-the-december-7-letter-s\u2026\nLetter to Peterborough Examiner\nby Drew Monkman and Tim Dyson Dec. 14, 2018\nCormorant cull a sign of PC attitudes towards nature\nhttps:\/\/www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com\/opinion-story\/9085919-peterboro\u2026\n-30-\n",

        "comment":"The proposed hunting season on Cormorants is ill conceived and should not be approved. I have several concerns:\n- It is an unjustified hunt because it is not based on scientific data indicating that there is a need for a hunt. More research is needed to show whether or not Cormorants do indeed have significant effects on sport fish populations.\n- It is an inhumane hunt in that it will be allowed to take place during the nesting season of the Cormorant, so that adult birds killed may leave young birds in the nest to die a slow and painful death. Hunting should not be allowed during the breeding season.\n- The proposed bag limit of 50 birds per day is much too high. At this level, it would be feasible for one or two hunters to destroy entire colonies of birds, and in regions where there are only a few colonies to  even extirpate the species.\n- It is likely to be extremely disruptive for other species which nest in colonies with the Cormorants. These include species such as the Great Blue and Black-crowned Night Heron,  Herring and Ring-billed Gulls, Great Egrets and Caspian Terns. Some of these species are uncommon in Ontario, nesting in only a few locations. This is another good reason that shooting should not be allowed during the breeding season.\nThanks for the opportunity to comment.\n",

The environment and world we live in has been suffering for decades, due to pollution, over fishing, pesticides, contaminants and various other factors, our wildlife has suffered and will continue to suffer.  To say that our Cormorants are the basis of fish or environmental decline, is looking at this problem with tunnel vision.  Problems within our eco-system are multi-faceted and are rarely solved when we put another species at risk.  When we place another species at risk, our eco-system will continue to suffer.  There must be another way to engage with individuals in conversation to solve the supposed issues caused by Cormorants.  In my opinion, there is never just one cause to a problem, we must look at ways of helping our diverse species in Canada without the necessary aim of killing.  Cormorants like other species, are sentient beings, they feel and hurt when they die.  Surely, there must be other ways of solving this problem.\n",

They have a right to be here, and their numbers have only recently returned to a healthy range in the wake of negative impacts from direct and indirect human intervention (hunting and pollution). Justification for a cull based on claims of aesthetics are subjective, self-serving, and have nothing to do with science.\nOn the other hand, if we apply the government\u2019s justification re: impact on sport fishing stocks, to the actual agents of their depletion, we\u2019ll be culling the anglers themselves.\nThere is no legitimate or scientific justification for a cull to begin with. That the proposed cull is so ill thought out and unbalanced, should be offensive to anyone whose rational capacities are not permanently overwhelmed with blood lust.\nClaims that the various effects of the cull will be neutral are not merely unsupported; rather they are obviously wrong, in most cases contradicted by science and existing studies. And speaking of studies, the government\u2019s claim that it will monitor cormorant populations going forward, is specious to the point of insult: a moments consideration of the scope of the proposal makes it plain that the entire cormorant population could be wiped out in a single season. That\u2019ll be a quick study. On the other hand I can\u2019t wait to hear what the local populace will be saying as the rotting carcasses that the hunters will be permitted to dump, start bringing out the coyotes.\nThis is not good stewardship.

Notably, lethal management of waterbirds does not address the root causes of fish population instability or decline, and directly contradicts current conservation measures at local, regional, national, and international levels.\nThe government's hunting proposal is gratuitous, irresponsible, and cruel. In particular, the proposal to allow hunters to kill 50 cormorants per day could feasibly permit the eradication of the entire species from the Great Lakes in a single year, assuming below average hunter engagement. More specifically, if only 1 in 100 Ontarian hunters each killed only 50 cormorants over an entire hunting season, this would still be enough to eradicate the species from the Great Lakes entirely. The Double-crested Cormorant is a native species to Ontario whose population has only recently recovered from human persecution and pollution-induced declines. This is no time to be stepping backwards. This species has a right to exist and feed on its native land, and the government has an ethical and legal responsibility to ensure its relative health.\n",

It does not appear that sufficient studies have been conducted to evaluate the impacts of this hunt, if they have, they should be made available to the public for our review as part of this comment period.\nAs proposed this hunt appears to be intended as a cull, given the extremely high bag limits, no possession limit, allowance for hunting from a boat, and possibly including provisions to allow carcasses to spoil. The cormorants would not be hunted for their meat, rather solely for sport, and likely by individuals that perceive cormorants negatively impact fish populations and who may be motivated to hunt cormorants at very high levels.\nI am concerned that this hunt would negatively impact cormorant populations. This proposal does not provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the population would remain stable with the hunt. I urge the government to estimate the likely capture rates from this hunt and conduct a population modeling study to analyze the impacts of hunting on Ontario\u2019s cormorant population. You may wish to engage a third party, such as Bird Studies Canada or a University partner, to conduct the study and add credibility. Any bag limits, and hunting season, should be allocated based on the results of this work.\nThe proposal states that a monitoring committee would be established to review the impacts of the hunt and adjust the hunting regulations as necessary. Reasonably, it could take years to detect the trend of a population decline, and additional time to update regulations. The committee will likely be making decisions on lagging indicators and will be slow to respond to change. Hunting, combined with other unanticipated environmental issues (e.g., loss of nesting habitat, contamination, etc.) could exacerbate declines. It is easier to give things to people than to take them away. I anticipate that once the regulations are in place they will be hard to change and that hunters will resist lower bag limits. Please, proceed with caution and do the necessary population monitoring before establishing this hunt, not afterward.\nAgain, please do not move forward with this proposal, especially without doing the necessary science first.\nThank you.\n",

They are now at a modest number.  Only 3% of potential Island Sites in the Great Lakes are suitable for them, they are easily targeted and killed.  Small congregations will be wiped out in under an hour; while larger colonies win less than one hour.  This in no doubt will cause irreparably damage to our natural ecosystems.  And to discuss Danger, it will be an extremely dangerous situation putting the lives of humans at risk.  Endangering the public as allowing hunters to use their weapons\/guns at Spring, Summer and in the Fall Season when populations of tourists and cottagers are at the highest.  There is no evidence to suggest that these Cormorants are at fault, there are so many other reasons for the changes we are seeing in our ecosystems\/environment.  Cormorants have been known to be predators to invasive fish species such as gobies and alewives.  Again, the Cormorant is the scapegoat.  Another extinction species perhaps, where then the government may see fit to then try to recover spending thousands of dollars once again.

Cormorants often nest in close proximity to other colonial nesting birds (e.g. Black-crowned Night-Herons, Great Egret) which are already in low numbers. Hunting of cormorants should not take place within a prescribed safe distance from any active heronry of such colonial nesting birds, especially during the spring as colonial birds are returning to their nesting site as well as until all the young of such colonial nesting birds have fledged.\nWhile shotguns have advantages, for wildlife management purposes that this proposal is, why not consider small calibre rifles, .22 only, with short or long bullets which are quieter and do not carry as far as long rifle bullets and are therefore not as dangerous, but will still kill the cormorants without needing to be quite as close and without the noise level that shotgun blasts can do to so many other species, especially during the nesting season.\nIf there are likely to be thousands of cormorants killed, is there any way that the dead cormorants could be used by manufacturers of pet food for example? Perhaps not, but there needs to be a way of safely disposing of potentially thousands of cormorant carcasses, which left exposed will be an awful stench and attract scavengers.\n",

        "comment":"My husband and I vigorously protest the draft regulations to permit the hunting of cormorants. The proposal seems to be astoundingly short-sighted and badly flawed. We expect MNRF to manage wildlife on our behalf, but this proposal seems to be suggesting a widespread, uncontrolled cull of a native species without thought for the consequences.\nWe have read many thoughtful, fact-based documents that oppose the proposal. We find wisdom and concrete analysis in the opinions of prominent birding organizations and scientists. We agree with these assessments. We are particularly concerned that the activity suggested is inhumane and that it opens the way for the violation of The Migratory Birds Convention Act 1994. Just as Trumpeter Swans have sometimes been shot instead of Canada Geese, many species in the vicinity of the hunted cormorants will be in jeopardy if this proposal is adopted. In addition, nests will be abandoned.\nFrom our personal experience, we have two concerns:\n\u2022\tIn 2001, along the shore of southern Georgian Bay, we gathered the very heavy, waterlogged carcasses of waterfowl that had been killed by botulism, and we bagged them for pickup by public works. This was a daunting task. It is inevitable that not all dead cormorants or other species killed will be removed, and some will be washed ashore in areas where residents will be responsible for disposing of them. There is no possible way to enforce the removal of carcasses by hunters.\n\u2022\tFor over a decade, we have participated in an invasive plant removal program and understand only too well the impact that introduced species can have on an ecosystem. Studies have shown that the round goby, which competes with and preys on native fish and is believed to be connected with outbreaks of botulism, now forms an important part of the diet of cormorants. It seems irresponsible to be advocating the decimation of a native bird species that is offering a measure of control of an invasive species. What will be done when round goby numbers increase dramatically as a result of a cormorant cull?\nIn spite of the fact that we have read a great deal about this proposal, it simply does not make sense to us. We do not understand the motivation behind it. We urge you to reconsider, to pay attention to the excellent submissions that you have received and to abandon the idea of a widespread cull of Double-crested Cormorants. If, after proper monitoring and careful study, there are areas where it really seems warranted to reduce the number of cormorants, then we hope you will proceed in a professional, controlled and limited manner.\n",

I am asking that the Ontario government begin to listen to the deep widespread concerns about the well being of our wildlife.\nBill 205 is not evidence-based but a product of deliberate misinformation. If passed it will facilitate the slaughter of cormorants across the province and drive them back to the brink of extinction. Then of course there will be a need for urgent measures to bring them back again.  This seems to be historically what we do with so many species.\nThe hunting industry takes advantage of pockets of ignorance, and irrational hatred or fear of certain species. How is it that the small percentage who enjoy recreational killing determine wildlife policy and law? Cormorants do not threaten native fish populations, and have become primary predators of invasive fish species.  In fact cormorants support rich biodiversity wherever  they maintain significant colonies ..At this time, colonies use less than 1% of the Great Lakes basins.\nIt is time for governments everywhere to stop hunter-driven destruction of wildlife and ecosystems.  Perhaps not many people will take the time to write letters in these situations. However in mainstream and on social media public opinion strongly opposes this relentless, mindless killing.\n",

The cormorant population in Ontario has been steady or declining in recent years. There was never a serious problem of overpopulation, though some hunting organizations have worked hard to get their members to hate cormorants. Since the cormorant is not a tasty bird to eat, the hunting would be just to kill. I see it as deeply immoral of our government to support this killing and I am absolutely opposed to it.\nWhen more than 60% of animal species are in decline, including birds of all kinds, this is a hugely wrong-headed decision.

But those concerns are largely just anecdotes, complaints and unsubstantiated claims that were debunked long ago.\nIn reality, cormorants are not overabundant, their numbers are relatively modest, have stabilized and are dropping in some areas. The entire North American double-crested cormorant population is estimated to be less than the population of Toronto, with only about 125,000 birds in the lower Great Lakes. Cormorant numbers on the US-side of the border have already dropped (naturally) by 30% or more.\nThe Ontario governments proposal is not science or fact based.

This policy is not based on science, but to placate a few citizens who do not see room for this native species in our fragile ecosystem.\nThe double-crested cormorant is a bird that is native to Ontario. When the first settlers arrived in Ontario, they commented on how the flocks of birds darkened the skies, as their numbers were so numerous before the European settlement of North America.\nOnly now are their numbers starting to return to their \u201cnormal\u201d population levels after having been almost wiped out by DDT in the 1960s and 70s. They are an important part of the ecosystem and do not take an abundant share of the fish stocks, which have had their populations largely artificially engineered and maintained by human intervention. They only take a small fraction of the fish species that are available and will not limit the amount of fish available to people who participate in recreational fishing.\nI also understand that hunters would be allowed to shoot up to 50 birds per day, which could decimate the population in only a short period of time. There are already regulations in place allowing for culls in certain circumstances when an area may be threatened by too many birds. Also, property owners are already permitted to take whatever means are necessary to protect their land from \u201cnuisance\u201d animals.\nI am also deeply concerned that people may shoot wildly and irresponsibly near cottage owners, campers, canoeists, which would put people in danger.  Other wildlife may also be threatened. Loons may be mistaken for double crested cormorants, and there are no checks and balances to make sure people are hunting responsibly.\nThis cull is not backed by science. It is based on a knee jerk reaction to the birds re-establishing their populations in areas where they have been lost in the past. They are also a species that is prey to the bald eagle, which is making a comeback in Ontario.\nPlease do not go ahead with this policy. There are already measures in place without allowing a mass cull of up to 50 birds per day, per individual. We want to protect our native wildlife, not decimate their populations as we have done in the past.\n",

Further more the slaughter and wasting of their carcasses have the potential to pollute water ways and cause the spread of disease.\nPopulations of double-chested cormorant should be left alone to come to equilibrium on their own. They are part of the natural habitat and once the carrying capacity of each population has been reached it will ebb and flow around that point as long as they are left undisturbed by humans.\nIf this hunt is permitted as proposed then the double-chested cormorant will join the passenger pigeon and only be seen in the dusty drawers of museum collections where we tell stories of their once great number to children that wonder how we could have simply shot the last of a species.\n",

It is ridiculous for such a long time period and the number of birds per person is ridiculous.   Clearly, if this # is allowed, the cormorants will again be wiped out like we did to them with DDT.\nCormorants are native species and the only reason some members of the public think they are 'taking over' is because the numbers are coming back to what they should be according to nature, not a human count.  Your own correspondence underscores this point and that they are already reducing in numbers.\nWe live in rural Ontario and the last thing we need is more hunters with limited shooting restrictions.

While cormorant populations have increased in recent decades, it is important to remember that the species was fighting back from the brink of extinction. Evidence shows that the climb in populations has levelled out around the Great Lakes basin and may actually be falling as part of a natural cycle. Study is needed on population levels before a hunting season is opened.\nAllowing each hunter to shoot as many as 50 Double Crested Cormorants per day, for 10 months of the year, including during the nesting season, and leave their bodies to spoil where they fall is not \"hunt\" it's a slaughter.\nIt's especially troubling that the proposal allows for hunting during the nesting season as cormorants nest with a dozen other species and this will disrupt the reproductive success of all the species.\nIt's important to note that cormorants have been providing an important food source for the rebounding Bald Eagle population around the great lakes. What impact will reduction in cormorant populations have on Bald Eagles? As well, as cormorants are what's called an \"Apex Predator\" and scientific studies show that when apex predators are removed, it cause catastrophic changes all down the food chain, what impacts will reduced cormorant populations have on the Great Lakes ecosystem as a whole? This includes on the invasive fish species that cormorants help control.\nCormorants resemble herons when in the air and loons when on the water, making it likely these species will be shot by accident if this hunt is allowed. What impact will a cormorant hunt have on those species?\nWhile cormorant faces may kill a small number of trees, the number is nowhere near the number of trees destroyed every year by development around the Great Lakes. While the affected trees may look unsightly, the environmental impact is minuscule and part of the natural cycle. It is not reason for the hunt.\nAllowing \"spoilage\" is disgusting and inhumane. How can a hunt be controlled if there is no way to know how many animals have been killed?\nPlease, listen to the scientists. Do the studies.

Where is the humanity in people, does decision-making like this really seem routine when hundreds of birds' are at stake and a species will be wiped out and left to rot in the landscape?

It is my understanding that this is just gratuitous violence perpetrated against a struggling animal species. Considering the inevitable environmental stress that will be placed on all animal and human species in the upcoming decades with climate change altering the habitats of all species on Earth, I do not think that humans have any logical reason for engaging in what I think is an awful practice. It is not up to humans, who have a proven record of bad stewardship and who have demonstrably failed to conserve the environment for future generations, to decide how many individuals of any species a given environment can handle. Humans have no idea what aggravating effects will be felt in the next decade and how large or small the environment supporting the cormorant or any other species will be. All models are out the door now.  So stop pretending that you now what is best, that the politicians have any idea about responsible stewardship.

None of the birds shifted to the south.\nOntario Breeding Bird Atlas data demonstrates that \u201csouthern\u201d birds species such as Tufted Titmouse, Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher, Northern Mockingbird, and Red-bellied Woodpecker have increased in number and have expanded their range northwards in Ontario compared to 20 years ago.\nThese climate-induced shifts are not always a solution to coping with a warming climate.

This is because late northerly winds delayed coastal upwelling, which affected plankton growth and caused a decline in the fish species on which the seabirds depend.\nTufted Puffins at Canadian sites have breeding success near zero when water is at its warmest, which could mean that Canada\u2019s largest breeding colony for this species, Scott Islands, becomes unsuitable for Tufted Puffins as water continues to warm.\nExtinction risks are on the rise\nBirds most at risk of extinction from climate change are those with restricted ranges, poor ability to move their range, small populations, or those already facing conservation challenges.\nMigratory birds are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects, because they depend on multiple habitats and sites.\nArctic birds are particularly vulnerable \u2013 warming is occurring rapidly here, and at least 85 of the world\u2019s bird species breed in global Arctic regions. Vast areas of habitat, including tundra and sea ice, will be lost. Sea ice retreat could have severe consequences for Ivory Gulls, which forage along sea ice.

Within the last few years hunting has increased around the small town I reside in in the gta and our children wake to the sound of gunfire in the morning by hunters. As an example the number of Canada geese and ducks have significantly diminished to the point that I rarely see any at our local reservoir. Birds and bees and wildlife are a part of the delicate eco system one only has to look at the situation with honey bees to see that human action destroying nature has catastrophic consequences for us all. Species of birds were hunted to extinction by people who allowed it to happen. Many bugs and birds are responsible for distributing wildflowers, keeping bug populations in check and cleaning ponds. Also there are studies that bird populations are an early detection system for environmental hazards as was shown previously in population records. This needs further study with scientists and environmentalists and community discussion.\n",

In some areas their high concentration does appear to negatively impact other species, the environment and possibly commercial fishing enterprises. However, there are no scientific studies demonstrating these alleged impacts.\nMost governments are moving toward evidence-based policies and decision making, and so I beseech the Ontario government to review this proposal, which lacks evidence. I'm not opposed to culling birds in problematic areas, however letting the killed birds, nestlings rot on the spot may cause other problems.\nI am also vehemently opposed to an open season of 294 days, that is March 15 to December 31, will certainly give rise to confrontations between outdoor enthusiasts and hunters, and as such pose a security risk. It also has the potential to cast Ontario as a gun happy, wildlife killers and tarnish the reputation of the province as Nature destination for international tourists. I like to stay out of the forests during hunting season for safety reasons, the proposed hunting season in this case will stop many like me from discovering areas of Ontario where I may have to come face to face with a sport hunter or an accumulation of rotting carcasses and the predators that may attract.\nPlease review your proposal to include a reduced season, safety means to protect non hunters, and. to dispose of killed birds in a hygienic fashion. Canada, and Ontario are thought to be developed, and proponents of well informed nature and wildlife management, let's not regress to the 19th century killing sprees that almost eliminated the bison. Please consult the wildlife scientists, on both side of the borders in this matter, instead of enacting a proposal in reaction to people who are reacting on perceptions rather than scientific facts.\n",

That works out to approximately 1,500 cormorants per month or up to 14,250 cormorants for the entire proposed annual hunting season.\nThe presence of cormorants benefits other colonial water birds, such as federally protected herons, egrets and pelicans, all of which are stable or growing populations where cormorants are found.\nThe mass killing of cormorants will not be beneficial.\nIn fact, the process of killing them will force other bird species to vacate the colony sites they share.\nThere is no way to kill cormorants humanely.\nEven controlled, organized culls in other regions have resulted in large numbers of injured and crippled birds being left to die of their wounds or starve to death, including nestlings.\nCormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial, non-forage species.\nIt is the commercial fisheries in Lake Erie and other lakes that are depleting fish populations, not cormorants.\nThe mass killing of cormorants will damage the environment and disrupt natural ecosystem processes.\nThe return of cormorants, a native wildlife species, to the Great Lakes Basin is part of a natural process and should be celebrated\nCormorants are not overabundant in the Great Lakes.\nIn fact, their numbers are modest, now stabilized and are dropping in many areas.\nChanges in the composition of vegetation in and around bird colonies are a sign of  vibrant, healthy, dynamic natural ecosystem processes.\nThe number of trees that die in colonial waterbird colonies across the province is minuscule and wouldn\u2019t even equal the number of trees in a single modestly-sized woodlot or taken in one day by Ontario\u2019s logging industry.\nOnly a small number of islands (less than 3%) and peninsula sites are available for cormorants and other colonial waterbirds to nest on.\nThe mass killing being proposed by the Ontario government is a political response to anecdotes, unsubstantiated claims and complaints by a small group of radical fishermen, supported by special interest groups.\nThere is no substantive body of scientific evidence supporting their position.\nInstead of making cormorants a scapegoat for environmental problems they have nothing to do with, attention should be given to addressing the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, over-fishing and a broad range of other issues.\nThe proposed designation of cormorants as game animals, along with a non-utilization exemption that allows the carcasses to rot should be an affront to every hunter who believes in sportsmanship, fair chase and ethics.\nThere are very real safety issues where hunters are permitted to discharge firearms throughout the spring, summer and fall season when lakes and natural areas are populated by cottagers and tourists.\nThe proposed \u201chunt\u201d will cause unimaginable cruelty by allowing the wholesale, uncontrolled slaughter of cormorants across the province, wounding adults (video of cormorant with a broken bill:  www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z0pBs6XjtSg&list=PL1asTRKubtRuAy7LWUpMFubz97ydJ\u2026) and orphaning thousands of baby birds who will die from starvation and exposure to the elements.\nThis would be animal cruelty, to a beautiful species of birds, who ALL want to live, and ALL have a right to live!  I enjoy it whenever I see the cormorants.  I love nature, as do MANY OTHER PEOPLE.\nStop destroying God's beautiful creations!

Hunting this bird at the rate that you propose only reinforces an unbridled lack of respect for life which in this day and age should not be reinforced.

It is callow. The cormorant has been accused of depleting commercial fish stocks. This is odd because scientists report that the birds dive, catch and feed on coarse fish. A CBC report last August talked about cormorants in the Toronto area being afflicted with NEWCASTLE DISEASE from feeding on Alewife fish and dying from the virus.

It is not possible to manage such a hunt sustainably.\nA species is not \u201coverpopulated\u201d just because it appears to be common. Cormorants are a native species that have finally returned to their natural level of abundance, after recovering from human-caused harm. The fact that the population has stabilized without human intervention is a sign that natural forces are working as they should. Adding hunting now can only cause a decrease in the population \u2013 the hunt would undo a hard-won conservation success. Having cormorants present again has been beneficial to the ecosystem as a whole. Killing cormorants would remove the pressure they put on the invasive fish species they help control, which would be detrimental to native fish stocks and aquatic ecosystems generally.\nSound conservation management involves ensuring that sustainable populations of native wildlife continue to thrive in Ontario. This proposal will ensure that a native species declines quickly, reversing its recovery, and benefitting non-native, harmful fish species that will lose their best predator. There is no science supporting the claims made by those who advocate for the hunt. Disliking an animal, \u201caesthetics\u201d, and seeing more of something than one used to (even when it is a species recovering from a previous near-extinction), are not acceptable reasons to slaughter animals. It is the opposite of ecologically responsible. If adopted, this proposal would set responsible conservation management back decades.\nPlease choose to manage Ontario\u2019s ecosystems in a responsible, sustainable, and ethical way by rejecting this proposal.\n",

Allowing one hunter to kill 50 birds per day (up to 14,600 per year in the proposed 292-day hunting season) is neither humane nor sustainable. Allowing the hunt to occur throughout nesting season is a breach of conservation protocol and animal welfare ethics, as this will lead to baby birds being abandoned and starving to death. Other species of birds often share nesting sites with cormorants, and this hunting would impair their ability to nest successfully, and will inevitably lead to some other birds being killed by accident. This is not acceptable.\nAllowing the hunt through the spring and summer will also cause conflicts with every other person who spends time outdoors in Ontario. People relaxing at cottages, canoeing, boating, fishing, swimming, hiking near lakes and wetlands, etc., will be disrupted and at times put in danger by the ongoing hunt.\nAny hunt needs to be managed with sustainability in mind, based on conservation science. No scientific studies exist that support this proposal. Classifying an animal as \u201cgame\u201d yet allowing meat to spoil is either completely unethical, or a disingenuous way to have an uncontrolled, unnecessary cull. It is not acceptable to slaughter a native animal just because a small number of loud people don\u2019t like the birds, or think their nest sites are ugly, or blame them for their poor fishing skills. By controlling invasive fish species, cormorants help native fish populations persist in spite of pollution, habitat loss, and relentless fishing by sport anglers.\nThis proposal would cause serious damage to the ecosystem as well as to Ontario\u2019s reputation as a responsible jurisdiction with sound conservation management.

By the government's own admission numbers are declining based on the last censuses. So why cause further imbalance to the natural processes  starting to balance out the population?  It makes no sense.\nThe government's proposal does not reflect accepted or sound wildlife management approaches and techniques.  It provides no current scientific basis or planning for scientific management. It is responding to opinion and whim of those who will not live in a reasonable co-existence with wildlife, but simply see wildlife as something that can and should be killed. The daily bag limit is an anathema to wildlife management principles and the provision for letting carcasses rot after appropriate disposal is simply something out of the dark ages. and is morally reprehensible.   The proposed hunting season goes through out the breeding season and contravenes principles of scientific management and humanness as nesting and rearing will be disturbed and undue pain and suffering caused to adults and nestlings alike. As well the proposed hunting season would be in effect when there is a maximized use of lake waters by a multitude of other users for recreation, transport and scientific study. This will in effect establish an unsafe condition for non-hunters.\nScience has shown that Newcastle disease is sweeping through the Great Lakes basin population of double crested cormorants. This natural event has been rapidly reducing population increases for the past 2-3 years through  the impact of killing off  most nestlings and some adults. This population reduction is a natural event and will cease more or less when the population balances out with the resources available to support it.\nI urge and request  the government to cancel this proposal and to immediately institute scientific research so that management of double-crested cormorants, if required, might proceed in a rational and scientific way instead of the way it is currently proposed.\n",

The proposed plan has not been created using verifiable data but appears to be based on complaints from a few affected individuals.  Individuals who already have remedies to protect their properties if they are in fact negatively affected at all, without a province-wide uncontrolled hunt being needed.\nThe daily limit is too high, and the proposed hunting season too long.  It could result in the near extinction of the species, reversing decades of recovery of the species.  Since cormorants are not a food species for humans, they will be shot essentially as a recreational activity, like sending people out to a shooting gallery to kill birds as they wish.  Hunting lodge operators may actually see this as a market opportunity and it will become a business, until there are no cormorants left to shoot.\nBecause the birds would be shot over water or land, the dead bodies will be left to rot in large numbers and will cause problems for other species.  Hunters will also accidentally shoot other species while there, so the negative effects could be much more far-ranging than expected.\nThe proposed 'culling' is unnecessary and an example of bad planning with no real rationale for doing it beyond the wishes of a few people, or a plan to monitor the result after.  It should not be carried out and the issue of cormorant populations and their effects should be studied further with experts in the field before a 'solution' is proposed.\nAs a resident of Toronto, and a user of our waterfront I am aware of the effects of cormorants.

Comorants will be shot and carcasses will be left in situ as cormorants, unlike geese or ducks, will not be used as food but will be shot solely for sport. The scientific data does show some need for cormorant control but a bag limit of 50 per hunter is completely unacceptable. I do not support this as many hunters shoot cormorants in areas that are not easily accessible due to the areas that cormorants nest and will most likely not extract carcasses.\n",

I've even been asked by other people on hiking trails, or even within the city, \"What are those birds?\" I reply, \"They're cormorants!\" Personally, I think that cormorants are wonderful birds.  To go down to the lake and see them swimming half-submerged, diving for fish, and sitting on the shore with their wings spread to dry really helps me appreciate them as part of the rich biodiversity of Ontario's wetlands.\nI am unsure why the Ontario government wants to allow the public to be able to kill such a large number of cormorants.  Hunting as a sport should be done responsibly and sustainably.  To allow the culling of 50 birds per day, per person is neither.\nI believe that allowing people to hunt cormorants in such a large quantity will be harmful to their population.

I'm not opposed to properly managed wildlife culls where they are understood to be necessary to protect species at risk, but that's not what this is. Completely unregulated shooting of nesting birds is not population management, nor is it \"hunting\". Allowing shot birds to spoil is not \"hunting\" and contradicts everything that hunters are taught. The public perception of hunting has been increasingly negative over the last 40 years and activities such as what this proposal would allow will only make this situation worse. We cannot allow anyone to shoot as many birds as they like and leave them to rot (or pile them up and burn them) if we want to attempt to keep what little public goodwill is left towards hunters and hunting in southern Ontario.\nThat's not to say that local hunters could not be involved in a cull that was planned as part of a management strategy. But the timing, numbers, etc. would need to be decided by those qualified to do so using scientific evidence, not perceptions of \"they're eating all the fish.\" Further, such perceptions are not a valid reason for a wildlife cull. Competition with humans for resources should never be a reason; humans are doing well enough at competing with wildlife already. Some people would have us shoot more wolves so that there are more deer to hunt. This is not a valid approach to wildlife management by today's standards.\n",

The proposal details state: \"...Great Lakes populations (of double crested cormorants) have ...stabilized or declined slightly\".  Creating a hunting season may make sense but it must be aligned with existing hunting regulations for other water fowl.  The numbers of cormorants do not warrant the extreme measure proposed.\n1.  The hunting season must be limited to a few weeks in the fall of each year.  It makes no sense to have hunters in conflict with recreational users of areas frequented by cormorants during the peak spring and summer months.\n2.   The \"bag limit\" should parallel that of other water fowl.  Having hunters on recreational lakes in mid-summer shooting 50 birds each is frightening for those of us with cottages and camps on those lakes.   Most hunters are not so accurate as to hit a target with each shot.  Just imagine, two hunters in a boat on busy recreational lake in mid summer firing hundreds of shots at panicking birds!\n3. Allowing hunters an exemption from the requirement that meat not be allowed to spoil creates the potential for a large volume of dead birds being improperly disposed of.   Feces from Canada geese are enough of a problem on our lakes without adding dead cormorant carcasses.\n4. Municipalities should have the legislative right to prohibit hunting of cormorants within their jurisdictions.\n5.  The cost of additional MNR staff to properly manage and enforce the new regulations would be significant and without enforcement there will be abuse.\nIn conclusion, as a recreational user of lakes and natural areas in Ontario, I fear for the safety and health of my children and grandchildren if this killing of cormorants is allowed in public areas in the numbers and within the proposed hunting season suggested by the proposal.\n",

This proposal is a call for species annihilation, since the \"limit\" set is 2.7 billion cormorants (based on the number of small game hunting licenses Ontario issues annually), even though only about 125,000 cormorants exist in the province.\nThe Government\u2019s proposal would have numerous terrible consequences to wildlife and natural ecosystems in Ontario including, of course, the wholesale, and uncontrolled, slaughter of cormorants.\nThe Government says it is responding to concerns about too many cormorants, depleted fish stocks and environmental damage. But if fish stocks are indeed depleted, shouldn't you be looking at reducing the number of sport fishing licenses, rather than annihilating one of the species that depends on fish as its sole food source? All species are facing a climate crisis caused by human activities, and studies have shown that one effect is warmer waters which is causing fish to grow smaller (https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/science\/climate-change-fish-shrink-s\u2026).\nCormorant numbers are \"relatively modest\", according to Zoocheck, and have stabilized and are dropping in some areas. The entire North American double-crested cormorant population is estimated to be less than the population of Toronto, with only about 125,000 birds in the lower Great Lakes. Cormorant numbers on the US-side of the border have already dropped (naturally) by 30% or more.\nPlease reconsider and drop this proposal. Those who care about the future of our beautiful blue planet are busy trying to save ecosystems and species, and initiatives such as this--increasing the death toll of a  particular scapegoat species through gratuitous killing--are even harder to stomach in times like this.\nSincerely,\nC.

Let us not forget that Cormorants play an important role that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked; they feed on the invasive round goby, which has devastated fish populations by eating the eggs and the young.\nWhat is being proposed is an effort to push the cormorant back down to endangered status, which is completely unacceptable and wholeheartedly irresponsible.  The province should be ashamed for even considering this course of action!\n#savethecormorants\n",

Entire breeding colonies of cormorants and co-inhabiting species such as Great Blue Herons, egrets and, in the north, American White Pelicans, could be eliminated.\n\u2022 Since both parents care for young, untold thousands of nestlings will die of thirst, malnutrition, hypothermia and predation.\n\u2022 This proposal discredits decades of understanding basic ecology and the importance of apex predators to biodiversity.\n\u2022 Protected colonies such as the one at Tommy Thompson Park, which are humanely and effectively managed on science-based principles, will face increased pressure.\n\u2022 According to the Canadian Wildlife Service, cormorants feed primarily on small, largely non-commercial, shallow-water fish (e.g., non-native rainbow smelt and alewife). Only a small percentage of their diet consists of \u201csport fish,\u201d which is one of the excuses given for the hunt.\nI am appalled that this proposal is even being considered. I am vehemently against this proposal; and hope that you do the right thing, and abolish it rather than move forward and alter these unsustainable guidelines. We need to protect our wildlife for generations to come. We already have numerous species that have become extinct, please do not enable the opportunity for more species, including cohabitation species, to be added to this extinction list.

Cormorants are doing exactly what they are supposed to do in their environment.  Therefore, I agree with monitoring and assessing their population and status.\nI do not agree with allowing the hunting of cormorants under any circumstances.  These birds have been on the decline due to habitat loss, pollution, culls, and most recently, Newcastle disease, which is species specific.\nThe proposed hunting season between March 15th to December 31st is too long, gives visitors to natural areas no break, and will leave orphaned chicks.\nThe proposed bag limit of 50 birds per person is excessive.\nAllowing any hunted animal to rot is completely unethical.  Animals are not garbage.  Leaving animals to rot can create attractants and wildlife conflicts.\nAny lethal wildlife control leaves more room for more animals.  A lethal approach is a lazy approach that does not get to the root of the problem.  A much better approach to human conflicts with double crested cormorants is to fully protect them from hunting and culls, while educating the public about their vital role in the environment.

Fish species and information regarding the depletion of any specific fish species is not provided in this proposal.  Further, the impact of commercial and recreational fishing, pollution has not been quantified or considered if, in fact, there is a decline in fish stocks.  It is immediately obvious that this bird could not single handedly influence such as decline as to support your proposal.  I suspect no work has been done by your Ministry to quantify or determine any relationship between fish stocks and the Double Crested Cormorant's numbers and foraging.  There is no sufficient information contained in the proposal to support a cull of the Double Crested Cormorant and I am deeply concerned that the Ministry of Natural Resources proposal reflects a mismanagement of the Public Trust in this proposal.  There is documented evidence that the Double Crested Cormorant has not reached it's former healthy numbers on the Great Lakes and that the proposed cull could easily eradicate the species from the Great Lakes in a single year.  Please see:  EBR Registration number:  013-4124 Edward Kroc, Ph.D. Assistant Professor of Measurement Evaluation, and Research Methodology UBC \"On the hunting of the Double-Crested Cormorant in Ontario: a scientifically baseless and environmentally na\u00efve proposition.  Lastly, the proposal is seriously flawed, barbaric, unethical, and cruel.  I am immensely disappointed by this poorly researched and disturbing proposal.  Once again, I suspect a bias towards satisfying the complaints of folks who may not appreciate this species vital niche in Ontario's ecosystem, as well as the blood sport interests of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters.  This proposal is similar to the Spring Bear Hunt in which the barbaric, cruel, and ill conceived change was made to allow the killing of a lactating mammal and leaving cubs to starvation and predation, promoted by OFAH as a good management practice. No where in the proposal regarding the Double-Crested Cormorant, is a unbiased body of information that highlights the importance of this species, such as providing habitat for other nesting birds such as Herons, and the creation of dead trees is of significance just as much as living trees are in ecosystems.  Your Ministry wishes to expand opportunities for families to fish and yet blame has been put on the backs of the Double Crested Cormorant for and without evidence, depletion of fish stocks in the Great Lakes.  I am disturbed that Ontario would showcase a direct irreverence and disregard for wildlife and the treatment thereof, by such a proposal.\n",

With no requirement to collect the bird, there is no way to enforce limits either since one could shoot hundreds and a conservation officer would have no means to prove overhunting.\nAlso cormorants nest with other non-game species, including species-at-risk. Just the act of hunting would cause species-at-risk to abandon colonies.\nAdditionally the claims this is trying to address have very little to no scientific merit. Very few of the fish it eats are desirable to anglers, and human-created habitat loss is far more detrimental and widespread than cormorant colonies.\nI would only support this if the scope is scaled down greatly to a far more conservative approach. A season that does not overlap with breeding, and is more in line with what is expected of duck hunting -- a requirement to collect, and smaller limits, would be desirable.\n",

        "comment":"Subject: EBR Registry Number 013-4124: Proposal to established a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\nI am writing to request that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (hereafter MNRF) withdraw the proposal on the EBR, Registry number 013-4124, to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants (hereafter cormorants). My objections to the proposal are generally two-fold: 1) lack of sufficient documentation, lack of use of evidence, and lack of demonstration of need; and 2) fundamental flaws in the approach to and description of the proposed activities, specifically the mis-characterization of the activities as \"hunting\", rather than as what it really is: population reduction or culling.\nLack of documentation, evidence and demonstration of need:\nThe only statement in the \"Description of the Policy\" that relates to any underlying need (or purpose) for a hunting season ('cull')is the one that refers to continued \"concerns expressed by some groups ... and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations\". Wildlife and fisheries policy in Ontario and North America is generally based on a combination of assessments of biological science, economics and social concerns, and thus this type of general opinion is insufficient on its own to support a major change in policy, certainly one involving the reclassification of a species and an essentially uncontrollable and unenforceable regulation invoking the public as agents of population reduction. The lack of any evidence in the proposal demonstrating the need for population reduction at any scale is particularly egregious because the MNRF is a science-based organization and because double-crested cormorant populations have been extensively and intensively studied in the Great Lakes, including by the MNRF, other governments, and universities in Canada and the United States.\nThe wealth of information available to the MNRF about the diets of cormorants and the potential effects of cormorant foraging on fish populations has not been presented in this proposal. If there is compelling evidence that supports the assertion that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between cormorant population size and fish population size at the relevant management scale, it should be presented in the proposal and used as support for any active population management. Because the hunt is proposed at the provincial level and because the proposal is silent on the scale of any effect, it must be assumed that MNRF is making the case that fish populations in the Great Lakes as a whole have been affected. This is improbable and it is much more likely that effects on fish are local. However, even at the scale of a basin within an individual lake, cormorants alone are unlikely to drive fish populations, rather they have been shown to track fish populations (e.g., the collapse of alewife in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay in the early 2000's was followed by a significant decline in the number of breeding cormorants in those water-bodies).\nIt is stated in the \"Description of the Policy\" that the \"latest information\" indicates Great Lakes populations have \"stabilized or declined slightly\" since the early 2000's. Rather than support a need for a reduction, this implies that the issue of concern to \"some groups\" may have self-corrected and no longer be valid. In any case, no population estimates for the Great Lakes as a whole or any of the individual Great Lakes or their basins are provided. Without baseline population estimates, there is no way of measuring outcomes of the proposed hunt. This insufficiency is critical, as it indicates a departure from evidence-based management, one of the MNRF's basic guiding principles, and it weakens any attempt to measure or claim to achieve sustainability of the activity. The proposal purports to having adjustments of the hunt regulations in future based on monitoring. The establishment of \"a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends\" is a worthwhile and essential activity, but such a program needs to be established and operated for several years before any management activity such as the population reduction of this proposal is undertaken.\nFundamental flaws in the approach to and description of the activity proposed\nWhile technically\/legally the province can designate the cormorant as a \"game bird\" by regulation  under its Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (FWCA), the broadly accepted definition of a game species is a species that is pursued for the purpose of consumption as food, or less commonly, as a trophy. The designation of cormorants as \"game\" species under FWCA as laid out in this proposal is contradictory to that broad definition, as neither of those uses is mandated for this hunt. In fact, although the proposal indicates that the FWCA's requirement for retrieval of killed game birds would be maintained, the use of the term \"disposal of carcasses\" and the proposal's specific statement that an exemption to the general requirement that prohibits spoilage of game meat would be sought or regulated are clear indications that the MNRF does not anticipate the birds would be consumed for food or deemed to be trophies, and thus does not sincerely believe this to be a hunt in the traditional and commonly accepted sense (e.g., as game bird hunting equivalent to that for ducks, geese, grouse, etc). The proposed re-designation of cormorants would be highly detrimental to the integrity of the FWCA and to the credibility of MNRF, both in its setting of precedence and its devaluing of this and other species and of the process (i.e., the hunting regulations process).\nThe proposed \"hunting season\" is a euphemism for a population reduction or cull. The intent (or inadvertent effect) appears to be the downloading of the responsibility of population control to the general \"hunting\" public at its expense. Like the designation of the cormorant as a game bird, this is fundamentally contradictory to the North American Model of hunting and conservation of wildlife. While some hunters might participate in a season if this proposal were to proceed, it is hard to believe that many of them would be motivated by conservation principles. The harm done to the image of hunters as conservationists in the eyes of non-hunters and the vast majority of urban Ontarians by such a spectre would be great indeed. For example, the hunting of cormorants during the breeding season on or near their breeding sites inevitably means that the death of adult breeders would lead to the death of eggs, embryos, and pre-fledged young. Such treatment would not be tolerated for any other wildlife species, certainly no other game species. The MNRF also stands to lose its credibility as a science-based conservation agency which uses socially acceptable practices, if this proposal proceeds as it is.\nThere are both provincial and international precedents for culling of cormorants for the purpose of conservation of other natural resources. In Ontario, the successful implementation of a cormorant cull by Provincial Parks demonstrates that acceptable tools are already available and will be accepted by the public where need is demonstrated. In the Great Lakes in general, federal culling programs have also been implement in Canada and the United States with due process and public consultation and acceptance. These have been location-specific and have allowed targeting of control where negative ecological effects have been demonstrated, rather than a wide-open population reduction with no basis in ecosystem management, another of MNRF's guiding principles.\nThe \"Regulatory Impact Statement\" that states the \"anticipated environmental consequences\" are expected to be neutral is neither quantified nor logically supportable. Firstly, the proposed season completely overlaps the presence of the species in the province, allowing their killing without respite. Secondly, there are no statements regarding the protection of breeding colonies or mature breeding birds during the breeding season, indicating that contrary to all other hunting of game species, the reproductive portion of the population during reproductive activities could be killed. Basic principles of population biology indicate that this is a prescription for negative population growth, despite the claim of neutrality or sustainability. Thirdly, the proposed bag limit of 50 per day per hunter effectively allows killing without constraint. Many of Ontario's breeding cormorant colonies include small enough numbers of breeding adults that they can reasonably be expected to be wholly eliminated by the kind of persistent hunting that would be allowed by this proposal.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe this proposal to be fundamentally flawed and without merit. I request and urge the MNRF to withdraw the proposal. If cormorant population reduction is the MNRF's management goal for the species and the Great Lakes ecosystem that it inhabits, then MNRF should develop an approach suitable to that purpose which does not include reclassification of the species as game, the devaluation of hunters and hunting, and the devaluation of its own reputation. Any such program should include specific, measurable objectives for acceptable and sustainable cormorant population sizes at scales and for locations where negative ecological effects of cormorants have been demonstrated or can be reasonably expected.\n",

        "comment":"I have been an activity sports fisherman on Lake Ontario for the past five years and during this time period my concern about the exploding population of cormorants has been increasing over the years.   Beyond the clearly visible impact of the infestation of these cormorants on the small parcels of land along Eastport Drive in the Hamilton Harbour the growing colonies of birds appears to be having a negative impact on the fish populations in the Hamilton Harbour as well as Lake Ontario.    When I initially started fishing for salmon in Lake Ontario in 2013 it was quite easy to locate large balls of bait fish on my sonar.   At some times during the day I could actually observe signs of bait fish feeding on the water surface and on a few occasions could see the bait fish swimming just below the water surface beside my boat.\nOver the past few years it is becoming increasingly more difficult to locate groups of bait fish when I'm trolling for salmon and when bait fish are located the volume is significantly reduced which I'm confident is a direct negative impact of the ever growing number of cormorants in the West end of Lake Ontario.    Unfortunately as the volume of bait fish has reduce so has the number of salmon fish which migrate around Lake Ontario in their normal  patterns.   In addition to a much lower number of salmon fish the size and general weight\/condition of the salmon I catch (100% release) continues to deteriorate.\nI feel it is imperative that corrective action (open hunting & reproduction control) to control the numbers of cormorants be taken now and ongoing in the future.   As with any econ system it is important to maintain balance and with the increasing number of cormorants & reduction in fish within Lake Ontario that balance has been lost.  Corrective action is required now, not later, in order to ensure  a healthy fishery is regained and maintained for the Great Lakes in general and specifically for Lake Ontario.\n",

        "comment":"I think this proposal is a bad idea for the following reasons:\n1.  There is apparently good evidence that cormorant populations are stabilizing or even beginning to decline, therefore there should be no argument for overpopulation.  At any rate, nature has ways of controlling wildlife populations without the need for human intervention.\n2.  Despite what some people say, there is little evidence that cormorants are consuming large quantities of commercial or game fish species, so that argument also is groundless.\n3. It is ridiculous to call cormorants a game bird if nobody eats them and there is no sport in hunting them.\n4. A bag limit of 50 birds per person per day, and allowing the birds to be shot while on the breeding grounds is unprecedented.  Though it is a strong word, the only one that I think describes this is \"slaughter.\"  Especially considering the birds are likely to be left behind to rot if no one eats them (and who is going to load their boat with 50 or more birds to take home).  This type of hunting has not occurred since the passenger pigeons were  hunted to extinction.  Not to say that extinction will be the end result, but the public perception will be bad.\n5. The public perception will reflect poorly on hunters and hunting as a whole.  Currently, even those who are against hunting can acknowledge that there is some sport to it.  But there is no sport in the proposed hunting of cormorants.  The public will also not take kindly to the idea of young birds being left to starve in the nests after their parents have been shot right in front of them, or that bodies of dead birds will invariably be left to rot.\n6.  Most of the big cormorant colonies are in protected areas where no hunting is allowed.  Therefore as a means of population control the hunt will be a failure.  Indeed this completely falsifies the main argument for what is essentially a \"cull\" disguised as game hunting.\nI urge the province (MNRF) and the OFAH to think carefully about these points.  This will backfire and give both a bad reputation.\n",

It is an affront to me as a life-long, law-abiding, ethical, hunter-conservationist to kill or wound wildlife that is not being retrieved, consumed or used (e.g. fur).\nCulling has become a necessary management tool for many species that create problems because of their population levels or behaviour (e.g. deer in Rondeau Provincial Park or International\/regional\/local airports, Canada geese on beaches, coyotes and sheep kills. turkey depredation of crops, etc.).\nHunting and Culling should be clearly separated in the Fish and wildlife Conservation Act so that those heritage features of hunting are not degraded by the short-term need of controlling some wildlife populations.\nCulling should be described in new sections of the Act with an eye to future needs that do not erode, negate or downgrade our traditional hunting culture and practices. A clear division between the two distinctly different activities will allow continuance of hunting as a recreational activity based on ethics and scientifically validated limits that protect populations, compared to the approach of culling a wildlife population without regard to ethics, techniques, seasons, and limits. The activity requires a focus in its application to identifiable locations (private property sites, threatened habitats, nuisance species control applied at times of greatest concentration and highest kill numbers, etc.), species, kill objectives, and allowable techniques. It should not be applicable openly across the province.\n",

        "comment":"Cormorants have become an important predator of round gobies, an aggressive invasive species in the Great Lakes. That's according to a national park biologist I interviewed as part of my work. We want to control round gobies. It makes sense to let cormorants do the job.\nIn addition, I am concerned about the proposed cormorant hunt for three reasons.\nFirst, I have not seen any scientific evidence that virtually-uncontrolled hunting is the best way to manage cormorants, even assuming that there is a valid basis for controlling these round-goby-eating birds.\nSecond, I have never tasted cormorant flesh, but those who have say it is oily and fishy tasting and generally unpalatable. In other words, it is highly unlikely to be eaten. Hunting is therefore not for food but as an alternative to a cull. With a bag limit of 50 birds a day, the cormorant hunt would encourage a high degree of wanton waste, which is in total disregard to the basics of ethical hunting.\nThird, loons in their winter plumage can be mistaken for cormorants. Loons are in enough trouble from the acidifcation of southern Ontario loons. We can't afford to lose loons which are mistaken for cormorants.\nTo summarize, hunting cormorants is a misguided proposal because it removes a source of control for the highly invasive round gobies, it is unsupported by scientific studies, it promotes wanton waste and it endangers loons i their fall plumage.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my concern about the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s (MNRF) proposal to establish a hunting season for the Double-crested Cormorant in Ontario. I write as a professional wildlife biologist with over twenty-five years\u2019 experience dealing with complex conservation issues (including fisheries-wildlife interactions), and with years of experience monitoring bird populations. I believe that this proposal lacks justification from a science perspective and has the potential to significantly impact the population not just of Double-crested Cormorants but of many other native bird species, notably other colonial-nesting waterbirds. Consequently, I am opposed to this proposal.\nThe Double-crested Cormorant is a native Ontario species which in recent decades has recovered from near extirpation in the province. Its recovery is a complex issues, and I recognize that there are sensitive and rare ecological communities in some parts of the province where limited controls may on occasion be warranted. The current wide-ranging proposal is neither justified nor limited \u2013 nor is there any provision or practical mechanism proposed to monitor the impact of such an open-ended hunt.\nThe proposal lacks scientific credibility and justification, raising concerns among a wide-ranging spectrum of the public (including many conservation-minded hunters, anglers and outdoors enthusiasts). In particular, the species\u2019 population appears to be stabilizing, or decreasing, as noted by MNRF, undermining one of the arguments used to support a hunt. The biology of the species is highly complex, and common perceptions about the impact of the cormorants on fish populations, plant communities and other wildlife are frequently misunderstood, partially understood, or sometimes misrepresented. Such misconceptions should not form the basis of such sweeping changes to wildlife management policies in Ontario.\nMy greatest concern relates to the potential hunting of Double-crested Cormorants at breeding colonies, as well as the exceptionally high proposed bag limits and long open season. Hunting for game species in Ontario is typically closed during the breeding season for adults caring for young, and for young, nestlings, eggs. (In the case of cormorants, both adults are required to raise young.) There are sound wildlife management reasons for closing hunting during the breeding season, including managing population assessments more accurately and effectively. Not only could this lead to highly significant impact on the cormorant population, it also poses a major risk to other bird species which often nest in close association (e.g., herons, egrets, terns). Shooting and disturbance at or near breeding colonies could lead to nest failures and colony abandonment of broad avian wildlife communities. The proposed daily limit of 50 birds is exceptionally high, and unlikely to be effectively enforced given the relatively small number of Ontario conservation officers. Further, the exceptionally long open season represents, essentially, the entire duration of the species\u2019 annual occurrence in Ontario. The long hunting season, very high proposed bag limits, and the proposed permission to hunt during the breeding season (including at\/near colonies) are particularly problematic aspects of this proposal.\nI encourage MNRF not to proceed with this proposal.\n",

This is in spite of the first paragraph of the ERO posting, which states that \u201ctheir numbers began to increase rapidly from the 1970s to the early 2000s, with the latest information indicating Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly.\u201d\nThe government points out that it is responding to \u201cconcerns expressed by some groups\u201d as a result of the impacts of cormorants on fish populations; however, the Canadian Wildlife Service has clearly demonstrated that cormorants do not eat \u201csport\u201d fish in any significant numbers.  No explanation is given to why a stable or slightly declining population should be opened to a massive slaughter.\nThis disturbing proposal would allow the killing of 50 cormorants per day from March 15 until December 31 each year, which would potentially mean the killing of more than 14,000 birds per hunter, per killing season.  Additionally, both members of a nesting pair are required for nesting success; therefore, the killing of either the male or female during the nesting season would result in their chicks starving to death.  The government also proposes to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to allow killed cormorants to be left to spoil, but suggests that if this proposal proceeds it may be accompanied by regulations to require retrieval and disposal of the carcasses.  This entire proposal is unacceptable, irresponsible and unjustified, and presents an increased risk to cottagers and recreational boaters and fishermen.\nNo scientific justification or data has been presented to support a drastic culling of this wild native cormorant population whose populations in the Great Lakes have been shown to be stable or slightly declining since the early 2000s.  This proposal has offered no evidence-based rationale or information on the current population size or management target, and no plan or strategy to detail its potential impacts on the ecosystem.  How will this killing season be monitored or assessed, and what about the collateral damage\/risks to other bird and aquatic populations and, more importantly, to the public at large?\nAccording to the Canadian Wildlife Service, cormorants feed primarily on small, largely non-commercial, shallow-water fish (e.g., non-native rainbow smelt and alewife). Only a small percentage of their diet consists of \u201csport fish,\u201d which is one of the reasons given for the hunt.\nORA objects to the proposed policy to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants when there is already provision under Section 31 of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, to harass, capture or kill cormorants if they\u2019re causing property damage.\nThe extreme bag limit allowing an individual to kill 50 cormorants a day for nine-and-a-half months of the year, including the breeding season, is without precedent and could cause significant harm to this and other native wildlife populations.\nThis proposal goes far beyond what any ethical hunters would consider reasonable and appropriate.  It is difficult to believe that any environmental or sport game\/fishing group would support such a proposal for a full-on slaughter of any wild native species.\nORA urges this government to abandon this ill-considered proposal when there is no reasoned or evidence-based data to support it.\nThank you for this opportunity to comment!\n",

I assume that North America knows enough examples when abundant species were eradicated in the short period of time. The classic example is a Passenger Pigeon, which also was considered as a pest and just shot by anyone, who liked shooting and blood on the hand just for pleasure. I assume that in our very critical for biodiversity time, this precedent can more harm to general biodiversity conservation and to implementation by Canada its obligations to CBD for execution of Biodiversity Action Plan, associated with Aichi Biodiversity Targets (2010-2020). I assume that it should be more consultations done that to elaborate more civic and appropriate ways to control population growth. I assume that it should be done more research that to know critical points of species biology, which will allow to decrease its population.\nWe often talk about ecological integrity, but the solution to hunt on cormorants from March to December is absolutely out such integrity.

        "comment":"013-4124\nIn Opposition\nThe issue is the hunting season on cormorants proposed by the MNR at the apparent request of the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission Technical Advisory based on concerns expressed by some groups and individuals.\nThe proposal is for the hunting season to be open from March 15th to December 31st with a 50 bird per day limit with no restrictions on possession, allowing hunters to not retrieve the carcasses and allowing hunting from a motorboat.\nAccording to the mandatory Regulatory Impact Statement, \u201cThe anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral. The double-crested cormorant is abundant in Ontario and anticipated levels of harvest aren\u2019t expected to affect sustainability.\u201d\nThis statement seems unsupportable given the lack of limits on possession and 50 bird per day quota. One motivated hunter over 76 days of open season (June 24th, 2019 to August 31st, 2019) could theoretically kill 3800 birds legally. A mere 10 hunters could kill 38,000 birds; 100 \u2013 380,000 birds annually.\nThis additional anthropogenic pressure will ensure that another species will be extirpated from the Great Lakes if this goes through. Literature shows that historic cycles of a similar extirpation are recorded in the late 1800s (Wires, 2006). So history is literally repeating itself.\nWhat happens when these native birds become a threatened species? Will they then have to be added to the Provincial Species at Risk list?\nGiven that numerous environmental contaminants will bioaccumulate in these birds, i.e. mercury, PCBs etc., it would be unlikely that human consumption would be recommended. This would therefore tend to characterize this not as a \"hunting \" plan but rather as a sport shooting, extermination plan. A proper population control management plan would address causative and connectivity issues raised and in the absence of these justifications, we are uncertain of the basis on which the Ministry scientists are supporting this proposal.\nAccording to the included MNR&F background material, the latest information indicates that Great Lakes cormorant populations have stabilized or declined slightly since the 2000s. The justification for the \u201ccontrol measure\u201d provided is based on \u201cconcerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\u201d\nThere is no scientific support presented to establish any connection for the unsubstantiated causative linkages presented here and no reference to acknowledge the historical cormorant populations far exceeding those present today. Scapegoating and esthetics seem to play a major role here too as many people don\u2019t like the rock islands covered in guano.\nBasing a decision on concerns from one economic sector while ignoring evidence based impacts on that same sector and others is not recommended.\nFood web interactions are complex. Anthropogenic interventions will have impacts that are not currently well understood. Many recently developed investigative tools (DNA, bio-tracers, stable isotopes, etc.) are available to document food web structure, but these have not yet been applied to the Great Lakes ecosystems widely enough to understand these complex relationships. There should be research specific to this issue before any extirpations are begun. This would be a perfect application for the tools developed at the University of Guelph and used in our ongoing work to establishing a genetic barcode library of all species in Georgian Bay housed in the International Biology of Life Database project at UofG.\nCormorants are a native species to the Great Lakes. Previous cormorant population growth in the 1950s to 1990s was linked to invasive alewives that have since collapsed due to intense predation, competition from quagga mussels and interaction complexities resulting from climate change impacts on thermal guild, prey and thermal habitat availability and increased upwelling events due to intensification of storm and seiches (Collingsworth, 2017; Stanley, 1971). Alewives are planktivores foraging for copepods and zooplankton. The MNRF has also previously suggested that their stocking programs were instead feeding the Cormorants and looked to curtail the practice.\nThere is no thought indicated in the proposal as to the recent role of invasive Goby in the suggested loss of fish species. Round Goby are abundant and present in large numbers in the Great Lakes (i.e. estimates suggested there were 9.9 billion in the Western Lake Erie basin as of 2002) but recent studies suggest some stabilization in their numbers. Some facts to consider:\n\u2022\tThe round goby is extremely aggressive and is a prolific breeder, often spawning several (up to six) times each season.\n\u2022\tOnce established, it can quickly become the dominant fish species in an area.\n\u2022\tThe round goby prefers rocky, shallow areas but flourishes in a wide variety of habitats.\n\u2022\tThey out compete native species, particularly other bottom-dwelling species like mottled sculpin, logperch, and darters, for food and space, and preys on eggs and fry of other fish. Goby forage on the bottom and are voracious fish egg eaters.\n\u2022\tThe round goby also preys heavily on zebra mussels, which are often high in contaminants, leading to concerns about increased risk of contaminant exposure for sport fish and other round goby predators including cormorants.\nThe published literature shows that cormorants have been eating goby. This evolving ecological balance may in fact be protecting yellow perch and smallmouth bass populations from both cormorant predation and round goby egg foraging.\nFurther, the literature shows that cormorants are eating goby year round, likely due to the multiple times (up to six) per year that goby reproduce versus pre-goby eating patterns where cormorants food sources changed seasonally due to the once per year breeding cycles of our native Great Lakes species. This may again result in protections for other species to be less impacted by both the cormorants and the goby.\nTherefore, it is highly likely that eliminating cormorants will increase invasive round goby numbers and their predation on the eggs of other fish species will have impacts on yellow perch, small mouth bass, whitefish, lake trout, etc. To add to the complexity, goby are also food sources for adult fish of these species.\nIn other words, eliminating either cormorants or goby might result in a detrimental impacts to native species at this time of flux.\nFurther, modifications to the Act allowing the cormorants to spoil means that hunters won\u2019t have to retrieve the carcass of the dead birds:\nThe Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act currently prohibits anyone who kills game wildlife (including game birds), or who possesses game wildlife killed by hunting, from allowing that meat to spoil. Via this posting, the Ministry is also consulting on a proposal to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to add provisions so hunters could allow cormorant to spoil. This proposal would add provisions to the Act, so that persons who lawfully hunt (or possess) cormorants could be exempt from this requirement and would be subject to conditions that require the person to retrieve and dispose of the carcass. Should this proposal proceed, it may be accompanied by regulations to implement the exemption and requirements.\nThis creates a significant potential issue of unretrieved rotting, contaminated bird carcasses washing up on the shores of Georgian Bay adversely impacting residents and cottagers.\nFurther, the allowance of hunting from a boat coupled with the nature of these birds as surface skimming flyers and swimmers raises safety concerns in the highly populated shorelines and heavily trafficked waterways in Georgian Bay.\nIn summary, as near apex predators, cormorants bio-accumulate anything in the water i.e. mercury, PCBs etc. therefore, this would counter indicate human consumption. The \"hunting\" season, therefore, must be being proposed as a management practice to achieve an objective. If that is the case, the management objective would need to be clearly articulated so that this management action could be measured for effectiveness and it should be a part of an overall management strategy. Additionally, prior to this implementation there would need to be an actual linkage proved for cormorants as the causation of the fish declines. We do not see this rational posted with the proposal.\nThese linkages are complex and the Great Lakes ecosystems are in a time of great flux due to invasive mussels too. More research is needed to avoid anticipated detrimental impacts to the sport and native fishery. The food web tracing mentioned above provides an applicable methodology to prove the linkages.\nIn the absence of such a rational for a management plan, establishing a \u201chunting\u201d season would seem premature at best and ill advised given the absence of environmental connectivity impacts data.\nIt seems clear that this is a socio-political approach and not a sound management plan based on ecological factors (Wires, 2006).\nRespectfully,\nDavid Sweetnam\nExecutive Director\nGeorgian Bay Forever\nReferences:\nInvasive Round Goby are being eaten by Cormorants, The Invasive Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in the Diet of Nestling Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario Christopher M.

        "comment":"The proposal for establishing a hunting season for Double-Crested Cormorants during the breeding season and promoting the spoilage of killed birds is unethical and not based in science. Not only will the killing of adult birds around colonies during the breeding season leave chicks to slowly starve to death, but it would also disrupt the breeding of other birds including terns and herons. Left to rot carcasses could create an unpleasant smell for those with cottages on a lake as well as at any beaches dead birds wash up on.\nThe proposed hunting season for Cormorants is nothing more than a scapegoat as documented impacts (to fisheries, island areas) tend to be isolated. It would be narrow minded to think that negative impacts to commercial and sport fish populations are impacted solely by Cormorants alone, especially since they are among many fish eating bird species. It is also well known that fish populations are heavily impacted from pollution, overfishing, poor water quality, invasive species, and destruction of spawning habitat. Heck, even sport fishing pressure can change fish behaviour on lakes. Studies have documented that Cormorant diets include large amounts of non-native invasive fish species in areas where they are plentiful, including Round Goby and Alewives.\nAlthough it may seem like Cormorants are invading into more northern areas, it is important to consider: A. that the population is stabilizing from the last decline and back into extirpated areas; and B. they have been documented breeding as far as Lake of the Woods in Ontario, Canada before persecution and widespread pesticide use significantly dropped their numbers.\nFor the above reasons, the best course of action would be to reduce human impacts to aquatic ecosystems, reduce fishing pressures where needed, and conduct further research on the interaction of Cormorants with their environment.\n",

        "comment":"With due respect the insanity of thinking killing off the cormorants will benefit the fish populations is actually the reverse of what will happen. Cormorants actually increase the natural health of the fish populations and the killing off of cormorants, which will happen if this bill is enacted, will have the same effect as the killing off of wolves did on animals and habitat in the areas this has been attempted. The balance of population and natural health of the fish populations and other species is aided by the cormorants in removing the slower and invasive species of fish not native to the habitats the cormorants are travelling through or living in. Pesticides and herbicides are the more common source for destroying fish populations, island forest habitats and other species. Using an argument as flimsy as aesthetics for killing off the cormorants is no different than saying you want to kill off the ugly toads because they take away from the beauty of other amphibians. In my understanding protecting cormorants is the essential priority of conservation so agreeing to allow them to be killed off in the manner suggested in this legislation is against all ethical conservation efforts. Agreeing to this legislation would show an absence of ethics and humane values of the conservation authority.\n",

Since\n2006 I have undertaken research on double-crested cormorants (hereinafter\ncormorants) and participated in The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority\u2019s\nCormorant Working Group. I have an ongoing long-term monitoring project (10\nyrs) following breeding chronology and productivity cormorants and blackcrowned\nnight-herons. My students and I have also undertaken other cormorantrelated\nresearch projects which fall outside of the monitoring goals. This research\nhas thus far resulted in six peer-reviewed publications specific to cormorants and\ncormorant management (McDonald et al. 2018, Gupta et al. 2017, McRae et al.\n2017, Andrews et al. 2012, Taylor et al. 2012, Taylor and Fraser 2011).\nIntroduction. In this document I respond to the proposal for a cormorant hunt in\nOntario. I structure my comments following the Policy Proposal Notice:\nDescription of the Policy, the proposed hunting regulations, the Purpose of the\nPolicy and Regulatory Impact Statement. Items from the proposal will be italics,\nmy comments will follow in normal text.\nDescription of Policy.\nThere continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing\nindustry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental\nto fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\nI am opposed to this proposal and provide rationale for my position below.\nThis proposal originates from the OMNRF and as such the justifications\nprovided for a cormorant hunt should be science-based. The generic statements\non double-crested cormorants without data to back such statements are a\nproblem. The OMNRF should have a full and detailed rationale to provide\njustification for this proposal, as well as population modelling exercises,\npopulation level targets to support the extreme daily bag numbers being\nproposed, exactly how the cormorant population will be monitored to determine\neffects of a hunt and an evaluation of the negative impacts on non-target\nspecies.\n1. Detrimental to fish populations. The science behind determining whether a\ncormorant population has a negative effect on a particular fish population is\ncomplex (Wires et al. 2003). There are factors that could negatively impact\nthe abundance of a particular fish population: human predation, predatory\nfish (multiple species), predation by other waterbirds (e.g., red-breasted\nmerganser; Bur et al. 2008), competition from other prey which would\ninclude multiple species, abiotic considerations (e.g., water temperature) etc.\nThus, rigorous scientific studies are required for each fish population\nconsumed by cormorants (Wires et al. 2003; see also Dorr et al. 2014 for a\nsummary of cormorant fish predation).\nAs one of the presumed intentions of this proposal is to increase fish\nabundance by reducing cormorant predation, additional factors which\ninfluence fish populations should be considered (see Wires et al. 2003). For\nexample, predicted changes in the distribution and abundance of walleye due\nto climate change (see Van Zuiden et al. 2016); and how changes in lake ice\nwill modify aquatic food webs (Ontario Biodiversity Council 2015) should\nbe considered.\n2. Island habitats. Cormorants nest in high densities (Dorr et al. 2014). Where\nthey nest in trees they will cause the mortality of trees in 10-15 years (e.g.,\nLemmon et al. 1994; Herbert et al. 2014) which is a natural ecological\nprocess. Cormorants do not occupy all available island habitat; they have\nonly occupied 3% of the U.S. Great Lakes islands over a 30-year period\n(Wires and Cuthbert 2010).\nIf particular islands or forest patches that host at-risk species are being\nsignificantly modified by cormorants, local, small scale management such as\ndeterrence and culling (e.g., Middle Island, Point Peele National Park) may\nbe appropriate1. Non-lethal management, deterrence and knocking down\n1 Though in the case of Middle Island, I would argue a cull is not warranted as the Carolinian\nspecies are at-risk because they are at the northern edge of their range (see Brown et al. 1998 for\nconcepts on species range and abundance).\nnests, should be used first to disperse them (McDonald et al. 2018). For\nroosting cormorants, a tethered raptor has successfully displaced birds\n(Quinn et al. 2012).\nAesthetics are presumably an additional factor for this section. People\ndislike the change of a forested island to a non-forested island. Yet,\necological processes involve change. Cormorants are a native species to\nOntario and this is what they do. On a far larger scale, humans are\nsignificantly modifying the landscape in Ontario. For example, in Ontario\nforest cover the mixedwood plains ecoregion is declining (Ontario\nBiodiversity Council 2015); and agriculture is a primary a driver of species\nendangerment in this ecoregion (Kerr and Cihlar 2004).\n3. Other species. In general, competition within and among species is a part of\nevolution and proposing a provincial wide cull because one out-competes\nanother is a disproportionate response and not necessary.\nCormorants nest with other species both in trees and on the ground. Treenesting\ncormorants can nest among great blue herons, black-crowned nightherons,\nand great egrets (see Rush et al. 2015 and references therein).\nCaspian terns and ring-billed and herring gulls can co-occur with groundnesting\ncormorants. This means there are a considerable number of species\nwhich could be disturbed from humans on or near colonies; and hunting\nactivities will be detrimental to all birds nesting nearby (Carney and\nSydeman 1999). Disturbance to non-target birds would presumably violate\nthe Migratory Bird Convention Act.\nI will include comments on the positive impact cormorants have for bald\neagles. Bald eagles were de-listed from the Endangered Species listing in the\nU.S. and their population is increasing in Ontario, though they are still listed\na species of special concern in Canada (Armstrong 2014; Environment and\nClimate Change Canada 2017). Bald eagles on the Atlantic coast are\nnegatively impacting seabird colonies by preying on adults and chicks\n(Hipfner et al. 2012) and farmers\u2019 chickens (Williams 2017). In Minnesota\ncormorant remains were found in 40% of bald eagle nests (Windels et al.\n2016). Ecologists predict a top-down effect of bald eagles on waterbird\npopulations (Hipfner et al. 2012); bald eagles can take adult cormorants as\nwell as juveniles and disrupt nesting colonies which can result in a site\nabandonment (Cairns et al. 1998; Armstrong 2014; Windels et al. 2016,).\nBased on other locations, it is likely that cormorants will provide a\nsignificant source of prey for bald eagles in Ontario in the near future and\nmay assist in achieving the population recovery goal for the eagles identified\nby the OMNRF (Armstrong 2014). Bald eagle predation should be\nincorporated into a model on what may suppress the cormorant population in\nOntario. In addition, the potential economic impact to free-range chicken\nfarmers in reducing an abundant prey (cormorants) for bald eagles should\nalso be under consideration.\nTo respond to these concerns, the Ministry is proposing to create a hunting season\nfor double-crested cormorants in Ontario. This new population management tool\nwould allow persons who hold a small game licence to hunt these birds.\nList the double-crested cormorant as a \u201cGame Bird\u201d. Hunters would be required\nto have an outdoors card and small game licence to hunt double-crested\ncormorants, similar to other species of game birds.\nCreate an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to\nDecember 31 each year across the province. Create an exemption allowing small\ngame licences to be valid for double-crested cormorant hunting in central and\nnorthern Ontario from June 16 to August 31 each year\u2026.. Monitoring of\ncormorants will allow the Ministry to assess the impacts of the hunting season and\nto adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns\nabout population sustainability.\nUnlike ducks and mergansers, cormorants have altricial young where both\nmembers of a pair are required for nest success. The killing of either a male\nor a female during the breeding season will result in their chicks starving to\ndeath even if the other parent is present. How will the sustainability of this\ncull be assessed in this regard? Monitoring of the cormorant population will\nbe done presumably via nest counts, but this approach does not assess\nreproductive success. Where strong rationale and evidence is provided, a\ncontrolled, local cull by OMNRF would avoid this situation. At Point Peele\nNational Park, adult cormorants are shot at the nest site early in the nesting\nseason when no chicks are present, thus permitting a reduction in nest\ndensity but avoiding unnecessary suffering and mortality of young (e.g.,\nDobbie and Kehoe 2012).\nAllow hunting from a stationary motorboat.\nThere is no mention of restricting hunting on or near colonies. Hunting on or\nnear colonies would almost certainly disturb ground-nesting colonies, as\nwell as disturb non-target, co-nesting species. Cormorants will disperse to\nother locations; including new tree sites where available. A study using\nmarked cormorants showed that the management actions of complete nesting\nfailure resulted in the dispersal of adults to sites without management (Duerr\net al. 2007). The dispersing adults established 10 new colonies, and in some\ncases, moved up to 100 km away (Duerr et al. 2007)2. Disturbance to\nnesting sites may also have the indirect effect of increased predation on\nnests, thus lowering productivity even further and causing more dispersal\n(Carney and Sydeman 1999; Duerr et al. 2007).\nThere is, presumably, also a significant risk to recreational boaters given that\nthe proposed hunting season is throughout the summer months. When\nqueried, the Toronto Marine Police did not know where the municipal\nboundary was on Lake Ontario with respect to hunting. They confirmed that\nat a minimum fire arm discharge would not be permitted within the harbor.\nMunicipal boundary lines need delineation for all coastal cities and towns to\nensure public safety.\nThe Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act currently prohibits anyone who kills game\nwildlife (including game birds), or who possesses game wildlife killed by hunting,\nfrom allowing that meat to spoil. Via this posting, the Ministry is also consulting\non a proposal to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to add provisions\nso hunters could allow cormorant to spoil. This proposal would add provisions to\nthe Act, so that persons who lawfully hunt (or possess) cormorants could be\nexempt from this requirement and would be subject to conditions that require the\nperson to retrieve and dispose of the carcass. Should this proposal proceed, it may\nbe accompanied by regulations to implement the exemption and requirements.\n2 While there was a significant banding effort for cormorants in the early 2000s in Ontario and\nsome banded birds remain, there is no effort in re-sighting marked birds before and after the\nhunting would occur, to establish residency and change of residency.\nA controlled, focused management action by the OMNRF is preferred over a\npublic hunt because appropriate steps would be taken to consult the public: it\nwould be a targeted\nlocal action; data (i.e., date, location, the number of birds shot) would be\ncollected; a target of the number of birds to be killed would be articulated;\ndisposal would properly occur; and other data could be gathered from the\nkilled birds (e.g., Coleman et al. 2012).\nA public hunt may disperse cormorants into new areas creating more\nconflicts \u2013 potentially moving ground-nesting birds to new tree or ground\nhabitat and reduce prey for bald eagles.\nA blanket open season on double-crested cormorants is not warranted and its\nimpacts would be difficult to monitor.\nThe change to the Fish and Wildlife Act to permit game wastage is\nunprecedented, a serious change to the Act and completely unethical.\nTo accompany the proposed hunting seasons, the Ministry will implement a\ncormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends. Monitoring\nof cormorants will allow the Ministry to assess the impacts of the hunting season\nand to adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns\nabout population sustainability.\nCormorants are a species native to Ontario (Dorr et al. 2014, McIlwraith\n1894). A significant amount of financial resources was invested in creating a\nhealthier environment which allowed the recovery of this species; their\nabundance is a conservation success story (Weseloh and Collier 1995).\nShould this proposal be approved, specific targets should be articulated for\nthe cormorant population in Ontario. To avoid the species becoming\nendangered again, these targets should be set prior to a hunt and their\npopulations carefully monitored. Annual monitoring data should be released\nto the public on a timely basis for comment.\nThis proposed hunt places other aquatic waterbirds species at risk,\nparticularly ones that nest with cormorants (herons, egrets and gulls and\nterns). Disturbance from hunting on non-target birds should not be\nunderestimated; for example, it can displace birds from foraging areas and\ndisrupt breeding (Masden and Fox 1995; Cairns et al. 1998). Should this\nproposal proceed, how will the impact on other waterbird species be\nmonitored?\nSince the proposal is for all of Ontario, enforcement and monitoring will be\nminimal and that alone should be the basis for a rejection of this proposal.\nLiterature Cited\nAndrews, D., G.S.

        "comment":"Wildlife Section\nPublic Input Coordinator\nMinistry of Natural Resources and Forestry Policy Division, Species Conservation Policy Branch\n300 Water Street\nPeterborough Ontario K9J 8M5\nJanuary 2, 2019\nTo Public Input Coordinator:\nRe: ERO 013-4124: Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\nOn behalf of Zoocheck\u2019s many thousands of members, supporters and constituents across the province, I would like to express our strong opposition to the proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario.\nAccording to the Environmental Registry, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responding to \"concerns expressed by some groups\" about impacts of cormorants on sport fish populations, island and headland forest habitats, other colonial waterbird species and aesthetics. We have many concerns about the MNRF proposal including the fact that no scientific evidence has been provided to substantiate, either wholly or partially, the \u201cconcerns expressed by some groups.\u201d\nWe are especially concerned that no information has been provided about the current cormorant population size in Ontario, the government\u2019s proposed population target number, the reason for the 50 bird daily bag limit, and how hunting can be monitored and controlled given the lack of resource capacity in the MNRF. The proposal also seems to ignore the fact that double-crested cormorants are a native Ontario waterbird species that, because of its biology and behaviour, is conspicuous and vulnerable to harassment and hunting.\nThe proposal also fails entirely to consider the complex interactions of double-crested cormorants with other colonial waterbirds, fish populations, and both aquatic and terrestrial habitats and we are alarmed that there is no analysis whatsoever of the ecological benefits cormorants bring to the habitats in which they live.\nThe entire proposal appears to be rooted in myths, misconceptions, innuendo and false assumptions about double-crested cormorants in Ontario. As such, it is heavy handed, unnecessary and will almost assuredly result in irreparable harm to cormorants in Ontario, to other colonial waterbirds that benefit from the presence of cormorants, to other waterbirds that are similar in appearance to cormorants and to the aquatic and terrestrial environments in which cormorants and other colonial waterbirds live.\nIt should be noted that recent evidence shows that the double-crested cormorant population in Ontario is stable and decreasing in some regions. On the United States side of the border, cormorant numbers have already naturally decreased by 30% or more. There is nothing to suggest that the Ontario situation is different and there is nothing supporting the claim that the number of cormorants currently in the province is excessive.\nShould the proposed hunting season be implemented, given the number of small game hunting licenses issued annually in Ontario, along with the daily bag limit of 50 cormorants per day for the entire season, the provincial limit for cormorants legally able to be killed would be approximately 2.7 billion birds. For a cormorant population that probably numbers between 125,000 \u2013 200,000 birds in the province, most of them existing in highly conspicuous situations, the proposed hunting season could very easily force cormorants back to a position of endangerment or worse.\nFinally, we would like to note our additional concern regarding public safety. The proposed hunting season includes those times of year when recreational open water usage, for boating and other activities, is at its highest. Since hunters targeting cormorants will be allowed to shoot from stationary boats throughout these high-use times, the potential risk to human safety is substantive, as is the possibility of conflict with recreational open water users.\nWe strongly urge you to abandon the proposed double-crested cormorant hunt. It is unethical, unscientific, unnecessary, unsafe and cruel.\nSincerely,\nRob Laidlaw\nCBiol MRSB, Director\n",

        "comment":"I am opposed to the opening of a hunting season on Double-crested Cormorants, especially with the extraordinary bag limits and extended hunting season. It would make it legal for anyone who hates these birds to wipe out a colony at will. This measure, encouraging people to kill native wildlife for no other reason than to be rid of it, will bring hunters into disrepute.\nRight off the top, the Proposal Details on the government site states that Great Lakes populations have \"stabilized or declined.\" There is therefore no pressing environmental reason for this measure. This is no way to deal with what has become, in some places and for some people, a wildlife nuisance problem.\nIn an era when wildlife numbers are in general decline, to have a native species flourishing in Ontario is a good thing. Large flocks of Cormorants and their colonial nesting sites are wildlife spectacles; surely we have room for them in this province, and can share with them the fish they must eat in order to live.\n",

        "comment":"I am opposed to the proposed hunting legislation for the Double-crested Cormorant. While many people do not like cormorants or their colonies, aesthetic preference in no way justifies a hunt. The proposal ignores much of the scientific evidence regarding cormorants, puts protected bird species at risk and dismisses proven, non-lethal methods of managing cormorant populations.\nApart from the impact on cormorants and other bird species, the legislation potentially puts others who share the waterways during the proposed hunting season at risk. Shooting from boats during the summer months: June, July and August, is not compatible with recreational uses of our lakes and rivers.\nReasons Why I am Opposed to the Cormorant Hunting Proposal\n1)\tKilling Cormorants During Breeding Season\n\u2022\tWith a hunting season extending from 15 March to 31 December, the bill would allow hunting precisely during the regular breeding season of cormorants, approximately April - July. This would include the time when cormorants have young in the nest and when those young are totally dependent upon constant care from their parents. The young of adult cormorants, who would be shot, would die from exposure and\/or starvation. No other \"game\" bird is hunted during its breeding season or on its breeding colonies or while tending its nests.\n2)\tRisk to Protected Bird Species\n\u2022\tCormorants seldom nest alone, by themselves, in single species colonies. In Ontario, they almost always nest with one or more of the following groups of colonial water birds: gulls, terns herons, egrets and pelicans. These species are protected by federal migratory bird legislation or provincial legislation. Discharging shotguns at or near cormorant nesting colonies, including shooting at flying birds and shooting adults on their nests \u2013 both in trees and on the ground, would be an enormous disturbance to all of these co-habiting species. It is almost a certainty that these protected species will be accidentally killed or will abandon their nests due to disturbance or associate incidental predation and consequently their young would also die. Thus, shooting cormorants on their nesting colony and causing disturbance (or injury or death) to other nearby or interspersed nesting colonial water birds (which would be inevitable) would be a violation of the Migratory Bird Convention Act. This would put provincially licensed cormorant hunters at risk of legal prosecution on violation of federal migratory bird statutes.\n3)\tPublic hunting is not the appropriate method for Managing Ontario\u2019s Double-crested Cormorant Population\n\u2022\tSince cormorants are virtually inedible, the only possible rationale for a cormorant hunt is to attempt to reduce their populations. The evidence is mixed on whether cormorants have a significant effect on sport fish populations. There is strong evidence that Ontario\u2019s cormorant population has stabilized and has even declined in some areas of Ontario (Lakes Huron and Superior) due to regime shifts in their food supply. There is no need to shoot cormorants to stabilize or reduce their population. Population reduction can be achieved through less intrusive methods than shooting, e.g. egg-oiling.\n4)\tShooting is Not Required to Manage Cormorant Colonies\n\u2022\tIf management is deemed necessary to restrict colony expansion at specific sites and limit further damage to trees, less intrusive\/non-intrusive methods have proven extremely effective and do not harm protected species nesting in, or adjacent to colonies. Methods which do not require killing hatched birds include: human presence during nest site selection and post-breeding dispersal, egg oiling, provision of ground nesting materials and destroying nests prior to egg-laying. Egg oiling is a very effective means to limit cormorant productivity and has already been used to great success on some ground-nesting cormorant colonies on the Great Lakes.\n5)\tDaily Bag Limit is Unenforceable\n\u2022\tThe proposed daily bag limit of 50 birds with no possession limit is essentially unenforceable. At the end of a full week, a determined hunter could legally shoot 350 cormorants. What is less certain is how many would be retrieved due to the location of hunting (some might fall into crotches of tree or tangled vegetation) or because of their weight, or because of shooting on open water (some might be lost underwater, etc.). Unretrieved birds would jeopardize a hunter's claim to have stayed within the daily limit, if confronted by a conservation officer requiring proof.\n6)\tSocial Impacts OFO notes that there is a suite of negative social impacts to the proposed legislation. Among these are:\n\u2022\tLoss of confidence in the Ontario government's support for environmental protection, ecosystem management and conservation principles\n\u2022\tExacerbation of strife and conflict between hunters and non-hunters\n\u2022\tThe mis-conception of this as a \"hunting season\", which it is not. Classifying cormorants as \"game\" under the FWCA does not make this proposed activity hunting. Hunting involves eating what is procured.\n\u2022\tHuman safety (e.g., shooting from boats, shooting with shotguns over open water, shooting near areas where recreation is occurring during the highest water-based recreation time in the calendar year). This invites conflict with the non-hunting recreational public.\n In conclusion, if a cormorant management strategy is required, it should be founded on strong science and should not impact protected species. Apart from any other consideration, the danger to others, who also use the waterways, should be of foremost concern.\n",

        "comment":"To Whom It May Concern:\nPlease do NOT create a hunting season for the double-crested cormorant. Cormorants were put at risk by man in Canada, and these once rare birds, and native birds to Ontario, have made a miraculous comeback. Not many other species have been so fortunate. Cormorants are not \"game\" birds. it is erroneous to use the term. These birds will not be hunted as game, which implies harvesting for food. The proposal is treating these birds as nuisance birds, not game birds. The cormorant has made a significant comeback, but is currently experiencing nature's way of regulating systems through a disease which is already affecting cormorant communities, and they are also now the prey of rare bald eagles, who are just now making a comeback. Let nature regulate the cormorant population. Balance is key.\nThe proposed legislation talks about the requirement to recover the birds that are killed and dispose of them properly, through burial. It is doubtful that any hunters will carry this out. And where exactly should burial of up to 50 birds a day take place?? Or even one? What parcel of land are you inviting hunters to disturb by excavation of bird graves? Are you disturbing other species habitats? No doubt you are. Are you disturbing an archaeological site? Quite possibly. The irresponsibility of this proposed legislation is glaring. And what about the birds that are hunted on the water? These birds tend to raft up (sit in large numbers on the water). How will \"hunters\" recover these birds that they have killed?\nBy permitting hunting of these birds, you put other species of both bird and animals at risk. Cormorants cohabitat environments with others. If there is hunting of the cormorant, you put these other birds\/animals at risk.\nIt seems to me that this legislation is for recreational boaters who have their boats \"detailed\" by the birds. Yes, there are trees at risk.\nBut nature is a great regulator. Please put a stop to this legislation. If necessary, revisit again in five years, but in the meantime, allow nature to do its job.\n",

It also goes against fundamental resource management principles.\nThis will become a \u201cvigilante\u201d action by a small segment of the population opposed to a specific native wildlife species.\nThis is not \u201chunting\u201d per se, rather an \u201cuncontrolled\u201d kill of wildlife. It cannot even be considered a cull, which typically has some form of controls in place.\nOne of the key principles in hunting is to ensure against the spoiling of game. When we begin to make exceptions to this, in legislation, as well as the broader ethic and spirit of \u201csport\u201d hunting, we are descending in our societal values.\nThis proposal is essentially saying that this species is \u201cvalueless\u201d. This goes against principles and ethics of all wildlife having value, even if it is to be used, enjoyed or managed in some way.\nDo we truly understand what we may be putting out of balance by such an act, when it is still not clear just how much sport fish that cormorants actually eat?\nManaging cormorants should be addressed following the precautionary principle and ongoing adaptive management. Once legislation is revised to allow the \u201chunt\u201d of cormorants, how easily can this be adjusted to respond to actual environmental criteria? Other means of managing the problem (culling, oiling or other methods) can be carried out in close concert with monitoring and the cormorant reduction can be adapted accordingly over time.\nUrban areas will require other methods of control as they are in an area where hunting is not permitted.  What about parks which do  not permit this form of management through hunting? What about other parks where hunting is permitted\u2014is there a potential conflict between the values and principles of provincial parks? Will this maintain or restore ecological integrity? Will this enhance heritage appreciation when park visitors get to sit by while others nearby are shooting birds?\nShooting cormorants throughout the summer months will be a potential conflict with other users\u2014boaters, anglers, kayakers, naturalists out enjoying coastal areas. This may lead to safety issues in a season of heavy use and enjoyment by others. Beyond physical safety, there is a grave aesthetic issue if cormorant carcasses (up to 50 x number of hunters per boat, per day) are left along the shoals, islands and shorelines of the Great Lakes and inland waters. Businesses in the tourism sector such as lodges, parks, marinas and tour operators may be affected.\nThis is a short-sighted and mean-spirited approach to wildlife management. It demeans the principles of hunting, the role of governmental control in resource management, and can be seen as a cheap and easy means of dealing with a problem. The image of \u201chunters\u201d working through a colony of nesting birds, shooting birds at various life stages, will be a blight on all society. We are deputizing vigilantes to go about the business of cormorant management as they see fit.\n",

        "comment":"Apart from the impact on cormorants and other bird species, the legislation potentially puts others who share the waterways during the proposed hunting season at risk. Shooting from boats during the summer months: June, July and August, is not compatible with recreational uses of our lakes and rivers.\nReasons Why I Am Opposed to the Cormorant Hunting Proposal\n1. Killing Cormorants During Breeding Season\nWith a hunting season extending from 15 March to 31 December, the bill would allow hunting precisely during the regular breeding season of cormorants, approximately April - July. This would include the time when cormorants have young in the nest and when those young are totally dependent upon constant care from their parents. The young of adult cormorants, who would be shot, would die from exposure and\/or starvation. No other \"game\" bird is hunted during its breeding season or on its breeding colonies or while tending its nests.\n2. Risk to Protected Bird Species\nCormorants seldom nest alone, by themselves, in single species colonies. In Ontario, they almost always nest with one or more of the following groups of colonial water birds: gulls, terns herons, egrets and pelicans. These species are protected by federal migratory bird legislation or provincial legislation.\nDischarging shotguns at or near cormorant nesting colonies, including shooting at flying birds and shooting adults on their nests \u2013 both in trees and on the ground, would be an enormous disturbance to all of these co-habiting species. It is almost a certainty that these protected species will be accidentally killed or will abandon their nests due to disturbance or associate incidental predation and consequently their young would also die. Thus, shooting cormorants on their nesting colony and causing disturbance (or injury or death) to other nearby or interspersed nesting colonial water birds (which would be inevitable) would be a violation of the Migratory Bird Convention Act. This would put provincially licensed cormorant hunters at risk of legal prosecution on violation of federal migratory bird statutes.\n3. Public hunting is not the appropriate method for Managing Ontario\u2019s Double-crested Cormorant Population\nSince cormorants are virtually inedible, the only possible rationale for a cormorant hunt is to attempt to reduce their populations. The evidence is mixed on whether cormorants have a significant effect on sport fish populations.\nThere is strong evidence that Ontario\u2019s cormorant population has stabilized and has even declined in some areas of Ontario (Lakes Huron and Superior) due to regime shifts in their food supply. There is no need to shoot cormorants to stabilize or reduce their population. Population reduction can be achieved through less intrusive methods than shooting, e.g. egg-oiling.\n4. Shooting is Not Required to Manage Cormorant Colonies\nIf management is deemed necessary to restrict colony expansion at specific sites and limit further damage to trees, less intrusive\/non-intrusive methods have proven extremely effective and do not harm protected species nesting in, or adjacent to colonies.\nMethods which do not require killing hatched birds include: human presence during nest site selection and post-breeding dispersal, egg oiling, provision of ground nesting materials and destroying nests prior to egg-laying. Egg oiling is a very effective means to limit cormorant productivity and has already been used to great success on some ground-nesting cormorant colonies on the Great Lakes.\n5. Daily Bag Limit is Unenforceable\nThe proposed daily bag limit of 50 birds with no possession limit is essentially unenforceable. At the end of a full week, a determined hunter could legally shoot 350 cormorants. What is less certain is how many would be retrieved due to the location of hunting (some might fall into crotches of tree or tangled vegetation) or because of their weight, or because of shooting on open water (some might be lost underwater, etc.). Unretrieved birds would jeopardize a hunter's claim to have stayed within the daily limit, if confronted by a conservation officer requiring proof.\n6. Social Impacts\nThere is a suite of negative social impacts to the proposed legislation. Among these are:\n\u2022 Loss of confidence in the Ontario government's support for environmental protection, ecosystem management and conservation principles\n\u2022 Exacerbation of strife and conflict between hunters and non-hunters\n\u2022 The mis-conception of this as a \"hunting season\", which it is not. Classifying cormorants as \"game\" under the FWCA does not make this proposed activity hunting. Hunting involves eating what is procured.\n\u2022 Human safety (e.g., shooting from boats, shooting with shotguns over open water, shooting near areas where recreation is occurring during the highest water-based recreation time in the calendar year). This invites conflict with the non-hunting recreational public.\nIn conclusion, I urge the Ontario Government to withdraw the proposal. If a cormorant management strategy is required, it should be founded on strong science and should not impact protected species. Apart from any other consideration, the danger to others, who also use the waterways, should be of foremost concern.\n",

        "comment":"The Ontario Commercial Fisheries\u2019 Association (OCFA) represents the interests of the commercial fishery, both fishermen and fish processors, on the Great Lakes in Ontario.\nThe double-crested cormorant has undergone a population explosion in Ontario, and its numbers and range continue to expand.  Its ecological impact is profound, and includes heavy predation on fish stocks and the destruction of habitat on which other wildlife depend.  In addition to the serious destruction of vegetation that unchecked populations of cormorants have caused, cormorants have very seriously depleted certain fish stocks in the commercial fishing industry on the Great Lakes.  Cormorants eat approximately 1 lb. of fish each, per day.\nThe OCFA has been concerned about the significant negative impact of uncontrolled populations of cormorants on the commercial fishery and the ecosystem for many years.  We applaud this government\u2019s proposal to take action on controlling damaging cormorant populations.  Our position has not been to seek the extinction of cormorants from Ontario but for the management of cormorants to provide for a sustainable fishery and balanced ecosystem.\nWhile the OCFA recognizes that there is a need to balance competing interests and to continue studying the ecological impacts of cormorants, there is a need to do something now to protect the environment and the livelihood of the commercial fishing industry, particularly in areas where cormorants have devastated wildlife habitat and the fish population.  The overpopulation of cormorants continues to decrease benefits, and increase costs associated with fisheries and terrestrial ecosystem values.  This government\u2019s proposal is a positive move in the right direction.\nThe OCFA also encourages the development of an inclusive comprehensive management plan for cormorant control that would include all possible tools and management strategies to control harmful cormorant populations to protect the fishery and ecosystem.\n",

That this even made it to the proposal stage reeks of there being too strong an influence from people who are trigger-happy gun owners who feel the cormorants are ugly and therefore worthy of nothing but death. Great Blue Herons also nest in colonies and cause damage to the trees they nest in \u2013 but I guess since conventional thought considers them pretty, they weren\u2019t included in this proposal?\nMore appalling that someone is weakly trying to paint it as some kind of 'conservation' method to help fish, rather than the obvious open shooting season that it really is since they'd be leaving lead-riddled carcasses to spoil in water bodies so that other creatures can ingest the lead and continue the needless death cycle. Whoever thinks they\u2019re helping fish with this needs to wake, up, grow up, and work on introducing more legislation to educate and enforce and prevent and control and prohibit things that science has repeatedly proven actually negatively impact our native fish populations and wildlife habitat:\n-\tthe pet\/aquarium fish and horticultural\/landscaping industries (results in non-native invasive fish\/invertebrate\/plant species being released into our waters and terrestrial habitat)\n-\tthe numerous industries and human actions that pollute our waters\n-\toutdoor cats\n-\tnon-native mute swans damaging marsh restoration efforts\n-\tlitter\/garbage\/dumping\n-\tpeople hunting with lead shot and people fishing who use lead weights and leave that and their fishing line behind to cause animals to suffer to death\n-\tvarious nuclear power plants along lake shorelines that local wildlife rehabilitators have to rescue oil-covered birds from (happens each year)\nThere are so many reasons why this proposal to hunt cormorants should not go forward:\nFirstly:\nIT WOULD CAUSE NEEDLESS SUFFERING AND DEATH OF NESTLINGS \u2013 AND ONE OF THE MAIN TENETS OF ETHICAL HUNTING IS TO NOT CAUSE SUFFERING. Shooting Cormorants during the proposed \u2018season\u2019 (from March 15 to December 31) would have them being shot during their breeding and nesting season (April \u2013 July). This means they would have young in the nest that are completely dependent upon their parents. These young, whose parent birds would be shot, would die from exposure and\/or starvation. Tell me, are any other \"game\" bird species hunted or shot during their nesting season, or while at breeding colonies or while tending to their nests? Since you\u2019ll realize the answer is no, examine why that is the case \u2013 and realize that it\u2019s because that would be an unethical, unsportsmanlike, unnecessary, and indefensible and irresponsible action that should never have been done in the first place.\nSecondly:\nIT IS PAINFULLY OBVIOUS IT WILL INEVITABLY RESULT IN SUFFERING AND DEATH TO OTHER PROTECTED BIRD SPECIES. Cormorants don\u2019t always nest in single species colonies; check the science - in Ontario, they almost always nest with other colonial water birds (pelicans - that are threatened in Ontario - plus several other species of herons, egrets, terns, and gulls). These are species protected by federal migratory bird legislation, or provincial legislation. If the government or whatever private body who bothered to waste taxpayers money on tabling this junk proposal even bothered to consider the impacts of discharging shotguns at or near these nesting colonies, including shooting at flying birds and shooting adults on their nests (both in trees and on the ground), then they would have recognized the enormous disturbance it would be to all of these other species sharing the nesting colony with the cormorants. If this proposal goes forward, IT IS A CERTAINTY THAT THERE WILL BE MEMBERS OF THESE PROTECTED SPECIES THAT WILL BE ACCIDENTALLY SHOT AND KILLED, resulting in orphaning other nestlings, causing a needless suffering death from exposure or starvation. Or, it greatly increases the chance not-shot adults of non-cormorant species will abandon their nests because of the disturbance or associated incidental predation, again consequently causing their young to die a needless suffering death from exposure or starvation. ***Therefore, shooting cormorants at their nesting colonies would inevitably cause disturbance, injury or death to other nearby or interspersed nesting colonial water birds \u2013 in direct violation of the Migratory Birds Convention Act. This would put provincially licensed cormorant \u2018hunters\u2019 at risk of legal prosecution on violation of federal migratory bird statutes, and potentially give cause to people to hold the government who created the legislation also liable\/at fault.\nThirdly:\nALLOWING PEOPLE TO FREELY SHOOT CORMORANTS IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE OR RESPONSIBLY EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR MANAGING ONTARIO\u2019S CORMORANT POPULATION, NOR IS IT NECESSARY. Since cormorants are essentially inedible, the only rationale for a cormorant \u2018hunt\u2019 is to attempt to reduce their populations. There is at best mixed evidence on whether cormorants have a *significant* effect on sport fish populations \u2013 there is evidence that actually shows otherwise.  Among them, refer to Somers, Lozer, Kjoss, and Quinn 2003, \u201cThe Invasive Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in the Diet of Nestling Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario\u201d by the Journal of Great Lakes Research, Volume 29, Issue 3, pgs 392-399 \u2013 they found that the two most abundant species in nestling\u2019s stomachs were the non-native and invasive species alewife and round goby, and that \u201cfish species of sport or commercial interest were detected in samples with extremely low frequency (< 0.1%)\u201d. There is strong evidence that Ontario\u2019s cormorant population has stabilized and has even declined in some areas of Ontario (Lakes Huron and Superior) due to regime shifts in their food supply. The proposal\u2019s own details state that \u201cTheir numbers began to increase rapidly from the 1970s to the early 2000s, with the latest information indicating Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly\u201d. Therefore, it's unnecessary to shoot cormorants to stabilize or reduce their population. Population reduction can be achieved through less intrusive and more targeted methods than shooting, such as egg-oiling.\nFourthly:\nIF MANAGEMENT OF CORMORANT COLONIES IS DEEMED NECESSARY TO RESTRICT COLONY EXPANSION AT SPECIFIC SITES AND LIMIT FURTHER DAMAGE TO TREES, SHOOTING IS NOT REQUIRED TO DO SO. Less intrusive\/non-intrusive methods are already proven extremely effective and do not harm other protected species nesting in or adjacent to colonies, plus they do not require killing hatched birds \u2013 such as: human presence during nest site selection and post-breeding dispersal; egg oiling; removing ground nesting materials; and destroying nests prior to egg-laying. Egg oiling is a proven effective means to limit cormorant productivity and has already been successfully used on some ground-nesting cormorant colonies on the Great Lakes. Plus, it has the additional benefit of not leaving an area riddled with lead pellets that are proven to permanently pollute a site by inevitably repeatedly causing deaths by lead poisoning to non-targeted birds, including loons, swans, geese, and ducks.\nFifthly:\nTHERE IS NO WAY TO ENFORCE THE DAILY BAG LIMIT. Besides being comically ludicrous, the proposed daily bag limit of 50 birds with no possession limit is essentially unenforceable. In one week, a determined hunter could legally shoot 350 cormorants, but without the need to retrieve the carcasses, how does the shooter prove they stayed under the limit? Even if the requirement was changed to mandate that they retrieve the carcasses, consider those that may not be retrievable if they fall into the water or into thick vegetation - unretrieved birds jeopardize the shooter\u2019s claim to have stayed within the daily limit, both morally\/ethically, as well as if they are approached by a conservation officer requiring proof.\nSixthly:\nTHE NEGATIVE SOCIETAL IMPACTS FROM THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:\n-\tloss of confidence in the Ontario government\u2019s support for science-based environmental protection, ecosystem management and conservation principles\n-\tanti-hunting sentiment - as a hunter myself, I already experience anti-hunting sentiment; this proposal would exacerbate conflict between hunters and non-hunters, and justifiably so!\n-\tThe mis-conception of this as a \"hunting season\", which it clearly is not. Categorizing cormorants as \"game\" under the FWCA does not mean this proposed activity is \u201chunting\u201d. Hunting involves eating what is procured. I\u2019m a hunter and it makes me not want to call myself one, if I\u2019m to be associated with people who just shoot something inedible and leave it there to rot! Anyone who calls themselves a hunter and participates in that needs to redefine themselves as a bully with a gun, not a hunter.\n-\tHuman safety (e.g., shooting from boats, shooting with shotguns over open water, shooting near areas where recreation is occurring during the highest water-based recreation time in the calendar year). This invites open, repeated conflict with the non-hunting recreational public, which significantly outnumber the hunting recreational public. Apart from any other consideration, the danger to others, who also use the waterways, should be of foremost concern.\n-\tWasting public safety resources - This increased chance of conflict will cause more people to make phone calls to the police to report\/complain about the gunshots than there are people who want to kill cormorants, and where shots are fired, the police have to respond; the police and conservation officers need to be able to spend their time elsewhere.  This proposal would create conditions that will result in wasting police time.\nPlease, I urge the Ontario government to withdraw this proposal and toss it directly in the trash. IF A CORMORANT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS DEEMED NECESSARY IN CERTAIN AREAS, THEN IT SHOULD BE ONE THAT IS ETHICAL, DEFENSIBLY FOUNDED ON STRONG SCIENCE *RATHER THAN CONFIRMATION BIAS*, AND SHOULD NOT IMPACT PROTECTED SPECIES. WHAT AMOUNTS TO A FREE-FOR-ALL KILL-THEM-ALL-AS-THEY-SIT-ON-THEIR-NESTS IS NOT THE ANSWER.\n",

        "comment":"Apart from the impact on cormorants and other bird species, the legislation potentially puts others who share the waterways during the proposed hunting season at risk. Shooting from boats during the summer months: June, July and August, is not compatible with recreational uses of our lakes and rivers.\nReasons Why I Am Opposed to the Cormorant Hunting Proposal\n1. Killing Cormorants During Breeding Season\nWith a hunting season extending from 15 March to 31 December, the bill would allow hunting precisely during the regular breeding season of cormorants, approximately April - July. This would include the time when cormorants have young in the nest and when those young are totally dependent upon constant care from their parents. The young of adult cormorants, who would be shot, would die from exposure and\/or starvation. No other \"game\" bird is hunted during its breeding season or on its breeding colonies or while tending its nests.\n2. Risk to Protected Bird Species\nCormorants seldom nest alone, by themselves, in single species colonies. In Ontario, they almost always nest with one or more of the following groups of colonial water birds: gulls, terns herons, egrets and pelicans. These species are protected by federal migratory bird legislation or provincial legislation.\nDischarging shotguns at or near cormorant nesting colonies, including shooting at flying birds and shooting adults on their nests \u2013 both in trees and on the ground, would be an enormous disturbance to all of these co-habiting species. It is almost a certainty that these protected species will be accidentally killed or will abandon their nests due to disturbance or associate incidental predation and consequently their young would also die. Thus, shooting cormorants on their nesting colony and causing disturbance (or injury or death) to other nearby or interspersed nesting colonial water birds (which would be inevitable) would be a violation of the Migratory Bird Convention Act. This would put provincially licensed cormorant hunters at risk of legal prosecution on violation of federal migratory bird statutes.\n3. Public hunting is not the appropriate method for Managing Ontario\u2019s Double-crested Cormorant Population\nSince cormorants are virtually inedible, the only possible rationale for a cormorant hunt is to attempt to reduce their populations. The evidence is mixed on whether cormorants have a significant effect on sport fish populations.\nThere is strong evidence that Ontario\u2019s cormorant population has stabilized and has even declined in some areas of Ontario (Lakes Huron and Superior) due to regime shifts in their food supply. There is no need to shoot cormorants to stabilize or reduce their population. Population reduction can be achieved through less intrusive methods than shooting, e.g. egg-oiling.\n4. Shooting is Not Required to Manage Cormorant Colonies\nIf management is deemed necessary to restrict colony expansion at specific sites and limit further damage to trees, less intrusive\/non-intrusive methods have proven extremely effective and do not harm protected species nesting in, or adjacent to colonies.\nMethods which do not require killing hatched birds include: human presence during nest site selection and post-breeding dispersal, egg oiling, provision of ground nesting materials and destroying nests prior to egg-laying. Egg oiling is a very effective means to limit cormorant productivity and has already been used to great success on some ground-nesting cormorant colonies on the Great Lakes.\n5. Daily Bag Limit is Unenforceable\nThe proposed daily bag limit of 50 birds with no possession limit is essentially unenforceable. At the end of a full week, a determined hunter could legally shoot 350 cormorants. What is less certain is how many would be retrieved due to the location of hunting (some might fall into crotches of tree or tangled vegetation) or because of their weight, or because of shooting on open water (some might be lost underwater, etc.). Unretrieved birds would jeopardize a hunter's claim to have stayed within the daily limit, if confronted by a conservation officer requiring proof.\n6. Social Impacts\nThere is a suite of negative social impacts to the proposed legislation. Among these are:\n\u2022 Loss of confidence in the Ontario government's support for environmental protection, ecosystem management and conservation principles\n\u2022 Exacerbation of strife and conflict between hunters and non-hunters\n\u2022 The mis-conception of this as a \"hunting season\", which it is not.

This invites conflict with the non-hunting recreational public.\nIn conclusion, I urge the Ontario Government to withdraw the proposal.

        "comment":"The proposal to establish a \"hunting\" season for Double-crested Cormorants raises concerns for me.  I am not averse to well planned, targeted culls by conservation professionals at specific sites (including shooting a set number of adult birds, egg oiling, and nest destruction), where there is a legitimate conservation concern, such as endangering populations of species at risk or rare vegetation communities.  However, to call this a \"hunt\" undermines the meaning of the term.  There is no one that I know of who would actually eat a cormorant.  Thus, this proposal focuses on killing with no other purpose than to reduce the numbers of cormorants, but with no focus on legitimate conservation concerns.  There is no valid evidence that Double-crested Cormorants have a negative impact on game or commercial fish populations.  Declines in some fish populations pre-date the cormorant population increase, and are due to other factors, such as over-fishing.  Cormorants tend to eat small fish, including some invasive aliens such as alewives and gobies. Large bag limits, no possession limits, an extended season, allowing the birds to be wasted, and allowing for the shooting of cormorants from boats, all add up to an unfocused, untargeted, unplanned assault on the Double-crested Cormorant, whether at a colony or not, with no obvious conservation benefit and dubious social benefit. In my opinion, this proposal should be withdrawn. If there are legitimate conservation concerns in specific locations, then a planned, focused, and targeted cull based on scientific evidence could be supported, but not a wholesale, unfocussed, and illegitimate slaughter.\n",

I am an avid field naturalist and have worked in the natural heritage conservation\/environmental education field professionally for 40 years starting with MNR (F) and continuing my career with the CWS, Ontario Conservation Authorities and presently teach college in Ecology and greenspace management.     While I, like many others have witnessed the growth of cormorants throughout Ontario, I cannot agree with the proposed hunt. In all I have read on cormorants, particularly peer-reviewed journal articles, few list predation on \"game fish\" as a serious issue. Most literature lists \"coarse\" or \"forage\" fish as the main food source. I have seen the coastal\/riparian habitat damage done by these birds and solutions to this situation should be pursued, but not through a recreational sport hunt. My concerns are many, but 3 that I worry most about are 1) - the potential danger at worst and in the least, potential disturbance to the non-hunting public who enjoy outdoor recreation throughout the proposed hunting season in areas where the hunting would take place - namely the lakes and wetlands found in southern and central Ontario.  Imagine a family canoeing a lake shore in May, June, July, August or September and encountering hunters in an anchored boat blasting away at a cormorant colony, 2) - which may contain, Great Blue Herons, Black-crowned Night Herons, Great Egrets and even White Pelicans. And (3) what about enforcement? Our Conservation Officers are hard pressed to fulfill tradition enforcement obligations let along taking on patrolling expanded areas and dealing with a potentially new type of \"recreational hunter\" who is hunting not conscientiously but rather taking out their anger and frustration on cormorant colonies for the destruction these hunters perceive the birds are doing.  In conclusion, I encourage the Ontario government to reconsidered this unwarranted cormorant cull and open a greater dialog  with Ontario residents to investigate a better solution. Thank you.\n",

        "comment":"Re: Environmental Registry of Ontario #013-4124 \u2013 Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\nAttn: Public Input Coordinator, Species Conservation Policy Branch\nWe would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment on ERO #013-4124 - Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario.  As an animal welfare organization in Ontario that advocates for all animals, the Guelph Humane Society is strongly opposed to the proposal due to the potential ecological, conservation, and welfare impacts.  Here is a summary of our main concerns:\n1.\tThe proposal does not present any scientific evidence to support the need for reducing cormorant populations.\nAs outlined in the proposal, cormorant populations are stable or potentially decreasing.  This statement is substantiated by data presented in an Environment Canada Great Lakes Fact Sheet on cormorants.  In addition, the proposal goes on to state that there have been concerns \u201cexpressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.  To respond to these concerns, the Ministry is proposing to create a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario.\u201d  This statement suggests that the proposal is not being driven by scientific research or evidence, but merely the conjecture of special interest groups with no scientific basis.\nAs a species that is native to Ontario, it is inappropriate to describe double-crested cormorants as \u201cdetrimental\u201d.  In fact, scientific studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the primary diet for cormorants is largely non-commercial, shallow-water fish, and cormorants likely have little, if any, impact to fish populations harvested commercially.  Furthermore, including concerns about \u201caesthetics\u201d as a factor in the need for implementing a hunting season for cormorants is especially worrisome, as it has no basis in sound conservation management decisions.\nThe Ministry must ensure that changes to policy affecting wildlife is made based on solid scientific evidence.  Public policy on environmental issues cannot be made based on the desire of special interest groups to expand hunting opportunities.  To implement policy changes without scientific basis is contrary to responsible environmental stewardship.\n2.\tThe proposed length of the hunting season and the high daily bag limit.\nThe proposed hunting season of March 15th to December 31st is excessively long and would make cormorants a potential target of hunting activity throughout the time that they spend in Ontario, including during the nesting season.  Sound conservation management strategies generally protect birds during the nesting season, and a failure to do so is indefensible when considering both the conservation and welfare implications.  In addition, there is also a great risk to other bird species that share habitat with double-crested cormorants, such as various species of gulls and herons.  These species could be negatively affected by both hunting activities, as well as carcass retrieval during their nesting season, which could inadvertently create conservation and welfare concerns for these species as well.\nIn addition, the proposal fails to identify any population reduction targets that are meant to be achieved through the implementation of a hunting season.  Instead, the proposal sets a daily bag limit of 50 birds\/day, with no possession limit, over a nine-month period.  This approach creates the potential for a staggering number of birds to be killed within a short time frame.  Without identified population targets, and continued monitoring of cormorant populations, this policy change has the potential to exploit and decimate these birds.\n3.\tThe proposal would lead to the unnecessary suffering of many cormorants, as well as serious ethical and animal welfare implications.\nGiven that this proposal would permit cormorants to be shot from a distance, and permitted to \u201cspoil\u201d (i.e. not be collected), birds could be wounded but not fatally shot and left to suffer.  In addition, given that aesthetics has been mentioned previously as a factor in the proposed hunting season, the sight of injured or deceased birds in recreational areas is certainly not aesthetically pleasing and could be traumatizing to other members of the public that use the area recreationally.\nThe proposal also fails to recognize other management strategies that would reduce the cormorant population and are much preferred from an ethical perspective, such as egg oiling, egg addling, or replacing eggs with false eggs.  Employing culling strategies as a population management tool when less invasive (and more effective) options are available is immoral and should be avoided without exception.\nAnd from a broader conservation management perspective, while hunting, trapping, and capturing animals have been commonplace management strategies for decades, the concept of Compassionate Conservation is a rapidly growing transdisciplinary field that fully considers animal welfare and ethics in conservation, research, policy, and practice.  The following principles are fundamental to Compassionate Conservation*:\n\u2022\tRespecting wild animals for their inherent value, not just as a resource for people\n\u2022\tRecognizing the importance of individual animals within their population as they provide stability for groups\n\u2022\tAvoiding using labels like \u201cpest\u201d because the label reflects attitudes\n\u2022\tUnderstanding that co-existence is often a more effective management option\n*Source: British Columbia SPCA - https:\/\/spca.bc.ca\/ways-to-help\/take-action\/wild-animals\/compassionate-\u2026\nAs such, the indiscriminate killing of cormorants, and the welfare implications that these birds will suffer as a result, is unethical and demonstrates a disturbing lack of compassion and respect.  We urge the Ministry to instead implement a policy that embraces the concepts of Compassionate Conservation, and utilizes the expertise of both conservationists and animal welfare scientists to develop meaningful policy.\nDue to the concerns identified above, the Guelph Humane Society strongly encourages the Ministry to reject the proposal.  Policy decisions must be based on scientific evidence, and must ensure that ecological, ethical, and animal welfare implications are considered and evaluated.\nSincerely,\nGuelph Humane Society\n",

        "comment":"I strongly object to the proposed \u201chunt\u201d of Double-crested Cormorants in the Province of Ontario. I have lived on the edge of Lake Ontario overlooking two major nesting islands for more than three decades. The cormorants returned to this area in 1982, and I have observed the changes their return has wrought to vegetation on the islands near the east end of Lake Ontario. But I have also noticed that the population appears to be stable now, and the damage to vegetation is already done.\nI object for several reasons: the inappropriate science, the proposed season, the large bag limit, the threats to safety, and the certainty of collateral damage.\n1.\tInappropriate science. Since the cormorant population appears to be stable or declining, where is the science to say the cormorant population must be reduced? If research determines that population reduction is imperative, then undertake other techniques to control population such as egg oiling, harassment in the fall, or, worst-case, a controlled cull conducted away from the nesting season. Other jurisdictions have found these techniques effective.\nSome who fish firmly believe that cormorants threaten the game fish population. From what I have read in scientific studies, cormorants eat some game fish, but consume large quantities of Round Goby. This fish species, introduced by accident in the ballast of ships, is a major predator of our native perch population, so cormorants may well help encourage growth in the game fish population through their consumption of Round Goby.\n2.\tPermitting a hunt for more than nine months per year is not sporting. Ontario permits hunting of other game species during the fall and winter, with a few species where hunting is allowed in early spring. During the summer, cormorants congregate for nesting and spend an extended time \u2013 together with other bird species \u2013 laying eggs, tending nests, and tending young on small islands where they are \u201csitting ducks\u201d for shooters operating from boats. See my point for collateral damage for further discussion on this topic. Legal shooting during nesting season is cruel and dangerous.\n3.\tAllowing a bag limit of 50 cormorants per day is frankly ridiculous, and certainly not sporting. How will a shooter ever manage to properly dispose of 50 cormorants? A normal fishing boat cannot even hold 50 carcasses. Where will a shooter manage to dig a big enough pit to bury 50 cormorants per day? No other game species has such an astronomical bag limit.\n4.\tThe threats to safety arise largely from the length of the proposed season. I live in Kingston. Kingston describes itself as the freshwater sailing capital of Canada. I watch boaters, kite surfers, windsurfers, and fishers enjoying Lake Ontario every summer day. Permitting the shooting of cormorants from boats during summer months threatens this recreational enjoyment of the lake.\n5.\tCollateral damage and environmental degradation will result from my three previous points. For example, where the shooter is unable to retrieve the cormorant carcass, it will wash up along the Kingston shoreline as the prevailing winds run across Snake and Salmon islands (major cormorant nesting islands) toward the northern shoreline of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. Shooting cormorants during nesting season will certainly trigger the starvation of remaining untended young, and their carcasses will also wash up along the shoreline and\/or decompose and damage the water quality of Lake Ontario. Our city will suffer.\nMy house looks over Snake and Salmon islands. A number of other species nest on these two small islands \u2013 some considered vulnerable in our province. Any hunt during nesting season where shooters aim toward these small islands crowded by nesting birds will certainly result in collateral kill of gulls, shorebirds, and other species.\nIn summary, I ask that the Ontario government withdraw its proposal for the so-called hunt of Double-crested Cormorants. If solid research shows that the cormorant population needs to be controlled, please adopt proven techniques for population control: egg oiling, harassment, or as a last resort highly selective culling away from nesting season.\nIt is not fair to Ontario residents to do otherwise.\n",

        "comment":"I am totally against the proposed changes for a number of reasons. I have hunted in the past in this province and others in this country. I currently am not a hunter but support regulated hunting as a means of obtaining venison for personal use and in very specific circumstances, for controlled management of populations of wildlife.\nThe changes proposed are in my opinion totally out of control and a shunning of responsibility by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.\n1. The cormorant is a native species that has responded to improvements in the environment and has re-inhabitated the great lakes basin on its own. We drove it away in the 60's and 70's with our use of chemicals and once we realized our error, we began a clean up which improved water quality, removed most toxic chemicals and allowed this species to re establish itself in this province. One of the other factors that allowed it to re-establish itself was the abundance of nearshore food, namely the invasive alewife, a species introduced to the Great Lakes and a species managers wished to control. With the reduction in alewife due to over stocking of chinook salmon, natural production of chinook salmon and other environmental changes, the cormorant needed to switch to another source of food and it found that other native inshore species were rebounding at the same time alewife were declining. Walleye and yellow perch in parts of the Great Lakes were becoming very plentiful and a perfect source of food for this bird, but unfortunately this meant competition with the ultimate predator, us!  Bottom line is we created the history of this bird in the Great Lakes and rather than continue to think we can manipulate the ecosystem better than mother nature, we should be way more cautious than we have been in the past in trying to manage a single species.\n2. Single species management policies do not work. Never have and never will. Once again, bottom line is by trying to deal with this individual species in a very extreme manner, we will be creating a situation for change for which we have no plans or idea of the consequences.\n3. Controlled management does, I concede, have its place in very specific circumstances.  There is nothing specific about this management action.  A 50 bird bag limit with no possession limit, means virtually no control whatsoever. In addition, the suggested change in the F+W Act to allow disposal of these birds is preposterous.  That is no longer hunting and if fact that is not controlled in the least. That is open killing and eradication, plain and simple.  It opens the door to waste killing in all kinds of other situations. Not a precedent one should be setting.\n4.It is the Ministry of Natural Resources responsibility to manage the resources of this province for we the people. IF the MNRF feels there is sufficient evidence to indicate a positive overall ecological response to controlling cormorant populations, then I would support controlled management of those populations. But I do not see any presentation of scientific evidence of a positive ecological response. I do not see any resemblance of \"control\" in this proposal either.  All I see is the MNRF evading a situation and neglecting their responsibilities to act in the interest of ALL Ontarian's.\nI repeat, I am totally against all of the proposed changes put forth in this management action.\n",

        "comment":"On proposed hunting of the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) in Ontario; a scientifically baseless and environmentally naive proposition\nRE: EBR Registration number 013-4124\nExecutive Summary:\nThe Government of Ontario's current proposal to introduce an open hunting season on Double-crested Cormorants from March 15 to December 31 each year has no basis in scientific knowledge and neglects the interests of a wide variety of citizens who interact with wildlife without killing it. This document offers a critique of the government's proposal while citing the relevant scientific knowledge. Often-repeated concerns by some hunters and recreational anglers that cormorants negatively impact fish populations, forest habitat, and other species have been thoroughly qualified or debunked. Notably, lethal management of waterbirds does not address the root causes of fish population instability or decline, and directly contradicts current conservation measures at local, regional, national, and international levels.\nThe government's hunting proposal is gratuitous, irresponsible, and cruel. In particular, the proposal to allow hunters to kill 50 cormorants per day could feasibly permit the eradication of the entire species from the Great Lakes in a single year, assuming below average hunter engagement. More specifically, if only 1 in 100 Ontarian hunters each killed only 50 cormorants over an entire hunting season, this would still be enough to eradicate the species from the Great Lakes entirely. The Double-crested Cormorant is a native species to Ontario whose population has only recently recovered from human persecution and pollution-induced declines. This is no time to be stepping backwards. This species has a right to exist and feed on its native land, and the government has an ethical and legal responsibility to ensure its relative health.\nIntroduction:\nThe Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) is a native species to North America, including Ontario and the Great Lakes. Its existence on the continent predates any human inhabitance by about 1 million years. However, since the time of European colonization and up to present day, the species has often been mercilessly persecuted (Wires 2014).\nThe Ontario government is proposing the creation of an open hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants from March 15 to December 31 each year, with a special classification as \"small game\" in central and northern Ontario from June 16 to August 31 each year, which would allow even more hunters to target these birds during these weeks. The proposal (EBR 013-4124) is being justified as a \"management tool,\" a justification that has no scientific or ethical basis.\nThis document aims to summarize the current state of knowledge about the Double-crested Cormorant in and around the Great Lakes, and to critique the Government of Ontario's hunting proposal on all relevant points.\nCritique of EBR 013-4124:\nIn this section, I quote a piece of the Government of Ontario's proposal and then critique it.\n*** \"Double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations declined significantly in the Great Lakes from the 1950s to the 1970s primarily due to environmental contaminants affecting reproduction. Their numbers began to increase rapidly from the 1970s to the early 2000s, with the latest information indicating Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly.\"\n- This statement is essentially accurate, but it neglects to mention two important points. First, Double-crested Cormorants are a native species to the Great Lakes. Second, before the human-induced contaminant-based declines of the mid-20th Century, they were hunted extensively. Population analyses of current and historical data indicate that cormorant populations were likely much higher than they are now in the Great Lakes before the advent of European settlement (Wires & Cuthbert 2006). The current population rebound is a common pattern for waterbirds in North America (Blight et al. 2015) and Europe (Grandgeorge et al. 2008) following protection from hunting in the early 1900s (North America) and late 1800s (Europe). The species is not overabundant in the region in any historical or scientific sense, in direct contradiction to the common assertions of many anglers and hunters (see a typical example at OFAH 2018).\n*** \"There continues to be concerns expressed by some groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species and aesthetics.\"\n- Dozens of studies over the past three decades have repeatedly shown that cormorants do not have a significant negative impact on commercial fish populations, with most of these studies targeted specifically on the Great Lakes. For example, studies on Lake Ontario indicate that fish most attractive to human fishermen (Lake Trout and Salmon) comprise less than 2% of cormorant diets, and that cormorants consume about 0.5% of critical prey fish, an insignificant number especially when compared against the 13% taken by sport fishermen (Weseloh & Collier 1995). Many other studies that fail to show a meaningful impact of cormorants on open fisheries are discussed in Reed et al. 2003. Moreover, it is well known that cormorant diets consist of mostly nonsport fish species like the invasive Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) (e.g. see Belyea et al. 1999, Reed et al. 2003). Anglers have been shown to impose far more stress on their preferred fish populations than cormorants do on theirs (Ridgway et al. 2012).\nOn the other hand, evidence does exist that cormorants can negatively impact aquaculture systems (a distinct concern from openwater fisheries). However, it has been thoroughly documented that lethal management tools are not effective at solving this problem, and are likely to simply allow other piscivorous species to take the cormorant's place (see Reed et al. 2003 for detailed discussion and many relevant references).\nIf the Government of Ontario is truly concerned with the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem, then it would be wise to actually pay attention to what ecologists have to say on the issue. Management of piscivorous birds does not address the root causes of fish population instability or decline. Moreover, it directly contradicts current conservation measures, locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally. The most important factor affecting fish stock in the Great Lakes is the establishment of more than 150 exotic and invasive species, many of which have direct, documented impacts on the health of Ontario fisheries (e.g. see Belyea et al. 1999, Wires & Cuthbert 2006).\n- It is true that nesting cormorants can drastically affect island forest habitats at a very localized level. Cormorant excrement can quickly kill trees and surrounding plant life, which of course will alter the local ecosystem. However, it must be emphasized that these changes occur at an extremely localized level; i.e. there is no evidence that cormorants have an appreciable effect on forest habitat away from the immediate vicinity of their nesting and communal roosting sites.\nFurthermore, there is no evidence that cormorants are threatening island forest habitat in general. In fact, as a native species to the Great Lakes, the default ecological position would be that cormorants are simply active members of a healthy regional ecosystem. There may exist very particular cases where cormorant control is desirable (e.g. to protect the rare habitat of Middle Sister Island, Hebert et al. 2005), but in these cases population control measures must be justified scientifically and instituted only by trained wildlife professionals. Moreover, nonlethal control measures should always be considered first. Such techniques (e.g. habitat enhancement and social attraction) have been shown to be quite successful at relocating cormorants away from sensitive forest areas (Suzuki et al. 2015). Each potential case is unique; there are no generalizable reasons to justify cormorant control.\n- There is no evidence (outside of occasional anecdotal observations) that cormorants negatively affect other species (Cuthbert et al. 2002). In particular, Cuthbert et al. (2002) reported that cormorants do not negatively influence Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) or Black-crowned Night-heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) populations. While these species often compete (naturally) for limited nesting sites and can have similar \"detrimental\" consequences on forest habitat, cormorants are the only species singled out for persecution under the guise of 'wildlife management.' Cuthbert et al. (2002) explicitly advise that \"cormorant control policy should not be justified by assumption of potential impacts on other waterbird species.\"\nIt is also important to note that some species may actually benefit from cormorant-induced habitat change. Dorr and Fielder (2017) pointed out that American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), an officially 'threatened' species in Ontario, may benefit from these habitat changes as they prefer to nest on remote islands with sparse vegetation.\n- The supposed negative effect on 'aesthetics' that cormorants can have is obviously entirely subjective. Birders are certainly likely to claim that cormorants have many positive aesthetic qualities. Moreover, it is important to once again note that Double-crested Cormorants are a native resident and nesting species of the Great Lakes. Thus, 'aesthetic' considerations seem rather irrelevant.\n*** \"Create an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to December 31 each year across the province.\"\n- Even discounting all the previous information that stands in opposition to cormorant hunting, the Government of Ontario's proposed hunting season is gratuitously long. Crucially, it extends across the entire breeding season of the species, from approximately May to August. Cormorants generally nest only once per year, unless their nest fails early enough in the breeding season and, like most seabirds, they have a very high rate of mate fidelity (e.g. Aebischer et al. 1995). Thus, killing a single adult bird during the breeding season can have the likely consequence of wiping out that bird's offspring for the entire year. If hunting is permitted at or near nesting colonies, this could lead to nest abandonment en masse, condemning any chicks to death by starvation and\/or exposure.\nEthically speaking, such a proposition is unacceptably inhumane and could easily destroy the relative health that this species' population has only recently begun to enjoy.\n*** \"Create an exemption allowing small game licences to be valid for double-crested cormorant hunting in central and northern Ontario from June 16 to August 31 each year.\"\n- This policy would serve to only exacerbate the problems previously described. Such an extension of the cormorant hunt could be particularly deleterious given that this proposed small game license time frame would coincide with fledging at cormorant colonies, the time when young cormorants are at their most vulnerable and are poorest equipped to fend for themselves.\n*** \"Establish a bag limit of 50 cormorants\/day with no possession limit.\"\n- This is an astoundingly short-sighted proposition. The average hunter in Canada will engage in hunting-related activities approximately 44 days of the year (FPTGC, 2014). Supposing hunters kill 50 cormorants a day for only half of these days would mean that each hunter would kill 1100 cormorants per year, on average. The Canadian Nature Survey (FPTGC, 2014) reports that about 709,500 Ontarians participate in hunting activities. If only 1 in every 100 of these hunters participated in this type of kill, this would lead to nearly 8 million dead cormorants in a single year alone, not adjusting for nestling and fledglings mortality due to parental death. The entire Great Lakes population is estimated at only about 250,000 birds, and the entire global population is estimated at about 2 million (Dorr et al. 2014). [Calculation notes: 14,190,000 x 5% = 709,500 number of hunters in Ontario (5% of total Ontario population figure taken from the Canadian Nature Survey - FPTGC, 2014). 1 in 100 hunters: 709,500 x 1% = 7095. This many hunters killing 50 cormorants a day for 22 days in a year: 7095 x 50 x 22 = 7,804,500 cormorants dead.]\nMaking a similar calculation, if only 1 in every 100 Ontarian hunters killed only 50 cormorants per entire hunting season, this would still be enough to eradicate the species from the Great Lakes in a single year. It is obvious that whoever proposed this bag limit has not done the slightest bit of calculation to consider its most rudimentary effects on the cormorant's population. [709,500 hunters in Ontario. 1% of these totals 7095 hunters. This many hunters killing 50 cormorants over the course of an entire hunting season: 7095 x 50 = 354,750 dead cormorants.]\nCormorants would not be difficult to hunt. They are generally quite tolerant of a variety of human disturbances, including motorboats. They nest conspicuously out in the open. Colonies usually consist of a few hundred pairs at most (Wires & Cuthbert 2006). A single hunter could therefore easily eradicate an entire colony of cormorants in less than a week's time. Cormorants are also well-known for their prominent and frequent outstretched wing displays in open locations. These displays are thought to help dry the cormorant's wings, as they lack the usual oils that naturally wick away water that are present in most seabirds. This is thought to be an adaptation to make them more effective divers (Dorr et al. 2014). Unfortunately, it also means that they would make particularly easy targets for even the most inexperienced hunter.\n*** \"Allow hunting from a stationary motorboat.\"\n- Beside for its obvious ethical indefensibility, the Government of Ontario seems to ignore the socio-political consequences of such a policy. One need only to examine the public backlash from similar machine-aided killing programs in other jurisdictions - for example, the extremely controversial and publicly unpopular helicopter-aided wolf hunt in British Columbia - to realize that the public-political optics of such a proposal are not promising.\nFurthermore, allowing hunting from motorboats will mean that no cormorant colony on the Canadian Great Lakes will be safe; all will be accessible to hunters. In Lake Ontario, 16 of 20 major colonies lie in Canadian waters; in Lake Erie, 7 of 11; in Lake Huron, 87 out of 91; in Lake Superior, 37 out of 50. In total, fully 85% of cormorant colonies on the Canadian Great Lakes are situated in Canadian waters (Weseloh et al. 2002). Virtually all will be vulnerable.\n*** \"Via this posting, the Ministry is also consulting on a proposal to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to add provisions so hunters could allow cormorant to spoil. This proposal would add provisions to the Act, so that persons who lawfully hunt (or possess) cormorants could be exempt from this requirement and would be subject to conditions that require the person to retrieve and dispose of the carcass.\"\n- Allowing a free-for-all retrieval and disposal system of cormorant carcasses is sure to have cascading impacts on the surrounding ecosystem. Under this provision, hunters would be able to simply string the carcasses together with fishing wire, weigh them down, and then toss them into the water so as to be out of sight. But these species do not exist in a vacuum and carcasses do not just disappear. 50 cormorant carcasses lying in the open or washed ashore, even for a short time, will assuredly attract all kinds of scavenging animals, including bears, coyotes, small mammals, crows, and gulls. The consequent effects on other local wildlife (including on these scavenging species) are not at all well understood. Regardless, the wanton waste that would be allowed under the current proposal appears totally unjustified and is reminiscent of the shameless wildlife slaughter scenarios of 100 years ago.\n*** \"To accompany the proposed hunting seasons, the Ministry will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends. Monitoring of cormorants will allow the Ministry to assess the impacts of the hunting season and to adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns about population sustainability.\"\n- This part of the proposal gets the scientific best practice completely backwards. Monitoring programs should be in place long before any changes to population management are instituted; otherwise, there is little knowledge available to inform these changes, and even less knowledge of what to expect. This is basic to wildlife management best practice (e.g. see Nisbet 1995, Weseloh & Collier 1995, Weseloh et al. 2002, Reed et al. 2003) and it is inexcusable in the twenty-first century that any government would make a proposal like the one discussed here without substantial knowledge about current population status and trends.\n*** \"The anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral.\"\n- There is no evidence for this incredibly sweeping claim. In fact, the likely consequences outlined in this document indicate the very real possibility of serious negative environmental consequences of this proposal, including the legal sanctioning of the eradication of the species from the Great Lakes. That is not a \"neutral\" outcome. Nor is it a far-fetched one given the absurd parameters of the proposed hunt.\n*** \"The anticipated social consequences are both positive and negative. Those interested in hunting cormorants or who believe cormorants are having detrimental impacts will likely support the proposed changes. Individuals and groups opposing cormorant hunting or hunting during summer months will likely oppose the proposed changes.\"\n- This claim is likely true. But one should add that people who simply enjoy co-existing with, or watching, or studying wildlife will also likely oppose the proposed changes. This is a sizeable demographic. Birding alone is nearly 4 times more popular than hunting in Ontario. In particular, birding is exceptionally popular among older Canadians, aged 55+; data indicate the past-time is 8 times more popular than hunting in this demographic. On average, Ontarian birders spend 139 days per year engaging in birding activities, whereas hunters spend only 44 days per year (on average) engaging in hunting activities (FPTGC 2014). The Government of Ontario cannot responsibly ignore those large demographics that peacefully engage with wildlife.\n*** \"The anticipated economic consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral but depend on levels of hunter participation.\"\n- This claim is unjustified and quite dubious given the relative popularity of birding and wildlife viewing compared to hunting (FPTGC 2014). Birding generates more than half a billion dollars of economic activity annually in Canada, almost twice as much as what hunting of waterfowl or hunting of other game birds generate (FPTGC 2014).\nSince the Government of Ontario claims that all environmental, social, and economic consequences are expected to be neutral, one wonders what possible reason the government could have for even proposing such a drastic change to current policy. The answer seems to be simply that they wish to placate a small group of anglers and hunters, both groups that consume public resources. Anglers and hunters do not have some special claim to wildlife. Cormorants, like all native bird species, are considered public resources, and as such, the entire public has the right to access and enjoy them. That the government has not even considered this element of their ill-conceived proposal is evident from the preceding critiques.\nConcluding Remarks:\nThe Double-crested Cormorant is a beautiful and tenacious native seabird of Ontario and of North America in general. They have survived centuries of hunting, persecution, and poisoning by humans. Now that their population may finally be returning to something resembling what it was before the advent of European settlement (Wires & Cuthbert 2006), it seems the epitome of foolishness to introduce a change in policy that would allow the conservation gains of the past 50+ years to be obliterated in a matter of a year or two. Double-crested Cormorants have a fundamental right to exist and feed on their native lands.

        "comment":"I am not in support of listing the birds as game. Doing so ignores long-term environmental protection and evolution, as these cormorants are a native species to the region, which migrated to the Great Lakes via natural\/climatic conditions. The perceived boom in population is because of the impacts these birds have on the recreational fisheries. This is not cause to kill any species. Dismantling the natural ecosystem of the lakes we call home is detrimental to our larger-scale economy, human well-being, and environmental health. Further, bald eagles are finally becoming established in the Great Lakes once again- after many years of DDT recovery. This an environmental success! There are some finer details about this success that are directly applicable to this case. Bald eagles are top predators. A strong base of prey, of which is mostly fish, is required for bald eagles to thrive. I know many places where cormorants and eagles co-exist, indicating that cormorants are indeed not deteriorating the fishery base of ecosystems is such as strong fashion as suggested by this proposal.\nHistorically, this same idea was completed with common loons in Ontario, our provincial bird. It was thought that fisheries were suffering form natural loon populations, and a cull was completed. Loon populations have suffered ever since, especially combined with cumulative anthropocentric impacts, such as lead poisoning. Fisheries did not change during or after the cull, though loons have.\nScientists have long bellowed that we should not stop natural progressions of biotic and abiotic change. These are important to facilitate future mitigation and adaptation to other environmental stressors, like pollution or warming or cooling. By further directing nature by shooting and killing, we are introducing more contaminates into the environment that pose an even greater risk to the environment. An open season on waterbirds through most of the open-water stage will introduce ammunition to the system. Heavy metals like lead, tungsten, zinc can enter solution and bioaccumulate, harming the entire ecosystem, target and non-target species alike. Ammunition shells and pellets will also accumulate and pose an environmental risk for animal species, pets, and humans alike. If there is open shooting on a lake, I for one am not risking my life for a walk along the shore. Clearly this is unacceptable.\nAn ecosystems approach must be undertaken rather than an economic, both words of which come from the same root- not so disconnected as it seems to be currently. It is lost on me why, in 2019, we are concerned about killing a native species to our region, while ignoring the invasive species we brought here that is realistically, measurably, and rapidly changing the environment and our resources in unnatural ways. Round gobies feed on native fish eggs, carp pollute water bodies, Phragmites are shrinking our wetlands. These three are clear examples of truer, unnatural threats to our native fisheries that will continue to diminish the resources, no matter how much we commit blood-lust on our native species. I am not in support of listing cormorants as game.\n",

They have been working to gain protections for cormorants.\nCormorants have been accused of water pollution, environmental destruction and decimation of fish populations. All of these claims are false.\nDouble-crested Cormorants are native Ontario birds that have repopulated parts of their former range and fulfill a valuable ecological role. Not only do they benefit biodiversity, their presence signals healthy fish populations.  They are an integral component of Ontario\u2019s natural heritage.\nThe Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s proposal under EBR Registry Number 013-4124 sets out one of the most regressive wildlife \u201cmanagement\u201d decisions in Canadian history.  The proposed changes are rooted in an irrational hatred for cormorants that will fuel their persecution and drive them back to the brink of extinction, or worse, in the province.\nThe Government\u2019s proposal would:\n\u2022\tcause unimaginable cruelty by allowing the wholesale, uncontrolled, impossible to monitor, slaughter of cormorants across the province,\n\u2022\tdevastate and very likely eradicate a recovered native wildlife species,\n\u2022\tresult in disturbance, destruction and death of numerous federally protected non-target bird species such as Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets and White Pelicans,\n\u2022\tirreparably damage natural ecosystems,\n\u2022\tencourage the worst form of \u201chunting,\u201d and\n\u2022\tendanger the public by allowing hunters to discharge firearms throughout the spring, summer and fall season when lakes and natural areas are populated by cottagers and tourists.\nOntario government has no recent data on cormorant populations:\nPersecution by humans and pesticide poisoning all but wiped out cormorants in Ontario on two previous occasions, the first through persecution and the second, pesticides.  Since the ban on DDT, their population has rebounded.  They are a recovery success.\nThe Government of Ontario says it is responding to concerns about too many cormorants, depleted fish stocks and environmental damage. But those concerns are anecdotal, complaints from a small, radical segment of the fishing community, and unsubstantiated claims that were debunked long ago.\nThe Ministry states, \u201cTo accompany the proposed hunting seasons, the Ministry will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends.\u201d\nHowever, the Minister has not conducted a Great Lakes cormorant survey since 2007 to 2009, 10 years prior to the current proposal. How can the Minister monitor population status and trends without knowing the current status of the Ontario cormorant population? This glaring lack of data is particularly troubling given that US surveys, conducted between 2005 and 2016 show a 36% decline in the population (F. Cuthbert and L. Wires, Unpublished Data, USFWS).\nThe Minister is proposing a full onslaught against cormorants in Ontario without knowing the status of the population and in the face of very troubling declines in cormorant numbers on the US side of the Great Lakes.\nOntario government has no data to support claims of depleted fish stocks\nThe reality is that cormorants are a natural part of Ontario\u2019s rich biodiversity and an ecologically beneficial species, being major predators of invasive fish species like round gobies and alewives, attracting other waterbirds to their nesting sites, and serving other important functions in the ecosystems they inhabit.\nFor instance, an eighteen year review to the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for Lake Erie Yellow Perch and Walleye, discredits the claims that cormorants are depleting fish stocks.  The TAC for Yellow Perch in Lake Erie increased continuously between 2000 and 2006 (when cormorant populations were peaking) and remained at an average of 15.6 million pounds.  In the same period of time, there were two years, 2000 (7.7 million pounds) and 2006 (9.9 million pounds) where the TAC for Walleye was the highest over the 18 year period and averaged at 4.7 million pounds.\nDespite hosting the largest population of cormorants in North America, recreational fishing is alive and well at Tommy Thompson Park.  As the web site states:\n\u201cThere are many recreational fishing opportunities at Tommy Thompson Park (TTP). Aquatic habitat enhancements have improved conditions for coolwater fish in the Embayments, including successful Northern pike spawning channels. Habitat enhancements scheduled for Embayment D will improve warmwater fish habitat, as they have in the Cell One Wetland.\u201d (tommythompsonpark.ca\/park-species\/fish\/#recreational-fish).\nThe species of fish caught at TTP includes Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, Freshwater Drum, Brown Bullhead, and Lake Trout.\nOntario government is putting cormorants at risk of extinction in Ontario\nCormorants occupy only about 3% of island sites in the Great Lake but because they are conspicuous, nesting on exposed islands and peninsulas, they are particularly vulnerable, being easily targeted and killed. Small congregations could be wiped out in just a few minutes or an hour, while larger colonies could be destroyed in just a few days or a week.  Years of effort and thousands of dollars to recover the species will have been for nothing.\nRadical cormorant-haters have already attacked colonies under cover of night, destroying nests, stomping on chicks and killing adults. Once the proposed changes to the law come into effect, people will feel as though they have free rein to destroy as many cormorants as they want. It wouldn\u2019t take many people very long to wipe out most cormorants in the province, leaving just a tiny remnant of their population in a few protected areas and driving them back to near extinction or even worse in Ontario is a real possibility.\nOntario is putting other colonial waterbirds at risk:\nOther colonial waterbirds including Great Blue Herons (GBH), Black-crowned Night Herons (BCNH), Great Egrets (GE) and others preferentially nest with cormorants.  Over a 10 year observation of the Middle Island waterbird colony, cormorants arrive first, followed by the herons and egrets.\nThey nest in close proximity to each other, increasing the risk of injury and death of non-target birds.  In addition, nest abandonment for both cormorants and non-target birds is also a very real possibility causing suffering and death of the chicks and additional mortality to the 50 cormorants\/hunter\/day.\nThe question then becomes, what will the Ontario government do to ensure that federally protected birds that co-nest with cormorants do not become victims of the hunt?\nOntario government is ignoring successful non-lethal management of cormorants at Tommy Thompson Park:\nThe Toronto and Region Conservation Authority\u2019s report titled, \u201cMANAGEMENT OF DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANTS AT TOMMY THOMPSON PARK 2016 SUMMARY REPORT Restoration & Infrastructure February 2017 describes the area as follows:\n\u201cThe site was designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA) in 2000 due to the globally significant numbers of colonial waterbirds under the general congregatory threshold, and nationally significant numbers of waterfowl during spring and fall migration as well as during winter depending on ice conditions (Wilson & Cheskey, 2001). Six species of colonial waterbirds breed regularly at Tommy Thompson Park (Figure 2). Three species are predominately tree-nesters, Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Great Egret (Ardea alba); and three species are ground-nesters, Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis), Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) and Common Tern (Sterna hirundo). Although there was no nesting from 2004 to 2011, Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) have been nesting on the ground at TTP since 2012.\u201d (tommythompsonpark.ca\/app\/uploads\/2018\/03\/TTPDCCO-Management-Report-2016.pdf)\nThe intent of the management strategy was to manage the TTP cormorant colony in the least invasive, non-lethal manner.  The techniques include inactive nest removal, enhanced ground-nesting, pre-nesting and active deterrents, active nest removal, and post breeding deterrents. The strategy has been spectacularly successful.\nOne of the key management objectives was to limit tree loss throughout the park, a difficult goal given the yearly increase in the cormorant population.  However, the TRCA made a commitment to try to encourage the cormorants to nest on the ground.  In that regard, the management objective was achieved.  By 2016, 76% of the cormorants were nesting on the ground thereby reducing impact on the tree canopy.\nIn addition, the TRCA has taken the opportunity to increase public awareness and appreciation for waterbird colonies and for cormorants in particular.\nConclusions:\nWe strongly urge you to:\n1.\twithdraw this proposal; and\n2.\tconduct an Ontario wide cormorant nest survey given that Ontario has not conducted a survey since 2009 and given that the US cormorant nest count which shows a 36% decline in the number of nests between 2005 and 2016.\nLiz White,    Director, Animal Alliance,\nAmber Ellis, Executive Director, Earthroots\n",

        "comment":"Re: ERO 013-4124: Proposal to establish a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario\nNature Canada strongly opposes the proposed regulatory changes, which would permit the slaughter of Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario. As an organization that prides itself on acting on behalf of wildlife through science-based research and collaboration, with almost a century of experience, we believe that the changes proposed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) are misguided and dangerous to both wildlife and the public. There is no scientific justification for the proposed extreme measures. The establishment of a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants will undoubtedly cause substantial harm to a wildlife species that is native to Ontario, may cause disruptions and adverse effects in ecosystems and other wildlife species, and lacks the proper research and scientific justification to implement.\nAs one of Canada\u2019s oldest national nature conservation charities, Nature Canada\u2019s mission is to protect and conserve wildlife and habitats in Canada by engaging people and advocating on behalf of nature. Since the founding of Nature Canada in 1939, we have been connecting Canadians to nature by instilling appreciation and respect for nature, at the same time encouraging Canadians to act in nature\u2019s defense. Since then, we have grown to become a national organization with over 90,000 members and supporters, with a network of more than 750 naturalist organizations all throughout Canada. Nature Canada has helped to protect over 255,000 km2 of parks and wildlife areas in Canada alone, along with the countless species of wildlife that depend on those environments for their habitat.\nThe Double-crested Cormorant is a native Ontario species, which has been a remarkable success story after the decimation of their populations in 1950\u2019s-1970\u2019s from exposure to toxic contaminants such as DDT and PCBs in their diet of forage fish.  As was the case with other fish-eating species such as Bald Eagle and White Pelican, exposure to these chemicals cause many adverse impacts on their health, including the thinning of eggshells by almost 30%. However, since government ban on DDT and PCBs in the early to mid-1970s, the population of Double-crested Cormorants rebounded and recovered rapidly. Along with the decrease in toxic chemicals, there were other factors as well that may have helped them recover, including a dramatic increase in prey fish such as Alewives in the Great Lakes. MNRF indicates that Cormorant populations are now stable or even declining, suggesting that this proposal to dramatically reduce the species\u2019 population is unwarranted.\nNature Canada is strongly against the proposed hunting regulations for Double-crested Cormorants for the following reasons: lack of scientific justification for the need for the hunting season; potential negative impacts on Double-crested Cormorants and other wildlife species; inhumane treatment of native wildlife, and danger to human life. Following is a brief description of the major points that Nature Canada has against the proposal:\n1.\tLack of scientific research in justifying the need for the hunting season\n\u2022\t In the proposal, the MNRF fails to justify the need for the hunting season with sound scientific\nresearch, as is the norm when implementing such new regulatory changes.\n\u2022\tNot only are there no data on current population levels (births, mortality, breeding pairs) provided in the proposal, the MNRF actually suggests that populations of the Double-crested Cormorants are stable or declining, suggesting that the hunt is unnecessary.\n\u2022\tThere is no scientific evidence indicating that Double-crested Cormorants are responsible for the decrease in commercial fish populations. The MNRF suggests that this proposal is being implemented as a response to concerns expressed by groups (e.g., commercial fishing industry, property owners) who believe that the Cormorants are competitors to sports fish and are detrimental to fish populations. However, a report by Canadian Wildlife Service indicates that Cormorants actually only consume about 0.5% of prey fish while sports fish consume approximately 13.4%.  We believe that, if the issue is controlling predator species that negatively affect commercial fishing, OMNRF has the wrong villain.  Their own introduced Salmon species are a much bigger problem.\n\u2022\tThere are no objectives or goals outlined by the MNRF when it comes to the population numbers of the Double-crested Cormorants.\n2.\tImpacts on Double-crested Cormorants and other wildlife species\n\u2022\tCurrently, the MNRF is proposing a bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no limits on possession, over a period of nine and a half months (291 days). This could mean that one individual hunter alone could potentially shoot and kill up to 14,550 cormorants a year, every year. This extremely unsustainable policy could lead to local\/regional extinctions of Double-crested Cormorants.\n\u2022\tThe proposal allows for hunting at breeding colonies. This could have unseen impacts on the mortality of other colonial water bird species such as Black-crowned Night Heron, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Ring-billed Gull, Common Tern and other species that often nest in or around Double-crested Cormorants colonies. While hunting on breeding colonies, hunters are likely to also disturb other wildlife species as well, as not only colonial water birds nest near cormorant colonies.\n\u2022\tEven though the MNRF states that they will ban toxic shot, there is no way to ensure that all hunters will abide by this law. Hunting from a motorboat (allowed in the proposal) can increase the level of toxic chemicals in lakes and rivers as well.\n3.\tInhumane treatment of native wildlife\n\u2022\tIn the proposal, MNRF is suggesting to amend the current Fish & Wildlife Conservation Act to allow hunters to let their hunted cormorant meat to spoil. This is not the norm when it comes to hunted game, as it is currently illegal for hunters to let hunted carcasses spoil. This suggests that this proposal is not intended for sport hunting, but instead is a badly disguised excuse for large-scale slaughter of the native Double-crested Cormorants.\n\u2022\tOnce the meat is spoiled and disposed of by the hunters, it would be virtually impossible to track how many cormorants have been hunted in one given season, thus negating the impact and usefulness of the monitoring program proposed by the MNRF.\n\u2022\tMNRF is also allowing Double-crested Cormorants to be hunted during their breeding season. Undoubtedly, some of the individual birds that will be hunted may have young chicks already. This will lead to the death of young chicks by starvation if their parents are hunted, as well as increased problems with the management of the cormorant populations.\n4.  Danger to humans\n\u2022\tCormorant colonies are often located not far from human settlements and areas where humans are active.  Such areas include Tommy Thompson Park in Toronto, Presqu\u2019ile Provincial Park near Brighton, the Point Pelee National Park vicinity, Chantry Island near Southampton, and along the Ottawa River. These areas attract people pursuing a range of other recreational activities in all seasons, but particularly in summer. It seems extremely dangerous and misguided for the MNRF to permit hunting of Cormorants in places where potentially significant numbers of people are present, and thus at risk.\n\u2022\tThe large scale of the hunt and the allowance to discard carcasses and let meat spoil renders the hunt unenforceable by Conservation officers, while also creating a public health risk to humans.\nFor the reasons identified above, Nature Canada opposes the regulatory changes allowing the slaughter of the Double-crested Cormorant, and therefore urges the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to abandon the proposal.\nTed Cheskey\nNaturalist Director\nNature Canada\n",

        "comment":"I have serious concerns about the way this bill is set up. I have no love for Cormorants but there are better, more effective ways of control (oiling eggs for three consecutive seasons for one) than giving hunters a virtual dawn to dusk hunt, over open water from open motor vessels, with shotguns and a very questionable 50 daily bag limit WITH NO REQUIREMENT TO TAKE THE CARCASS for sanitary disposal. These are water birds, they eat in the water they hunt their prey in the water and they nest by the water. The water I am associated with most is the Rideau system and from ice out to ice in, there are non hunters travelling on the lakes and canal portions in boats. many with families, what will be the Provincial response when some of the pellets from a hunter strike the boats, or worse, the occupants? You do not have enough wardens now to do normal enforcement work, where are the extra wardens to police this shooting gallery that the Province now legitimizes and makes itself liable for the actions of the hunter's. I will be, I promise, one of the witnesses to any subsequent action against both the offending hunter (if he or she can even be found) and the Province for setting up and sanctioning this dangerous application of firearms to cull a bird population. The Province is assuming a liability contrary to the safety of the public.\nOn the Rideau System, 2018 marked the first year for the leBoat rentals and it promises to be a lucrative economy boost with European tourists. What happens when a visitor reports taking cover in the boat as shot gun pellets strike the boat and, hopefully fail to penetrate the hull to strike adults and children?  Imagine the court case on that one, the Province complicit with dangerous pursuits. Even worse, the Province had other safer alternatives but chose 50 daily bag limits, no requirement to clean up the carcasses. Strong odds on hunters hitting Osprey and small Eagles or Hawks. A Loon with its neck stretched (as they like to do), looks like a cormorant!\nEverything about this suggests a script written by the Ont. Federation of Anglers and Hunters and copied without change or safety concerns, by the Ministry into a Bill for the legislature. Are you really that desperate that you will circumvent basic hunter safety and prevention of injury, or death, to other waterway users?  This is a new low in pandering to a small percentage of the voters for a questionable gain. The OFAH will not stand by you, the Province will wear to dirt from this decision.\n",

They have been working to gain protections for cormorants.\nCormorants have been accused of water pollution, environmental destruction and decimation of fish populations. All of these claims are false.\nDouble-crested Cormorants are native Ontario birds that have repopulated parts of their former range and fulfill a valuable ecological role. Not only do they benefit biodiversity, their presence signals healthy fish populations.  They are an integral component of Ontario\u2019s natural heritage.\nThe Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s proposal under EBR Registry Number 013-4124 sets out one of the most regressive wildlife \u201cmanagement\u201d decisions in Canadian history.  The proposed changes are rooted in an irrational hatred for cormorants that will fuel their persecution and drive them back to the brink of extinction, or worse, in the province.\nThe Government\u2019s proposal would:\n\u2022\tcause unimaginable cruelty by allowing the wholesale, uncontrolled, impossible to monitor, slaughter of cormorants across the province,\n\u2022\tdevastate and very likely eradicate a recovered native wildlife species,\n\u2022\tresult in disturbance, destruction and death of numerous federally protected non-target bird species such as Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets and White Pelicans,\n\u2022\tirreparably damage natural ecosystems,\n\u2022\tencourage the worst form of \u201chunting,\u201d and\n\u2022\tendanger the public by allowing hunters to discharge firearms throughout the spring, summer and fall season when lakes and natural areas are populated by cottagers and tourists.\nOntario government has no recent data on cormorant populations:\nPersecution by humans and pesticide poisoning all but wiped out cormorants in Ontario on two previous occasions, the first through persecution and the second, pesticides.  Since the ban on DDT, their population has rebounded.  They are a recovery success.\nThe Government of Ontario says it is responding to concerns about too many cormorants, depleted fish stocks and environmental damage. But those concerns are anecdotal, complaints from a small, radical segment of the fishing community, and unsubstantiated claims that were debunked long ago.\nThe Ministry states, \u201cTo accompany the proposed hunting seasons, the Ministry will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends.\u201d\nHowever, the Minister has not conducted a Great Lakes cormorant survey since 2007 to 2009, 10 years prior to the current proposal. How can the Minister monitor population status and trends without knowing the current status of the Ontario cormorant population? This glaring lack of data is particularly troubling given that US surveys, conducted between 2005 and 2016 show a 36% decline in the population (F. Cuthbert and L. Wires, Unpublished Data, USFWS).\nThe Minister is proposing a full onslaught against cormorants in Ontario without knowing the status of the population and in the face of very troubling declines in cormorant numbers on the US side of the Great Lakes.\nOntario government has no data to support claims of depleted fish stocks\nThe reality is that cormorants are a natural part of Ontario\u2019s rich biodiversity and an ecologically beneficial species, being major predators of invasive fish species like round gobies and alewives, attracting other waterbirds to their nesting sites, and serving other important functions in the ecosystems they inhabit.\nFor instance, an eighteen year review to the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for Lake Erie Yellow Perch and Walleye, discredits the claims that cormorants are depleting fish stocks.  The TAC for Yellow Perch in Lake Erie increased continuously between 2000 and 2006 (when cormorant populations were peaking) and remained at an average of 15.6 million pounds.  In the same period of time, there were two years, 2000 (7.7 million pounds) and 2006 (9.9 million pounds) where the TAC for Walleye was the highest over the 18 year period and averaged at 4.7 million pounds.\nDespite hosting the largest population of cormorants in North America, recreational fishing is alive and well at Tommy Thompson Park.  As the web site states:\n\u201cThere are many recreational fishing opportunities at Tommy Thompson Park (TTP). Aquatic habitat enhancements have improved conditions for coolwater fish in the Embayments, including successful Northern pike spawning channels. Habitat enhancements scheduled for Embayment D will improve warmwater fish habitat, as they have in the Cell One Wetland.\u201d (tommythompsonpark.ca\/park-species\/fish\/#recreational-fish).\nThe species of fish caught at TTP includes Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, Freshwater Drum, Brown Bullhead, and Lake Trout.\nOntario government is putting cormorants at risk of extinction in Ontario\nCormorants occupy only about 3% of island sites in the Great Lake but because they are conspicuous, nesting on exposed islands and peninsulas, they are particularly vulnerable, being easily targeted and killed. Small congregations could be wiped out in just a few minutes or an hour, while larger colonies could be destroyed in just a few days or a week.  Years of effort and thousands of dollars to recover the species will have been for nothing.\nRadical cormorant-haters have already attacked colonies under cover of night, destroying nests, stomping on chicks and killing adults. Once the proposed changes to the law come into effect, people will feel as though they have free rein to destroy as many cormorants as they want. It wouldn\u2019t take many people very long to wipe out most cormorants in the province, leaving just a tiny remnant of their population in a few protected areas and driving them back to near extinction or even worse in Ontario is a real possibility.\nOntario is putting other colonial waterbirds at risk:\nOther colonial waterbirds including Great Blue Herons (GBH), Black-crowned Night Herons (BCNH), Great Egrets (GE) and others preferentially nest with cormorants.  Over a 10 year observation of the Middle Island waterbird colony, cormorants arrive first, followed by the herons and egrets.\nThey nest in close proximity to each other, increasing the risk of injury and death of non-target birds.  In addition, nest abandonment for both cormorants and non-target birds is also a very real possibility causing suffering and death of the chicks and additional mortality to the 50 cormorants\/hunter\/day.\nThe question then becomes, what will the Ontario government do to ensure that federally protected birds that co-nest with cormorants do not become victims of the hunt?\nOntario government is ignoring successful non-lethal management of cormorants at Tommy Thompson Park:\nThe Toronto and Region Conservation Authority\u2019s report titled, \u201cMANAGEMENT OF DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANTS AT TOMMY THOMPSON PARK 2016 SUMMARY REPORT Restoration & Infrastructure February 2017 describes the area as follows:\n\u201cThe site was designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA) in 2000 due to the globally significant numbers of colonial waterbirds under the general congregatory threshold, and nationally significant numbers of waterfowl during spring and fall migration as well as during winter depending on ice conditions (Wilson & Cheskey, 2001). Six species of colonial waterbirds breed regularly at Tommy Thompson Park (Figure 2). Three species are predominately tree-nesters, Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Great Egret (Ardea alba); and three species are ground-nesters, Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis), Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) and Common Tern (Sterna hirundo). Although there was no nesting from 2004 to 2011, Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) have been nesting on the ground at TTP since 2012.\u201d (tommythompsonpark.ca\/app\/uploads\/2018\/03\/TTPDCCO-Management-Report-2016.pdf)\nThe intent of the management strategy was to manage the TTP cormorant colony in the least invasive, non-lethal manner.  The techniques include inactive nest removal, enhanced ground-nesting, pre-nesting and active deterrents, active nest removal, and post breeding deterrents. The strategy has been spectacularly successful.\nOne of the key management objectives was to limit tree loss throughout the park, a difficult goal given the yearly increase in the cormorant population.  However, the TRCA made a commitment to try to encourage the cormorants to nest on the ground.  In that regard, the management objective was achieved.  By 2016, 76% of the cormorants were nesting on the ground thereby reducing impact on the tree canopy.\nIn addition, the TRCA has taken the opportunity to increase public awareness and appreciation for waterbird colonies and for cormorants in particular.\nConclusions:\nWe strongly urge you to:\n1.\twithdraw this proposal; and\n2.\tconduct an Ontario wide cormorant nest survey given that Ontario has not conducted a survey since 2009 and given that the US cormorant nest count which shows a 36% decline in the number of nests between 2005 and 2016.\n",

        "comment":"Reasons Why I Am Opposed to the Cormorant Hunting Proposal\nWith a hunting season extending from 15 March to 31 December, the bill would allow hunting precisely during the regular breeding season of cormorants, approximately April - July. This would include the time when cormorants have young in the nest and when those young are totally dependent upon constant care from their parents. The young of adult cormorants, who would be shot, would die from exposure and\/or starvation. No other \"game\" bird is hunted during its breeding season or on its breeding colonies or while tending its nests.\nCormorants seldom nest alone, by themselves, in single species colonies. In Ontario, they almost always nest with one or more of the following groups of colonial water birds: gulls, terns herons, egrets and pelicans. These species are protected by federal migratory bird legislation or provincial legislation.\nDischarging shotguns at or near cormorant nesting colonies, including shooting at flying birds and shooting adults on their nests \u2013 both in trees and on the ground, would be an enormous disturbance to all of these co-habiting species. It is almost a certainty that these protected species will be accidentally killed or will abandon their nests due to disturbance or associate incidental predation and consequently their young would also die. Thus, shooting cormorants on their nesting colony and causing disturbance (or injury or death) to other nearby or interspersed nesting colonial water birds (which would be inevitable) would be a violation of the Migratory Bird Convention Act. This would put provincially licensed cormorant hunters at risk of legal prosecution on violation of federal migratory bird statutes.\nIf management is deemed necessary to restrict colony expansion at specific sites and limit further damage to trees, less intrusive\/non-intrusive methods have proven extremely effective and do not harm protected species nesting in, or adjacent to colonies.\nMethods which do not require killing hatched birds include: human presence during nest site selection and post-breeding dispersal, egg oiling, provision of ground nesting materials and destroying nests prior to egg-laying. Egg oiling is a very effective means to limit cormorant productivity and has already been used to great success on some ground-nesting cormorant colonies on the Great Lakes.\nThe proposed daily bag limit of 50 birds with no possession limit is essentially unenforceable. At the end of a full week, a determined hunter could legally shoot 350 cormorants. What is less certain is how many would be retrieved due to the location of hunting (some might fall into crotches of tree or tangled vegetation) or because of their weight, or because of shooting on open water (some might be lost underwater, etc.). Unretrieved birds would jeopardize a hunter's claim to have stayed within the daily limit, if confronted by a conservation officer requiring proof.\nIn conclusion, I urge the Ontario Government to withdraw the proposal. If a cormorant management strategy is required, it should be founded on strong science and should not impact protected species. Apart from any other consideration, the danger to others, who also use the waterways, should be of foremost concern.\n",

It is not an edible game bird, and hunters will only see this as a target practice.\nAllowing one hunter to shoot 50 birds is a ridiculous limit.  These are communal birds and found in large groups, so a shotgun blast would kill many birds. This would not be a sport but a massacre.\nFurther, I don't believe all hunters will be scrupulous about removing and disposing of the carcasses safely, as there is no benefit to be gained from this extra effort.\nThe research I have done does not support the idea that these birds are competing with fishermen for game fish.  \"Cormorants feed opportunistically on fishes that are readily available and often congregate where these fishes are easily caught. In natural environments, fish species of direct interest to recreational or commercial fishermen typically do not make up a large part of the cormorants' diet (see Diet section and Appendix 1)\"  https:\/\/birdsna.org\/Species-Account\/bna\/species\/doccor\/introduction\nI also believe that releasing this proposal for comment over the Christmas holiday season is an abuse of fair process.\n",

        "comment":"IFAW, with approximately 22,000 Ontario supporters, thanks you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed hunting of the Double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) in Ontario, EBR 013-4124.\nFounded in Canada in 1969, IFAW is a global non\u2010profit organization that protects animals and the places they call home. We believe that individual animals matter to species conservation, and our work seeks to link the value of individual animals to the health of the population and ecosystem at large.  IFAW believes that in order to be effective, conservation efforts must include, and have the support of, local communities.\nWe also believe that wildlife management should be based on the best available science. Where lethal management of wild animals is being considered, it should be justified by scientific evidence and conducted with rigorous monitoring and evaluation to ensure the desired objectives are being achieved.\nThe proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants (DCCO) in Ontario is concerning for a number of reasons.  This proposal appears to be a cull: a targeted reduction in the cormorant population in response to \u201cconcerns expressed that cormorants have been detrimental to fish populations, island forest habitats, other species, and aesthetics.\u201d Where culls of wild animals are being considered, they should be justified by science. A cull of DCCO is not supported by any available scientific evidence.\nSecond, the proposal appears to be an attempt to disguise an unscientific cull as a legitimate hunting activity. The proposed changes to classify the DCCO as a game bird and to then amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to allow game meat to spoil undermine the very basis of ethical hunting principles and the North American model of wildlife conservation . As such, the proposed changes will almost certainly have negative impacts on the public perception of hunters in Ontario.\nThird, the proposed bag limits are excessive by any calculations and, if achieved, would vastly exceed the estimated population size of DCCO in the entire world. The calculations and scientific basis for these limits should be made transparent so that Ontarians can be assured that they have been thoughtfully developed and will not affect sustainability, as the proposal claims.\nWe elaborate on our concerns below:\n1.\tLack of scientific basis for a cull of double crested cormorants.\nThe double crested cormorant is a native species to Ontario and the Great Lakes, whose population has only recently recovered from declines caused by DDT between 1950-1970.  Despite this increase, there is no indication that DCCO have exceeded historical population size or their carrying capacity. The EBR proposal states that the latest information suggests the population has stabilized or declined slightly. There is nothing to suggest the species is \u201coverabundant\u201d in a historical or scientific sense.\nConcerns that DCCO are negatively impacting fish stocks are not supported by science. According to the Canadian Wildlife Federation, fish species targeted by anglers such as trout and salmon comprise less than 2% of DCCO diet.  Nor does there appear to be competition between fishermen and cormorants for the prey of commercially important species, with cormorants consuming only 0.5% of critical  prey fish compared to 13% taken by sport fishermen. There is no indication that the fish consumed by cormorants has a negative impact on what is available to commercial and recreational fishers. It has also been noted that cormorants consume much greater quantities of invasive species such as the alewife and round goby.\nLethal management of piscivorous birds does not address root causes of fish stock fluctuation or decline, and is out of step with modern wildlife management and conservation practices.  Nonlethal mitigation methods should be attempted first, and lethal control of wildlife, when adopted, should be justified scientifically and instituted by trained wildlife professionals.\nThere is also no evidence to suggest that cormorants are threatening island forest habitats, nor having detrimental consequences for any other waterbird species.\nThere is no evidence that DCCO are \u201coverabundant\u201d or a threat to ecological integrity or biodiversity.  According to the proposal, the DCCO population has stabilized on its own and may already be at a point of zero population growth and population decline.  This necessitates further examination of  any proposal to cull, as lethal removals may, in fact, put the DCCO population into a state of more rapid growth, and will completely fail to address the concerns it intends to address.\n2.\tCulls should not be disguised as hunting.  The government of Ontario must be transparent and acknowledge the lack of scientific basis for any proposed cull of wildlife.  Culls based on subjective criteria such as \u201caesthetics\u201d, or political convenience, have no place in modern, science-based wildlife management.  Such culls should also not be disguised as legitimate hunting activity, as this is misleading and further confuses the public.\nListing a wholly inedible, migratory species as a \u201cgame bird\u201d in attempt to disguise an unscientific cull as a hunting activity is dishonest and misleading. To then change the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to permit the spoilage and waste of the killed \u201cgame\u201d is alarming from a conservation perspective, and does a great disservice to the ethical hunting community in Ontario. Ethical hunting aims to achieve full utilization of any animals killed. Allowing game meat to spoil is in direct contravention of the core principles of ethical hunting and the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation. Further, the prospect of piles of dead cormorants left to rot will have impacts on other wildlife species, not to mention highly negative social consequences and impacts on \u201caesthetics\u201d.\nConflating a politically motivated cull of wildlife with traditional hunting as for food and sustenance will confuse the general public and will likely generate unnecessary antipathy and anger towards hunting in general.\n3.\tThe proposed bag limits and other measures are arbitrary and unacceptable\nThe proposed bag limit of 50 cormorants per day demands additional scrutiny. If only 1% of Ontario hunters killed only 50 cormorants over the entire season, this would result in over 350,000 cormorants killed \u2013 more than the entire Great Lakes population. If the bag limit of 50 birds per day were actually achieved, over 8 million birds \u2013 at the most conservative estimate-would be killed. This is four times the estimated global population.\nDespite this incredible calculation, the proposal goes on to state that \u201canticipated levels of harvest aren\u2019t expected to affect sustainability\u201d. Clearly the proposed bag limit requires review and modification.\nAllowing an open hunting season from March to December across the entire breeding season of the species could be particularly detrimental and result in far more birds dying than those killed by hunters. Hunting permitted at nesting colonies could lead to disturbance and nest abandonment, resulting in chicks dying from starvation or exposure. Such a proposal is unacceptably inhumane.\nConclusion:\nThe proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorant in Ontario appears to be a scientifically unjustified cull intended to address concerns about perceived competition for fish and subjective concerns such as aesthetics.  This proposal is being portrayed as a \u201chunt\u201d, but the proposed amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act  allowing meat to be wasted destroys one of the core tenets of wildlife conservation and ethical hunting.  And while little scientific information is provided in the proposal, the incredulity of the suggested bag limits make it clear that more research on DCCO and the ecological impacts of this proposal must be conducted before proceeding with any further management action.\nDouble-crested cormorants are an important component of a healthy and functioning Great Lakes ecosystem.  We appreciate that the government of Ontario must consider conflicting values for wildlife held by voters in this province,  but lethal removal in response to ecologically unfounded complaints of perceived competition, or worse- \u201caesthetics\u201d - is an archaic policy response that has no place in modern wildlife management.  Thank you.\n",

        "comment":"As a professional wildlife biologist specializing in waterbirds, I am surprised that this proposal has not been more well-researched and the goals more clearly defined. Lethal management of cormorants on Great Lakes colonies has been successful but the impacts on co-nesting species need to be taken into account (Wyman et al. 2018). There is also no clear evidence that cormorants impact fisheries to any significant degree (Dor et al. 2014). If the goals are to reduce certain nuisance colonies, why not focus on methods that are more locally targeted and less disruptive to other species (e.g. egg oiling)? It is unclear what the government is trying to achieve given that hunters are unlikely to want to hunt cormorants to the levels and in the most appropriate and less disruptive places to make a difference to the overall population. I would have liked to see more background on how the ministry came up with the bag limit and season duration, as well as studies to poll hunters to get an idea of what the intensity of the harvest will be and whether it will meet their goals (which should also be defined). Finally, I would like to see how they are proposing to monitor the species status and trend, especially given a lack of baseline data.\nDorr BS, Hatch JJ, Weseloh DV. 2014.

We do not support the call to establish a hunting season.  Our views are based partly on our location in Hamilton where we are active with efforts to remediate the Hamilton Harbour watershed.\nWe have also learned more about the current situation with cormorants in Ontario from Dr. James Quinn, a professor of Biology at McMaster University who studies birds \u2013 including cormorants.  Dr. Quinn has shared three central concerns with us to support his position that this policy is problematic:\n1. Allowing hunting from motorboats during breeding season will disturb other colonial nesting birds that are protected under the Migratory Birds Act.\n2. Cormorant populations in Ontario have stabilized and complaints from fishers that they are depleting fish population are unsubstantiated.\n3. By feeding on round gobies, a recent invasive exotic to the Great Lakes, cormorants are helping to reduce negative impacts on some native species in the Great Lakes.\nFor these reasons, we do not support the proposal to allow cormorants to be designated a game bird so that hunters can shoot and bag up to fifty cormorants per day.\nYours truly,\nLynda M.

There are no targets expressed, and no apparent science.  The  rationale, such as it is, is three lines long and avoids any reference to data.\n1. Double-crested Cormorants are top predators.  Populations have partially recovered from past human-caused impacts, and their rebound has been fueled in large part by human-caused mismanagement of the Great Lakes fishery.  The most recent population information shows that populations of these birds are stable or slightly declining on the Great Lakes.  It is also significant to note that populations are not believed to be what they were at the point of European contact, in fact not to have returned to historical levels.\nCormorants eat a variety of fish species, including some fish that are valued by sport fishermen (documented in many studies, including DeBruyne et al. 2013).  As declines of certain fish species have coincided with the rise in Cormorant numbers, many people have leapt to the conclusion that the cormorants are the reason for the collapse.\nCormorant numbers have recovered to the extent that management programs have been enacted to control their numbers in several jurisdictions, so we actually have some case studies to inform us.  The Department of Environmental Conservation in New York implemented a control program that succeeded in significantly reduced bird numbers (Farquhar et al. 2012),  notably without impacting the diversity and numbers of co-occurring waterbirds, through methods such as egg oiling, nest removal, and limited killing of adult birds (carcasses disposed of by burial). Target levels reached, the program shifted toward a less intensive program aimed at maintaining those levels.  Other examples of adaptive management come from the state of Michigan (Dorr et al 2012).  Again, short-term management goals were met through non-lethal harassment, supplemented by limited lethal take of spring migrating cormorants.  Some of these programs were implemented despite evidence that the overall impact of cormorants on certain valued fish species was low.  One thing that all these programs had in common was a carefully implemented program supported by research, and an adaptive management response.\nThe proposed Ontario program is embarrassingly lacking in any sort of considered implementation or assessment.  Instead, a nine-and-a-half month open season is proposed, a massive bag limit of 50 birds daily, and no possession limit.  A single individual could therefore kill over 14,000 birds annually, a blatantly unsustainable harvest.  Added to this,  it appears that hunters would be allowed to let the meat spoil, meaning that they can leave wounded birds to die and dead birds to rot, with no concern for exceeding these ostensible limits.  (A confusing side note in the proposal information suggests that hunters might be required to gather fallen birds, adding trespass onto private lands to the list of unacceptable hunting practices.)  Having failed to propose any reasonable steps to gather accurate information on the number of birds killed, such as those taken by other management agencies, the Ministry proposes an after-the-fact cormorant monitoring program.  How this vastly underfunded Ministry, sorely lacking in equipment and staffed by people who have been told for years to stay in their offices, proposes to implement such a program is left to the imagination.  Binoculars from behind their desks?\n2.  The proposed policy would characterize Double-crested Cormorants as \u201cGame Birds.\u201d  The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act defines a \u201cgame bird\u201d as a species prescribed by the regulations - a masterful piece of circular wording.  In the real world, the accepted definition of a game animal is one that is under pursuit or taken in hunting, especially wild animals hunted for food.  It is clear, however, that the intent of this proposal is no such thing.  Under it, cormorants can be shot in essentially unlimited numbers, no effort has to be taken to collect the corpses or indeed to ensure that the bird has been humanely killed and, as if to ensure that this is the case, hunters can shoot from stationary motorboats (eliminating the need to obtain permission from the landowner).  It is crystal clear that the Ministry knows perfectly well that nobody will eat these birds, but that a certain element will be eager to slaughter them.  This smacks of catering to the lowest common denominator, those with no claim to be termed \u201csportsmen.\u201d   Each one of these three deviations from normal hunting practices is deplorable, and should not be acceptable in the Province of Ontario.\n3. One of the oddest things about Double-crested Cormorants is their capacity to generate irrational hatred in humans.  This is not something new, but goes back centuries (Wires and Weseloh 2018).  Most of what people think they know is based on myth and misinformation. Study after study has shown that they do not normally have any significant impact on fisheries.\nAs mentioned, cormorants eat a variety of fish species, and studies have shown that they are flexible in their prey selection habitats.\nWhile many people decided that the cormorants are the reason for the collapse or declines in numbers of certain fishes, the Great Lakes form a hugely complex ecosystem, and we ignore other factors at our peril.  One well-recognized change to the ecosystem has been the introduction of the invasive Round Goby - a fish from the Black and Caspian Seas in Europe, believed to have been introduced to Michigan in ballast water.  It had spread to all the Great Lakes by 1994, and is a voracious consumer of fish eggs, a species with few or no predators, now working its way into inland waters.  Except that Somers et al (2003) showed that cormorants had switched to a heavy reliance upon gobies in their diets.  Work by Ross et al (2003) showed the shift in cormorant diets on Snake and Pigeon Islands in eastern Lake Ontario prior to and after the appearance of Round Gobies.  Before, the cormorants ate mainly sport fish like Yellow Perch and Smallmouth Bass.  In the years since gobies appeared, those species make only a small part of the diet, and the cormorants have shifted their attention to gobies.  In the event of a wholesale slaughter of cormorants, gobies are one of the species that will benefit significantly, and that will thus be free to feed aggressively on insects and other small organisms, mussels, small fish and fish eggs, and to continue its push into inland lakes and rivers.\nAnother example of ecosystem complexity is the resurgence of Bald Eagles, another species rebounding from past human-caused impacts.  A  species of conservation concern (currently Special Concern), Bald Eagles are likely to become predators of cormorants.  Indeed, this is occurring in areas where Bald Eagle numbers are better.  These apex predators are known to kill both adult and young cormorants, and to cause the abandonment of colonies in some areas.\nAnother unintended consequence will be the impact to all the co-existing bird species.  I volunteer time with the local Land Conservancy for Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox & Addington, including annual monitoring on the same Snake Island mentioned above, site of the third largest cormorant colony in the lake\u2019s eastern basin.  From annual monitoring, I know personally that this is not an island inhabited by cormorants alone.  A few of the other species we have observed include: Herring Gull, Ring-billed Gull, Mallard, Black-bellied Plover, Sanderling, Least Sandpiper, Ruddy Turnstone, Spotted Sandpiper, Baird\u2019s Sandpiper, Dunlin, and Semi-palmated Sandpiper.  As well, the island has been the subject of annual studies by the Canadian Wildlife Service for over 40 years.  The impact of indiscriminant shooting would be devastating to many bird species, not to mention the possible endangerment of research scientists on  the island.  This is a very valid concern, as the U.S. experience has shown that refuge, sanctuary, and privately-owned islands were targeted (cited by Wires and Weseloh 2018).  Additionally, the killing of adults during the breeding season condemns unfledged juveniles to a lingering death without their parent caretakers.\nIn conclusion, I would like to see the proposal as presented scrapped in its entirety.  I hate to use the term witch hunt in light of its overuse in a country to the south of us. But if a witch-hunt is an attempt to find and punish a particular group of people who are being blamed for something, that seems like exactly the right term.  The only point of exception I would make is to support funding the MNRF to undertake the proposed cormorant monitoring program.  If a number of years of monitoring showed actual evidence of increasing cormorant numbers, then a more reasoned approach to control should be considered.  If a control program were deemed to be necessary, based on actual evidence, I would be able to support it, assuming that the presented program of control consisted of a multi-pronged approach largely based on non-lethal methods, combined with clear means of measuring success and impact.\nRespectfully submitted,\nLiterature Cited (but a small sampling of available science):\nColeman, Jeremy, Robin DeBruyne, Lars Rudstam, James Jackson, Anthony VanDeValk, Thomas Brooking, Connie Adams, and Milo Richmond.  2016.

It sounds more like a way to appease the hunters and anglers of this province, with little concern for the overall impact of such a plan.\nFor example, almost all Double-crested Cormorant colonies contain several other colonial waterbird species, including:\n1) Herring Gull\n2) Ring-billed Gull\n3) Common Tern\n4) Caspian Tern\n5) Black-crowned Night Herons\n6) Great Blue Herons\n7) Great Egrets\n8) White Pelicans\nIn other words, 8 other species will also be disturbed during their breeding season by this hunting activity.\nIn fact, the potential damage from this faulty proposal will be egregious: When Ontario Parks began culling cormorants at Presqu\u2019ile Provincial Park, they lost the ONLY Great Blue Heron breeding colony on Lake Ontario, which was embedded among the cormorants for protection against predators.\nThere are many more reasons to prevent this proposal, but based on the above facts alone there is reason enough to stop the plan from ever becoming a reality. If we are to protect our coastal water birds at this critical point in time when more and more species are endangered and threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, we do not need to add mindless hunting to the list of reasons for species decline and demise.\nI am the owner of a private wetland in southwestern Ontario and I try very hard to protect species and biodiversity. As a citizen of Ontario, I am appalled by this proposal. Please, do not grant the government the right to establish this needless and wasteful attack on a symbol of our great lakes.\n",

The cormorants are currently making a comeback from a very steep past decline and will therefore over populate until they realize that doing so means less food etc for themselves and then they will naturally stabilize their numbers.  Having hunters shoot a species to almost extinction (in this area again) will only cause those left to propagate.  Leave them alone.  They attract other species who feed on them or nest beside them.  Their numbers will stabilize as time goes on.  I feel the government is supporting this idea of a hunt without proper insight into the eventual outcome of such a proposal.\n",

We must learn to protect the natural environment and its wild denizens and not view them as purely instrumental to human whims.

Without this evidence, I do not see how any meaningful conservation decision can be made.\nIt is not clear to me how aesthetics has any bearing on whether or not a species should be hunted, but for the record I find double-crested cormorants an attractive species, and their communal nesting behaviour is fascinating.\nThe proposed hunting season includes the nesting season. Hunting cormorants during nesting season would have a negative impact on other protected species such as Great Blue Herons and Black-crowned Night Herons. I often see those species on or in close proximity to the island used for nesting by cormorants near my home. The noise and disturbance caused by hunting would certainly impact the ability of other species to successfully nest. Doubtless herons would be mistaken for cormorants and shot.\nI do not think it is appropriate that the daily bag limit is set so high and that the meat will be allowed to spoil. This sort of unrestricted hunting caused many bird species to come close to extinction a century ago and is what lead to cormorants and other migratory birds to be protected in the first place.\nRather than creating a hunting season for cormorants and then studying the impact on the cormorant population it would make more sense to first study the impact of cormorants on fish populations and provide some evidence that they are causing harm that could then be used as the basis to make an informed decision on whether or not they should be hunted.\nGiven that cormorants and fish have co-existed in Ontario for millennia, any declines in fish population are much more likely to be due to human activities rather than to the activities of cormorants.\n",

This hunt\nas it  has been purposed is barbaric and disheartening that  we  have so  little respect\nfor a bird that plays an important part in the ecological system.  The animal kingdom\nlives in harmony when the human species does not interfere.\nThis so called hunt, plain and simple is slaughter . For the first time ever since game laws came into\nbeing, it would be legal  to let  carcasses  spoil. The governments way of dealing with  the cormorants\nas it stands is extermination or extinction to please a few select groups. It is certainly not for the\nenvironment!\nPlease read the attached important file on \"Facts on Cormorant Issue\"\n14  facts about the Double-crested cormorant issue!\n1.  The Ontario government's proposal will allow individuals with a small game\n      license to kill up to 50 cormorants per day. That works out to approximately 1,500\n      cormorants per month or up to 14,250 cormorants for the entire proposed annual\n      hunting season.\n2.  The presence of cormorants benefits other colonial water birds, such as herons, egrets\n      and pelicans, all of which are stable or growing where cormorants are found.\n3.  The mass killing of cormorants will not be beneficial. In fact, the process of killing them\n      will force other bird species to vacate the colony sites they share.\n4.  There is no way to kill cormorants humanely. Even controlled, organized culls in other\n      regions have resulted in large numbers of injured and crippled birds being left to die of\n      their wounds or starve to death, including nestlings.\n5.  Cormorants are beneficial because their diet consists of very large numbers of primarily\n      invasive fish, such as alewives and round gobies, as well as other non-commercial,\n      non-forage species.\n6.  The mass killing of cormorants will damage the environment and disrupt natural\n       ecosystem processes.\n7.   The return of cormorants, a native wildlife species, to the Great Lakes Basin is part of a\n       natural process.\n8.   Cormorants are not overabundant in the Great Lakes. In fact, their numbers are modest,\n       now stabilized and are dropping in many areas.\n9.   Changes in the composition of vegetation in and around bird colonies are a sign of vibrant,\n        dynamic natural ecosystem processes.\n10. The number of trees damaged or destroyed in colonial waterbird colonies across the province\n        is miniscule and wouldn't even equal the number of trees in a single modestly-sized woodlot.\n11. Only a small number of islands (less than 3%) and peninsula sites are available for cormorants\n        and other colonial waterbirds to nest on.\n12. The mass killing being proposed by the Ontario government is a political response to anecdotes,\n         unsubstantiated claims and complaints by a small group of radical fishermen, supported by\n         special interest groups. There is no substantive body of scientific evidence supporting their position.\n13. Instead of making cormorants a scapegoat for environmental problems they have nothing to do with, attention should be given to addressing the issues that actually do affect fish populations and aquatic environments, such as climate change, pollution, shoreline and habitat destruction, overfishing and a broad range of other issues.\n14. The proposed designation of cormorants as game animals, along with a non-utilization exemption that allows the carcasses to rot should be an affront to every hunter who believes in sportsmanship, fair chase and ethics.\nYours truly\n",

        "comment":"re: Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\nI object to the \u2018Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\u2019 chiefly because the proposal, which extends the hunting season to an extreme length, and the daily bag to an extraordinary fifty birds per day per hunter is excessive.  Extinction of the double-crested cormorant would seem to be the intention of the proposed legislation, and extinction of any species cannot possibly be the intention of a responsible government--it would be an occurrence remembered in history as abhorrent rather than simply ignorant or unwise.\nAs well, the proposal suggests that legislation be amended to allow shooting from stationary motor boats.  Have our law-makers never been in boats on choppy water?  Remember the erratic breezes that rock the boats on an angle too.  Surely shooting from boats is prohibited, at least in part, because water and wind action introduce unpredictable effects that make responsible shooting problematic if not impossible.  I am out on Lake Ontario frequently in the summer--sometimes a mile or more from shore--as are many, many other people.  I will fear to venture onto the lake because this legislation will make it unsafe to be there.\nI object to the proposal to remove the spoilage prohibition for cormorant hunting.  Even with a possible provision for suitable collection and disposal, the proposal is worded too vaguely to be fairly assessed by the public.   But in any case, how could retrieval from the water, a mile out, possibly be done?  Perhaps the proposal is mute on this because it is not possible.  I\u2019m not in any way suggesting that hunters would simply consider the birds buried if they sank\u2014but it will be difficult to find them floating, let alone retrieve them.  A bird is relatively small, close to the colour of the water, and generally a fair distance away from the boat when it falls.  Good luck.  Although birds do die naturally, some over water, this legislation could easily have the effect of overloading underwater ecology from sunken birds.  Meddling with nature is problematic, and in the case of this proposed legislation, unnecessary.\nAs well:\nIf \"the Great Lakes populations [of cormorants] have ... stabilized or declined slightly,\" surely a cull is not necessary.  Meddling with nature rarely produces good results.  It also sounds suspiciously like political coat-tailing on nature.\nCormorant diet in the Great Lakes region has been widely discussed, and there seems to be no consensus and very little, if any, scientific evidence to back up the assertion that cormorants interfere in a meaningful way with the fishing industry.  Certainly none has been provided in the proposal, which is vague and seems to rely on hearsay.\nThe cormorant reputation for destroying trees where they nest may be well founded -- we\u2019ve all seen the bare trees -- but shooting them indiscriminately will only spread the tree problem further by forcing colonies to move to other locations, which they will then destroy.\nThe phrase used in the official outline, \"cormorants have been detrimental to ... aesthetics,\" also verges on the ridiculous given the current government's apparent attitude to culture, climate change (which will certainly alter our aesthetic if allowed to continue as it is) and Green Belt development.  Besides, cormorants are actually quite lovely looking--go down to the waterfront next summer and watch them drying their wings on the breakwaters side-by-side with the ducks, minks and night herons.\nPlease do not go forward with this proposal.  Not only is it unnecessary, it is unethical and unsafe.\n",

        "comment":"Proposal: ERO number 013-4124\nDear Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry:\nI am a Canadian citizen, an Ontario resident, and a taxpayer who is vehemently opposed to the proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario (ERO number 013-4124).\nCanadian wildlife is under attack from urbanization, climate change and ignorance. Permitting hunters to kill an arbitrary number of 50 cormorants per day from March to December will decimate cormorant populations; initiate a cascade of negative environmental impacts; and endanger birds sharing the same habitat; e.g., great blue herons, egrets, the endangered American while pelican and threatened least bittern. I question how you can state environmental consequences are \u2018expected\u2019 to be neutral with such a widespread, long-term open hunting season on double-crested cormorants without first conducting a thorough scientifically-based investigation on similar culls throughout Canada and the United States of America.\nIn 2015, a portion of the 39th Annual Meeting of the Waterbird Society was dedicated to Recent Advances in Biology and Management of Double-crested Cormorants. At a talk titled, Double-Crested Cormorant Culling in the St. Lawrence River Estuary: Results of a 5-Year Program, scientists determined, \u201cCulling should be considered a last-resort form of intervention whenever softer techniques (egg spraying, mechanical nest destruction, and carefully planned disturbances to the nesting colonies to enhance predation and abandonment) are not sufficient or practical to produce population control.\u201d Their studies showed, \u201cFurthermore, our work has shown how easy it is to decimate a cormorant population.\u201d\nScientists at the Waterbird Society meeting also shared their findings that contrary to public opinion, the double-crested cormorant is actually an ally to the commercial fishing industry and the sports fisherman. Exploring Potential Effects of Cormorant Predation on the Fish Community in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron revealed, \u201cRespectively, the three most common prey species observed by number (%) and biomass (%) pooled across years and sites were round goby Neogobius melanostomus (56.6%, 42.1%), emerald shiner Notropis antherinoides (25.2%, 12.5%), and yellow perch (8.0%, 14.1%).\u201d By feasting primarily on the round goby invasive species, double-crested cormorants are facilitating a healthy ecosystem where both native species of fish and Ontario\u2019s commercial fishing industry can thrive.\nAdditional studies conducted at York University in Ontario, have demonstrated that double-crested cormorant tree nesting and subsequent tree mortality reduced an invasive fire ant population in Toronto\u2019s Tommy Thompson Park; \u201cAt this particular site an invasive fire ant appeared to be negatively impacted in areas where tree mortality occurred.\u201d (Double-crested Cormorant Tree Nesting Habitat Modification and Impacts on Invasive European Fire Ants)\nAnother York University study titled Non-traditional Management of the Largest Great Lakes Cormorant Colony in Toronto, Canada discovered a management strategy to encourage double-crested cormorants to build nests on the ground rather than in trees. \u201cTo date the strategy has successfully limited the expansion of tree-nesting cormorants and, as of 2014, 63 percent of the population nests on the ground where they are not affecting tree canopy, compared to pre-management when only 15 percent of the colony nested on the ground.\u201d\nThe above references provide scientific evidence of sound, environmentally conscious methods of managing double-crested cormorants that do not involve killing the species. Links to PDFs and websites with supporting information have been submitted with this comment.\nThe negative effects of hunting on wildlife in general have not been considered. Frequent shotgun blasts and increased hunting will disrupt other breeding waterbirds, reducing their populations and causing injury and sometimes death due to stray bullets, bad aim and incorrect double-crested cormorant identification. Also, hunters continue to use toxic shot. This proposal will kill opportunistic scavengers through lead poisoning, including species at risk, such as the bald eagle of special concern, threatened species (gray fox and the Algonquin wolf), and endangered species (American badger, mountain lion and golden eagle).\nIt is doubtful that the many hunters who shoot 50 cormorants each day will dispose of all the carcasses. Ontarians are in a hurry. It is reasonable to assume that numerous carcasses will spoil and rot, polluting waterways and forested areas, and causing a greater stench than the excrement of an equal number of live cormorants.\nA hunting season is unwarranted. As you state in the proposal details, double-crested cormorant populations have stabilized or declined. I ask that my tax dollars be invested in educating Ontarians on how to coexist with wildlife, and in alternative methods of management that do not involve culling a species deemed aesthetically displeasing and wrongfully accused to be decimating fish populations. In my opinion, aesthetics should never be considered a reason to kill. I ask the provincial government to first determine if a proposal is scientifically valid before inviting Ontarians to submit comments.\nIn conclusion, I once again state I am opposed to the proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario and request it be stopped and not pursued in any manner.\nSincerely,\nAn Ontario resident and Canadian citizen\n",

Below are some of my concerns\/reasons.\n1.\tThe MNR wants to list a Cormorant as a game bird under the FWCA. Game bird to me, means something that edible i.e. grouse, pheasant etc.  The proposed legislation would allow waste of the flesh of the Cormorant \u2013 not typical of a game bird.  I would thus assume they are not edible or desirable to eat, something someone would like to eat like a grouse etc.  They should not be listed as game bird what I have been grown up to believe a game bird is.\n2.\t I believe that allowing cormorants to be shot from a boat, at their nest sites during the breeding\/nesting season is totally against ethical hunting \u2013 fair chase.  Furthermore at their nest sites Cormorants nests are often next to other birds from including gulls, terns, and Pelicans.  Disturbance at nest sites by excessive noise from a shotgun, a person walking on shore at the nesting colonies to hunt or a boat next to island in the act of killing Cormorants would allow predatory birds to eat the young or eggs.  Birds would temporarily abandon their nests and Herring Gulls and Black-billed Gulls will predate the nests of Cormorants as well neighbouring species nests like the White Pelican. It will radically reduce Cormorant populations and species that co nest as there will be no recruitment due to the Predatory birds.  In Ontario the White Pelicans is listed as a threatened species. In Northwestern Ontario, on Lac Seul east of Ear Falls, Ontario, White Pelicans nest next to Cormorants on Cormorant Island.  Any disturbance by man at this nesting colony will wipe out recruitment of all nesting specie on the island including White Pelicans.\n3.\tI understand there are issues with numbers of Pelicans on the Great Lakes.  I believe, if that is the case, then a cull should take place by a limited hunt or some other method used to reduce numbers.  Or at least shoot Cormorants in problem areas, prior to nesting season or well after birds have fledged in the fall.  Allowing \"hunters\" to randomly kill Cormorants at their nest site would threaten the specie and other species that nest at the same island.  This goes against ethical hunting where normally birds are hunted outside the nesting season.   This will feed ammunition to anti-hunting groups and will give hunters and hunting a terrible name.  This is unsportsmanlike and not what hunting or our hunting heritage is about.  Again a limited cull could be implemented in problem areas but not open to anyone with a small game licence.  Perhaps this proposed legislation being so liberal is designed so it fails and is not truly supported by the MNR.\n",

        "comment":"I am an artist and academic who has been researching double crested cormorants for the past two years relative to projects around land use, species cohabitation, and the cultural factors that determine ecological activity in our current age. Working in consultation with leading scientists and administration from the Living City Project, the TRCA, and Tommy Thompson Park, I have had the unique experience of observing, documenting, and creating reactionary works based on cormorant behaviours, including the roosting patterns that have been deemed problematic by supporters of this particular proposal. Through a thorough investigation into the scientific and cultural factors at play in the discussion around double crested cormorants, I wholeheartedly contest this proposal as unethical and unsubstantiated.\nThis proposal for an open season offers little insight into its implementation, monitoring, research, and timelines. There is no clear understanding of the resources being dedicated toward a public action to cull up to 50 birds per day. Who would monitor the actual numbers of birds being killed? What increase in resources (human and otherwise) will be dedicated to support the policing of cull activity? What ongoing research strategies will be implemented to monitor the effects of such an action on the species' overall population health? The proposal seems deliberately thin, and the tight turnaround on the process suggests that the aforementioned questions remain unanswered at the time of publication.\nCormorants are an ancient group of birds that have evolved successfully throughout North America for millennia. Scientific research has shown that since the rapid decline of cormorants in the region via DDT and other chemicals, significant efforts to rebound the population have been successfully implemented, which have included progressive strategies for maintaining green-space adjacent to cormorant roosts (Tommy Thompson Park, Toronto; see McDonald, Toninger, et. al, pdf attached). There is tangible scientific evidence to suggest that cormorants are feeding on several invasive fish species, thus helping to maintain aquacultures. Furthermore, cormorants act as prey to bald eagles, another species on the rebound in Ontario; scientists argue that the current cormorant population has stabilized, and in some regions, is declining alongside the increased presence of bald eagles. A recent peer-reviewed report published by Dr. Gail Fraser of York University aptly outlines the many ecological ways in which this proposal is problematic (see G. Fraser, link provided).\nWhile I currently reside in Toronto, I have lived the majority of my life in rural Ontario and frequently visit family in lakeside regions where cormorants are nesting. The common argument in favour of the cormorant cull by rural residents rests on the belief that the birds are invasive species, which is not the case, and that they are destroying green-spaces and decimating fish populations as presented in this proposal. The scientific research on the latter two presumptions concludes that a) cormorant populations are lower than in pre-colonial Ontario, b) cormorant roosting sites are a necessary part of the ecosystem, and c) cormorant fish feeding represents little to no threat to the commercial fish populations that the angling community has laid claim to. This proposal validates inaccurate presumptions about an indigenous species, and has created an unnecessary divide between social groups based on whether or not individuals believe cormorants to be \"good\" or \"bad.\" This is a reductionist approach and from a political perspective, echoes populist strategies for mobilizing targeted communities, a pattern in contemporary politics that has become far too common. What is required of the ministry is the sharing of research-based information on the species to shift perceptions in all communities toward an understanding of the ecological roles that cormorants have and will continue to play. It is not the job of the ministry to politicize nature, rather to ensure its future vitality.\nAs an artist and art historian, I was quite surprised to read that aesthetics was cited as a contributing factor. Aesthetics is a human-construct based on varying cultural perceptions of beauty. Human biases toward specific visual phenomena can hardly be a sound justification for ecological intervention. Setting a precedent that supports human affections for certain aspects of nature as viable factors in ecological policy-making is absurd and could have future impacts. As an anecdote, cultures that have mobilized cormorants to serve human functions like those in fishing villages in China and Japan have lauded the species in the form of poetry and visual artworks. Aesthetics is relative, and often problematically humanist.\nThe proposal to lift the spoilage ban is particularly disturbing, in part because of the bio-economical wastage of energy, but more so in terms of the knowing implementation of suffering. As Dr. Fraser discusses, the killing of one cormorant, male or female, will result in the starvation of a chick. What is the justification of a public cull over the humane alternatives \u2013 if required at all - offered by scientists (egg oiling, deterrent action, raptor presence, etc.)? Leaving the task of species population management in the hands of an untrained public will absolutely mean that animal suffering will ensue at a great scale. Once spoilage has been lifted with this animal group, can the public assume that future actions on other species are possible?\nIn the current age that some call the 'anthropocene,\u2019 a term used to describe the irreversible impact of humans on the natural world, it is more important than ever to ensure that any ecological action is approached with the utmost care and respect for nature\u2019s tenuous balance. Historical cases of open-season action (ex \u2013 the passenger pigeon) have shown that high population density does not insulate a species from extinction. The effects of an uncontrolled cull are impossible know until they occur; this proposal is a gamble with the balance of nature that we, the stewards of this land, are in no position to take. I strongly urge the ministry to engage in a research-based strategy that brings together key players in the fields of science, culture, traditional and Indigenous knowledge, and politics to assess the situation in a more nuanced way. Only then can an appropriate action, if any, be responsibly taken.\n",

This would include the time when cormorants have young in the nest and when those young are totally dependent upon constant care from their parents. The young of adult cormorants, who would be shot, would die from exposure and\/or starvation. No other \"game\" bird is hunted during its breeding season or on its breeding colonies or while tending its nests.\n2. Risk to Protected Bird Species\nCormorants seldom nest alone, by themselves, in single species colonies. In Ontario, they almost always nest with one or more of the following groups of colonial water birds: gulls, terns herons, egrets and pelicans. These species are protected by federal migratory bird legislation or provincial legislation.\nDischarging shotguns at or near cormorant nesting colonies, including shooting at flying birds and shooting adults on their nests \u2013 both in trees and on the ground, would be an enormous disturbance to all of these co-habiting species. It is almost a certainty that these protected species will be accidentally killed or will abandon their nests due to disturbance or associate incidental predation and consequently their young would also die. Thus, shooting cormorants on their nesting colony and causing disturbance (or injury or death) to other nearby or interspersed nesting colonial water birds (which would be inevitable) would be a violation of the Migratory Bird Convention Act. This would put provincially licensed cormorant hunters at risk of legal prosecution on violation of federal migratory bird statutes.\n3. Public hunting is not the appropriate method for Managing Ontario\u2019s Double-crested Cormorant Population\nSince cormorants are virtually inedible, the only possible rationale for a cormorant hunt is to attempt to reduce their populations. The evidence is mixed on whether cormorants have a significant effect on sport fish populations.\nThere is strong evidence that Ontario\u2019s cormorant population has stabilized and has even declined in some areas of Ontario (Lakes Huron and Superior) due to regime shifts in their food supply. There is no need to shoot cormorants to stabilize or reduce their population. Population reduction can be achieved through less intrusive methods than shooting, e.g. egg-oiling.\n4. Shooting is Not Required to Manage Cormorant Colonies\nIf management is deemed necessary to restrict colony expansion at specific sites and limit further damage to trees, less intrusive\/non-intrusive methods have proven extremely effective and do not harm protected species nesting in, or adjacent to colonies.\nMethods which do not require killing hatched birds include: human presence during nest site selection and post-breeding dispersal, egg oiling, provision of ground nesting materials and destroying nests prior to egg-laying. Egg oiling is a very effective means to limit cormorant productivity and has already been used to great success on some ground-nesting cormorant colonies on the Great Lakes.\n5. Daily Bag Limit is Unenforceable\nThe proposed daily bag limit of 50 birds with no possession limit is essentially unenforceable. At the end of a full week, a determined hunter could legally shoot 350 cormorants. What is less certain is how many would be retrieved due to the location of hunting (some might fall into crotches of tree or tangled vegetation) or because of their weight, or because of shooting on open water (some might be lost underwater, etc.). Unretrieved birds would jeopardize a hunter's claim to have stayed within the daily limit, if confronted by a conservation officer requiring proof.\nApart from the impact on cormorants and other bird species, the legislation potentially puts others who share the waterways during the proposed hunting season at risk. Shooting from boats during the summer months: June, July and August, is not compatible with recreational uses of our lakes and rivers.\n",

        "comment":"I would like to take this opportunity to express my alarm at the proposal to open a hunting season on the double crested cormorant in Ontario.  As you say this is being driven by property owners, commercial, and recreational fishermen.  These are not science driven decisions it is simply caving to political pressure.  Cormorant numbers are stabilizing after an amazing recovery from the effects of DDT according to Jim Quinn ( Biologist, McMaster) and other biologists who study cormorants. The ministry should always base decisions on science not politics as it puts your credibility at risk.\nThere is also a high probability of some nasty blow back from the public if this becomes law. The idea that a hunter could shoot and leave an animal to rot is abhorrent to most hunters and should never be allowed. As is the idea that they can be shot while nesting leaving their young to die a grim death. This is not something I could to explain to a child as responsible or ethical behaviour. Nor can you.\n",

        "comment":"As an Ontario resident who values nature, science-based policy, and sees the value in hunting as a management tool I am absolutely opposed to this proposal. The proposal lacks justification for the establishment of a province wide public hunt of this scale and fails to provide scientific evidence to defend the expressed concerns which have triggered the Ministry to pursue this proposal.\n\u2022\tThe Double-crested cormorant is a conservation success story, with populations in North America recovering from relatively low numbers in the early 1970\u2019s. In the current proposal the Ministry indicates that the Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined slightly, suggesting there is little justification in establishing a hunt to control population numbers.\n\u2022\tThe proposal fails to provide scientific evidence to justify the hunt, including failing to provide information about the species population status at the provincial, regional and local level.\n\u2022\tThe proposal fails to establish a clear problem statement other than suggesting that some groups and individuals have expressed generic concerns. A proposal made by the Ministry must be justified by the Ministry itself. The justification from the Ministry must be science-based, not based on generic comments.\n\u2022\tThe proposal fails to establish a clear target or goal for which this solution (i.e. \u201cmanagement tool\u201d) is to achieve. It is assumed that a decrease in Double-crested cormorant populations is the desired goal, but the proposal fails to specify a trigger which would indicate the goal was achieved. Along with failing to provide current provincial and regional population estimates, the proposal fails to indicate any provincial, regional or site level population target.\n\u2022\tThe proposal provides no scientific evidence to indicate the perceived impacts of Double-crested cormorants on local fish populations are real and that this species plays a significant role in the decline of local fish populations. Local fish populations face myriad threats include habitat loss, habitat degradation, human predation, predation by other species, and competition with invasive species; the Ministry has not provided any evidence to indicate that Double-crested cormorants in Ontario have significantly contributed to the decline of local fish populations.\n\u2022\tThe proposal indicates Double-crested cormorants have been detrimental to island forest habitats but fail to quantify the impact or acknowledge that this type of impact is a natural ecological process that occurs when high density colonially nesting waterbirds inhabit a portion of an island.\n\u2022\tThe Ministry failed to provide evidence that any alternative solution was considered that could address the expressed concerns (e.g. fish recovery programs, habitat management and restoration projects, public awareness\/outreach events).\n\u2022\tThe proposal indicates the Ministry will establish a Double-crested cormorant monitoring program, signifying there is currently no population monitoring program which could provide adequate, scientifically supported baseline population data from which harvest targets could be derived. It would take several years before any statistically meaningful monitoring data could be used to assess population status and trends, meanings several years of hunting would go unchecked. The proposed monitoring plan also fails to indicate any other parameters that will be monitored including fish populations, island flora health, and aesthetics, all of which are being used as generic justification for the proposal.\n\u2022\tThe proposal fails to justify the establishment of an open hunting season from March 15 to December 31 each year across the province, which represents nearly the entire window of time this species is present in Ontario. An open season of this length also effectively means the species can be hunted through its entire breeding season, which is inconsistent with wildlife management and hunting ethics. The killing of either parent bird will result in the death of young; how will this impact be factored into assessing the sustainability of this hunt?\n\u2022\tDouble-crested cormorants are colonial nesters and are often found nesting in association with other non-game migratory species including Great Blue Herons, Black-crowned Night Herons, Common Terns, gull species, etc. Due to the overwhelming likelihood of disturbance to other wildlife species (including at-risk species), a high risk of indiscriminate take of non-target species, and a lack of method to evaluate non-target species impacts, hunting of Double-crested cormorants during their sensitive breeding season must be avoided.\n\u2022\tThe proposal to amend the Fish and Wildlife Act to allow for hunters to leave Double-crested cormorant meat to spoil is both shocking and inconsistent with current hunting regulations and ethics. If aesthetic is a concern the Ministry has failed to demonstrate that potentially large numbers of bird carcasses left along shorelines will have anything but a pleasing aesthetic. The Ministry has also failed to address the human and environmental health risk associated with leaving large numbers of carcasses to spoil in the open. Additionally, by allowing hunters to let meat spoil it is assumed that the requirement to retrieve your quarry and ensure it is dispatched quickly and humanely is also voided; this represents blatant wildlife cruelty and a disregard for the intrinsic value of wildlife.\n\u2022\tThe proposal to allow a 50\/day bag limit with no possession limit in the face of the stated potential decline of the species, is nothing short of reckless. The Ministry failed to provide an explanation for how the limit was set. The statement by the Ministry that the environmental consequences of the hunt are expected to be neutral is both unfounded and speaks only to the potential impact on Double-crested cormorant numbers, not any of the other potential environmental impacts associated with such a large-scale hunt (e.g disturbance to other non-game protected bird species, risk of water quality issues from spoil carcasses and unlawful use of toxic shot, nestling success, public safety due to close proximity to active hunting, etc.). If the impact is expected to be neutral, then this solution\/management tool will fail to address the perceived problems. What then will be the point, other than to simply allow people to hunt the species for the sake of killing them and not for any overall net benefit.\n",

        "comment":"What the Hell?! The idea that when a species is slightly coming back from the verge of extinction it is now time to start killing it again for sport is a sickness in humans. There is no conceivable reason for the Ontario government to allow this creature to be hunted. The proposed hunting season is March 15 to December 31 \u2013 virtually all year. As cormorants fly south for the winter, this is the entire part of the year they spend in Ontario.\nThis includes nesting season, against the established wisdom of sustainable conservation management.\nIt includes nesting season for other birds \u2013 like gulls and herons \u2013 that often nest with cormorants.\nIt includes anytime you are out birding during migration \u2013 spring and fall.\nIt includes the entire summer, when you might be relaxing by a lake, or out canoeing or boating.\nFor that entire time, people would be legally allowed to blast away at cormorants.\nThe proposed bag limit is 50 birds a day. The proposed hunting season is 292 days long. This means a single person would be able to kill 14,600 cormorants in a year. The high estimate for the North American population is 2,000,000 \u2013 which means at this rate, 138 people could eradicate the species from the continent in a single year.\nThis proposal is ridiculous and horrendous.

        "comment":"It is my personal belief that there are better ways of fixing the issues associated with cormorants than allowing hunters to shoot them down with few restrictions. By disrupting the population of cormorants, the Ministry of Environment may be causing subsequent changes that are unintended and potentially more harmful to the ecosystem than if they were left alone. Furthermore, unless cormorant poop is causing catastrophic damage to the soil and cormorant diets are causing catastrophic damage to the fish population, they should be left be in order to preserve the integrity of the ecosystem. This is especially true because populations are restoring to natural levels, as opposed to populations rising beyond what they are supposed to be. Finally, the noise of gunshots would most certainly disrupt other populations, including bird populations, thus leaving them vulnerable. In general, this policy change has the potential to be highly disruptive to the ecosystem and further discussion definitely needs to be facilitated (especially with environmental experts, as opposed to only considering the opinions of fishermen who have for-profit interests) before a decision is reached. Until then, I will not support this move.\n",

Smarten up Ontario!!!!\nAccording to Bird Studies Canada, \u201cthe proposed bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no possession limit over a nine and a half month open season is exceptionally high, unsustainable, and without precedent under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for its failure to address the need for population sustainability.\u201d\n\u2022 This proposal will set a precedent whereby, for the first time ever in the history of Canadian game management, it will be legal to allow game to be wasted.\n\u2022 Hunters will be allowed to shoot from stationary boats in cottage country, even during the height of summer tourism.\n\u2022 There is no funding to monitor the killing. Entire breeding colonies of cormorants and co-inhabiting species such as Great Blue Herons, Egrets and, in the north, American White Pelicans, could be eliminated.\n\u2022 Since both parents care for young, untold thousands of nestlings will die of thirst, malnutrition, hypothermia and predation.\n\u2022 This proposal discredits decades of understanding basic ecology and the importance of apex predators to biodiversity.\n\u2022 Protected colonies such as the one at Tommy Thompson Park, which are humanely and effectively managed on science-based principles, will face increased pressure.\n\u2022 According to the Canadian Wildlife Service, cormorants feed primarily on small, largely non-commercial, shallow-water fish (e.g., non-native rainbow smelt and alewife). Only a small percentage of their diet consists of \u201csport fish,\u201d which is one of the excuses given for the hunt.\n",

The proposal as it stands now would allow hunters to essentially and easily kill as many of these birds as they like in the extended hunting season. Although the current studies estimate a neutral impact from the new legislation it is impossible to accurately determine just how impactful this may be. Furthermore I don\u2019t feel aesthetics or this displeasure of the cottaging population should factor into species control. We are encroaching in the birds natural territory. Commercial fishing is doing far worse things to our provinces water ways than any bird, perhaps we should look at changing that legislation instead.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for taking the time to read my concerns with Bill 205, the proposal to establish a hunting season for the double -crested cormorant in Ontario.\nAs I understand it, this particular species of bird can certainly be destructive to trees and surrounding habitats, because of its acidic faeces. It is also a fairly messy bird, as it will vomit half eaten fish, after ingesting.\nI also understand that these birds were once almost completely wiped out due to pesticide use in the 50's and 60's, and that great lengths were taken to bring the birds back from the brink of extinction in the Great Lakes area.\nUpon hearing about the proposal to have a 292 day hunting season for these birds, beginning in March of this year until the end of 2019, with a daily 'bag' quota of 50, per small game card carriers, and an added ironic twist that negates the 'retrieval' of the carcass, I was in complete disbelief that such a proposal was allowed to be put forth. Why have such a long hunting season for these birds, especially during their nesting season? Why not see how the adult population has fared over the migratory winter, and after the mortality rate of the babies is better known, for the coming year?\nWith these absurdly high daily quota numbers, it is conceivable that the population of these birds presently in the 250,000 range, could be completely wiped out in one hunting season. I find that preposterous and highly irresponsible. We are already doing a good job of causing the extinction of many species around the planet. Please, let's not willfully cause the extinction of one more.\nI understand the need for culling certain species of wildlife, if they are causing problems. I can see that the Cormorant is causing some problems in the Georgian Bay and surrounding 'cottage\/boating' country, although it seems to be problems of inconvenience, aesthetics and infringing on the sport fishing industry, and not of a dire threat to any ecosystem or humans.\nWhat I don't understand are three things:\n1.) Why can't hunting time-frame for the cull be AFTER the mating\/nesting season? Then hatchlings are able to take of themselves and not have to be subject a long and horrible death, when their parents are shot.\n2.) Why 50 per day, per hunter? Why not a seasonal quota of 200, or something much more manageable and pragmatic? If a smaller quota shows that it hasn't affected the population in the first year, then the quota could be increased for the next season.\n3.) If there is no retrieval and therefore no way to know who shot the bird, what is stopping anyone, with or without a license, to shoot these birds and potentially go OVER the already absurd daily quota, thus ensuring that these birds may very well face an endangerment to their species in this province?\nAlso, by not retrieving, the carcasses would be left to rot in the environment, which would fly in the face of lowering their numbers because of the rotting debris they can produce themselves. Not to mention, rotting bird carcasses in the hundreds could potentially lead to disease, of the water, the marine life and of other animals, namely, humans.\nI would really like those involved to think hard and long about the numbers that are being put forth, AND the timing of the open season on Cormorants. It does not make sense at all. Please rework Bill 205, to lighten up the potential for mass slaughter.\n",

This proposal has failed to establish scientific evidence in support of a hunting season, and the proposal in fact acknowledges that cormorant populations, which were once nearly extirpated from Ontario, are either stable or declining. In addition, this proposal promotes the myth that double-crested cormorants have a high negative impact on sports fish, when research by the  Canadian Wildlife Service, cormorants indicates that double-crested cormorants are not competing with commercial fishers as they feed primarily on small, largely non-commercial, shallow-water fish. Only a small percentage of their diet consists of \u201csport fish.\u201d\nI believe that allowing to hunters to cull 50 cormorants per day while leaving the meat to spoil will promote unsustainable hunting practices. Because double-crested cormorants are colonial birds that nest on islands, it would be all too easy for hunters to repeatedly target a colony until it is eradicated. In addition, because hunters would be able to shoot cormorants from boats, it could pose a potential safety issue for the many boaters, cottagers, and other members of the public who use and enjoy coastal zones in Ontario.\nI am disappointed that this proposal fails to provide any scientific evidence for the implementation of a double-crested cormorant hunt. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry works to sustainably preserve Ontario's fish and wildlife resources, yet this proposal fails to provide evidence that this hunt would sustainably maintain Ontario's wildlife.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Public Input Coordinator, MNRF,\nI am writing on behalf of the Rondeau Bay Waterfowlers Association (RBWA) for public comment on the proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario.  The RBWA strongly supports hunting season on double crested cormorants rooted in science, with population monitoring where feasible.  We do not wish to see the birds extirpated but their negative impacts mitigated.\nThe RBWA have strong concerns about the impact these birds have on the ecosystem including the public hunting opportunities within Rondeau Bay, as well as Ontario as a whole.\nOver the past decade Rondeau Park has lost all the trees on two (2) islands due to nesting of double crested cormorants, as a result of the loss of vegetation, the wave action has eroded these islands away and now both completely underwater.  The birds have since moved to another peninsula and the nesting has nearly killed all of the trees on this point as well.  These islands and point serve as hunting blind locations in Rondeau Park\u2019s A-Zone during the waterfowl season and have negatively impacted these public hunting locations, making Rondeau a place of interest regarding the impact of double breasted cormorants.\nWith the current proposal to list the double breasted cormorant as a game bird, a cormorant would be taken under a small game license.  Currently hunters are allowed to hunt migratory birds within the boundary of Rondeau Provincial Park\u2019s A-Zone but not game birds under a small game license.  The RBWA would request that the MNRF consider what options can be implemented to mitigate the impact these birds have at provincial parks such as Rondeau.\nWill waterfowl hunters within a provincial park (that permits waterfowl hunting) be permitted to harvest cormorants if they are a game bird?  If so, the RBWA would propose further consultation with the MNRF to evaluate cormorant hunting season within the park limits, and if it should coincide with our current specific hunting days or be permitted throughout the entirety of the proposed season.  The RBWA would anticipate the opposite side of Rondeau Bay, B-Zone, would be open during the entirety of the proposed hunting season.\nDue to the negative impact these birds have had to the local ecosystem as well as the quality of public hunting locations within Rondeau Park we would request the MNRF consider permitting the harvest of these birds within provincial parks that currently permit waterfowl hunting.\nIf any additional information pertaining to the hunting practices specific to Rondeau is required in your consideration please contact the RBWA at admin@rondeauwaterfowlers.com.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\nBrendan Guest\nRondeau Bay Waterfowlers Association\nPublic Relations Officer\n",

Maybe we should respect that.\nYes the Cormorant population may need to be managed now and then and there are tools available to do this at present. This bill is overkill, biased, unbalanced and smells of vigilante revenge and blood lust. It will extinct the species.\n",

        "comment":"If this government is truly \"for the people\", then it must listen to the all of the people, not just a small sector of powerful stakeholders. This proposal is scientifically baseless and flies in the face of decades of understanding basic ecology and the importance of apex predators to biodiversity.\nIt is time to stop using cormorants as a scapegoat. According to the Canadian Wildlife Service, cormorants feed primarily on small, largely non-commercial, shallow-water fish (e.g., non-native rainbow smelt and alewife). Only a small percentage of their diet consists of \u201csport fish\".\nAccording to Bird Studies Canada, \u201cthe proposed bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no possession limit over a nine and a half month open season is exceptionally high, unsustainable, and without precedent under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for its failure to address the need for population sustainability.\u201d\nUS surveys conducted between 2005 and 2016 show a 36% decline in the population (OF. Cuthbert and L. Wires, Unpublished Data, USFWS). Ontario has not conducted a Great Lakes cormorant survey since 2007 to 2009, so any data being used is now 10 years old. How can this proposal be put forward when it is not based on current population statistics and trends?\nThis proposal will set an unacceptable precedent whereby, for the first time ever in the history of Canadian game management, it will be legal to allow game to be wasted. Hunters will be allowed to shoot from stationary boats in cottage country, even during the height of summer tourism. How will safety measures be enforced? I can't imagine that people in cottage country will be pleased spending their summers with constant gunfire and cormorant carcasses left to spoil on the shorelines of lakes.\nMost wildlife species are protected from hunting in the spring when they are caring for their young. There be significant animal cruelty issues involved given that both cormorant parents care for their chicks. How will this mass hunt be managed and monitored? Entire breeding colonies of cormorants and co-inhabiting species such as Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets and, in the north, American White Pelicans, could be eliminated.\nThe Tommy Thompson Park cormorant colony is the largest in North America, numbering 13,275 nesting pairs in 2016. They achieve a balance between the continued existence of a healthy, thriving cormorant colony and the other ecological, educational, scientific and recreational values. Management techniques include ground nest enhancements, deterrence and site restoration. Their management strategy encourages ground-nesting while discouraging nesting in healthy trees. Management does not include lethal culling or egg oiling.\nThere are options to this morally bankrupt and precedent setting proposal.\n",

Plenty of animal hunting is already occurring and there does not need to be more animals at risk of endangerment.\nThe Government says it is responding to concerns about too many cormorants, depleted fish stocks and environmental damage. But those concerns are largely just anecdotes, complaints and unsubstantiated claims that were debunked long ago.\nIn reality, cormorants are not overabundant, their numbers are relatively modest, have stabilized and are dropping in some areas. The entire North American double-crested cormorant population is estimated to be less than the population of Toronto, with only about 125,000 birds in the lower Great Lakes.\nPlease be humane and do not allow cormorant hunting.\n",

        "comment":"To whom it may concern;\nI understand the reasons for considering a hunting season for Double-crested Cormorants. I take issue with the Ministry\u2019s outlandish ideas for population control.\nI feel that a bag limit of 50 cormorants per person per day is excessive. Such a limit is excessive for any species and encourages indiscriminate killing just for the sake of killing. This attitude is unacceptable and contrary to the premise that hunting is a controlled and careful practice that is respectful of natural resources.\nThe season proposed by the Ministry is also inconsiderate of breeding seasons and gestation periods. Based on the current proposal there is no attention given to nesting birds and their babies. If the season continues as suggested countless chicks will be left without one or both parents and they will starve to death or die of exposure. This is inhumane and flies in the face of responsible resource management. A modified season, such as 1 March to 31 May, and 15 September to 31 December would be a more socially acceptable option.\nWith the current suggested practice of hunting without a requirement to collect carcasses there is the potential for excessive water and land contamination. If hunters kill their bag limit and birds are left to rot where they fall then a disservice is being done to the very ecosystems this proposed hunt is meant to protect. Rotting carcasses will cause aquatic contamination resulting in a decline in suitable fish habitat, water quality for wildlife and for humans alike, and will be an eyesore and an overall assault on the senses for those attempting to enjoy the outdoors. Carcasses left on islands or land to spoil will further damage the areas where cormorants, and other species of birds such as Bald Eagles, Turkey Vultures, Ospreys, various gulls and terns, and ducks and geese, nest and live. Furthermore, failing to retrieve or collect hunted birds could conceivably leave an inordinate number of wounded birds to suffer an agonizing and slow death at the hands of the elements. Again, this is incongruent with hunting and resource management best practices. Collecting hunted birds would also increase the accountability of hunters to ensure bag limits are being maintained, that birds are actually dead, and assist in ensuring that carcasses do not contaminate the environment. Carcasses could be required to be disposed of properly in a landfill or provided to other hunters for bait, in the case of bears, coyotes, and wolves. Additionally, having limits, seasons, and hunter responsibilities as detailed could put the Ministry, the Province, and hunters alike, in the crosshairs of animal rights activist groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). This could have results ranging from benign to dangerous.\nI believe additional management efforts are required to adequately determine the population of cormorants in Ontario. A hunt as proposed, appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to the complaints of underinformed resource users. Prior to fishing becoming a mainstream pastime cormorants existed in the environment. During the years of the indescriminate use of DDT,  cormorants and countless other species of birds suffered greatly through population decline. This is finally being rectified however, now that the birds are thriving it\u2019s a problem for those engaged in fishing. Contrary to popular belief, cormorants do not only feed on Walleye or other sought after sport fish. They have been known to feed on over 250 species of fish including those that are deemed to not be of importance to the ecosystem or are invasive, such as the Round Goby, Wels Catfish, Zander, and Rudd.\nI expect the Ministry to make an informed decision regarding changes to resource management practices. This does not include excessive bag limits, poorly-defined seasons resulting in orphaned and starving chicks, or birds left for dead since there is no onus to be responsible when engaged in hunting this species. Prior to the addition of a new species to the list of those that may be hunted further analysis of populations, habitats likely to be adversely affected, and humane and accountable harvesting practices should be studied and considered.\nIn closing, every species has a niche in our environment. The sudden and aggressive harvest of a single species could result in extirpation and, in the extreme, a possibility of a repeat to the sad story of the Passenger Pigeon, a species that was once said to darken the skies with its great flocks. Please consider alternatives and use some restraint in this planning process as it benefits everyone who takes the time to enjoy Ontario\u2019s great outdoors.\n",

The double-crested cormorants are not overly abundant and the myth that they deplete fish stocks or cause environmental damage was debunked long ago.  If any desirable or commercially important fish species have been depleted, it is due to human overfishing and pollution.  Unsubstantiated claims blaming a natural species of the ecosystem, namely the double-crested cormorants, is pure nonsense, and frankly this proposal is an embarrassment to the Ontario Ministry of the Environment.  You must know that this irresponsible slaughter of any cormorants, including nesting parents (up to 50 per day is not \"game management\") would be impossible to monitor properly and would no doubt provide the excuse to take numerous other species \"by accident.\"  Allowing the carcasses to spoil is further indication that this is an irresponsible and ill-advised proposal that will have very unfortunate consequences for wildlife and natural ecosystems in Ontario.

The evidence is quite clear that double breasted cormorants do not impact sports fishing, studies show that the stocking of lakes with predator fish species has a greater affect on the decline of bass species. As with many other gut reaction theories the reason that cormorants are blamed is because they are not that pretty and rather obvious so therefore it must be them. If you want a natural way to control them, find a way to encourage bald eagles to take up resident in the areas there are large cormorant colonies, they have been shown to be effective predators (again there are scientific studies to support this) and would maintain the natural balance a lot better than a bunch of gun toting men in boats.

Hunting during the nesting season will disturb other species including birds, turtles, and amphibians, especially birds.

The social effect of hunting during the summer will be disruptive and set hunters against cottagers, boaters and tourists.

        "comment":"I would like to register my opposition to the proposed changes regarding the hunting of cormorants.  These changes bear little resemblance to what most hunters regard as responsible hunting practices.  The limit of 50 birds per day is not compatible with maintaining a healthy population of birds particularly when combined with the provision that birds may be left to rot.  How can the number of birds killed by a hunter be determined when they do not have the birds killed in their possession?  Therefore the \"limit\" is unenforceable.  All accepted hunting practices require that a hunter do his best to ensure that any animal wounded by the hunter is tracked and killed to prevent unnecessary suffering.  This value of responsible hunters is totally ignored in this proposal.  It is also not normal hunting practice to kill animals at a time in which young which are dependent on their parents for survival will be orphaned.  The terms of this proposal indicate that its true purpose is the virtual extirpation of the cormorant in Ontario to benefit recreational fishing. While recognizing that this fishery is of interest to many Ontarians, it should be recognized that equally as many citizens of the province benefit from and appreciate nature in different ways.  The cormorant is a native species which has relatively recently returned to this habitat following the damage done to the population by pesticides. While there may be a need for some control of its numbers, this proposal is far too extreme and environmentally irresponsible.\n",

To initiate a hunt and then to propose to monitor the population is the reverse of the norm which would be to assess the population; set population goals and then determine if the population would support a hunt and at what level.\nIn addition hunting ethics would suggest the season should not be during the nesting period resulting in juvenile birds starving.  That should call for an animal cruelty investigation.  Perhaps an August 1 opening would be more appropriate if sustainable or whenever the young are able to survive.  It will put hunters in a bad light to other users of the waterways at a time of heavy usage of waterways.\nA fifty bird limit seems excessive when by other proposed changes the government is admitting the birds will be wasted.  Not sure what a recommended limit should be as I am not aware of population status or size or recruitment rate hence what would be an appropriate allowable harvest.\nIn summary it would be contrary to the principles of Fair Chase and Hunting Ethics which former Premier Mike Harris supported and promoted through the Premier's Symposium on Hunting Heritage held in Ottawa in 2000 and subsequently supported by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.\n",

However, the Ontario government's plan to designate double-crested cormorants a 'game' bird, and allow a 9-month open season with a 50 daily bag limit, is a radical shift in the management of this species, bringing with it real concerns of uncontrolled and unsustainable hunting. Equally worrisome would be the impact of this legal hunt on other roosting birds, such as great egrets, great blue herons, and white pelicans, a species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Persistent complaints by sport and commercial anglers that cormorants complete for the same valued fish species are scientifically unfounded and should not be the basis for any changes to the game laws.

I am well aware of what cormorants eat and the effect they have on the land where they nest.  I am not opposed to wildlife culls when scientifically justified.  In fact I was an early proponent of the deer cull at Presqu'ile, and I am generally supportive of cormorant management in the western Lake Erie islands where truly unique vegetation communities in Canada exist.  Having said that, I find this proposed legislation offensive and deeply disturbing.\nCormorants, like few other creatures, inspire a deep hatred within a certain set of people, especially commercial and sport fishers.  Here in Brighton they are sometimes referred to with racial epitaphs.  They have been illegally killed on their nesting colonies within a year of their colonization of Gull Island.  There is no acceptable number of cormorants for this group.  And incredibly your proposal validates this without even an attempt to lay out a population goal.  What kind of cull doesn't have a number?  This is nothing more than a policy that panders to a vocal group who absolutely hate these birds.  This proposal lets the fox guard the henhouse.\nI know a number of people in wildlife management and without exception they are ashamed, embarrassed or angered by this ridiculous proposal.  There are existing tools at the disposal of MNRF and CWS to manage cormorants.  Opening it up to a \"sport\" hunt where the animals are allowed to waste is unethical and offensive.  This kind of hunt will harm the reputation of ethical hunting.\nI know a number of people who will jump at the chance to kill cormorants en mass.  Many couldn't tell a cormorant from a loon, both of which occur here in dense feeding flocks in fall.  They will park offshore from the breeding colonies, which are also home to herons, egrets, terns and gulls, and they will not stop shooting.  Breeding colonies, which almost always involve multiple species, are incredibly sensitive to human disturbance and this policy will bring devastation to colonial birds in Ontario.\nI can't believe that in 2019 we are considering such a policy which seems out of the dark ages of wildlife management when species were either classified as good or vilified as evil.  This is an embarrassment and I urge you in the strongest terms to rescind this terrible proposal.\n",

I believe my opinion is valuable and should be heard. The proposed cormorant hunt for Ontario is a joke based on a lack of research and a few angry people who aren't used to seeing numbers of cormorants on small lakes.\nThe Double-crested Cormorant is the most widespread cormorant in all of North America and has caused no issues anywhere in its range. So why hunt it? Because the cormorant was once a species nearly wiped out in Canada due to DDT and is now making a comeback back to its original population size. People are seeing an increase in population size and want to manage it even though they are returning to the places that they once were.\nCormorants are beneficial to the ecosystem as they control invasive fish species in our lakes such as the Round Goby, Goldfish, and Common Carp. They also provide food to the Bald Eagle, a bird that is also increasing in numbers but no one would dare to shoot them as they are \"pretty\". Double-crested Cormorants also rarely catch mature game fish.\nCormorants destroy trees to make nesting colonies which may look ugly but we have to remember that these dead trees provide habitat for Great Blue Herons, Black-crowned Night Herons, Great Egrets, Tree Swallows, Chimney Swifts, all woodpeckers species including the Red-headed Woodpecker, and American White Pelican. The last two species are both species at risk and are protected by the Fish & Wildlife Act.\nIt's ridiculous that a hunt like this was ever proposed. I have convinced many hunters who are supportive of the hunt to change their opinion and I will continue to do so if this proposal becomes a reality.\nYou think humanity would've learned from the Passenger Pigeon, Great Auk, or Yellow-breasted Bunting.

These birds are a part of the great lakes ecosystem and for the government to allow essentially  fishermen and hunters to target this species due to some fishermen\u2019s fears of them depleting fish stocks and causing environmental damage does not justify the brutal culling of these birds. History has shown that when humans are involved, many problems arise due to overfishing, overhunting, cruelty, and destruction of the environment.\nIf  hunting of cormorants is permitted, there will be birds that will not be killed immediately and therefore it will result in wounded birds that are left to drown, bleed or starve to death. It will condemn chicks, that rely on parent birds, to die of exposure and starvation. If animals must be killed, it must be done quickly and as painlessly as possible. Under the circumstances considered for this hunt, it will result in unnecessary pain and suffering for many of these birds and more than likely for other birds that are not to be part of this cull.\nThe proposed bag limit of 50 cormorants per day from the exceedingly long hunting season from March 15 to December 31 is shocking. In my opinion, this is not management of the cormorants but is outright war on them.\nIt is wrong to decimate a specific species and it is wrong to cause unnecessary pain and suffering, which will result if this proposed cull proceeds.\n",

In addition, the concept of hunting them from a stationary boat in this area just enhances the risk.\nA better approach, if these birds are considered a nuisance, would be to oil the eggs in their nests to reduce the population.\nIronically, the large roost of birds in this area has not spoiled the sport fishing at all, so I believe you are being misled.\nI would strongly suggest that if you are going to move forward with sport hunting of the cormorant, that you make the rules significantly more restrictive to reduce the risk to the public.\nIt should be noted that as this comment will be of public record, in the case of an accident, it would be available for discovery in a potential lawsuit or criminal charges against public officials sanctioning this change in the cormorant status to a game bird, without putting the proper controls in place to protect the public.\n",

        "comment":"I would like to express my opposition towards the proposal to establish a hunting season for the Double-crested Cormorant in Ontario through amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act and supporting regulations.  I believe that the proposed changes lack scientific justification, pose considerable harm to a wildlife species native to Ontario, and have the ability to adversely impact other native wildlife species and habitats.\nMy opinion on this matter has been greatly influenced by those of Bird Studies Canada, their goals being the understanding, appreciation, and conservation of birds.  For the rest of my comments I will quote Bird Studies Canada\u2019s objections to this proposal, as they state their case much more eloquent than I can.  Below is a summary of the major concerns noted by Bird Studies Studies Canada regarding the proposal:\n\"(1)   Lack of scientific credibility and justification\n-The proposal fails to demonstrate a sound scientific basis for the need for the hunt, lacking any detailed information about the species\u2019 population size.\n    -The proposal\u2019s policy rationale indicates that the species\u2019 population is stable or declining, decreasing MNRF\u2019s justification for the hunt.\n    -The proposal fails to address the potential impact of the hunt on the population of Double-crested Cormorants in Ontario, or the potential impact on other wildlife species which could be affected.\n    -The proposal fails to adopt an ecosystem-based approach to wildlife population assessments and management, a key consideration for a species with such complex interactions with aquatic and terrestrial species and habitats. Among other things, it fails to describe a population management objective (population target) provincially or regionally. Nor does it describe a time frame over which the proposal would be in place. Although it proposes a program to monitor cormorant population and trends in Ontario, it would be some years before any such program could provide solid estimates, leaving the first few years essentially unmonitored.\n(2)   Inconsistencies with standard norms for hunting and Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act principles\n-The proposed hunt is inconsistent with every tenet of wildlife management and hunting ethic, including failure to protect wildlife during the breeding season and permission to allow game meats to spoil. This proposed divergence from norms highlights the fact that this is not sport hunting by any standard definition, but is rather a broad-scale and largely unregulated cull \u2013 reminiscent of unchecked \u201cmarket hunting,\u201d which modern bird hunting regulations were designed to correct.\n    -The proposed exemption to the requirement to protect against meat spoilage, coupled with a failure to retrieve or even report carcasses, renders population monitoring and enforcement effectively impossible, which could rapidly lead to large-scale mortality with population level impacts.\n    -The hunting of Double-crested Cormorants during the breeding season is again inconsistent with wildlife management and hunting principles and ethics; such hunting will inevitably lead to failure of nests and starvation of chicks, which are issues of concern relating to both population management and to inhumane treatment to wildlife.\n    -The proposed open season from March 15 to December 31 each year represents the entire duration of the species\u2019 natural annual occurrence in Ontario \u2013 effectively resulting in no meaningful closed season in the province.\n(3)   Impact on Double-crested Cormorant populations, native biodiversity and ecosystems\n-The proposed bag limit of 50 Double-crested Cormorants per day per hunter with no possession limit over a nine and a half month open season is exceptionally high, unsustainable, and without precedent under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for its failure to address the need for population sustainability. It is not unlikely that such a level of hunting would lead to local and\/or regional extirpations, as well as reduction provincially to token remnant populations. The likelihood that this proposal would have only a \u2018neutral\u2019 impact is baseless.\n    -The proposal allows for shooting of Double-crested Cormorants on breeding colonies which could lead to mortality of other colonial waterbird species which often nest in close association, such as Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, and Black-crowned Night Herons.\n    -Disturbance by hunters will disrupt other wildlife nesting in and near Double-crested Cormorant colonies, including the above-noted heron family members, as well as other species such as Caspian Terns, Common Terns, and Great Black-backed Gulls.\n    -The increased level of shooting over water could lead to an increase in toxic shot deposited in lakes and rivers since not all shooters may abide by the proposal\u2019s requirement for non-toxic shot.\n(4)   Public safety and enforcement of proposed changes\n-The proposal allows for unrestricted shooting in Ontario, both in terms of season and location, potentially permitting hunters to be in unsafe proximity to boaters, cottagers and other outdoor recreation enthusiasts. The lack of a closed season in spring and summer increases the public safety risk due to the overlaps of the open season with the peak of outdoor recreation.\n    -The proposal to permit hunting from a motorboat increases risk for public safety, which is contrary to migratory bird hunting regulations.\n    -The large scale of the proposed hunt, the permission to discard carcasses and let meat spoil, and the exceptionally long open season render the hunt (including the daily bag limit) unenforceable by conservation officers.\n    -The proposal\u2019s broad scope and exceptionally high quotas would require intensive and greatly expanded enforcement, as well as greatly increased resources for population monitoring; such resources are not likely to be available at a time when public expenditures are being cut back.\n    -The Ministry\u2019s intent not to provide additional opportunities for public comment, should the proposal proceed, is a concern for due process relating to Ontario legislation, regulations, and policies.\"\nBy using the reasons stated above, I express by opposition to the proposal.\n",

        "comment":"This is not a hunt, this is a slaughter. This is not a hunt, it\u2019s an extermination program.\nAllowing this killing throughout the nesting season is unconscionable, especially as cormorants share their nesting space with many other species, and this will disrupt their nesting season as well. Also, there is bound to be accidental kill of non-targeted species since they share the same space and since it can be difficult to distinguish cormorants from herons in the air.\nThis slaughter is being advocated for by fishing and hunting organizations based on faulty assumptions about the cormorants impact on fish stocks \u2014 concerns that have been largely discounted. Others raise complaints that their guano kills vegetation around their nesting sites. While this is true, this is part of the natural cycle and when they move to new nesting areas, the previous ones recover.\nCormorants are inedible, so hunters won\u2019t even be able to eat what they kill. In fact, the MNRF also wants to ease restrictions on \u201cspoilage\u201d meaning that hunters will be able to just shoot the birds and leave them where they fall, injured or dead. As they intend to allow this slaughter during the nesting season, the young will be left to starve in their nests.\nThis inhumane plan must be stopped.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing in strong opposition to the proposed cormorant hunt. I am a Professor of Biology at an Ontario University, where I teach Conservation Biology and conduct research in seabird conservation. I have conducted several studies on cormorants, and was an academic consultant for the cormorant cull at Presqu\u2019ile Provincial Park. I oppose the cull for several reasons:\n1. There is little evidence that cormorants significantly reduce the availability of fish to the commercial and sport fisheries.\n2. Rather, studies indicate that cormorants eat round gobies, which are alien invasive fish. Thus, they are important in mitigating negative human impacts on freshwater ecosystems.\n3. Although cormorant numbers have increased since eradication of DDT, we do not know what their numbers were before European colonization of North America. Thus we simply do not know - and cannot assume - that their numbers are unnaturally high.\n4. While it is true that cormorants eventually kill trees in which they nest, they also nest on the ground.\n5. Importantly, the justification for a daily bag limit of 50 birds is not provided in the Ministry proposal. This level is almost certainly not sustainable. Most likely it will result in annihilation of colonies in areas where local people have a vendetta against cormorants.\n6. By allowing hunting of adults during the breeding season, many chicks will die from starvation and dehydration. This is simply inhumane.\n7. The proposed amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, to allow meat to spoil, would open the door to other unpalatable species being persecuted simply because local people do not appreciate their ecological or intrinsic value.\nCormorant control efforts at Presqu\u2019Ile Provincial Park were highly successful in reducing and maintaining cormorant numbers to healthy and viable numbers. Those control measures involved a combination of (1) oiling eggs to reduce breeding success, and (2) culling low - and annually adjusted - numbers of adults by PARK STAFF, not by local hunters. Ideally, control efforts should involve modern Adaptive Management methods including Population Viability Analysis, annual monitoring, and control actions by government employees.\nCormorants are often vilified because they are large black birds that sometimes eat fish that humans like to eat, and whose colonies sometimes smell bad to humans. I have seen results of local fishermen in Atlantic Canada taking revenge on cormorants for erroneously perceived competition for fish. However, cormorants are important components of healthy ecosystems, and are integral parts of our natural heritage. They - and the citizens of Ontario - deserve that they be managed using progressive, ecological sound principles, not by potentially vindictive hunters with high bag limits.\n",

Allowing such wholesale slaughter for nine months of the year will adversely affect other migratory birds including Common Terns, Caspian Terns, Black-crowned Night Herons, Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, and White Pelicans. Such birds are currently protected by the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act.\n In addition, the lakes and rivers where Cormorants live will be unsafe for the public during the nine month hunting season and there is no provision for removal of the carcasses which will be detrimental to the environment.\nOther proven more human methods to reduce the cormorant population such as egg painting should be considered as a workable alternative. This can be properly monitored to rate impact and success.\nFinally, it is a tremendous oversimplification to assume that we can re-engineering natural ecosystems by a mass killing of one species.

Cormorants are an easy and emotional target for some in the pro-hunting and fishing community.\n2. I have serious concerns about the suggestion that you are essentially opening Ontario to wholesale shotgun hunting on waterways (lakes, rivers) for most of the year with a long season of cormorant hunting. For those of us with rural properties, it's already a frustration to hear hunters blasting away in the fall for waterfowl, and the spring and fall for turkeys.  Not to mention the poachers who feel free to hunt at any time of the year with virtual impunity since the MNR has so few game warden enforcement staff any more.  The Ford Government proposes to let hunters blast away on our lakes and rivers throughout the summer when we are trying to enjoy our cottages or rural properties.\n3. The cormorants will be wastage since they are not fit for eating, and I am very sure that most hunters will let them float in the water or on the beach where they have been shot to rot rather than properly disposing of the birds. This sets a terrible precedent for hunting behaviour.\n3. I would support a science-based hunt for the cormorant. It should be designed with clear objectives up front, be based on current best understanding the the bird and it's place in the ecosystem,  a limited open season, and should REQUIRE regular objective monitoring and open honest reporting of the results, free from interference by lobby groups and political meddling.\n",

        "comment":"Please reconsider your proposal for an open hunt on the Double-crested Cormorant. This bird is a native species to the Great Lake region that should be celebrated for its ability to recover from near extinction many years ago according to Cornell Labs All About Birds:\n\u201cDouble-crested Cormorant populations have rebounded from persecution and pesticides over the past couple centuries, and today they are a widespread and abundant species. Populations increased steadily between 1966 and 2015, according to the North American Breeding bird Survey. The North American Waterbird Conservation Plan estimates a continental population of over 740,000 breeding birds. In the 1800s and early 1900s, cormorants were frequently shot, and their numbers declined with westward settlement. They also suffered greatly from pesticides used in the mid-20th century, such as DDT, which cormorants ingested from the fish they ate. The pesticides caused thin eggshells.\"\nThere is so much more that we can learn from this bird before we eradicate it for good, which will surely be the result if hunters are allowed to shoot this bird under the guidelines you are permitting. Please allow more time for thorough research and complete scientific studies on this bird.\nWe need to consider a more careful review of the facts when addressing concerns about the amount of fish cormorants consume. Anglers often argue that cormorants are eating fish that otherwise humans might consume and when addressing this questions, a Toronto Star article by Thomas Walkom, a National Affairs Columnist from June 20, 2016 has some compelling findings.\n\"In fact, according to the federal government\u2019s Canadian Wildlife Service, that\u2019s not true. Studies show that less than two per cent of a cormorant\u2019s diet consists of sport fish, such as lake trout or salmon. And less than one per cent of a cormorant\u2019s diet is made up of the fish that sport fish eat. Cormorants do eat a lot. That\u2019s true. But they tend to eat fish that humans don\u2019t want. As the federal environment department notes in one publication: \u201cStudies have repeatedly shown that, in a natural environment, cormorants feed primarily on small, non-commercial, shallow-water fish.\nIn the book \u201dIn The Devil\u2019s Cormorant\", author Richard King provides an opportunity for us to learn more about this remarkable and resilient bird that in one of the world\u2019s most misunderstood waterfowl.\n\"Behold the cormorant: silent, still, cruciform, and brooding; flashing, soaring, quick as a snake. Evolution has crafted the only creature on Earth that can migrate the length of a continent, dive and hunt deep underwater, perch comfortably on a branch or a wire, walk on land, climb up cliff faces, feed on thousands of different species, and live beside both fresh and salt water in a vast global range of temperatures and altitudes, often in close proximity to man. Long a symbol of gluttony, greed, bad luck, and evil, the cormorant has led a troubled existence in human history, myth, and literature. The birds have been prized as a source of mineral wealth in Peru, hunted to extinction in the Arctic, trained by the Japanese to catch fish, demonized by Milton in Paradise Lost, and reviled, despised, and exterminated by sport and commercial fishermen from Israel to Indianapolis, Toronto to Tierra del Fuego.\"\nAs a concerned citizen, I am asking that we allow a little more time to consider all of the perspectives at hand before we cave in to pressure and eradicate this unique species of bird.\n",

Especially because in the past while their numbers were dwindling, MNR thought to revive the species by creating habitat and laws to help revive them. Now, just because the number of commoronts have grown and probably due to bad stewardship that MNR believe it is time to reduce their numbers, it seems outrageous to slaughter them. I am certain their are more humane ways to reduce their numbers. I suppose one of the ways maybe to introduce natural predators in to their environment and find other ways to disrupt their growth. Culling commoronts by shooting them enmasse would not only kill them but would leave many injured and stress the remaining stock. I suggest more time and forethought go in to this.\nThanks,\nRanga\n",

        "comment":"As a professional biologist and angler, I would like to formally register my opposition to this proposed legislation in its current format.  Recent research and anecdotal evidence from current researchers indicates that cormorants currently foraging in the Great Lakes predominantly consume alewife and gobies, both non-native invasive fish species which are now abundant.  Cormorants do indeed consume commercially\/recreationally important fish species, but research indicates these species are not the bulk of the Great Lakes cormorant diet presently.  As a result, culling large numbers of cormorants \"en masse\" is not guaranteed to have a significant positive impact on commercial\/recreational fisheries, and may even have a negative impact as gobies are direct competitors with native fish species.  More information is required to understand the relationship between cormorants and invasive fish species and whether cormorants are a controlling factor.\nCormorants nest in colonies, often shared with a number of other waterbird species, nearly all of which are afforded protection under the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act (MBCA).  As a result, anyone hunting cormorants nesting in a colony with other species will be in contravention of the MBCA by disturbing protected nesting birds, not to mention the high likelihood for incidental take to occur in the form of accidental harvest of non-target species and loss of eggs and chicks through abandonment.  Federal and provincial agencies struggle to enforce current wildlife laws effectively and there is no additional capacity to enforce either this new legislation or its impacts on existing legislation (MBCA).  Additionally, hunting during the nesting season will cause cormorants to seek out new nesting sites, possibly creating conflict situations with additional landowners.\nIf the main goal of this legislation is to improve commercial and recreational fisheries, there should be provincial data presented with this proposal to indicate that foraging by cormorants is a leading cause of declining fish stocks and that control is warranted.  Anecdotally, the combined effects of irresponsible and illegal harvest of fish, as well as loss of spawning and nursery habitat and direct competition and ecosystem modification by non-native fish species are equally likely causes of poor fishery health.  Reduction of cormorant populations may lead to an increase in goby populations, which, in turn, may have a negative impact on commercial and recreational fish through direct competition for food resources.\nCormorant control measures (culls) have been conducted in Ontario in the past to protect and preserve rare vegetation communities.  Having worked on Great Lakes colonial waterbird colonies, I am well aware of the damage and odor that can accompany a cormorant colony and I am supportive of cormorant control measures when conducted within strict guidelines to accomplish specific goals.\nAssuming that the province can collect or collate data that biologically justifies that cormorant control on this scale will accomplish its intended goals, I suggest that this proposal should be reconsidered and refined based on the following points:\n1. To reduce the potential for contravention of the MBCA, no hunting of cormorants should occur during the nesting season for colonial waterbirds, resulting in a season restricted to the late summer and autumn.\n2. Develop an alternative designation for cormorant rather than \"game bird\" as this insinuates cormorants are hunted for food or sport.  Cormorants are not likely to be considered food by many (any?) and are certainly not \"sporting\" to hunt, as they are clumsy and spend parts of the day unable to fly.\n3. Specific colonies or areas should be targeted on an annual basis to focus control efforts on areas that require it most.\n4. Some main points of the proposed monitoring program should be included in the proposal.  At a minimum, this should include some provincially-supported assessment of the current diet of cormorants, as well as population estimates and a process to allow hunters to report their harvest data.  Monitoring of fish populations in the vicinity of cormorant colonies (both controlled and uncontrolled)  also should also be included in the monitoring program.\nCurrently, I believe there are too many unknowns with regard to this proposal and I feel the government requires more information before it can draft responsible, effective cormorant control legislation that will benefit all Ontarians.\nThank you for providing me with the opportunity to comment.\n",

Allow hunting from a stationary motorboat.\n\u2022       This is likely going to cause a lot of disturbance at the nest site, with non-target birds being affected too. Double-crested Cormorants have been shown to nest with American White Pelican, Black-crowned Night-heron, Great Blue Heron, Herring Gull, Ring-billed Gull, Common Tern and Caspian Tern in Ontario (McLeod and Bondar 1953, Peck and James 1983, Thompson 1981). All of these species are protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act (MBCA) (with the exception of American White Pelican which is only protected under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (FWCA)). Under the MBCA, these birds and their nests cannot be disturbed. The proposal would allow hunters to disturb other colonially nesting birds during their breeding season, which is against the law. The proposal does not mention how it will handle these situations.  Furthermore, what would happen if a hunter accidentally kills one of the non-target species? Will they be charged under the MBCA?\n2.       Create an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to December 31 each year across the province.\n\u2022       The proposed dates essentially constitute the entire time that Double-crested Cormorants spend in Ontario. In the winter months, the majority of them are known to leave the province to overwinter in Florida and the Gulf Coast (Sandilands, 2005). By opening such a long hunting season  - especially during their nesting season - what type of protection will cormorants actually receive under the  Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act? I would like to see some clarification on this. Is the proposal the first step in removing cormorants as a protected species under the act?\nReferences\nMcCloud, J.A.., and G.F. Bondar. 1953.

        "comment":"I do not support this proposal for a number of reasons:\nFirst, a bag limit of 50 per day is excessive and extreme. I can\u2019t think of any wildlife animal (birds, mammals) that can be hunted legally at such high numbers per day with no maximum number for the season. Also, the hunting period spans a 9-month period that includes the breeding period which again is atypical. With the ministry\u2019s focus on conservation, I am puzzled as it leaves me wondering if this is not just a massive cull of these birds. I know that culling activities are legally carried out in Ontario but I prefer that these are regulated and controlled.\nThere are also serious safety concerns to the public and scientists who study these birds. Cormorants are indeed found in high numbers in Ontario and if people can shoot these birds in all areas and from a boat, it poses a safety risk for people who are recreational users of these areas. In addition, colonial waterbirds that co-nest with cormorants (often in very large colonies) would be subject to disturbance and harm during the breeding season which is an especially sensitive period. As well, this would impact chicks of all nesting species as they would likely die due to this disturbance (from heat, lack of food, predation, etc.). Hunting during the breeding season means that not only are adults and juveniles killed directly but that chicks would also suffer and die. Again, this does not seem to be consistent with a responsible and conservation-minded provincial agency.\nI am not opposed to hunting as most hunters consume their game. These birds however are not consumable but are only considered a nuisance. I worry that some hunters may act irresponsibly (as these birds are despised) and with such an extensive hunting season and the high bag limit, the actions of few could endanger the lives of many.\nShould this proposal move forward, greater restrictions need to be placed on hunting cormorants. Personally however, I do not believe that population control implemented by the public is a feasible approach for managing this species.\nI hope these comments are considered in further drafting of this proposal.

As well-phrased in a statement by the Ottawa Field-Naturalists\u2019 Club (OFNC), the current proposal is \u201ca legalized extermination of an ecologically important native species.\u201d At best, the current proposal is a cruel, perverse, and misguided cull. At worst, the proposal risks significant ecological disturbance of sensitive ecosystems. Consistent with the stance of Bird Studies Canada (linked below), \u201cthe proposed changes pose significant harm to a native Ontario wildlife species, have the potential to negatively impact other wildlife species and habitats, and also lack scientific rationale or justification\u201d.\nIn brief, the proposal wholly lacks science, from the setting of an absurd hunting quota, which strangely inflated a bag limit of 10\/day to 50\/day in back-to-back EBR postings, to the exceedingly vague monitoring proposal. It begs to be said that the absence of science in the proposal reads like a pander to a high-ranking and ill-informed government employee disgruntled over cormorants on their lakefront property.\nMy stance in opposition to the proposal is fully in line with that outlined by Bird Studies Canada and Professor Gail Fraser of York University (both sources linked below), with major flaws including but not limited to:\n- The orphaning of young cormorants is a cruel and unusual allowance;\n- Large potential of conflict between hunters and outdoor recreationalists over the geographically broad and lengthy hunting period;\n- Furthermore, I am strongly opposed to amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act that would allow for meat spoilage of a so-called games species;\n- The threat of cormorants to sensitive habitats is localized (e.g., past lethal management in Presqu\u2019ile Provincial Park). Thus, any such threats should be dealt with in a localized manner (e.g., hired sharp-shooter for local population reduction), rather than the blanket, geographically widespread and \u2018public hunter call-to-arms\u2019 strategy outlined in EBR Registry Number 013-4124.\nI am particularly troubled by the absence of attention to protect other sensitive species that share double-crested cormorant habitat. It is noteworthy that Double-crested Cormorants in flight bear a very close visual likeness to rare visitors to Ontario, such as the Neotropic Cormorant and Anhinga. Only under ideal viewing conditions could these species be distinguished, never mind from the bow of a boat with an itchy trigger finger. I would argue that ducks, geese, herons, loons, grebes and just about anything else that flies over water is at risk due the inadvertent misidentification from a hunter, and with such a low likelihood of enforcement (due to the temporal and spatial breadth of this proposal) the killing of non-target species has the potential to be widespread.\nAgain, consistent with a statement from the OFNC, \u201cthe proposal has serious flaws that would be detrimental to the ecosystem and would undermine responsible conservation practices\u201d. While I believe that it may be possible to instate a legal hunt for the Double-crest Cormorant in Ontario, the proposal presented in EBR Registry Number 013-4124 promotes an extremely poor framework. The allowance for spoilage is unacceptable would set a very misguided precedent for \u201cgame\u201d species. I would be highly disappointed to see the OMNRF produce a response stating something of the like that \u201cpublic comments here heard and changes were made in response\u201d, whilst simply reducing the daily bag limit (e.g., from 50 birds\/day to 10 birds\/day), a shortened open season, and some modification of the spoilage allowance, for example. This is a proposal that needs to be redrafted in its entirety with the consultation of expert scientists and scientific resources. At present, I cannot reasonably support any part of EBR Registry Number 013-4124, \u201cProposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\u201d.\nThank you for considering my feedback.\n",

        "comment":"Response to a\nProposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\nProposal: https:\/\/ero.ontario.ca\/notice\/013-4124\nBiases\nI believe it is important to state my biases before stating my position, so you know where I\u2019m coming from.  I am not affiliated with any organization, though I have read a number of responses to this proposal.  I am not a hunter, though I do not have a problem with hunting as long as the hunter seeks to use as much of the animal hunted as he or she is able.  I am not an animal rights activist, but I believe in conservation, ecology and evolution.  I am not a birder, though I do enjoy birding when I get the chance to do it every couple of years.  I am not a scientist, but I am a fan of science.\nReasons for the Proposal\nThe MNRF proposal points out that cormorant populations \u201cdeclined significantly in the Great Lakes from the 1950s to the 1970s primarily due to environmental contaminants affecting reproduction,\u201d (ERO) and that cormorant populations have rebounded since, and have achieved what appears to be a stable population.  That has to be one of the great conservation success stories, isn\u2019t it?  So, what\u2019s the problem?\nThe MNRF proposal also states concerns from \u201csome groups (commercial fishing industry, property owners) and individuals\u201d (ERO) about the impact of cormorant populations on fish and other species populations, island forest habitats, and aesthetics.\nOther respondents (Kroc, others in Further Reading) have pointed out that there is no scientific evidence of cormorants impacting fish populations.  In fact, since cormorants are a native species, their relationship with their native prey species is balanced by natural ecological processes.  In fact, cormorants, being opportunistic with regards to their prey, makes them an important part of any strategy to manage invasive fish species.\nSo, without knowing what the \u201cother species\u201d are, that leaves the island forest habitats and aesthetics reasons, which are really the same thing, aren\u2019t they?  What happens to the trees in arboreal cormorant colonies doesn\u2019t look good.  The trees are killed by the nesting birds, leaving guano covered skeletons.  But, this happens locally.  Normally, the cormorants that nest in a given location return to that location, year after year.  If a colony is successful, then new trees next to the old ones might get killed as new nests are established.  But in a stable colony, the number of dead trees will not change from year to year.  It\u2019s important to point out that this is a natural, native process, and part of the evolutionary processes that act on the trees as well as the cormorants.  Labelling a natural process as ugly is grossly anthropocentric.\nMethod of the Cull\nThe MNRF proposes to utilize the small game hunters of Ontario to engage in what is ostensibly an open, unrestricted hunt of cormorants.  The proposed March to December season is broader than the birds are present in the province.  The 50 birds a day limit (with no hold limit) is practically an invitation to shoot as many birds as the hunter wants.  This is reckless enough to allow Ontario hunters to easily wipe out all cormorants in Ontario in a single season.  For example, if the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters 100,000 members (OFAH) shot an average of 2 \u00bd birds each, they could wipe out the approximately 250,000 cormorants in Ontario (Kroc).  Even if the proposal is amended to restrict the hunt to times outside when cormorants are reproducing (i.e., early spring and fall, as the OFAH proposes), the potential to wipe out the adult population of cormorants in Ontario in a single season with any kind of hunter-based cull remains.\nDespite the dire potential of this plan, I believe that an ethically self-interested hunter, when presented with the reality of the relative inedibility of cormorant flesh, won\u2019t bother to spend the cost of a shell and the effort required to set out to shoot and kill even one bird.  This would be fine if all the hunters in Ontario are ethically self-interested, which I doubt, considering the OFAH\u2019s largely supportive response to the proposal.\nThe OFAH, in their response to this proposal, compares cormorant populations to that of snow geese, and by doing that suggests that the proposed daily limits on cormorants is reasonable compared to the 20\/day limit on snow geese (50\/day in the Hudson\/James Bay area) (OFAH), stating that the daily limits on snow geese have yet to have any real impact on the populations of snow geese.  This is misleading.  The North American population of lesser snow geese is estimated to be 15 million individuals (DU).  This dwarfs the population of cormorants.  Which seems to beg the question, is a quarter million individuals really an indication of an out-of-control population?\nAnecdotal Cautionary Tale\nIn 2015, the US Army Corps of Engineers began a campaign to control the population of cormorants that nested on East Sand Island at the mouth of the Columbia River near Astoria, OR.  This colony was home to more than 16,000 cormorants, the largest in North America at the time, and represented approximately 40% of the cormorant population west of the Rockies.  The Corps oiled the eggs in 6 thousand nests and shot more than 5 thousand birds over the following year.  In mid-May of 2016, the colony experienced a complete collapse; 16,000 cormorants abandoned their nests and the eggs in them in a single day.  Only a few hundred birds returned to the island in 2017.  The rest, it is assumed, spread up-river and established new colonies (CBD).\nThis case illustrates one, probably unintended, consequence if this, or even an amended cull, is enacted: colony abandonment.  Without the cull, cormorants will return to the colonies they went to the previous year.  With a stable population of cormorants in Ontario, these colonies will not change, nor will new colonies likely be established.  However, if even one colony is abandoned, new colonies will be established to replace it the following year.  So, if aesthetics is really a valid reason (perhaps the only potentially valid, if morally questionable, reason left after the other ones have been demonstrated scientifically to be invalid), instigating the proposed cull will very likely result in more colonies being established.\nThe Real Reason?\nThe East Sand Island colony of cormorants used to be the largest in North America.  Now that honour belongs to the colony in Tommy Thompson Park.  That number of cormorants positioned next door to millions of people must look like cormorant populations are completely out-of-control.  It\u2019s natural for humans to look at a thing and assume that all other things like it are the same.  In this case, however, humans would be wrong.  The colony in Tommy Thompson Park is big, bigger than the East Sand Island colony ever was.  The damage to the forest of the park is easily visible from various yacht clubs, Cherry Beach and the Toronto Islands.  Rather than being celebrated for the amazing feat of nature that the colony represents, people complain about the dead, unsightly trees.\nI\u2019m certain the OFAH would also back down from its position, once they can be shown that cormorants not only do not affect fish stock levels, but are a part of the natural life-cycle of those fish, increasing the evolutionary viability of those species.  A cormorant colony should be a welcome sight to an angler, since its presence indicates a thriving fish population, for without the fish, there wouldn\u2019t be a colony.\nAn Alternative Proposal\nThe scapegoating of native species is an old world, imperial, father-knows-best practice.  There is no scientific evidence to support the cull, or the reasons given for it.  Yet, the stereotype of cormorants as fish guzzling monsters persists.  Which is strange, since there are many different piscivorous bird species in Ontario.  Is the prejudice because cormorants are black?  Is it because of their unsightly tree nesting colonies?  Regardless, it is unfairly bestowed.\nI suggest, as an alternative to the proposed cull, an education program aimed at the individuals and groups that believe that cormorants are pests.  Present them with the research on the lack of impact of cormorant populations on fish stock levels.  Talk about evolutionary and ecological processes and the web of predation that sustains the dynamic populations of native species, stabilizing their populations over time.  And, especially, make sure they realize the conservation miracle that allowed cormorant populations to recover after DDT ceased to be used.  And maybe statements about how cormorant populations have exploded since the 1970s will said only in celebration of how humans saved cormorants from the brink of extinction.\nCited Sources\nERO: Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, \u201cProposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\u201d, https:\/\/ero.ontario.ca\/notice\/013-4124, downloaded 2019-01-03.\nKroc: Edward Kroc, \u201cThe Government of Ontario proposes a Double-crested Cormorant hunt that could easily eradicate the species from the Great Lakes in a single year\u201d, https:\/\/ekroc.weebly.com\/blog\/the-government-of-ontario-proposes-a-doub\u2026, downloaded 2019-01-03.\nOFAH: Lauren Tonelli, \u201cERO Number 013-4124: Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\u201d, Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, https:\/\/www.ofah.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/ERO-013-4124-cormorants\u2026, downloaded 2019-01-03.\nDU: Dale D.

        "comment":"Dear Minister Yakabuski,\nRe: EBR 013-4124: Proposal to establish a hunting season for double-crested cormorants in Ontario\nI tried to separate my comments from the proposal wording using both colour and italics but neither worked, so I tried separating them.\nI strongly oppose the proposal for a hunting season for the double-crested cormorant.\nthe latest information indicating Great Lakes populations have since stabilized or declined\nIf the latest information indicates that populations have even declined, perhaps focus should be on reasons for decline rather than on instigating a new reason.  Following the instigation of the hunt, the Ministry says that it\n will implement a cormorant monitoring program to assess population status and trends. Monitoring of cormorants will allow the Ministry to assess the impacts of the hunting season and to adjust cormorant hunting regulations if necessary to address any concerns about population sustainability.\nThis monitoring programme should be implemented before even considering instigating a hunt so that the hunt, its regulations and any amendments thereto are all based on the same good science!\nCreate a hunting season for double-crested cormorant beginning in 2019\nThis should be postponed until the monitoring programme is up and running and has produced some meaningful data.\nAs for the fishing industry, research has shown that cormorants feed mainly on non-game, non-commercial fish, and include alien and invasive, non-native species (e.g. round goby).\nSome people complain about the smell of the bird's guano, yet the smell of dead and rotting birds will be much worse!  Unlike for all other game birds, the proposed cormorant hunting season is right through the breeding season which means that baby birds will be left to starve to death, rot and stink much worse than the guano!\nProposed regulations include:\n1. List the double-crested cormorant as a \u201cGame Bird\u201d. Hunters would be required to have an outdoors card and small game licence to hunt double-crested cormorants, similar to other species of game birds.\nThis is just a money grab that will encourage those who can't be bothered to do real hunting to, in some cases, just walk out their door and go on a shooting spree.\n2. Create an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to December 31 each year across the province.\n3. Create an exemption allowing small game licences to be valid for double-crested cormorant hunting in central and northern Ontario from June 16 to August 31 each year.\nThis is completely unacceptable!  All other game bird hunts are conducted in autumn and winter and for a very few species or locations, into very early spring.  This proposal is in violation of the federal Migratory Bird Convention Act which protects migratory species during the nesting season!  Cormorants do not nest in solitude.  They often nest with other colonial nesting species such as great blue herons, great egrets (listed provincially, as very rare in Ontario) and black-crowned night herons (listed as rare-uncommon in Ontario), as well as other bird species.  Shooting will disrupt all the nesting birds and could certainly lead to nest abandonment by these other species. Eggs could be left unhatched and nestlings to starve or die of exposure when parents are frightened away or accidentally shot.  Some cormorant colonies are located near bald eagle nests.  Both species suffered dramatically from pesticide. Both eat fish.   Much money, time and effort has been spent in bald eagle recovery.  It is currently listed in Ontario as common in the breeding season.  Both species are considered to be recovery success stories.  The proposal's conditions that require the person to retrieve and dispose of the carcass will further disrupt and distress breeding birds. Further, this could lead to someone throwing the bodies into the nearest garbage can where they will rot with a most putrid smell!  This would further chase residents and tourists out of the area.  The breeding season must be omitted from the hunting schedule.\nHunters will likely not be savy enough to distinguish between the double-crested and other species of cormorants which occasionally visit Ontario.  Any and all would be shot.  And, as an unusual bird, of any sort, attracts many, even many hundreds of birders, they too could be at risk of being accidentally shot.\n6.  Allow hunting from a stationary motorboat.\nEven a 'stationary' boat moves under the movements of the people therein and any waves.  Collateral damage to non-target species must be avoided, especially to humans!\n\tThe proposed hunting season coincides with the peak in Ontario outdoor activity: whether strolling along a lakeside, swimming, boating, beach sunbathing, partaking in water sports, kayaking, bird-watching, photography, etc.  No one wants to be shot or be shot at, or to have that happen to someone they know.\nWe cold be in a boat on one side of an island watching the birds, and someone in a boat on the other side could shoot toward us.  Neither may have any way of knowing that the other is there until too late.  Summer hunting will deter tourists and residents alike from enjoying Ontario summer.\n4. Establish a bag limit of 50 cormorants\/day with no possession limit.\nThis is outrageous!  50\/day is a minimum of 5-fold higher than any other game bird (the closest being the non-native ring-necked pheasant with 10).\nThis would mean that one shooter daily could murder as many as 14,600 cormorants in a single year!\nThe no possession limit seems to imply that one could catch\/trap additional birds beyond the bag limit.  Surely this is unsustainable!  Where is the data to back this up?\nThe Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act currently prohibits anyone who kills game wildlife (including game birds), or who possesses game wildlife killed by hunting, from allowing that meat to spoil.\nSurely this was so that hunting had a food purpose and was not just wanton killing ,  not just for fun or for a few animal parts, but so that an animal lost its life for some 'semi-descent' purpose.  Also it would not promote disease, smell or an unwanted increase in scavengers.  Since cormorants are purportedly not good tasting, hunters may be tempted to shoot and leave, therefore the requirement of retrieving the carcass must be part of the regulation.  However, because this would cause even more disruption to all breeding birds, the breeding season must be omitted from the hunting schedule!\nThis proposal would add provisions to the Act, so that persons who lawfully hunt (or possess) cormorants could be exempt from this requirement and would be subject to conditions that require the person to retrieve and dispose of the carcass.\nThis isn't a hunt.  This is simply a cull.  Some will be shot, others will die long agonizing deaths.\nRegulatory impact statement\nThe anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral. The double-crested cormorant is abundant in Ontario and anticipated levels of harvest aren\u2019t expected to affect sustainability.\nAt a maximum of 14,600\/hunter\/year, this may not be true.\nHunters will continue to be reminded to properly identify their targets to avoid conflicts with migratory game birds and other waterbirds.\n Who will train them? Different cormorant species are difficult to tell apart, and grebes and loons are similar.  If birders have difficulty how will hunters identify them?\nI summary, I am against the proposed double-crested cormorant hunt, particularly for the length of time of the hunt, the bag limit and the unlimited possession.\nK.

        "comment":"I became a waterfowl hunter and outdoorsman as a teenager in the 1960s, and later traded in the shotgun for a camera. Wildlife management and ethics around hunting are of interest to me. I support waterfowl hunting but am strongly opposed to the proposed Cormorant hunt and earlier commented on the lack of science-based evidence to support the need for such a hunt.  In my view the MNR's proposal is uncharacteristically ill-conceived and indicative of poor public policy.  Here are four reasons, mostly economic in nature, for this view that I would like considered by the MNR:\n1.\tThe proposed Cormorant hunt is not part of an integrated, forward-thinking wildlife management and ecosystem strategy -   For example, what is MNR\u2019s plan for when the near term inevitability of Asian Carp entering and breeding in the Great Lakes and Ontario\u2019s rivers happens?  As has been the case in the US, Asian Carp will wreak havoc on Ontario\u2019s commercial and recreational fisheries by reducing game fish populations.  How do Double Crested Cormorants fit into the future MNR strategy to manage this invasive and very problematic fish species?  It seems to me that when this happens, in addition to other strategies, we will need every available Cormorant in Ontario working overtime eating Asian Carp.  Some relatively small and isolated islands and shorelines damaged by Cormorant droppings is a small price to pay for the greater beneficial purpose they can serve in controlling the Asian Carp population when it gets to our waters.  Where is evidence of an integrated, forward policy-making context from MNR?   In this light it would be very easy for commercial and sports fishermen, cottagers and recreational boaters to get behind a policy that basically leaves the Cormorants alone as part of the larger ecosystem and renders the current proposal to begin a large scale slaughter of Cormorants as short-sighted.  What MNR Deputy Minister and Minister would want to have the Cormorant slaughter policy as a leadership legacy?\nAnd, to this we can certainly add the inevitable disturbance to other waterfowl and shorebirds of a three-season hunt, that includes their breeding season. As well, the inevitable killing and injuring of other species misidentified as Cormorants.\n2.\tThis proposal conflicts with the government\u2019s important \u201cOntario Open For Business\u201d messaging \u2013 We are in fierce competition with the US to attract new businesses, immigrant professionals, and direct foreign investment to Ontario.  Particularly new economy businesses and the highly qualified talent that will help them grow, create jobs, and enhance Ontario\u2019s tax base.  A prime consideration for these companies and their employees in any relocation is quality of life, and that includes sound environmental stewardship and values.  Regressive government policy such as the proposed Cormorant hunt sends exactly the wrong message to prospective immigrants and good corporate citizens looking to relocate to Ontario.  Does the Minister responsible for economic development in Ontario really want to have to explain to these prospects how the government's policy of slaughtering Cormorants will enhance their quality of life if they relocate to Ontario?\n3.\tThe proposed Cormorant hunt will cause reputational and economic damage to the Ontario Tourism industry \u2013 Tourists come to Ontario in large part, to enjoy a peaceful outdoors experience, particularly during summer months -   not to be unwillingly affected by a Cormorant hunt.  Who wants to rent a cottage on a lake in June and be woken up at sunrise by shotgun blasts from hunters?  Who wants to explain to the kids that the injured bird flopping around in the water was carrying food to its nestlings, who will now die a miserable death by dehydration and starvation?  Which resort owner wants to map out for tourists who sport fish, the areas on a public Ontario lake that are no-go because the tourists may be at risk from shotgun pellets?  Has MNR actually given any thought to these questions?  The minister responsible for tourism in Ontario should be concerned because this proposal, if implemented, has much potential for reputational and economic damage to our tourism industry.\n4.  This proposal will, in effect, create an unethical slaughter of Cormorants (rather than a \"hunt\") and incent it to be commercialized \u2013 The construct of this policy proposal to hunt Cormorants (long open season during nesting, 50 bag limit, no accountability for dead and injured birds), will effectively turn it into a slaughter rather than a hunt.  Good commercial hunting guides may get involved and do their best to bring some semblance of ethics to the hunt, however by design this proposed hunt will attract people looking to make a quick buck and the worse type of hunter - those who hunt to kill with no respect for the wildlife they are destroying. Ethical hunters do not treat wildlife as targets, do not kill wildlife for the sake of it, and will not be interested in the hunt.  It is absurd, and a low point in wildlife management that the MNR is proposing such a hunt.  We really can do better in Ontario.  This hunt, if it occurs, will serve as a terrible example of hunting ethics for young aspiring future hunters and as such really does a disservice to Ontarians.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing because I have grave concerns about all aspects of the proposal to list the double-crested cormorant as a \u201cGame Bird\u201d.  This proposed policy is based on beliefs and aesthetics, and an arbitrary dislike of the birds, rather than sound conservation science principles, which is really quite unreasonable.  They eat fish - but so do Ospreys, Bald Eagles, Loons, etc., and no-one is proposing creating hunting opportunities to limit their numbers.  Their feces affects the environment by killing trees in some small areas - yes, but there are many positive effects on the ecosystem created by the natural biodiversity that this fosters.  These are a native species - one whose numbers are not out-of-control.  They should be allowed to exist in peace, at least until there is strong scientific evidence to support a reasoned intervention.\nCreating an open hunting season for double-crested cormorant from March 15 to December 31 effectively results in the birds being legally hunted all-year round, since they typically do not reside in Ontario during the winter months.  This is unacceptable, as it encompasses even the breeding season, which really is a cruel and unethical practice - not to mention that it flies in the face of established sustainable conservation management practices.  Allowing hunting during this time will affect not only these birds, but any bird that breeds and nests nearby.\nCreating an exemption allowing small game licences to be valid for double-crested cormorant hunting in central and northern Ontario from June 16 to August 31 each year is dangerous - this is a time when birders, campers and boaters are on the lake, enjoying the all-too-short summer months. Allowing hunting from a stationary motorboat only further exacerbates the potential for hunting 'accidents.'\nEstablishing a bag limit of 50 cormorants\/day with no possession limit is without scientific merit.  It is a seemingly arbitrary high number, and would result in a very small number of individuals being able to decimate the populations in Ontario. Reclassifying the cormorant as a game bird seems dishonest at worst, and disingenuous at best \u2013 cormorants are largely considered inedible. Acknowledging this, the proposal includes adding a provision allowing meat to spoil.\nI sincerely hope that cooler heads prevail and that this proposal is not permitted to go ahead.  It is not reasonable and not warranted.  Thank you for providing the venue for public feedback.\n",

I am not a hunter but frankly I don't think anyone will leave with 50 in a day and it proposes risk to other species as well as humans.\nI've shared a link to an article below that suggests cormorants may have existed in far greater numbers pre-European contact which is certainly something I think should be taken into consideration.\n",

        "comment":"\"Harvesting\" implies keeping the game for food. The proposed change in legislation to deal with a perceived problem of one inedible species is not warranted. Hunters should only be allowed to take wildlife for food. Those who wish to do target practice should have to keep their weapons at a range and practice their skills on inanimate targets, and the weapons kept under secure lock and key between time. Reducing any one species out of the mix of Nature upsets the balance which apparently has been achieved by the cormorants who will now control the population of fish which are pushing other desirable fish out of the mix. Just as shooting wolves to try to save caribou has been a disaster, so allowing the slaughter of corporate will create another ecological disaster. Leave Nature to bring balance without human meddling.\n",

        "comment":"Hello Ontario,\nI am a fairly good shot at bird hunting.  I have furnished my family's table with duck and geese and partridge over the years. I also live in the GTA. I am wondering what I would do if I were to bag daily limit of  the 50 cormorants a day limit during the season (which I am not sure of the duration according to the proposed legislation change)  What is the cormorant season in the GTA?  In any-case what would I do with the cormorant carcasses if I shot 50 of these  pesky birds.  They are clearly not edible. I don't think my green bin would accommodate them and my back yard in downtown Toronto is not big enough to bury them.   I an looking forward to the carnage but need advice as to the end result.\n",

        "comment":"I do not believe that allowing there to be an open season on double-crested cormorants is a good proposal. The birds declined in population for twenty years and then made a healthy comeback. If there population growth is truly a problem why not wait until nature takes its course and the population declines on its own. If in the future cormorants become a species that very seriously affects other species than the government should take more scientific action. Letting any hunter with a permit shoot fifty cormorants per day is not very scientific or easily controlled. In the write up about the cormorant situation it says that the impact of this proposal will be neutral therefore what is the point, it is a lot easier to take out a population than it is to rebuild it. With so many endangered species is it really so made that a once declining population is now thriving.\n",

If the impact of hunting is neutral than why do it.\nThere should be an actual defined need and outcomes proposed.\nThis is not sustainable and should be have more study around it before moving forward.\n",

        "comment":"I was horrified to hear of this proposal. It is hard to believe in this day and age that this would even be an idea never mind an action. Cormorants seem to be disliked by many people but it doesn\u2019t mean they need to be slaughtered or used for target practice especially in breeding season where they share habitat with other species. Unbelievable. I am so ashamed that the Ontario government would do this.\nPlease do not allow this to happen.\n",
