We have miles of undeveloed roads that municipalities can't afford to maintain, property owners with large properties on these roads who can't afford to keep the home they grew up in, and they are not allowed to sell a few lots to generate income. Large property owners are forced to sell their family home to survive. People that want to move to rural areas are not looking to live in settlement areas, they are moving to rural areas to get away from settlement areas. Let rural areas develop without forcing them to create more sudivisions.\nThe Provincial Policy Statement, Official Plans, Zoning By-Laws, and Building Codes are too restrictive. The more restrictive they are the more it costs to enforce these regulations. Municipalities are forced to pass these costs on to the tax payers.

        "comment":"I strongly object to the proposed residential lot creation policies for prime agricultural areas provided in section 4.3.3 of the revised Provincial Policy Statement. These lot creation policies offend all good planning principles.\nPrime agricultural land is a finite resource in Ontario. Already, much of our most productive prime agricultural land has been lost to development. Further opening up prime agricultural areas to development will diminish the already limited supply of prime agricultural land, resulting in negative repercussions for our agricultural industry, food supply and food sovereignty. Once this resource is gone, we cannot get it back. You cannot grow food on concrete.\nMoreover, most of our prime agricultural lands are in rural areas, which have limited employment options and limited health and social services. By increasing potential for residential development in prime agricultural areas, you are increasing the reliance on personal vehicles, as the owners of these new lots would most likely need to drive to work, to school and to access services. Not only does this contribute to CO2 emissions and climate change, it also puts increased pressure on rural roadways. Rural municipalities already struggle to maintain rural roads to an appropriate quality. Increasing residential development will only further deteriorate these roads and pass financial pressure and burden onto the municipality.\nIncreased lot creation in prime agricultural areas will no doubt also lead to increased farm and non-farm conflict. Meeting MDS setbacks is not enough to negate the complaints from the non-farm community about normal farm practices such as operating equipment, using chemical herbicides, and spreading manure. Drive any road during harvest season, and you will already see vehicles attempting unsafe passes, or expressing frustration with slow moving farm vehicles. Increased non-farm residency of prime agricultural areas enhances the risk of these complaints and conflicts, which threatens the longevity of the primary agricultural operation.\nFurther, not allowing municipalities to create more restrictive policies is an offense to local autonomy.\nWhile I strongly object to any residential lot creation in prime agricultural areas, save and except for surplus farm residences under the existing policy, if the government MUST open up prime agricultural areas to residential lot creation I suggest the following amendments:\nA maximum of ONE new residential lot may be created from an parcel of land as it existed as of January 1, 2023 where the existing parcel is AT LEAST 40 ha in area\nThe new proposed lot shall be limited to a MAXIMUM size of 1 acre. I note that the existing language regarding \u201cminimum size required to accommodate the use\u201d is not strict enough. You are guaranteed to receive requests for estate lots of 2-5 acres, where the rationale for the minimum size is based on the size of a house, pool, etc.\nIt must be demonstrated through an Agricultural Impact Study completed by a qualified professional that the lands proposed to be severed have not and cannot feasibly be used for agriculture due to site-specific constraints (i.e., presence of natural features), subject to the natural heritage policies of the PPS (which I note are still outstanding).\nI would note that studies have been completed which demonstrate that the solution to our housing crisis is NOT opening up more land for development. We have enough land already designated for development and do not need to further attack our prime agricultural areas. It is a simple concept - we need to build UP not OUT. We need to build housing which is affordable (guaranteed that single detached lots in prime agricultural areas will not be - this will be \u201cprime\u201d real estate). We need to build housing that is within walking distance of employment, recreational and health, or where public transit can be used - so that households of all incomes can access all services. Again, opening up prime agricultural land is certainly NOT required to build more homes, and does not make sense if we want properly planned communities. Lets not repeat the planning failures of our past.\n",

This is unacceptable and is in no way consistent with the balance of PPS and the long-term protection of farm land. We hear that hundreds of acres of productive land are lost to development every year. Do we need more housing? Yes, but at the expense of forever losing the farm land that feeds the people that will live in those houses. The introduction of more non-farm residential uses into the agricultural areas is like building houses in the middle of an industrial subdivision. Agriculture is an industry and is no more compatible with residential development then a slaughter house would be within a residential subdivision.

And this government's own housing taskforce stated, there is absolutely no need to open up more natural or agricultural lands to address the housing crisis, yet for some strange reason the government has chosen to ignore its own taskforce's recommendations.\nFrom everything I've seen from this government's attack on environmental and land use policies (for example, Bill 23), it certainly looks as though all that this government cares about is further enriching large developers, a startling number of whom happen to be great friends of the leader of the PC government. In summary, these proposed changes to Ontario's land use planning policies, do nothing to address the affordable housing crisis, and do everything to worsen the environmental crisis - which is existential crisis that threatens all of us, including the politicians in this government and land developers, and to ignore such a thing is the height of stupidity - this proposal should be withdrawn, and  previous, stronger land use planning rules should be restored.

        "comment":"I appreciate the consideration of updating the Provincial Policy Statement.\nAs the owner of one of the largest development consulting firms (Planning, Architecture and Engineering) in Ontario, we have seen a number of unnecessary development hurdles over the years.\nA few suggestions:\n1.  In Rural jurisdictions, there needs to be more flexibility for development on partial services.  A number of large commercial and industrial developments have been held up on properly zoned commercial\/industrial sites due to lack of sanitary sewers.  These properties could be easily subdivided and developed (with proper zoning) but the County will not let them be subdivided on partial services due to the existing PPS.  This creates large islands of properly zoned, developable land with no sanitary services (but all other services).  Waterloo Biofilter systems has  developed advanced septic systems which completely eliminate the risk of development on these systems.  It's also far more economical than extending the sewers in most cases.\n2.  In Rural jurisdictions there needs to be more onus on Municipalities' to provide sanitary capacity within settlement boundaries.  We have had several residential developments delayed by years due to lack of foresight and investment by the Municipalities ultimately leading to lack of capacity in their systems.  Although these Municipalities are working with the developers, the process of increasing capacity through Municipal Class EA's needs to be streamlined.\n3.  We have had some large developments proposed but due to town boundaries, two municipalities need to cooperate on servicing or outright refuse to provide sanitary services to a development on their border.  There needs to be a formalized way for these developments to proceed.\n4.  We have had a number of properties that are zoned commercial, where we have proposed a mixed use development with commercial on the main floor and residential above.  Unfortunately some Municipalities see this as an opportunity to request Official Plan Amendments which significantly delays the development of large mixed use projects.  It would be very helpful if OPA's were not required for residential development above the zoned use.  There should be a preference for density in urban areas.\n5.  It would be helpful if Conservation Authorities were less involved in development proposals and this responsibility was given to the Municipalities to oversee (ie. Storm water management etc.).  We have had a number of developments held up due to lack of response from Conservation Authorities.\nThanks for your consideration.\n",

This will cause fragmentation of farm land and is the reason why rezoning the retained land as Agricultural Purposes Only(APO) is used.\n\"Provide flexibility for municipalities to allow for more residential development in rural settlements and multi-lot residential development on rural lands,.....\"\nI find this ironic because it is the Province who has restricted residential development in some rural settlements areas  because a rural highway runs through the rural settlement area(s). Perhaps look at this because your MTO restrictions cause issues too.\nAnd if you start allowing more development on rural lands(aka sprawl), I sure hope this is in areas that have poor soil quality unsuitable to agriculture and not near wetlands and ASNI and provincially Significant Woodlands.  Many rural areas have no municipal water and waste water infrastructure and have nome to very poor public transit service. This policy about more building in rural areas(excluding already established rural settlement areas) further emphasizes car use.\n\"Require municipalities to align land use planning policies with housing policies, including addressing homelessness and facilitating development of a full range of housing options and affordability levels to meet local needs.\"\nWhere exactly do you expect municipalities to find the money to build more social housing? They want more housing types but they have to be within the exisitng urban boundary to keep infrastructure costs down. This is a federal and provincial responsibility that has been dropped onto municipal governments who are already struggling to try and keep taxes reasonable for their constituents while trying to deal with already crumbling infrastructure. You've already removed their ability to charge development fees in some circumstances and now require refunding of application fees if they don't meet strict timelines. Municipalities cannot run a deficit. The province and the federal governments need to get back into building purpose built rentals.\n\"Provide a simplified and flexible approach for municipalities to undertake settlement area boundary expansions. Municipalities would be allowed to create new Settlement Areas and would not be required to demonstrate the need for expansion\".\nWhile I agree with making things more flexible, instead of not needing to demonstrate need for expansion, have them be able to request it at anytime, not just during OP reviews, but still have them need to justify the need.\n\"Require municipalities to plan for stormwater management, water and wastewater infrastructure, and waste management systems to accommodate growth \"\nPretty sure this already happens.  But it is a proven fact that expansion is a giant pyramid scheme that doesn't pay for itself. The province needs to encourage infill development and more mixed use within the current boundaries first, with upgrades to existing infrastructure to support those uses already existing.\n\"Require municipalities to designate specialty crop areas and prime agricultural areas, eliminating the requirement to use the provincially-mapped Agricultural System\".\nThis will require the municipalities to have to hire experts in this field of work and result in inconsistencies throughout the Province.   Again, dumping a provincial responsibility onto already cash strapped municipalities. The Provincial mapping system is important.\n\"Require municipalities to\u00a0protect specialty crop areas and maintain minimum separation distances\u00a0between livestock operations and houses, and promote an agricultural systems approach to support the agri-food network\"\nThis is already a thing.

This practice was utilized pre-1990 for \"retirement lots\" for farmers which has proved to only be problematic and a nightmare for farmers looking to expand livestock facilities, and create issues with land use combability. There was a reason this was eliminated as it has already proven to not work. Once these lots are created, it is never undone. Continue on with allowing additional dwelling units on farms, in close proximity to the other dwellings to minimize land use compatibility issues.\nInstead, focus on setting a maximum lot area for which a lot could qualify for severance. For instance, there are several 2-10 acre parcels on which farming is not a land use at all, and there is effectively 9 acres of grass, but current policy framework would not allow these lands to be divided. A 100 acre farm should not be further fragmented. Focus on what is already existing and not already a viable farm operation.

McMansions will continue to appear resulting in multigenerational living in houses not designed for it - watch for further paving of front yards to accommodate vehicles impacting removal of snow and drainage of water.\nThis is a step back, not a step forward.\n",

Simply tossing all of this aside is irresponsible and dangerous as a precedent.\nThe Waterloo official Plan is award winning and used as a model in parts of North America. It does not deserve to be ignored and overturned.\nThe new suggested boundaries do not make any sense. Some cannot be serviced, and some threaten biodiversity, wood lots and tree cover, wetlands and recharge areas. I suggest you take a look at the Tier 3 Water Budgeting report done recently in Wellington County as well.\nThe provinces own task force stated that enough land was set aside for growth and housing.

Firstly, the change that remove the word affordable housing and will move from an income based model to being percentage based on the housing market. As the housing market continues to rise, this is not a feasible solution. As someone who has worked expropriation before, the continued rising rental costs need to be considered affordable with a minimum age income. Otherwise, there is a high-risk of homelessness and individuals being pushed into unsafe living conditions simply because they cannot find anywhere else viable with their income. Subsidized programs are pushed to their limit with the waiting periods a minimum of two years. Our most vulnerable will be hit the hardest by these changes. I urge you to reconsider.\nIn addition to this, the changes to protection about agriculture are concerning. As someone who has grown up in a rural area, I've been slowly watching farmland be swallowed up by developments. We only have so much farmland and it is important that we protect our farmlands in order to have local reliable food sources for our future generations. As an Indigenous person, we work to make decision around the seven generations model. These changes seem focused on short-term benefits without thinking of the long-term repercussions. We must act in a way that will protect our lands, environment, and peoples for many years to come.\n",

Your job is to manage the province in a way that protects the health and welfare of the people. Controlling growth and protecting the agricultural system and the natural heritage system are fundamental. Using a housing crisis as an excuse to get rid of all the rules that protect us in the long run is totally unacceptable.\nIt is dangerous to open up the agricultural system to growth as the water table is not reliable. People move to the country expecting their well to meet their needs but this is not guaranteed. When they run out of water they call on the government to supply them with water. Is the Provincial government going to step in and help these people? Not a chance. But you will be the cause of their predicament.\nI personally own a 5 acre field that is rented to a farmer. If 3 lots are taken off of this field, it will no longer be viable for the farmer to travel to this field. So automatically 5 acres of prime agricultural land will be lost. Multiply this across Ontario. It is a tragic loss of farmland that is totally unnecessary.\nThe government should retract this proposed legislation and concentrate on reducing zoning restrictions in urban areas where services are available or can be upgraded without resorting to sprawl.\nFurthermore the government should re-enter the subsidized housing market and help those who need housing the most to get that housing.\n",

These major losses are made in favour of production of new housing, when there has been no demonstrated NEED for additional land for housing in the Province or GGH - and certainly not enough to justify such major changes to these areas of public interest concern. Many of the proposed changes will encourage low density, car-oriented development rather than development that is more environmentally sustainable by walking or transit.\nThe elimination of a Municipal Comprehensive Review  eliminates the requirement to study the serviceability and costs of infrastructure to develop new lands, in order to identify which areas would be the most efficient to develop (. . . or whether lands can be economically serviced, at all). The burden for major expansions of infrastructure will fall to local taxpayers and to all taxpayers for provincially- funded components. The Growth Plan was created (in part) because of concerns for Infrastructure funding and the best deployment of public resources in planning for growth. This valid concern is totally ignored in the new PPS.\nThe rights of citizens and of municipalities is also undermined by these changes, in favour of Provincial decisions that may be arbitrary or that favour specific interests, including specific land owners - the latter being very evident in the approval of Minister's Zoning Orders. In many cases, the approval of new land by such mechanisms is merely providing a financial windfall for specific owners who then take a profit from development permissions and sell the land, without adding any housing.\nThere are far less impactful means of increasing land available for housing, if indeed there IS a need for that, than these major changes to public interest concerns and fiscal responsibility.\n",

This enforcing of agreements also takes away the option for Cities to act responsibly.\n- This is not about protecting tenants - they, too, will have to pay higher taxes (though via their landlords) to finance infrastructure for big new houses.\n- The affordable housing crisis will actually worsen, as construction workers who are needed inside the cities will be diverted to construction of those big new houses we can fully expect to be the product of this proposal.\nThank you for your attention.\n",

Prior governments, even conservative ones looked to conservation authorities for expert guidance on what areas could feasibly be built on and which ones couldn't. This government only listens to developers that have donated money to their reelection campaign, and as a result, we will needlessly destroy valuable habitats and perhaps farm land to enrich these developers when much more feasible land exists.\nI call on this government to work with experts at conservation authorities and municipalities, who have spent years obtaining the knowledge to decide where municipalities can responsibly expand to, rather than randomly choosing valuable land to spoil in the name of urban sprawl.\n",

Why has this government gagged municipalities, the level of government closest to residents ... at the same time this government refuses to consult seriously with the public? This careless top-down approach by the provincial government will set Ontario back to the middle of the last century.\nResidents are not properly consulted because this Conservative government is intent on paving most of Ontario to benefit its development cronies; however, residents as taxpayers will be expected to pay for this dismal backward march to the 1950s, inclusive of a new and ballooning population, all of whom will require healthcare, housing, education and other public services, including costly new infrastructure scaled to meet the size of the rapid cumulative population growth.\nThe province is throwing out the Provincially-Mapped Agricultural System, directing municipalities to designate a few specialty crop areas. What will be grown in these areas? According to this document, it will likely be highways, houses, and some grass.  At this time of rampant climate change, Ontario has been fortunate to benefit from local agriculture, but this government's determination to pave over more farmland spells the end for sustainable and self-sufficient agricultural production.  The first thing everyone needs is FOOD. Think about that. The prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan are beset by increasingly hot weather, wildfires, and drought, thereby  decreasing agricultural yields, while farmers in Manitoba are experiencing more severe spring flooding, Climate change is already thrashing Canada's farmlands. Farmlands need more protection, not more paving!\nSpeaking of climate change, what has the provincial government done recently for the homeowners from Barrie to Uxbridge to Ottawa whose homes have been pummeled by severe weather, including tornadoes. since 2021 and even earlier?  You may remember the last severe storm hit Ontario at the end of May 2022, just before the provincial election. How many of those residents were able to vote while facing power outages and downed trees and powerlines?\nThe heading, Balance Housing with Resources, is comical coming from this government, but it is also a total insult to the thinking public. THERE IS NO BALANCE HERE. This Conservative government  has no concept of balance.  The Ford government has no other focus aside from housing. This government's downgrading of conservation authorities and the jettisoning of the CAs\u2019 central role in watershed planning, indicate flooding and water pollution are NOT concerns for this Conservative government, while it continues to fly by the seat of its pants in the complete absence of any serious planning.\nStop listening to developers and start listening to citizens\/taxpayers who pay the entire freight for this government\u2019s colossal gravy train and free ride for developers.\nI am completely disgusted with this undemocratic government.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the Environmental Registry of Ontario (\u201cERO\u201d) posting 019-6813 regarding the review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy (proposed PPS, 2023) instrument.\nPlease note that the following comments and recommendations are provided by City of Mississauga staff and have been endorsed by City Council on its May 3, 2023 meeting.  The City Council endorsed Corporate Report and Appendix is linked below.\nThe following contains a summary of the City of Mississauga's comments on the ERO 019-6813. In addition, a detailed comment table is attached to this submission.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe City of Mississauga supports efforts to increase housing supply.  The City recognizes that solving the housing affordability crisis will take significant effort, bold moves from all those involved in housing approval and development, and innovative approaches to planning and construction.\nHowever, measures to expedite housing supply should balance different planning priorities. The Province should not implement measures that would generate short-term benefits while creating long-term negative impacts on the natural environment, agricultural systems, infrastructure and transit delivery, economic prosperity, and the creation of complete communities.\nWhile staff want to see the creation of more housing in the GGH, it is important that new developments do not undermine access to services and jobs near where residents live, and that major cost savings can be achieved by coordinating growth and infrastructure delivery.\nStaff are most concerned with proposed changes to the GGH\u2019s employment planning regime. Mississauga has some of the most economically important employment lands in Canada and the operations of some of these areas could be significantly impacted. Staff suggest the current approach where employment lands can be considered for re-designation through the Municipal Comprehensive Review process worked well.\nThrough the City\u2019s Action Plan for New Housing, Mississauga has demonstrated it has approvals in place or endorsed by Council to support 246,000 new units (more than double Mississauga\u2019s 120,000 unit housing target set by the Province). The Regional Planning Commissioners of Ontario (RPCO) also reported that approvals are also in place for 1.25M units (almost reaching the Province\u2019s target of 1.5M homes). Against this backdrop, it is unclear how the Province can justify releasing more lands to support residential development that are so important for local employment opportunities, the economy and our natural environment.\nPROPOSED PROVINCIAL POLICY STATEMENT, 2023\nSince 2006, the Growth Plan helped to manage growth in the GGH by laying out an urban structure that aligned growth with infrastructure investments, promoted complete communities, a range and mix of housing forms, and protected lands for natural heritage, prime agriculture and employment. The PPS augmented the Growth Plan with broader based policy directions, again promoting a well-managed and balanced approach to growth province-wide. The proposed PPS, 2023, seems to be based on two assumptions. First, that there needs to be more residential land designated to meet growth targets.  And second, an individual development application based approach to employment land-use changes is preferable to the current comprehensive review approach.\nStaff disagree with both of these points and suggest the Province may not fully grasp the land economic implications of the proposed changes. Specifically, the changes could lead to an immediate spike in the land values in employment areas with prospective purchasers speculating on what higher financial return uses (e.g. residential) could possibly be considered on the sites. This land value uplift makes it more expensive for potential new businesses developing as-of-right uses to locate in the areas, thereby hurting overall economic growth.\nStaff need greater clarification from the Province on many of the policies in the proposed PPS, 2023, to more fully understand how these changes will impact the city going forward. However, staff are concerned there could be significant impacts on the city\u2019s residential to non-residential assessment and population to employment ratios. It could impact the types of uses that could go into our employment areas, the commercial buffers that separate heavy industry from residential areas and the ability to maintain commercial uses in communities.\nKey changes are discussed below, and a detailed list of changes and comments is included in the attached table.\nMUNICIPAL COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW (MCR)\nThe PPS would no longer require MCRs for periodic updates that are required for the Official Plans of upper-tier, lower-tier or single-tier municipalities.\n\u2022\tCity staff recommend the Province to maintain MCR requirements for evaluating settlement area expansions and the removal of lands from employment areas. These processes allow for a more comprehensive analysis that can lead to better planning outcomes.\n\u2022\tCity staff recommend the Province to keep the existing approach for the review of requests to remove lands from employment areas where they are considered through a comprehensive review at 5-10 year intervals, unless municipally initiated.  The MCR approach allows for a holistic approach to employment planning. Keeping the MCR framework would help avoid unintended consequences to the continued economic viability of employment uses, including commercial and industry sectors.\nEMPLOYMENT\nChanges to permitted uses in employment areas\nEmployment areas provide land for diverse employment uses to meet current and future needs, and do not permit residential development. In both Bill 97 and the proposed PPS, 2023, the Province is proposing to change how employment areas are defined by narrowing the list of uses in an employment area and removing commercial uses such as office and retail.\nThe Province proposes a clause in Bill 97 that may preserve existing clusters of business and economic uses in employment areas, but the drafting of this provision is unclear as to whether existing Official Plan policies will suffice or whether municipalities would need to introduce amendments to their Official Plans to keep existing office and retail buildings in employment areas.\nProposals to remove lands designated for commercial uses, could create major issues for retaining and attracting new businesses. For example, office users tend to prefer to cluster next to other offices. The introduction of certain industrial uses (e.g. metal clad building, with 100 dock doors, noise and odour emissions and outdoor storage) in a prestige office node could de-value existing offices. Staff are supportive of certain flexible options in office nodes and are in the process of expanding more life science permissions to office areas. The key point is the existing system worked well as municipalities could tailor the mix of employment uses permitted in each employment area based on the local context.\nCommercial lands also provide access to services and amenities that support the wider employment area \u2013 e.g. restaurants, print shops, banks, courier services, etc. The proposed policies do not account for the important role that office and retail play within employment areas. Moreover, where there are commercial uses along the edges of employment lands, they create an important buffer between heavier employment uses such as manufacturing, and nearby residential communities. Through engagement with industrial users, staff have heard how important that buffer function can be to their future success in Mississauga. Allowing sensitive land uses such as residential within these buffers could slowly erode employment areas and surrounding industrial operations and compromise their viability.\n\u2022\tBill 97 and the new PPS should continue to provide municipalities the option of designating for office and retail uses in employment areas.\n\u2022\tCity staff recommend that the Province conduct more in-depth analysis and consultation before approving changes to employment policies. The Province\u2019s proposed modifications to how municipalities plan for employment may have long-term, unintended consequences. While the pandemic has resulted in hybrid work arrangements for many places of employment that may continue to evolve, more analysis, data and public input are needed to identify long-term trends, and minimize any unintended risks to the future of Mississauga\u2019s economy.\n\u2022\tAt a minimum, the PPS should explicitly allow for commercial uses (e.g. office, retail) in employment areas when they are located in the middle of an employment area, where other PPS policies do not permit sensitive land uses (e.g. adjacent to the Airport), or where they provide an important buffer function to nearby residential communities.\nProposed changes may impact the economic viability of key commercial uses\nThe pandemic has undoubtedly had a major impact on the office and retail market, however it is too early to understand how these impacts will play out over the long term. Proposed PPS, 2023, could have long term impacts on land economics that will be difficult to reverse.\nSpecifically, an employment area designation helps to moderate land values, which can make investments in office and retail uses attractive. The City has found that when land is removed from an employment area and opened for residential development, land values can increase in the order of 5 to 7 times. This increase in land value makes it difficult for office uses to compete.\nMississauga\u2019s tax base relies heavily on commercial uses and it will important that these businesses continue to find lands in Mississauga that meet their requirements.\n\u2022\tStaff will need guidance from the Province on where it considers future offices and retail uses should be built. It seems the long-term land economic and business attraction implications have not been thought out.\nOutside of employment areas, retail and office protections are also being reduced\nThe Province is also proposing to make it easier to convert or redevelop lands with commercial buildings outside employment areas to residential uses. In Mississauga many commercial plazas, malls and aging office buildings are already facing significant redevelopment pressures. These commercial buildings however, are critical to meeting daily needs of residents, providing nearby amenities, services and local employment. Without these sorts of uses, it will be hard for Mississauga to create complete communities.\n\u2022\tCity staff recommend that PPS, 2023 direct municipalities to plan for complete communities, and retain non-residential floor space on these sites as part of any future redevelopment wherever possible.\n\u2022\tThe PPS should clarify the Province\u2019s intent for employment lands outside of employment areas. The policies should distinguish between primary and secondary uses for these lands. The City relies on employment lands as part of its economic development strategy, and it is important that the primary use continue to be protected for employment to ensure a balanced mix of jobs and residents in Mississauga. Having this distinction would still allow for PPS policies that require municipalities to permit a mix of secondary uses on those lands, including residential.\n\u2022\tIn order to support the creation of complete communities, the PPS should clarify that when redevelopment of existing commercial buildings occurs, commercial and office GFA should be replaced, wherever possible. The loss of these uses would reduce the range of amenities and services that residents enjoy in their community, and eliminate jobs near where they live.\nMore guidance needed for navigating compatibility issues\nStaff are also seeking more clarification on how to decide when a sensitive land use should be permitted near industrial operators. Proposed PPS, 2023, may result in more conflicts between sensitive land uses and industrial operations. For example, the proposed changes may make it easier for a sensitive land use to be permitted in proximity to major facilities.\n\u2022\tCity staff will be looking to the Province to clarify its priorities for employment areas, as it appears that residential uses should be prioritized.\n\u2022\tThe Province should consult further with industry leaders that could be significantly impacted by proposed changes.\n\u2022\tThe proposed PPS, 2023 policies on employment areas and land use compatibility should be strengthened to ensure an appropriate separation and transition between heavier employment uses and sensitive land uses is achieved. These policies are important to the continued survival of industry in Mississauga\u2019s employment areas.\nAmendments to employment areas can now be made at any time\nCurrently, requests to remove lands from employment areas can only be made through the Municipal Comprehensive Review process that occurs every 5 to 10 years. The current approach allows for consideration of the supply of land to meet employment growth targets. Proposed PPS, 2023, appears to change this requirement and allow requests for lands to be converted at anytime.\nThis could place a significant burden on planning staff and Council who may be drawn into many conflicts and appeals. Staff are looking to the Province for more clarification on how amendments to employment areas can be made and\/or subsequent appeal processes.\n\u2022\tThe Province maintain the existing approach that conversions only be considered through a comprehensive approach at 5-10 year intervals, unless municipally initiated.\n\u2022\tThe proposed PPS, 2023 definition for employment areas should align with the Planning Act definition. The Planning Act includes a broader definition and references prescribed businesses.\nGROWTH MANAGEMENT\nApproved growth forecasts to be used for infrastructure planning\nFor Mississauga, the Province has clarified that the City can continue to use its recently approved population (e.g. 995,000 people at 2051) and employment forecasts. These were the forecasts contained in the Region of Peel Official Plan, approved in November 2022. The growth forecasts were updated following a detailed review of all applications in the pipeline (including preliminary applications), a review of market trends and absorption rates, and demographic information.  In order to support Provincial Housing targets, City and Regional staff will work together to identify areas where infrastructure investments could be prioritized to open up new housing opportunities.\n\u2022\tCity staff support the Province allowing Peel Region municipalities to keep using the approved growth forecast to 2051 as this forecast has already being used for infrastructure and community facilities master planning.\n\u2022\tCity staff recommend the Province to carry forward essential policies that allow growth to be tied to the efficient use of existing and planned infrastructure, while providing protections to the Province\u2019s delicate natural environment and minimising impacts on valuable resources. The proposed PPS should carry forward policies requiring the majority of growth to be directed to existing urban areas, minimum intensification targets, minimum greenfield development density target and the tests to justify settlement boundary expansions (as per the section below).\nSettlement Area Expansions\nThe proposed changes may have significant impacts on the Region\u2019s responsibilities to deliver infrastructure to newly expanded areas that are in part paid for by Mississauga taxpayers. Currently, growth forecasts limit the amount of land that can be released at the Regional level, and when coupled with the intensification target, they ensure that a significant portion of growth is directed to existing urban areas (e.g. the Region has an intensification target of 50% of total growth to occur within the existing built up area). The proposed changes would give municipalities more flexibility on how much land can be released for development.\nWith the proposed removal of the MCR process, lands would be able to be released for development at any time.\nFurthermore, the need for expedited servicing, including major water, wastewater and transportation, to new growth areas at the fringes of the Region of Peel may divert the delivery of needed infrastructure in Mississauga\u2019s strategic growth areas (including MTSAs), which may compromise the City\u2019s ability to meet it\u2019s housing plan targets.\n\u2022\tCity staff recommend the Province carry forward the criteria in the Growth Plan (section 2.2.8) for settlement area boundary expansions with a continued emphasis on directing most of the growth to existing urban areas through intensification and meeting minimum density targets in urban growth centres, MTSAs and greenfield areas. Any review of a settlement boundary expansion should be part of an Official Plan review or update. Individual landowner requests should be properly evaluated based on comprehensive study and as part of municipal-wide planning processes.\n\u2022\tThe Province is urged to retain policies requiring municipalities to develop intensification strategies, focus growth on intensification and strategic growth areas, establish a minimum intensification target, and ensure new development in designated growth areas occur adjacent to existing built up areas.\nGreenfield lands can be released more easily and no density targets to be applied\nThe Growth Plan had many interrelated policy tools to manage growth in greenfields.  More specifically:\n       -\tGrowth forecasts worked to limit the amount of greenfield land that could be released at the regional level (e.g. land could not be released in excess of forecasted growth).\n       -\tThe intensification target ensured that a significant portion of that growth was directed to existing urban areas (e.g. the intensification target required 50% of growth to be directed to urbanized parts of the GGH).\n       -\tA greenfield density target (e.g. 50 people and jobs per hectare) was developed to ensure new growth would be transit supportive.\n       -\tIn addition, new lands could only be released for urban development under a Municipal Comprehensive Review (MCR).\nThe Province proposes to remove these policy mechanisms. The collective impact of not releasing mandated growth forecasts, allowing growth targets to be minimums, eliminating intensification targets and permitting settlement boundary expansions at any time means that there are few constraints on how much land can be released. Having no greenfield density targets will increase the challenge of providing transit to new communities, compounding regional congestion.\nLess dense development in Peel\u2019s greenfield areas could be more costly to service for Mississauga tax payers; it could also put more growth pressure on Peel\u2019s infrastructure budget if other regions open up more greenfield land, lowering growth in Peel.\n\u2022\tCity staff urge the Province to carry forward the Growth Plan's essential policies to manage urban expansions and growth in greenfield to ensure these areas are developed as compact and complete communities and support a range of transportation options.\n\u2022\tCity staff recommend the Province to retain requirements for a minimum greenfield density target in order to facilitate the development of compact, transit-supportive communities with a mix of housing choices; while avoiding the need to develop on natural areas and prime agricultural land. More compact greenfield developments can facilitate the building of 1.5 million homes by 2031 without the need for costly expansions of infrastructure to service new areas outside developed urban areas. This would also reduce transportation related greenhouse gas emissions by lowering the need for long commutes.\nLarge and fast-growing municipalities\n\u2022\tCity staff are neutral about these proposed policies as the City\u2019s Official Plan has been amended to include the MTSAs policy framework and is in the process of updating SGA policies as part of the broader Official Plan Review process.\nMajor Transit Station Areas (MTSA) policies carried forward\nProposed PPS, 2023, includes a policy framework for MTSAs that closely resembles policies contained in the Growth Plan. This will allow Mississauga\u2019s more than 60 MTSAs to continue to act as important places for growth and intensification. City staff have still not received clarification from the Minister on his recent correspondence regarding maximum heights in MTSAs.  However, nothing in Bill 97 or in the proposed PPS, 2023, indicates that the Province would restrict municipalities from being able to place height limits in those areas.\nIf heights limits are removed from MTSAs, it could have significant implications for growth forecasting and would add uncertainty to planning for infrastructure in Mississauga. Given the significant number of MTSAs and their wide distribution throughout the city, it would be cost prohibitive \/ unfeasible to service 60 MTSAs to be ready for unlimited growth.\nHousing\nThe deletion of the definition of affordable housing and removal of the requirement to establish and work towards meeting affordable housing targets will weaken the City\u2019s ability to secure affordable housing.  This policy change reduces the clarity and transparency of Provincial direction to municipalities to plan for affordable housing.  It will be difficult to establish rationale for policies and programs that will achieve affordable housing in the absence of targets.\n\u2022\tRemoving the policy foundation for affordable housing will lead to inconsistency across the Province with respect to the goals and objectives of building affordable housing in Ontario.\n\u2022\tThere is a need to focus on influencing both supply more generally, as well as the right type of supply to meet the needs of residents. It will be difficult to influence outcomes without strong policy direction at the Provincial level.\nClimate Change and Infrastructure\n\u2022\tCity staff recommend the Province to retain policies requiring climate change to be considered as part of land use and infrastructure planning, and preparation of infrastructure and public service facilities for the impacts of climate change. The removal of stronger policies represents a step backward that will not support efforts to respond to a changing climate.\n\u2022\tClimate change needs to be considered in all planning decisions and should be reinforced as a provincial priority throughout the PPS.\n\u2022\tThe Province is urged to retain policies supporting the achievement of compact, low carbon, and complete communities where development is aligned with efficient infrastructure planning, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and the protection of the natural environment and resources.  The following policies should be included in the new PPS:\n       o\tPromote compact communities that are supported by robust public transportation and active transportation infrastructure\n      o\tAvoiding development and land use patterns which many cause environmental or public health concerns and contribute to growing greenhouse gas emissions\n\u2022\tConsideration for natural heritage and surface water features should be maintained in policy as a means to protect the natural environment.\nNatural and Human-made Hazards\n\u2022\tCity staff support the inclusion of a policy requiring the identification of hazard lands and management of development in these areas. City staff will continue coordinating with conservation authorities for the evaluation of development applications to assess the limits of development near hazard lands.\nCompact and urban schools are encouraged\nProposed PPS, 2023, includes an innovative policy to encourage the development of schools and other public facilities in the base of condominium buildings.  In an urbanized city like Mississauga, with limited sites to accommodate new schools and many children living in growth areas, this provincial direction should help see more local schools being built.\n\u2022\tCity staff encourages the Province and school boards to be proactive in the supply of schools in areas of high growth and intensification as well as encouraging schools to be co-located within mixed-use and residential developments. The Province should help school boards with additional funding given the more costly nature of urban schools.\nCultural Heritage and Archaeology\n\u2022\tThe Province should clarify the meaning of \u201cproactive strategies\u201d with respect to identifying properties for evaluation under the Ontario Heritage Act. Will there be an opportunity to discuss examples? Additionally, would this language apply only to archeology or to all historic properties?\n\u2022\tFurther clarification is also requested on engagement with Indigenous communities. What is meant by \"ensuring interests are considered\" and what is the expectation of municipal staff?\n\u2022\tCity staff recommend that policies on engagement with Indigenous communities be clarified to facilitate more substantive municipal-Indigenous relationships.\nNatural Heritage\nDetailed comments on the upcoming proposed Natural Heritage policies will be included as part of a separate ERO.\n\u2022\tCity staff strongly recommend the Province to at least maintain general natural heritage system policies in the new PPS until further policies are developed. The Province has suggested that it will consult on these Natural Heritage policies as part of a separate ERO, but ordinarily in that circumstance the existing policy framework is maintained until the new policies are developed. Deleting these policies before they are replaced could lead to a temporary gap in the PPS where little direction on natural heritage is provided.\n\u2022\tThe Province is urged to have meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities, municipalities, conservation authorities and other stakeholders on revising natural heritage policies.\nImplementation: All decisions going forward must be consistent with new PPS\nImplementation provisions require that all planning decisions (even for applications submitted under the previous regime) must be consistent with the PPS, 2023, (once it is adopted) even if the Official Plan has not been updated. Furthermore, Bill 97 proposes to allow the Minister to make regulations that could address different transition rules. This lack of clarity would create increased uncertainty in the planning process and in the review of development applications.\n\u2022\tThe Province could reconsider the Official Plan review process. If the intent is to be consistent with the proposed PPS, the Province should develop transition provisions that remove the need to conform to the entire Region of Peel Official Plan, approved in November 2022 under the current planning framework.  Instead, the transition should indicate that lower-tier municipalities within Regions with no approval authority have to review their official plans to conform to the new changes in the Planning Act and to be consistent with the proposed PPS, without the need to conform to those relevant sections in previously approved upper-tier municipalities' official plans.\n\u2022\tMoreover, more time should be given as reviews of the Mississauga's planning regime as a result of these changes could be significant.  The Province should include a transition extending the timeline for the completion of lower-tier official plan reviews to address conformity to the new changes to the Planning Act and to be consistent with a proposed PPS.\nMinister's Zoning Orders (MZOs)\nWhen implementing the PPS, the Ministry may make decisions that take into account \u201cother considerations\u201d to balance government priorities. However, it is unclear what those \u201cother considerations\u201d are and the weight that should be given to the formally established matters of Provincial interest.\n\u2022\tCity staff agree that in many cases the use of MZOs and the revisions to municipal Official Plans by the Ministry may be necessary and beneficial in order to expedite development that would create an important benefit (e.g., creation of affordable housing or for long-term care). However, in order to have a clear planning framework and create certainty for developers, councils, communities and businesses, all planning decisions, including MZOs, should always be consistent with the PPS and have regard to the matters of provincial interest as spelled out in the Planning Act.\nCoordination\n       \u2022\tCity staff support the coordination policies in the proposed PPS. Staff will continue to have an open and transparent approach to engagement on planning matters, including the implementation of the PPS.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister,\nI am writing on behalf of the Council of the County of Middlesex to provide our thoughts on the Helping Homebuyers, Protecting Tenants Act and the proposed 2023 Provincial Planning Statement (PPS), from the perspective of our rural and small urban communities.\nFirstly, I commend the government's initiative to address the housing crisis and the ambitious goal of building 1.5 million homes by 2031. Rural and small urban communities in Ontario face unique challenges in housing affordability, availability, and accessibility. I would note that many rural and small urban communities have demonstrated the ability to provide housing opportunities. According to the 2021 Census, over a five-year period, the County of Middlesex accommodated 9% population growth and I am proud that my home municipality, the Township of Lucan Biddulph, accommodated 21% population growth over this period.\nThe proposed Provincial Planning Statement, providing municipalities with more flexibility, could offer opportunities to create more homes and support local economies in our communities. The Provincial Planning Statement acknowledges the need for growth and development beyond major urban centers. Coordination between municipalities and school boards to consider school and childcare needs early in the planning process is also an essential consideration, which will contribute to the quality of place for families moving to new housing. However, it is crucial to ensure that these changes do not compromise the quality and sustainability of rural and small urban areas and our communities have concerns regarding the potential impacts of some of the proposed changes.\nAgriculture is the predominant land use within Middlesex County and an important component of the economy and culture. For the most part the proposed changes to the PPS agricultural policies appear to be reasonable. We do however have significant concern with the proposal to allow residential lot creation within prime agricultural areas. The proposed policy would allow the creation of up to three new residential lots from a parcel of land that existed on January 1, 2023 subject to criteria. We are very concerned that the creation of residential lots across the country-side will have significant impacts on other provincial and local interests including agriculture (especially livestock farming); the availability of mineral aggregate resources close to markets; the provision of municipal services; on the Provincial and County Road networks; and that the resultant scattered residential development could occur at the expense of this growth occurring in our small urban communities.\nThe potential impact of the residential lot creation within prime agricultural areas policy is staggering for Middlesex County. It is estimated that within Middlesex there are approximately 7,100 parcels that may qualify for this policy based upon our current understanding of the criteria. If three lots were severed from all such parcels, over 21,000 residential lots could be created within the agricultural area (of course not all land-owners would do this, but many would). At one acre in size, this would equate to the loss of 21,000 acres of farmland. In comparison, 21,000 acres of land could accommodate 90,000 new residential units if that growth was directed to fully serviced urban areas. If the goal is to create 21,000 new residential lots, this could be accomplished within urban areas on 75% less agricultural land. Instead of this approach, we thought that there might be consideration for the further division of existing non-farm parcels within the agricultural area to provide additional rural housing opportunities while at the same time minimizing the impact on agriculture.\nThe second area that I would like to highlight, is the proposed inter-related changes regarding settlement expansions and the move to an unspecified maximum planning horizon. We welcome additional flexibility for municipalities to review and update settlement boundaries however we are concerned that the proposed policies will put land speculation ahead of growth management. Settlement expansions should be encouraged where initiated by municipalities or, at a very minimum, a municipality should be able to deny a private proposal to expand a settlement and that decision be un-appealable. If not, it could simply lead to uncoordinated settlement expansions due to continuous pressure from development proponents to expand in multiple directions. This would likely result in municipalities unable to complete actual growth planning and infrastructure projects that are necessary to sustainably accommodate growth and build great communities. The ad-hoc expansion of settlement areas without a fulsome analysis and justification would appear to contradict other provincial and local objectives including efficiently using land and infrastructure; preserving agricultural land; encouraging density, intensification and range of housing; building complete communities etc.\nThe specification of a minimum planning horizon time frame but not a maximum will leave municipalities open to successive applications for additional lands at an ever-expanding time frame. A maximum time frame for planning for growth and clear justification for settlement expansion is necessary to provide certainty and consistency in planning for growth and infrastructure and other public services (i.e. schools and other public facilities) and achieving complete communities. When municipalities make decisions to expand settlement boundaries, there are many complex factors that must be considered including the ability to cost effectively service the lands. Municipalities must be, subject to provincial oversight, the decision maker on which settlements grow and the manner in which settlements grow.\nCumulatively, these proposals and both intended and unintended policy outcomes have the potential to have detrimental impacts on municipal infrastructure, including roads, bridges, water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure. The policies may lead to dispersed development patterns, which can strain municipal resources and result in inefficient service provision. Such development may require costly upgrades and expansions of existing infrastructure, placing a heavy financial burden on municipalities, particularly those with limited financial resources.\nThe need for adequate provincial funding to support municipal infrastructure projects is crucial to address the challenges posed by dispersed development patterns. The proposal's potential to encourage land speculation ahead of growth management may lead to uncoordinated settlement expansions, which can hinder effective growth planning and infrastructure investments. By ensuring that municipalities have access to sufficient funding and support, the province can facilitate sustainable development and help create complete communities that efficiently utilize land, infrastructure, and public services.\nOne final comment concerning the Provincial Planning Statement, there is proposed policy that speaks to the coordinating of land use planning and planning for housing with Service Managers. As you know, for Middlesex County, the City of London is the Service Manager and we would want to ensure that the intent of this policy is not to couple land use planning decisions between Middlesex County and the City of London. We have a strong working relationship with London on many areas of mutual benefit but are separate municipalities with our own land use planning and housing needs.\nThe proposed changes to the Planning Act and the PPS could offer support for housing supply priorities. However, we urge the government to provide clear guidelines for these changes, ensuring the integrity of rural and small urban development.\nThe investment of $6.5 million to appoint additional adjudicators and staff to the Landlord and Tenant Board is welcomed. We hope that this will improve service standards and reduce decision timeframes for our communities' renters. The proposed enhancements to tenant rights, including those regarding air conditioners, evictions, and landlord's own use, are crucial to protect renters in rural and small urban areas. The expansion of deposit insurance for First Home Savings Accounts held at Ontario credit unions will benefit first-time homebuyers in our communities. We encourage the government to consider further support for rural and small urban homebuyers, such as additional incentives or financial assistance programs.\nThe exploration of a cooling-off\/cancellation period for purchases of new freehold homes and the requirement for legal advice on purchase agreements are promising steps to protect homebuyers. However, we recommend that the government carefully consider the potential impact on housing supply and affordability of this policy change on rural and small urban areas.\nFinally, I would be remiss if I did not remind you that Middlesex County recently undertook an extensive Official Plan Update process that included a robust community engagement campaign and concluded with the adoption of a significant amendment to the County\u2019s Official Plan. Middlesex County has been patiently awaiting a decision from the Ministry on this official plan amendment for almost a year now. This delay has impacted our ability to take action on a range of rural land use matters that we feel are key to the continued success and vitality of Middlesex County\u2019s many rural and small urban communities. Middlesex County and our local municipalities want to be part of the building more homes faster, we are willing partners and want to work with you on this challenge.\nIn conclusion, we appreciate the government's efforts to address the housing crisis and encourage continued collaboration with municipalities, particularly rural and small urban communities. We look forward to further participating in the 60-day consultation on the proposed new Provincial Planning Statement and will actively engage in further discussions to ensure the needs of our communities are met.\nYours truly,\nCathy Burghardt-Jesson, Warden\n",

There are lots of people in Toronto already but the supply of homes are less and in the future the number of immigrants are going to increase more and more. So, they should have a place to live. Whoever is in this country already, even these people are not able to afford right at the moment just because there are few supplies of homes and just because some people are placing bids for homes which already exists because there are few supplies of homes. Just because there are few supplies of homes, people are being seen \/ categorized as low \/ middle class and upper classes but in my opinion anyone shouldn\u2019t be categorized in such classes.

Farms should only be severed if the land is protected for farming and then only to allow smaller scale farming. Farmland should NOT be used for housing. Only 5% of the Canadian land mass is arable land and of that only 0.5% is prime 1, the type of soil that will grow crops even in adverse conditions. Do not change the provincial policy statement and planning act to encourage more sprawl. We need to keep density targets and only build outside urban boundaries once cities are densified. Keep density targets, stop random expansion of urban boundaries. The changes proposed in this Bill are destructive and need a total rethink.\n",

        "comment":"It seems somewhat laughable at this point to ask for public input on this matter considering that Doug Ford and the current provincial Government has made it clear that the will of the people is of little consequence when it comes to decisions being made about urban boundary expansion in our communities.\nHowever, there is a need for more housing in this province that is without question. But building mansions on valuable farmland and formally protected greenbelt and conservation areas is not a reasonable solution. People need housing within the communities where they will live and work. Where walking or transit is available. This will help grow our communities.\nOur cities are riddled with rotten, vacant and \/ or crumbling buildings and infrastructure. Especially here in Hamilton, there are endless locations that could be converted from former industrial sights to affordable housing. Covering our farm land and green spaces with unobtainable mansions and strip malls where people need to own cars and use freeways to get to amenities and work is poor planning. Do we want our province littered with subdivisions and strip malls instead of vibrant functioning cities?\nIn order to maintain healthy, active communities the people living within those communities need access to forest and green space and access to affordable locally sourced produce. Without farmland in Ontario how will we feed our cities and ever growing population? The pandemic has shown how fragile our supply chains are. An emphasis on locally sourced food should be at the forefront of our planning moving forward.\nToronto is a great example of poor planning coming to fruition in this province. Where profits for developers has been put before the needs of the people. Toronto has virtually become an unliveable city so to soaring costs of living, poor access to transit and amenities.\n",

I am very concerned about providing a liveable future for my young child in Ontario\ngiven the state of climate emergency.\nWhere I live in Hamilton, Ontario we have issues managing sewage and wastewater, an issue that will only be exacerbated by the destruction of trees and wetlands to expand\nthe existing urban boundary. In a time of climate crisis, we cannot afford to increase the carbon load per citizen by increasing commute times away from jobs and transit in a sprawling city. Nor can we afford to destroy any of our few remaining natural refuges.\nIt is entirely unconscionable that the provincial government can permanently scar the last remaining vestiges of hope for the fight against climate change just so the very\nfew developers can become even richer. The provincial government's argument that this will help the housing crisis is very transparent -- it has been proven time and again that infill within the existing urban boundary is a better solution to help both the\nhousing and climate crises.\nI am begging you to use your expertise, power, and contacts available to you to please help my son and his whole generation to have a livable future.\nThank you for your time and service.\n",

We believe it is preposterous for the Provincial Government to arbitrarily usurp thoughtful municipal Plans, for building sites within our City. We residents elected the City Council to make such decisions.  Such arbitrary decisions have occurred without satisfactory consultation with the City, certainly without their agreement. The City's Plan was to increase height from a current maximum of 8 stories to 20, for population intensification near \"a someday\" to be completed LRT. Until the Ontario Line is completed, gridlock will instead be created, not relief. This influx of population in the 3 towers, upon completion, will exceed the total population of the existing immediate community.  In head count the condos' will become the community. There are overhead wire and aged \"plumbing\" dangers. This decision seems to suggest services and infrastructure exists to accommodate.  This is untrue.  Very limited parking, with lots of space for bicycles is better environmentally but inadequate availability of hard good shopping, school capacity, medical services etc., means everything will have to be delivered.  Despite a laughable survey re traffic congestion, traffic\/parking congestion will increase & there are no bike lanes.  It will be dangerous. Greenery has been sacrificed without replacement, without setbacks.  A huge shadow! There is NO evidence of responsible planning here!\n",

No need.\nThe numbers used by your government add up in this way: 1.5 million homes at a conservative 3 people per means 5 million people housed in Ontario by 2031. In the same time duration, the Federal government will bring in 5 million (500,000 per year) new residents to all of Canada.\nDoes this mean Ontario will house all of every resident\/immigrant trying to come to Canada?\nYour government's numbers would imply so.\nYet last year 2022 the majority of new immigrants chose to live in either the East Coast particularly Halifax area or the Yukon.\nYour statement that more people are choosing to live in Ontario does not follow suit with this data.\nAs reported elsewhere, the suspicious sale of Greenbelt properties just before Oct. 2022 when your government first announced the More Homes Built Faster Act as Bill 23 bleeds with negative possibilities.\nPlease check with Colin Best president of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario for more on how Ontario already\nhas 1.23 million dwellings proposed and approved, before including Doug Ford's announced goal of 1.5 million dwellings.\nThe problem according to Mr. Best is a severe supply chain shortage of everything to do with building and a severe shortage of\nskilled tradespeople. These problems cannot be solved through what your government is proposing.\nFinally, your government's heavy handling of all items environmental, flagrantly disregarding what all Climate Change experts are telling us, including the new research into non-smoking caused lung cancer now seen to be caused by car particle emissions, point to the dangers of creating more suburban sprawl, more need for cars, more pollution.\nSimply building more will not solve the real problem with housing in Ontario: affordable housing. Affordable housing as you know is said to be mortgages of no more than 30% of income. With the current average price of a home in Toronto for example at 1.4 million, only multi millionaires can afford a mortgage in Toronto. That's an example of the real housing problem.\nEliminating the developer fees in an attempt to court more developers to build more does nothing to resolve the supply chain problems, nor the lack of skilled tradespeople. Those fees landing on the heads of residents in Ontario so their municipal taxes rise by the egregious amount of, for example in Stouffville, of 53% in the next five years, only adds to the burden the average person, trying to make a living and make a life in Ontario must bear.\nIn short, the policies of your government seem destined to increase the flight of new residents to affordable places such as Halifax, Calgary, and the Yukon. The policies of your government do nothing to help those in most need of housing: the seniors, students, Indigenous people, differently abled, as the prices of the homes as well as the increases in municipal taxes bear down against them. The policies of your government do nothing to ameliorate the increasing crisis in climate now scientifically ratified. Science also ratifies simple antidotes to our current climate crisis: densification of dwellings leading to using fewer cars, increased green space including more trees everywhere.\nWith your government's desire to force open the Greenbelt, increase suburban sprawl, increase car pollution, cater to developers by giving them no fees, new intensification of taxes on residents, silence on the issue of supply chain problems and lack of skilled tradespeople Ontario faces a bleak future indeed.\nWe must return to protecting our environment at all costs, building only affordable housing in urban areas, renovating buildings where possible, re-using materials whenever possible, reducing car pollution everywhere, planting more trees, protecting our wetlands and preparing for a different future, one that puts climate ahead of dollars.\n",

So why are you expropriating farm land via mapping as farmland through OMAFRA when there is already volunteer programs in place such as Farmland trust. You are assuming i want my farm preserved as farmland forever. I do not. Because i am in the NEC plan i can not participate in OFDUs without lots of Red Tape if at all.  You have this as a proposal but the Prime Ag designation is already written in as a layer without notification. Due to where my farm is why would i want my farm protected. There is no advantage as it will limit what i can or can not do with my farm . This designation devalues my investment. The law protects land rights and you are not protecting my rights as a land owner. This is illegal what you are proposing and if goes through will result in nothing but bad blood with the PC govt and farm owners when they find out what you have done and result in court battles.

Therefore this is not a proposal it is already been created and being used. If this is a proposal these maps should be removed from OMAFRA website find a property.\nPoint2- our farm property according to city of burlington and halton region has been classified as NEC rural land not prime agriculture\nPoint3- this PROPOSED policy says that there are benefits being in Prime Ag designation such as OFDUs, ARUs, 2 to 3 lot creations or severances.\nHowever, since we are in NEC we can not take advantage of these benefits as NEC regulation will not allow it. So even though the province is trying to help farms it is not helping farms in the NEC area, homes are not being built.\n*********Point4- therefore, we were never notified that we became prime ag designation and WE WOULD LIKE THIS DESIGNATION REMOVED FROM OUR PROPERTY and turned back to rural as there is more permissions in rural designation if we had to ever sell our property and opens up the door to potential purchasers\nPoint5- if there was a possible solution to NEC Regulation to what specifies a development permit that would help solve the dilemma in NEC .  It would also cut back on RED TAPE by making it easier for NEC as there is a backlog in getting permits from NEC. Right now NEC regulation requires development permit for OFDU, ARU, Agricultural building , internet road connections etc\u2026\nPerhaps these regulations can be removed by not considering them as development?\n******If this proposed policy is to create more homes it does not in the NEC area so please rethink*********\nAnother solution comes to mind.\nDue to the fact that there are multiple ministries the rural lands need a rural secretariat that can come up with a rural secretariat solution. We can bring in more homes on farms with ARUs that would augment farming income and housing. From speaking with other farm friends and families if we want farming to successfully continue we need farm help housing as there is a shortage. As well bringing in extra income to the farm with additional small housing would be very welcomed and will benefit farm succession and viability. It would also help your housing shortages.

I believe the proposed changes are a step in the right direction for Ontario and I appreciate the effort put in by the Provincial Land Use Branch to improve land use policies.\nHowever, as with any new policy or statement, there is always a concern regarding the implementation and enforcement of these policies. Therefore, I would like to suggest some measures to ensure that the proposed policies are realized for their intended purposes, and not left unenforced by the Municipality.\nMy group owns property on Twenty Road West in Hamilton, and we are grateful the Ministry advanced our INFILL parcel into the urban boundary for housing.  But in order to deliver housing, we need to deal with the City of Hamilton and as such require some tweaks to the language of your very much improved polices so that the City cannot slow-walk, stage, or delay much needed housing which appears to be what could occur.\nFirstly, it is essential to provide adequate and strict direction and enforcement to the Municipality on the issue of NEF noise contour limits and using the latest updated noise data.  This is currently a problem in Hamilton as the City does not do either of these things and as such is impeding maximizing residential infill.  The PPS new infill residential development and other sensitive lands uses are permitted up to 30 NEF.  Further the PPS advises that redevelopment or infilling of residential land uses may occur above 30 NEF subject to airport conditions. These polices already exist but the language must be stronger through explicit direction that the municipalities MUST be in compliance on the threshold and the latest data. We ask that the Ministry add language that enforces the NEF contours and regular updated data that advise the NEF\nSecondly, as we have lands that straddle an residential and employment line.  As such, part of these employment lands are suitable for residential as they fit much better with the proposed community, and comply with the 30 NEF (as referenced above). We have requested an Employment Conversion of the area in question and are at the mercy of the municipality.  It would be much more efficient if the ministry add polices that allow us, as the applicant to have first-party appeal rights for employment land conversions if certain tests, such as the achievement of draft PPS Sec 2.8, have been demonstrated. This would allow protection of the employments areas while still allowing broadening of the uses in an appropriate fashion.\nThirdly, it is recommended that the proposed PPS be updated to acknowledge the importance of privately initiated secondary plans, subject the participation of the municipalities.  Without a privately initiated process, housing that can commence immediately can be delayed for many years, perhaps decades.  A privately led plan also makes it more economical for the municipality and certainly supports the premise that development pays for development. This ultimately allows the municipality to not require more staffing and better allocate which areas to focus on growth and the resources that needs to be allocated appropriately.  We request that the ministry devise language to enforce the permission of privately initiated secondary planning on the municipalities subject to reasonable terms.\nLastly, it is crucial to monitor and evaluate the implementation and enforcement of the new policies regularly. This will help to identify any issues or areas of improvement and allow for adjustments to be made accordingly.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the proposed changes in the draft Provincial Policy Statement are a positive step for Ontario. However, it is essential to ensure that the policies are implemented and enforced effectively to achieve their intended purposes. I hope that my suggestions will be considered and incorporated into the final version of the policy statement.\nThank you for your consideration.\nBest Regards\n    Paul A.

        "comment":"I understand the balance your government is trying to strike to allow more homes to be created. We are in a housing crisis. Supply is a big part of the issue. Your government is aggressively combating this. But, on the path to increasing supply please consider:\n- Are you mortgaging the future for the present? Agricultural lands are finite. You want to allow for 3 severances from lands which are in active agriculture. This 100% will remove land from agricultural production. While MDS is still being respected, in an area where there are no livestock facilities, 3 severances would make it cost-prohibitive to locate future livestock facilities. This planning appears to be short-sighted.\n- Have you considered that supply of housing is not the only issue leading to the crisis? Take my community for example. In the last five-year period we have built more new homes than any other previous period since records have been kept. Even with this increased supply, it has not made a measurable dent in the price of a home. Something greater than just supply is at play. I raise this point, because if you are mortgaging the future to create more supply - especially in rural and agricultural areas - you might build 1.5 million new homes in the Province and still not address the biggest issue facing people: the cost. And, with the necessity of immigration to support our population, how will demand lessen? If you increase supply and also increase demand, there will be no impact on the price of a home, no matter how many you construct.\n- Yes, we do need more supply! Now more than ever, but not in agricultural areas and not in rural areas. Your proposed policies are ruinous in the long-term. Focus growth in areas that can support it - such as urban serviced areas. Or, provide funding to historic hamlets to construct wastewater and water collection systems. This would allow revitalization of these historic communities.\n- Please slow down. Since 2018: Bill 66, Bill 108, Bill 23, Bill 109, Bill 97. Where are you going? It's too fast. Now the proposed revised PPS. How do all of these pieces of legislation work together? You have even had to make knee-jerk revisions to legislation for site plan control adjacent watercourses and railways, because you went too fast.\n- You're weakening language and policy around affordability. More supply with more demand will not reduce the affordability crisis.\n- Invest in infrastructure as a solution and zoning reform! Most communities really need infrastructure to grow. I think if you heavily invested in water and waster infrastructure for communities that would enable the greatest amount of growth. If the pipes are in the ground, and the roads are built, and the municipalities do their part to pre-zone lands to remove barriers, then all that is left is to obtain a building permit. Having infrastructure and zoning in place will remove years from the development approval process. A building permit has to be reviewed within 10 days once received, and, assuming it's a complete application, can be issued.\n- Please get back on track. I really believe in you and this government, but I have lost faith based on your recent legislative agenda. I know you want to do the right thing. Be better, and consider the average Ontarian when you make these decisions. Please protect our future and our farmland.\n",

Ontario's sprawl-oriented A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement is at odds with both of these stated provincial goals.\nSingle-family, detached housing on large lots, absent density requirements, facilitate the highest up-front cost housing, with the highest lifecycle infrastructure costs, demanding an escalating tax burden to ensure roads, pipes and other assets meet service standards.\nAt the same time, continually expanding urban boundaries and building into the greenbelt fundamentally fail to value the ecosystem services undeveloped land provides, such as stormwater storage at a time when Ontario is experiencing intensifying rainfall events that overwhelm older infrastructure. To avoid large-scale, costly infrastructure replacements, we have to use the benefits nature provides, rather than pave over it.\nOntario's step to upzone all lots to allow 3 units was an excellent step in the right direction, as were modifications to Ottawa's official plan to increase permissible story size on main routes. I implore the province to move further in this direction. Gentle density is the most cost-efficient means to build out the housing Ontario needs, while expansion of sprawling suburban development is the least.\n",

        "comment":"Written below are my responses to each pertinent section I have concerns with.\nSection 1 Response:\nAllowing for more lots on farms creates many issues for the agricultural community, as it greatly reduces livestock areas and those not familiar with farm practices create havoc with farmers. Some examples of this include; complaints about farm vehicles on roadways, applying nutrients to land is \u201csmelly\u201d, and they will attempt to stop you from doing so.\nWhat \u201ccriteria\u201d will be used when creating residential lots? How will we know that the criteria is equitable? Can we be sure that it will be standardized?\nIn rural areas, more residential lots not only take away from crop production land but also potential livestock area. Since the minimum distances required between houses and livestock facilities is quite large, there will be less available areas where these facilities can be built. Dust and noise created by ag practices are very common, which are essential to success in crop production. Just because we place nutrients on our lands doesn\u2019t mean that our neighbors will not be affected by it.\nThose unfamiliar with rural mannerisms do not understand that farm vehicles require large amounts of space to maneuver on roads, which leads to congestion when there is little cooperation and makes transportation of farm resources more timely and potentially more costly. More of those who do not understand rural etiquette will move into these areas with the introduction of more housing.\nSection 3 Response:\nIt is unfair that those already living in a community will have to pay for the opportunity cost of infrastructure growth. This growth will be funded out of taxpayer\u2019s pockets, for people who have not lived in this community. Those moving to these communities will not contribute to the additional cost of new infrastructure; only join in with existing members. There needs to be a mechanism to compensate those already living in the community to support the infrastructure growth this policy proposes.\nSection 4 Response:\nUsage of the term \u201cagriculture systems approach\u201d is vague and quite open to interpretation. What system will be supported? What perspective of agriculture will be followed to support the farmers and those in the agricultural industry?\nSection 5 Response:\nWhat does \u201cefficient land use patterns\u201d entail? Will there be a measurable system that allows stakeholder input to be implemented when creating these patterns?\n",

Please see the attached PowerPoint presentation and report to Council, being RPT-0201-23, from the County of Brant for additional comments on the proposed Provincial Planning Statement (2023).\nThere are some changes to cultural heritage and archeology proposed in the Provincial Planning Statement (2023) not noted in the attached report to Council (RPT-0201-23), but that the County of Brant would like to make the provincial government aware of.\nThe County supports the conservation of heritage resources and landscapes and has been developing proactive strategies for the identification of properties and districts for evaluation under the Ontario Heritage Act. Identification, evaluation, and protection are equally important tools that work together to address matters of Provincial and municipal interest, and the proposed changes to the Provincial Planning Statement (2023) focus solely on \u201cprotected\u201d heritage property. Municipally, there is an opportunity to leverage the development process in a proactive way for the purposes of identification and evaluation of cultural heritage resources that could translate into the adaptive reuse of heritage buildings. There should be clear opportunity for a municipality to identify and evaluate heritage resources during the development application process, which could be done within certain parameters to ensure the development application continues within the prescribed timelines. The County of Brant requests that the Province consider incentives at the Provincial level (similar to development charge waivers for additional residential units) for the adaptive reuse of a heritage building to be incorporated into the development or incentivizing moving buildings to an alterative site that will provide social benefits to the municipality. These opportunities would benefit both the applicant and municipality and be a responsible use of existing resources without the need for demolition.\nOverall, the proposed policy changes create additional redundancies in the heritage conservation policy framework, undermining the work to identify and list properties and ultimately meet the matters of provincial interest in the Planning Act, and in particular the conservation of features of significant architectural, cultural, historical, archaeological, or scientific interest. There is no reference to the protection offered to \u201clisted\u201d properties in the proposed definition of a protected heritage property for the purposes of policy 4.6.1, essentially rendering the municipal listing process moot. Given the limited resources available for cultural heritage conservation in many municipalities, the County of Brant would support a simplified but multi-faceted approach to heritage conservation that incorporates opportunities to identify, evaluate, and protect built heritage resources in a timely and resource-effective manner. Consideration should be given to simplifying the processes of the Ontario Heritage Act and Building Code for the identification, evaluation, and protection of heritage resources and adaptive reuse of older buildings. Clear incentives should be provided for opportunities to adapt older buildings that have heritage potential as well as provide opportunities to be reused to support the community through additional housing units and amenities.\nShould there be any questions about this submission, please do not hesitate to contact the County of Brant for assistance.\n",

Millions of Ontarions are begging Ford and his government to stop the building of the new highway; to stop the destruction of Ontario's green belts, wet lands and farm lands to build more sub-divisions, more malls, more industrial complexes, more roads and highways, etc.  We need the farms, the farm land, and clean water supplies and trees.  We need to increase the local production of fresh food and produce for our population, not reduce it.  We need to regulate and stop the corruption and greed of developers, realtors, industrialists, corporations who want to build more subdivisions, industrial complexes, roads, sewers and expand the use of fossil fuels to power all of this unbridled growth within the GTA.  Ford's plans will increase the pollution of our air, water, lakes, rivers and soil and negatively affect the lives, health and welfare of all future Ontarions and their families.\nOntarions are really angry at Doug Ford for his ignorance and beligerance in not listening and respecting the validity and logic of research and reports by scientists, environmentalists, social scientists and policy makers, federal laws and the many experts re: the future impacts of his dangerous and irresponsible development plans on human health and all forms of life.  Ford's plans to eliminate and pave over and build on protected environmental areas, flood plains, and green belts; to cut down trees and eliminate natural forests will increase air, water and land pollution and totally eliminate natural eco systems, all wildlife and their habitats.  Members of Ford's government also lack the 'education and forsight' in supporting this Premier's ignorant, uneducated and egotistic policies which will for 'certain', negatively impact the future lives of all people and their families living within the GTA and outlying areas.\nCitizens of Ontario are well-informed and know that Doug Ford corruptly and with a brazen, uneducated, and ill-informed perspective went ahead and sold off lands and resources to his developer buddies to make them even richer.  Ford lied with impunity when he told Ontarions prior to election, that he would keep our greenbelt, flood plains, water, forests, and farm lands safe.  Then after election, without environmental, social and educated consultation and transparency, he ignorantly and secretly forged ahead with his terrible plans.\nThe logical solution for building more homes, which must be affordable homes, would be to build family friendly, low-rise walk-up apartments\/condos and parks on existing lands within the GTA to include community building, quality of life and social cohesion.   There is lots of existing spaces and land already available without paving over and developing our wetlands flood plains and existing farmlands.  The Green Party has sensible policies and plans for building affordable homes and family friendly communities.  It's time to consider better, smarter, more informed policies to insure a more humane, healthier, sustainable, saner and  safer way to live for the present and into the future.\nFord and his dangerous ego and corruptive character is also affecting the misguided plans for Ontario Place to become an exclusive spa for the rich with a mega underground parking lot and for The Ontario Science Centre to be moved onto Ontario Place at the same time.  In addition Ford's ignorance and lack of insight regarding his government policies - illogical, uninformed, inhumane- by reducing funding for schools and educationschools, educational assistants, adequate staff, educational resources, training and programs) is\n",

Perhaps, but not without the  expertise of sound land use planners and scientists. Using \"housing\" is no excuse. Housing can go anywhere and recent studies have shown there is ample room for housing already zoned or accommodated in existing Official Plans.

Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (p. 10)\"\nIt is time to listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets.\nRemember that you work for the public good of all Ontarians and our society, not for individuals and companies.  It would be detrimental to approve policies that:\n- Eliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to rein in urban sprawl;\n- Allow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n- Force municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n- Exempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n- Remove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and\n- Weaken and eliminate policies intended to address climate change.\nOntario is losing farmland at the rate of 319 acres per day. Sprawl development will not solve current housing needs, as your government seems to think. The current rhetoric of the Greenbelt being a scam is embarrassing for you and super dismissive of actual Ontarians that care. Despite this government's lack of respect (for these people you said Ford heard loud and clear when Ford promised he wouldn't touch the Greenbelt), I am politely submitting, during your mandatory consultation period, that the government go back to listening and that it retains PPS and Growth Plan policies that are designed to curb sprawl and protect farmland and natural areas or somehow otherwise ensure that the PPS creates new policies that do the same.

If the government truly cares, or even wants to half way pretend they care about the environment, they cannot promote the continued expansion of urban and suburban communities. At least not geographically. The heart and purpose of a Green Belt is to leave the land- not to convert it even for recreational use, let alone residential. Untouched (or even land returned to local indigenous communities) has inherent worth that would be greatly diminished by residential expansion. Many apartments or condos can be built on existing brownfield land within cities and suburban areas. I might also suggest limitations on Air BNBs or other such confiscation of perfectly good housing.\nI would implore you to not encroach upon the Green Belt, this land is meant to be protected. Even if, as the earlier proposal indicates, that the Green Belt is to be expanded, what is currently protected must remain so. If it\u2019s limits can be so moveable, than the Green Belt holds no purpose or value. Than the need to preserve incredibly valuable agricultural and natural land is jeopardized. If it can be encroached upon now, it can be further harmed later.\nPreexisting partially developed land can be greatly improved upon and can uplift the communities near them. Complexes and repurposing the buildings companies are partially abandoning due to work-at-home changes are a better use of space than wasteful suburbs.\nI live in Newmarket. I know what it is like to grow up in and love a suburb. My dream for it and other suburbs like it is to adopt condos, to adopt green roofs and community gardens.

High-density development in existing urban landscapes is preferred. Second point: There have been issues with immigration policy at the federal level. Official immigration numbers have been set at 500K (though the actual number of people entering Canada is likely twice that i.e. international students). How might planners accommodate existing immigration levels and proposed increases in immigration numbers when there is already an existing housing shortage resulting in a noticeable spike in home prices for first-time buyers?

I have never in all my urban travels ( which are considerable ) seen such appalling density being newly constructed and then posing as \"downtown urban living\" .

        "comment":"This proposal is deeply concerning, given that the PPS and the Growth Plan are critical provincial policies that provide comprehensive, integrated, balanced direction on land use planning. The proposed new Provincial Planning Statement will jeopardize decades of progress on land use policy, with changes that would:\nEliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to rein in urban sprawl;\nAllow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of associated infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\nForce municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\nExempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\nRemove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and\nWeaken and eliminate policies that address climate change.\nThese are only some of the harmful proposed changes that would fundamentally undermine smart growth and sustainable land use planning in Ontario. Others involve weakening rules and standards for affordable housing, water pipelines, employment areas, and development along public transit lines. In sum, the government is abandoning its long-standing policy commitment to promote compact, transit-friendly development and prevent sprawl. Instead, the new policy thrust is to allow scattered residential lots and subdivisions anytime and anywhere, including on prime agricultural land.\nThe government\u2019s underlying premise, that more land is needed for housing development outside existing settlement boundaries, is demonstrably false. As noted by Ontario\u2019s Housing Affordability Task Force in 2022, a shortage of land is not the cause of the housing shortage:\n\"Land\u202fis available, both inside the existing built-up areas and\u202fon undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture.\u201d (p.10)\nWhile the new proposed natural heritage policies have not yet been released, the government\u2019s sprawl-friendly agenda spells disaster for nature and farmland, especially in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, one of the largest and fastest growing regions in North America.\n",

        "comment":"this proposal while sounding great is going to put even more strain on our farm.\nIt might be a good idea to allow an additional house (or 2) on the property, we are currently looking into doing this for housing for foreign workers, as we cant get any farm help, and everyone who applies wants us to provide a house to do so. however, the severing will cause all kinds of problems. As it is, we have bought all the land that comes available directly beside our farm, however, when we built our last barn, we had to get special permissions to build it closer to a neighboring house than the regulations permit, having a neighbor sell out to a company building houses in a small subdivision (which was recently done just 2 blocks away) would cause even more problems for us trying to build another building.\nThe only way I see the subdivision working out (even partially) is if there is a special clause that stops the buyers\/renters from being able to complain about farming going on (manure being spread, trucks driving back and forth with feed etc.) and that only addresses one of the 3 problems (complaints from new residents, setback requirements being more difficult, and loss of agricultural land)\nIf the Federal or Provincial government was to guarantee they would fund decent public transportation  (busses multiple times per hour for example) along the roads that are allowed subdivisions (probably close to existing big cities) this might be considered by some as Okay, as it would allow employees to get to and from work without their own vehicles (something we are seeing more and more prospective employees not have). this would make the future system look much more like a lot of areas in Europe.\noverall the government needs to put more restrictions on building out into farmland, and instead building up the core of cities, densification, not sprawl.\n",

This would nullify the existing Provincial Policy Statement and Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, which provide balanced and integrated land use planning that protects against urban sprawl.\nThe proposed change would undermine smart growth and sustainable land use planning in Ontario, remove prime agricultural land from its function, and threaten our natural heritage.  Research has shown that the current housing shortage is not a result of land shortage, but instead, of failure to use available land for affordable housing, and development characterized by sprawl rather than intensification.  The government's proposed response to the housing shortage would not ensure that affordable housing is constructed, but would perpetuate current housing patterns that prioritize profit for developers and keep prices too high for many of those who need housing.\n",

        "comment":"As a resident of Hamilton, Ontario, I believe it's crucial that we prioritize growth within our pre-2022 boundaries, especially in areas where transit infrastructure already exists. This approach allows us to make the most of our existing resources and minimize the strain on our infrastructure.\nTo achieve this, we should promote density within our urban neighborhoods. This means removing rigid site restrictions and minimum parking regulations that may hinder development and discourage the efficient use of space. By encouraging denser development, we can create vibrant and sustainable communities.\nFurthermore, it's imperative that we protect our finite and fragile farmland. Before any construction projects begin on expansion lands, we should ensure that no shovels hit the ground until after the next election. This gives us an opportunity to thoroughly assess the impact on our agricultural resources and make informed decisions.\nTo address the financial aspects of growth, we need to understand who will bear the costs. I propose commissioning a report, similar to the one conducted in Ottawa, to identify how growth on expansion lands will be funded. This will help us develop a sustainable and equitable approach to financing growth.\nAdditionally, we must focus on getting existing approved projects built. It's crucial to streamline the development process and remove any barriers that may prevent the timely completion of these projects. By doing so, we can take advantage of the opportunities that have already been identified and approved.\nIn order to promote affordable housing, we should incentivize and support the development of affordable laneway housing. This type of housing can provide more affordable options within existing urban areas while making efficient use of underutilized spaces. By creating incentives and removing regulatory hurdles, we can encourage the construction of these affordable housing options.\nTo ensure a diverse range of affordable housing options, purpose-built rentals, and public investment in housing, we need to explore innovative strategies. It's unfortunate that there is currently no federal support for housing away from transit. Therefore, we must work with other levels of government, private organizations, and community stakeholders to develop creative solutions and secure the necessary funding for housing initiatives.\nBy addressing these topics and actively engaging in the conversation, we can work towards a more sustainable and inclusive future for Hamilton, Ontario.\n",

Let me explain:\n1) Undemocratic Decision-Making: This decision contradicts the resolution of our elected city council, which represents the voices and interests of Hamilton's citizens. We, as Hamiltonians, are left feeling unheard and disenfranchised.\n2) Increased Urban Sprawl: The imposed expansion encourages sprawl - an inefficient and costly investment for our city. The associated expenses, both direct (land development costs) and indirect (environmental impact), far outweigh the minimal increase in property tax these low-density developments provide.\n3) Exacerbating Climate Emergency: We are in the midst of a climate crisis, and this decision threatens to worsen our predicament. Expanding our urban boundary increases our reliance on fossil fuels, pushing us further away from sustainable, climate-friendly solutions.\n4) Overriding City Governments: This decision appears to override our city government's authority. The Ministry should instead support local initiatives to develop affordable housing within the existing city limits, which will not burden our city with unsustainable sprawl for generations to come.\n5) Potential Developer Influence: This decision, unfortunately, raises questions about potential undue influence from wealthy developers and construction companies. If this is the case, it is detrimental to those most impacted by our twin crises - housing and climate.\nI urge you, on behalf of myself and other concerned Hamiltonians, to reconsider this decision. I strongly believe that addressing our housing crisis should not come at the expense of our environment, our democratic processes, and the sustainable development of our city.\nI look forward to hearing your response and a resolution that puts the best interests of Hamilton and Ontario at heart.\n",

        "comment":"The current broad defintion of \"development\" in the current PPS and the absolute prohibition on 'development in certain PSW's (s.2.1.4) is problematic. It is so broad it prohibits the construction of any building or structure that requires application under the Planning Act ----regardless of scope or impact.\nIn my view, the current policy is overly restrictive and leads to internal inconsistencies within the PPS. For example, s.1.1.5.2 expressly allows resource based recreational uses (including recreational dwellings with waterfront structures) on rural lands within municipalities. However, the joint operation of the definition of \"development\" and s.2.1.4 then work to  indirectly prohibit what s. 1.1.5.2 permits.\nI am requesting that the PPS be amended by adding the science based language found in the final paragraph of s. 2.1.5. to s. 2.1.4 so that s 2.1.4 would read:\nDevelopment and site alteration shall not be permitted in:\na) significant wetlands in Ecoregions 5E, 6E, and 7E; and\nb) significant coastal wetlands,\nunless it has been demonstrated that there will be no negative impacts on the natural\n                       features or their ecological function.\nAlternatively, s. 2.1.4 could be modified to include language similar to that found in s. 2.1.8, such that it read:\nDevelopment and site alteration shall not be permitted in:\na) significant wetlands in Ecoregions 5E, 6E. and 7E; and\nb) significant coastal wetlands,\nunless the ecological function of the natural feature has been evaluated and it has been\n                 demonstrated that there will be no negative impact on the natural features or their ecological\n                 functions.\nThis balanced approach would ensure planning decisions on waterfront properties are made rationally and on the best available scientific information, instead of on the basis of current oppressive policy.\nHopefully this government is listening and will make decisions based on science as it did during the Covid pandemic.\nThank you\n",

For existing urban areas, the only way forward that makes sense is densification. If single-family home sprawl is permitted then the cost of servicing goes up and the viability of mass transit goes down. Ideally this pillar would reform zoning to permit low- and mid-rise multi-unit buildings in all areas of all built-up municipalities as well as requiring density minimums around both new and existing mass transit stations. The flexibility to build on farmland and in rural areas is not really needed; these communities would ideally start to densify in the population centres.\nPillar 2 contains some good planning principles, but instead of permitting municipalities to expand Settlement Areas without a review there should be some kind of densification principle (as in Pillar 1). Ideally municipalities would have to demonstrate that there is no way to densify before they're permitted to build over green areas.\nPillar 3 is common sense. It does dump a lot of responsibilities on municipalities with - presumably - no new funding or revenue tools though.\nPillar 4 is interesting and contains some good principles. Again, it dumps a lot of planning and management onto municipalities, which makes both oversight and funding more difficult. There is a significant risk of corner-cutting and\/or corruption if there is only a single layer of regulation.\nPillar 5 appears fine - though intermunicipal cooperation is often difficult when municipalities have only one revenue tool and inward investment is therefore a zero-sum game.\n",

Severance limits off 100 acre parcel - Dufferin county permits 3 severances off the original 100 acre parcel (which would allow us to potentially move forward); however, our town is more restrictive with only 2 severances permitted, which means a house build is not possible.  Personally I would like to see town and county guidelines the same.  Additionally, should the original 100 acre parcel remain the baseline for severing or should each severance application be based on its own merits without referring back to the 100 acre lot?\n2).  EP-2 rating - I just learned about the EP-2 rating which doesn\u2019t seem to be applied to a property on any scientific basis other than Google Maps showing trees in the area.  Our EP-2 rating is due to very old Scott\u2019s pine trees that are dead or dying (they are a somewhat invasive species as well).  I fail to see why these trees are considered protected, especially when our arborist told us to \u201cjust burn them all and start over because they are such a horribly useless tree\u201d. I would like to see environmental controls placed on property where they actually matter and are applicable - not just based on computer modeling which seems to be sorely missing the mark.\n3). Our town has another bylaw in place (in addition to the 2 severance maximum) that states you have to own the property for 5 years before a severance application can be submitted.  By-laws such as this (again not consistent with the county) make it more difficult to increase housing supply.  If these by-laws are in place to curb land speculation then maybe a family severance exemption could be considered that allows the transfer to family for them to build.\nIt\u2019s difficult enough to sever land in rural areas given environmental and agriculture rules without complicating it further with bylaws that are more restrictive than the county.  While I am a huge proponent of ensuring our agricultural land is preserved so farmers can continue to feed Canadians, where land is not being used to grow food, it would be nice to have the option of allowing someone to build a house given housing shortages (not to mention ongoing employment from the build).  I also fully understand a town\u2019s goal to maintain a rural culture, but I believe this can be done in a reasonable manner without striving to make the severing\/build process exceptionally difficult or impossible.\n",

        "comment":"May 17, 2023\nTo whom it may concerns,\nRe: Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nCanada is obviously amongst the largest land base countries on the planet, and at first glance, it would appear to be able to feed a sizable population however, much of Canada's land base is not available for crop growth suitable to provide the sustenance necessary to survive a long and healthy life. The available arable land for food production to support the Canadian population is small and extremely limited, despite the fact that Canada is so geographically large.\nThe current world population is roughly 8 billion and in a few relatively short years that population will be nearing 10 billion, at which point the worlds available arable land will struggle to feed the population.\nI\u2019m concerned will government, policies, initiatives, and decisions that inadequately address the fact Canada\u2019s arable land component is extremely limited and is likely unable to support the population growth rate the country is currently experiencing. The policies of all government levels are exhausting the arable land available to feed not only Ontario and Canada\u2019s population, but the worlds population.\nAt least 2\/3 of Ontario's land base is found above the 49th parallel and is full of lakes, rock, and muskeg essentially not suitable to support a modern-day population that is so dependant government support. The amount of arable land in the \u201cnorthern 1\/2\u201d of the remaining 1\/3 of the lands in Ontario below the 49th parallel, is relatively small and disconnected.  The available arable land is so small in this northern area of Central Ontario that is suffices to say the area is general void of good arable land for food production.\nThis leads me to highlight at best, only 1\/6th of Ontario\u2019s land base, normally referred to as southern and lower central Ontario, has a very limited amount arable land available for food production to feed the Canadian population. Although these lands are considered to be in the best agricultural area for Ontario, its important to note on a larger world stage, they are compromised due to long Ontario winters. The lands are only available for food production for a portion of a year, it is not possible to achieve food production rates of comparable lands at lower latitudes and when all facts are digested this country\u2019s ability to feed the Canadian population with a diverse and health food supply are extremely limited.\nSo, it is obvious to say Canada as big as it is, is much smaller than it appears when viewed from the position of land size capable of feeding the population a health food supply.\nThe discussion this far has not yet addressed the fact, Ontario has historically neglected to adequately protect its agricultural resources for food production. The urban element in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) has consumed significant portions of some of the best arable land in Ontario and more recent governments have been focused on protecting green space surround the GTA with a focus on preserving lands for nature and other environmental reason. These governments including the current Ontario government, have permitted and supported development skipping over areas like the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) and Niagara Escapement Commission (NEC) lands, to consume large portions of lands the Province should in fact be reserving for food production. It was noble to respect the importance of the ORM and NEC but completely irresponsible to support urban sprawl beyond these areas that consumes lands that must be reserved for food production to feed the Canadian population first and other population beyond considering the worlds limits in regard to available arable lands.\nImmigration to Canada is out of control , and if it continues at an outrageous rate of 1-2 million a year as some discussion on the matter suggest, and the governments continue to allow the use of Ontario's valuable farmland for anything other than FOOD production, it will all lead to disaster beyond belief.\nOntario definitely needs a new vision and taking any arable land south of Orillia or Parry Sound in Ontario for \"urban\" development must not be in any equation for the future of Ontario. In fact, I believe we are at a crossroad and immediate attention and response is necessary to stop the urban element from consuming any of the arable land Ontario has left.\nThe Ontario Ministry of Agriculture must narrow its focus to \"FOOD\" production only and fight to retain all of Ontario's arable land for food production that feeds the population with food products that sustain the basic healthy survival needs for the population.\nThe expression \u201cFarmers Feed Cities\u201d is more important now than it has ever been in the past. The Ministry of Agriculture must focus \u201cALL\u201d of its time and energy on managing Ontario\u2019s Agricultural Resources for Food Production. Considering the world population challenges in the near future, this department has no room left on its plate to deal with anything other than food production and the protection of the limited agricultural resources to produce same.\nIn an effort to support the Ministry of Agricultures need to focus on the above, Ontario is at a point where it must rethink the municipal structure. Urban centres must find a way to self-sustain from the tax base within their boundaries. Areas surrounding the urban form GTA and other major urban cities in the province, that are a mix of urban and rural, must be reorganized into separate urban areas and rural areas, so that the rural areas comprised of Agricultural and Natural resources can work to remain rural and help to stop urban sprawl. Larger governance areas must be established on both the urban and rural front to help tip the employment scale more toward private employment with far less government employment.\nAs an example, the area noted as Oak Ridge Moraine (ORM), could be managed as two distinct municipalities, One Urban and One Rural. The geographic size might suggest this be further delineated into eastern and western regions and studies would determine the ultimate numbers, but ultimately municipal splits would be around separating urban form governance from the rural form.\nThe \u201curban\u201d limits within the ORM could easily be join under one management structure, as the desires and needs of the taxpayer within the urban boundaries are generally identical.\nThe needs of the rural taxpayers are different to those within the urban centres, and since the rural areas are generally comprised of Agricultural and Natural Resources with the scatting of limited residential development that is not reliant on urban municipal servicing, no differently than the residential portion of the farms found on Agricultural resources, the rural areas outside the urban limits, could easily be combined in a rural form municipality that would work toward protecting the Agricultural Resources of Ontario, so they are reserved to at least feed the Ontario population and if managed adequately support other areas of Canada and beyond in a way that helps support the overall tax base for the rural area.\nThe urban and rural governance split could be done in various ways and maybe a first step would involve focusing on areas surrounding the larger all urban centres in the province. As an example, use the area around the Town of New Tecumseth, Adjala and West Gwillimbury. The urban areas of Alliston, Beeton, Tottenham, Colgan, Hockley Valley, Cookstown, Bradford, etc. could combine into one urban municipality, and all the area outside the urban element limits of these urban forms, would combine as a rural municipality. Some thought might be put into using the watershed boundary for more practical delineation, but definitely separate the rural from the urban, so that the rural is in a better position to protect the rural form from urban sprawl.\nSecond Tier government might be eliminated and the Ontario government take on a greater role through private sector involvement like OCWA to deal with water and sewer servicing to the urban form, and in fact maybe a private sector entity of a similar nature could be developed to deal with the cross boundary arterial road services that relay traffic to the major employment centres and more effectively share the cost across the portion of the public that use the transportation routes.\nThere is a definite need for such change as the current municipal structure is set up to promote urban sprawl and the lose of such valuable agricultural resources is a tragedy and not sustainable in the long run for the population of Ontario or the rest of Canada.\nI look forward to this process considering the important points I note and to the governments of this country waking up to the real problem of over population face this country and the world.\n",

Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (p. 10)\"\nWe MUST listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets.\nThere is absolutely NO need for proposed policy changes which would:\n- Eliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to rein in urban sprawl;\n- Allow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n- Force municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n- Exempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n- Remove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and\n- Weaken and eliminate policies intended to address climate change.\nOntario is losing farmland at the shocking rate of 319 acres per day.

        "comment":"I\u2019m reaching out to express my concerns with Bill 97 and the proposed Provincial Planning Statement, 2023. I am concerned and quite frankly scared for the unintended and irreversible consequences this bill will have on local food and farming.\nI am very worried about the implications of this Bill on our ability to produce local food, continue to viably farm, have safe, happy rural communities, and affordable housing.\nOntario's prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario's land base1. Ontario has lost 20% of our farmland in the last 40 years.  With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that we protect our prime agricultural areas. Once farmland is developed, it is gone forever. We are losing more than a family farm every day in Ontario to development. It is important to remember the ability to produce the local food we can in Southern Ontario can not be relocated or replicated elsewhere in the province or country. Once the prime soils and climates we have in our communities are developed on, that food producing ability is lost. This is not sustainable.\nI recognize the need for more housing and agree with taking steps to ensure housing is available for Ontarians, but this is not a practical way to achieve housing goals. The home buying generation wants walkable, transit oriented, dense communities where walking to groceries, restaurants and entertainment is attainable. 3 rural severances on each farm parcel will not be affordable or desirable for the current home buyer\u2019s demographic \u2013 which is our future.\nThe proposed policy of allowing 3 severance per farm parcel will virtually eliminate farmers ability to build a barn due to MDS (Minimum distance separation). This will also result in more investors purchasing farmland to sever houses, which will drive up the price for farmland making it impossible for the next generation of farmers who have a passion for producing local food to purchase farms. I worry this will be the beginning of the end for animal agriculture, which is the backbone of most rural economies.\nFrom a practical standpoint I don't know how a side road in the rural area can accommodate, or safely accommodate private serving (septic and wells) for upwards of 30 additional dwellings resulting from lot severances.\nFarmland is the foundation of the agri-food sector that provides us with locally produced foods, employs more than 750,000 Ontarians, or 1-in-10 of the province\u2019s labour force, and contributes over $47 billion annually to the province's GDP.\nThe sections in Bill 97 and the new PPS that are the most concerning and must be addressed include:\n1.\tThe weakening of policy language that will undermine the implementation of agricultural system planning that will lead to inconsistencies in designating prime agricultural areas;\n2.\tThe removal of municipal comprehensive reviews that assessed settlement boundary expansion to protect prime agricultural land;\n3.\tReducing existing density targets for fast-growing municipalities and removing density targets for the remaining municipalities within the Greater Golden Horseshoe. This will lead to inefficiencies of land use in existing settlement areas and will require boundaries to expand on farmland more quickly; and\n4.\tThe requirement for municipalities to permit up to three severances on prime agricultural areas for residential lot creation.\n5.\tThe additional powers afforded to the use of Minister's Zoning Orders (MZOs) in the land use planning process.\nWith the current rate of farmland loss, Ontario\u2019s farmland will be completely lost in the next 100 years. We do not have time to sprawl and fragment Canada\u2019s best farmland.\nI recommend we shift the approach and keep the PPS 2020 policies related and impacting agriculture, and work towards utilizing lands within the existing urban boundaries to create dense, walkable developments. This way we can create the type of housing that is in demand among the young home buying and aging community members and minimize the amount of farmland lost in our country\u2019s food producing region \u2013 Southern Ontario.\nI urge you to address these concerns and save Ontario\u2019s limited agricultural land.\nThank you for your consideration\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

Others involve weakening rules and standards for affordable housing, water pipelines, employment areas, and development along public transit lines. In sum, the government is abandoning its long-standing policy commitment to promote compact, transit-friendly development and prevent sprawl. \"\n",

I also suggested that MLAs be required to read the OECD report Rethinking Urban Sprawl:  Moving Toward Sustainable Cities which outlines a better way in broad strokes. It was the MLA's office that suggested that I could also submit my comments to you, so here they are.\nI do agree with many points in the proposed Provincial Planning Statement. \u00a0There is urgent need for more housing in our rapidly growing province. As well, some of the proposals in the Planning Statement are valid. \u00a0However, the problems of housing a growing population will not be solved by allowing any piece of property that becomes available in rural Ontario to be developed willy nilly. \u00a0Turning over land currently or in recent food production to housing under the guide and guise of these vague proposals will set Ontario on the path to even more urban sprawl than at present.\nThe three proposals in the\u00a0Proposed Provincial Planning Statement 2023\u00a0to which I most strongly object are:\nIn Section 1, Generate an Appropriate Housing Supply\n* \u201cRequire municipalities to permit more housing on farms, including residential lot creation subject to criteria, additional residential units and housing for farm workers\u201d\nAnd in\u00a0\nSection 2, Make Land Available for Development\u00a0\n* Provide flexibility for municipalities to allow for more residential development in rural settlements and multi-lot residential development on rural lands, including more servicing flexibility (e.g., leveraging capacity in the private sector servicing\nAND\n* Provide a simplified and flexible approach for municipalities to undertake settlement area boundary expansions. Municipalities would be allowed to create new Settlement Areas and would not be required to demonstrate the need for expansion.\nUrban sprawl has been an interest of mine since I was a teenager in high school geography classes and I wrote papers on the topic when I was in university. \u00a0The continuing urbanization and \u00a0gentrification of Ontario\u2019s rural land saddens me. I often travel on Christie Lake Road to Perth, a rural road that used to be lined with dairy farms. \u00a0Now there are a couple of dairy farms and a few cornfields, but for how long? \u00a0 Twenty years ago, an American visitor was gob-smacked at the black and white cows so visible along our route to Perth. \u00a0She remembered when her area of rural upstate New York had farms too.\nAlong Christie Lake Road, many of those dairy farms have now been sold to people who only have horses. \u00a0We don\u2019t eat horse meat in this country. Nor do we drink horse milk or spread our toast with horse butter. \u00a0I recently came back from Florida where butter was $2.98 per pound. \u00a0Do you know what the price of butter is in Ontario now?  Supply and demand must be a factor.  There is still demand but where is the supply?  Wisconsin?\nI learned of the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement 2023\u00a0that would replace the existing Provincial Policy Statement and A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe from the reeve of Tay Valley who recently brought the request for comments on the proposal to the attention of subscribers to his newsletter in his recent council update.  I read the\u00a0review of the proposal, as well as the reeve's brief\u00a0comments and the comments of some law firms to which the reeve referred. \u00a0I also read the OECD report on urban sprawl referenced above.\nThe OECD document repeats conclusions about the negative effects of urban sprawl that are well known, and have been well known and obvious for decades to those with even a little knowledge of the topic of land use.  Surely, whoever wrote this proposal must have more than a little knowledge of the negative effects of urbanization and gentrification on rural land, and yet there they are.  The proposals to which I strongly object in the statement will not solve the problem of getting housing where it is needed and wanted. Instead, housing will end up where it is undesirable, of little use to those who really need housing, and will be harmful to generations to come.\nThe proposal in Section 1 will lead to more piecemeal strip development across the province\u00a0 with farmland valuable for its food production suffering the death of a thousand cuts.\u00a0 A thousand land severances is a modest estimate.\u00a0 This is the way it was before some control was put on strip development decades ago.\u00a0 Before even modest restriction, every farmer who wanted a quick infusion of cash knew he could flog off some of his property to meet a shortfall or to fund a vacation or to buy the latest in machinery.\u00a0 This regressive proposal is an enemy to good planning.\nWithout going into supportive detail that is available in any college level geography or economic textbook on this topic and in the OECD paper,\u00a0 this type of development is not good for Ontario as a whole. \u00a0\u00a0The parcelling off of farmer's land requires a large lot size to support a septic system.\u00a0\u00a0Is that what we want?\u00a0\u00a0Septic systems lining our rural roads?\u00a0\u00a0In addition, strip development will encourage the gentrification of rural Ontario into \u201chorse lots.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In most of these cases, farmland has been taken out of production.\u00a0\u00a0There is a shortage of housing in Ontario.\u00a0\u00a0Horse lots in rural Ontario are not the way to increase housing stock in downtown Toronto or anywhere it is actually needed.\u00a0The price is too high for too little return.\nSection 2 should read Make Land Available for DevelopERS.\nThe proposals in Section 2 will encourage larger municipalities to poach the land adjacent to them rather than to search within their own boundaries for open land or to require different types of zoning promoting higher density.\u00a0 This section seems designed to feed the symbiotic and suspiciously mutually beneficial relationship evident between politicians at municipal and provincial levels, property developers and real estate agencies in too many Ontario municipalities.\nThe proposals as stated will encourage urban sprawl and gentrification.  The difference this time is that it will be unrestrained and unrestricted with all the attendant evils described in the OECD document. \u00a0Even if rural land is not currently in food production, land that does not face the pressure of real estate demand is a hidden asset that current generations do not have the right to give away to property developers. \u00a0Not only will this generation, but future generations, will condemn the irresponsiblity of the proposals repeated above.\nIt is already too late for the area north, east and west of Toronto.\u00a0\u00a0Has any analysis been\u00a0done of the farms that have been taken out of agricultural production to provide a checkerboard landscape of luxury homes on large lots and middle class homes in a ribbon of septic systems and immaculate fertilized lawns. What has been the cost to Ontario\u2019s economy and to Ontarioans. \u00a0This landscape seems harmless, but it is not.\nBefore farmers can sell off their land piecemeal or more urban sprawl be allowed to overtake rural Ontario, the following options must be exhausted within urban areas to increase urban density and to provide housing where it is needed and wanted.\n1. The rezoning of urban residential land to much higher density levels than at present\n2. Establishment of ratios of rental properties to condos when granting building permits for high rise buildings\n3. The building of lower rent housing suitable for families in urban areas\n4. The regulation of residential housing left vacant or for use as Airbnbs etc\u00a0\u00a0\n5. Complete infilling in already established urban or semiurban communities, such as villages and hamlets.\u00a0\n6. Starter homes in\u00a0\u00a0planned communities within the boundaries of existing urban areas\n7. A requirement that property immediately adjacent to an already municipally serviced lot be added to that service even if it is in another municipality.\u00a0\u00a0Details of billing to be worked out.\u00a0\n8. Rezoning of areas, presently zoned for industrial or commercial uses, be rezoned to residential if a review shows extensive industrial and commercial zones are in the wishful thinking of politicians and planners\nI urge you to have the clauses sited above from the\u00a0Proposed Provincial Planning Statement 2023\u00a0drastically modified or removed from the proposal.\u00a0\u00a0You can do better.  Canada\u2019s low urban density is embarrassing. \u00a0Give the \u00a0proposals in the OECD report a hard look. \u00a0What is it really going to take to provide housing where it is needed and wanted. \u00a0Ignore the wants of the selfish and the short-sighted, \u00a0Provide the possibility of housing, not necessarily a house, for all Ontario people. \u00a0Provide incentives for building higher density affordable rental spaces. \u00a0Penalize speculators and flippers. \u00a0Require higher density rezoning.\nThe final statement will be a toolbox for providing housing for all Ontarioans. What will be in that toolbox? Will it be the hammer and nails that put housing where it is needed and wanted? Or will it be a wrecking ball to the beauty and utility of rural Ontario?  Do you have the courage to choose wisely or will our beautiful province be scarred irrevocably by your actions. If these three proposals remain, there may soon be a horse lot for every middle class horse lover, but there won\u2019t be a chicken in every pot nor a roof over everyone's head.\n",

We want to severe 3 lots off our farm property. how do you think all these rural homes began? by severing off 1 acre lots. the nerve of these farm groups to make a statement that represents all farmers when they do not. take that in consideration. farmers are PC supporters and if you do something that helps them stay in bussiness or allows their family or farm help to live on the property or make money to stay in business then you will have a PC supporter for life.\nthere are over 40,000 farms between OFA and the Christian Farmers. that is way more than the 40 employees that work at OFA. OFA has made agreements with ECO land zealots that inhibit our way of farming. Natural heritage protection agreements that make farming secondary to tree protection. and now there are grumblings that maple syrup will not be allowed . this is some sick society we are living in. this is a war on land, not fought with guns like traditional wars but with maps and bylaws, layers of mapping red tape. this is an assault on private property by expropriation of farming rights. This is what you are up against. Left wing zealots that did not pay for our farm but have the nerve to tell us we are restricting you. Dismantle these Regions and bring it down to grass roots cities where they know who their farmers are.\n",

Agriculture is not only important for the economy of the County, but it is also deeply rooted in the identity of our residents. We take pride in ensuring that agricultural land is managed and protected to ensure long-term provision of local food and our way of life.\nThe County of Frontenac is generally in support of policies that will make it easier to build more housing in the province. However, the policies presented by the Provincial Planning Statement have the potential to create scattered development within prime agricultural areas that may:\n\u2022\tResult in the physical loss and\/or fragmentation of good quality but underutilized agricultural land,\n\u2022\tImpact the location of new livestock facilities or the expansion potential of existing livestock facilities as a result of minimum distance separation requirements,\n\u2022\tPlace additional burdens on existing public infrastructure and service provision such as school bussing, snow plowing, and road maintenance, and\n\u2022\tResult in conflict between new residential uses and modern farm practices that include ingress and egress of large agricultural equipment and transportation, spreading of manure, bird and rodent mitigation devices (e.g., air cannons), and instances of early morning and late-night harvest or crop management.\nIn addition, the proposed lot creation policies in prime agricultural areas are not clear or easy to implement.\nThe County requests additional information and clarification regarding the criteria presented for lot creation in prime agricultural areas. Clarification is requested specifically on the following matters:\n\u2022\tWhat constitutes agriculture? The Provincial Planning Statement does not define agriculture.\n\u2022\tWhat is considered adjacent to a non-agricultural use? Does this constitute other uses such as institutional, farm-related commercial, residential, etc.?\n\u2022\tWhat are lower-priority agricultural lands and how should they be determined? The general definition of lower-priority agricultural land within the Guidelines for Permitted Uses in Ontario\u2019s Prime Agricultural Area, prepared by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs suggest that lands that are not currently under agricultural production, have fewer drainage or irrigation upgrades, and those that constitute of good quality farmland could meet the definition of lower priority agriculture lands. Applying this definition could result in good agricultural land that has not been utilized to its maximum potential to be taken out of production, simply because it has not been subject to irrigation upgrades.\nThe County would welcome an enhanced municipal consultation process that could include establishing a technical working group with municipalities, Indigenous communities, and other agricultural groups to ensure that the proposed agricultural lot creation policies will not impact the long-term provision of agriculture and local food within our province.\nEmployment Lands\nEconomic development is important to rural communities, and it continues to be challenging to support and establish local businesses. The restrictions placed on what can constitute employment lands as currently proposed should not apply to rural lands and rural settlement areas. Rural municipalities that can or wish to establish small business parks need to have as much flexibility as possible in terms of the range of uses that can be permitted in order to make such development viable.\nAdditional Dwelling Units and Natural Heritage\nWhile Frontenac County supports the ability to utilize additional residential units to support additional housing, the inclusion of such units in the rural area, particularly on waterfront properties, needs to ensure appropriate on-site servicing for private water and sewage services. Increased density on waterfront properties has the potential to negatively impact the quality of waterbodies and therefore needs to be carefully monitored and managed.\nThe County of Frontenac Official Plan generally defines Waterfront Areas as all lands extending inland 150 metres (500 feet) from the ordinary high water mark of any lake, river, or waterway. This is a general boundary intended to recognize that development within this area may have an impact on lake quality and those impacts may need to be considered for any development within the boundary. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that the quality of waterbodies and character of the waterfront is protected for the long term. County staff have worked with Ministry of Environment staff over the years to develop policies in local Official Plans that prioritize water quality protection and lake health as the overarching priority for all of the lakes in the region. The County continues to support policies that will ensure that waterfront lots have an appropriate density and that there is not a cumulative increase in density over the long term.\nI trust you will find this in order; however should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at 613-548-9400, ext. 302 or via email at jamini@frontenaccounty.ca.\nYours Truly,\nJannette Amini, Dipl.M.M., M.A. CMO\nManager of Legislative Services\/Clerk\n",

        "comment":"On May 3, 2023, the Council of the Municipality of Grey Highlands received a \u201cPlanning Policy Update\u201d report from Grey Highlands Planning Staff. This report provided Council with an update on several planning policy matters that are affecting the Municipality, including the potential changes within the proposed Provincial Planning Statement (2023). Given that the commenting period on the 2023 PPS is only 60 days, the scope of the 2023 PPS review within the report to Council was limited to the policy implications of the proposed agricultural lot creation policies. The potential impacts to the agricultural land base were not discussed in detail in the report, as Grey Highlands is a rural municipality with substantial agricultural areas, and the reasoning behind the existing prohibition on agricultural lot creation is generally understood by Council.\nDuring the meeting, Grey Highlands Council debated the merits of the proposed changes to the provincial agricultural lot creation policies. Some Councillors expressed concern with the proposed changes and argued that lot creation should remain prohibited in agricultural designations to protect farmland for future generations. Other Councillors identified limited residential lot creation in agricultural designations as a potential means of creating parcels where family members of farmers can live, and as a means of generating income for a farming operation.\nCouncil did not come to a consensus as to whether or not they supported the proposed changes; however, the general consensus at the table was that the Province has not provided municipalities with adequate time to discover, understand, and debate the potential impacts of these changes prior to the closing date of the comment period. Furthermore, Council was generally in agreement that section 4.3.3.2 of the 2023 PPS, which prohibits official plans and zoning by-laws from being more restrictive than the updated PPS, is not appropriate. This policy removes the ability for municipalities to debate the merits of residential lot creation in agricultural areas. As is the case with most other policies within the PPS, Grey Highlands Council believes it is the Province\u2019s role to set the general policy direction while allowing municipalities to choose whether or not they want to be more restrictive.\nPlanning staff of the Municipality of Grey Highlands would like to raise the following operational challenges with Draft PPS agricultural lot creation policies:\n1.\tHuman Resource Capacity\nResidential lot creation in agricultural areas has been prohibited for several decades. The monetary value of a rural\/agricultural building-lot today is magnitudes higher than it was when lot creation was permitted in agricultural areas. Under the proposed policies in section 4.3.3, and specifically 4.3.3.2, there is the potential for the creation of thousands of new parcels within the agricultural designation in Grey Highlands alone. Given the pent-up demand and potential for lot creation in agricultural lands, the municipality will likely receive hundreds of consent applications for residential lots within the agricultural designation within a matter of months.\nLike most rural municipalities, Grey Highlands has a modest complement of planning staff. The current complement of three planners and one administrative employee enables the Municipality to process a total of roughly 120 Planning Act applications each year. The municipality does not have the capability to process what is likely to be 100+ consent applications in a matter of months if the PPS is passed with section 4.3.3.2.\nThe recent procedural changes that have been implemented through Bill 109 and Bill 23 have already consumed substantial staff capacity. The municipality can theoretically hire more staff, but there will be a lag in the municipal budgeting process relative to the Province\u2019s decision to implement the PPS. Furthermore, Grey Highlands Staff doubt that the Province of Ontario as a whole has enough professional planning capacity to allow all rural municipalities to scale up their planning staff compliment in order to process the impending wave of consent applications that will result from these changes.\nPlanning Staff are concerned that this wave of consent applications will overwhelm the entire planning system in all of rural Ontario. The Planning Act legislates strict timelines for processing applications\u2014timelines that are now financially penalized by recent Planning Act amendments\u2014and municipalities are often already forced to make decisions that they may feel unprepared to make. The inclusion of policy 4.3.3.2 may result in a flood of decisions that are being made permanently and prematurely, which is likely to result in planning outcomes that are detrimental to the public interest.\nFurthermore, processing these consent applications will divert staff resources from important policy updates. Grey Highlands is currently implementing a new zoning by-law, and plans on initiating the process to draft a new official plan following the implementation of the zoning by-law. These updates will have significant positive impacts on enabling more attainable housing stock\u2014impacts that are much more significant than allowing lot creation in agricultural areas. If staff resources are diverted from policy updates to focus on processing agricultural consents, then the effect of the PPS update will be to delay the passing of enabling development policies in Grey Highlands.\nThese staffing issues can be avoided with the removal of policy 4.3.3.2 from the Draft PPS. This would allow municipalities to properly phase-in permission for lot creation in agricultural areas and increase staff capacity if they chose to do so at a later date.\n2.\tAbsence of Official Plan Policies\nSection 4.3.3.2 prohibits municipalities from having more restrictive official plan policies than section 4.3.3 of the Draft PPS. Agricultural lot creation has been prohibited by the PPS for decades; therefore, there are no municipal official plans that contain the necessary policies to properly guide residential lot creation in agricultural areas. There are more elements that must be considered to ensure appropriate lot creation than what are included in section 4.3.3 of the Draft PPS.\nFor example, in Grey County, the frontage of a new residential lot in a rural designation cannot be less than 1\/3 of the depth of the lot. This prevents the creation of odd-shaped lots, such as a lot that is 20 metres wide by 400 metres deep. A 20m x 400m lot is 8,000 square metres, which is the standard lot size that would result from policy 4.3.3.2 in the Draft PPS. The official plan policies that prohibit the creation of such odd-shaped lots do not apply to agricultural lots, because the official plan does not contemplate the creation of residential lots in agricultural designations.\nThe Draft PPS overrides all existing official plans without providing municipalities with an opportunity to add the necessary lot creation policies to guide residential lot creation in agricultural areas. Staff anticipate that the approach to forcing municipalities to permit agricultural lot creation under section 4.3.3.2 in the absence of needing to adopt the appropriate implementing policies in official plans will result in appeals to the Tribunal that relate to lot creation matters under section 51 (24) of the Planning Act. It is possible that the Tribunal will be overloaded with appeals relating to an absence of appropriate official plan policies to guide residential lot creation in agricultural areas.\n3.\tInterrelationship of Rural and Agricultural Lands\nSection 4.3.3.2 of the Draft PPS removes the ability for official plans to be more restrictive than section 4.3.3 with regard to residential lot creation in agricultural areas. Many official plans, such as Grey County\u2019s Official Plan, already permit residential lot creation in rural designations while limiting the number of permitted lots relative to the original Township lot fabric. Section 4.3.3 of the Draft PPS follows a similar approach for limited residential lot creation in agricultural designations, although the reference point is based on lots existing on January 1, 2023.\nThe Draft PPS contains no explicit direction to allow a minimum number of lots to be created within rural areas relative to some former or existing lot fabric. If the PPS is implemented in its current form, then the lot creation policies will have the effect of making it easier to create residential lots in agricultural areas than rural areas. The prohibition on lot creation in agricultural areas relative to rural areas is the principal differentiation between the two designations under the current policy framework in Grey Highlands. This policy change effectively swaps the development protection of rural and agricultural areas. Staff believe that this is not likely to be the intent of the Province with the recent amendments to the PPS, but the Province should be aware that this will be the result.\nRequest\nThe Council of the Municipality of Grey Highlands makes the following requests:\n1.\tThat the Ministry extends the Draft PPS commenting period by 90 additional days.\n2.\tThat section 4.3.3.2 of the 2023 PPS be removed entirely.\n",

        "comment":"As a young person, registered professional planner, and someone who is fully aware of the housing crisis, the changes to farm severances will be horrible for animal agriculture. The lands needed to provide for a lot without full services is 3-5x a serviced lot. The better approach would be opening up more land for development (which is proposed already) and continuing to restrict severances in agricultural areas. Every single lot that was created in the short window of time where \"Retirement lots\" could be created in the Region of Waterloo, has proved to be an absolute nightmare for any livestock operation. So I ask, is it more important that we gain 1-3 lots on a farm, or lose animal agriculture here, when food costs are already high.\nSome farmers will opt to cease their small scale livestock operation so that they can comply with MDS regulations and sell 3 lots, which would have much more value than busting their back to raise 50 cattle etc.\nInstead, there are 1000's of lots (2-10 acres in size) that aren't used for farming, but cannot be severed. Open the door to severance of these lots as the impact on agriculture is already established. Open up more land in serviced areas. We've already learned the lessons that urban and rural do not always mix. Bringing in people without an understanding of agriculture creates conflict with air, noise, pollution etc and the farmer's right to farm.\n",

        "comment":"Please consider the following comments to be considered for the proposed updated PPS:\n1. There is an apparent and exorbitant use of the word 'housing' in the Vision section (pg. 4) of the proposed PPS. The PPS provides provincial planning direction and guidance on more than just housing (e.g. natural environment, natural resources, agriculture, infrastructure, public health, etc.), and should not just reflect the single-minded objective (i.e. build more homes) of the current Ford government.\n2. In the second paragraph of the Vision section, it states \"More than anything, a prosperous Ontario will see the building of more homes for all Ontarians.\" This is an erroneous overstatement. Building more homes, particularly as the current Ford government is proposing, is not and will not be the dominant factor contributing to the prosperity of Ontario.\n3. Regarding heading title for Chapter 2 . Replace \"Homes\" with 'and' or change title to 'Resilient, Sustainable and Prosperous Communities'.\n4. Section 3.7 - Waste Management. Need to incorporate 'reduction, reuse and recycling objectives.' from 2020 PPS.\n5. Heading title for Chapter 4 reads \"Wise Use and Management of Resources\". Natural Heritage falls within this section. Natural heritage features (e.g. rare and sensitive species, wildlife habitat, wetlands, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, etc.) should not be treated or grouped in the same category as 'resources', which is a term traditionally used to describe things that serve a direct purpose for human consumption or development. Consider re-wording the section title, such as, 'Protecting the Environment and Wise Use of Resources' OR create a new section for Natural Heritage.\n6. Section 4.1 - Natural Heritage. This section is omitted as it is under review by the current government. However, natural Heritage policies are inter-related to other policies within the PPS, and therefore, any proposed changes to natural heritage policies should have been made available in this proposed PPS document so that it could be reviewed in it's entirety and for consistency. This is a major oversight on the part of the current government. With that being said, at the very least, the review period for this proposed PPS should at least remain open until the Province has concluded its decision on any changes to the PPS natural herbage policies OR at least allow comments on any natural heritage policy changes to be incorporated into the proposed PPS before the document is finalized.\n",

As a farmer in a urban rural municipality bill 23 will help to reduce red tape. Dissolving halton region planning department and regulatory responsibilities of conservation halton reduces red tape for all levels of development from a septic tank replacement to a agricultural building to a house. Then why are you proposing PRIME AG MAPS that first of all for our farm have incorrect soil designation, and are incorrect. How does 1 farm on the street still have rural land designation and 2 doors down have prime ag when we have always had rural designation. There was never any notification that you were changing designations and as a PC government when did you ever agree with land expropriation. This is a counter to bill 23 where you took the CAregulation responsibility away. Now you want to propose a conservation proposal of Prime Ag restricting our land use and values. This is my hard earned money and savings and you want to add another layer of restrictions? And when I retire restrict who buys my property. Why don\u2019t you add these layers to the homes in the urban area? Who is advising this, OMAFRA OFA? Well they are not 46;000 farm voters in Ontario. OFA is 40 employees and not 46,000farm owners. This is land expropriation without paying the deficit I will get when I sell my farm. This is illegal and will end up in courts. If this is a proposal then why are prime ag maps already on the OMAFRA website? You need to be transparent as A government that I elected and remove this from any ONTARIO.CA maps that are already online. And stop listening to OFA as they do not represent rural urban farmers. We are in our own category.

Residential lot creation on farms, however, will lead to the loss of arable land. Given the costs of farming and the potential profit in housing developments, it is inevitable that farm land will be lost under this change. Increasing housing while losing the ability to feed the people living in that housing is a step backwards for the province of Ontario.\nLikewise, I am concerned that \"[m]unicipalities would be allowed to create new Settlement Areas and would not be required to demonstrate the need for expansion.\" The Ontario Ontario\u2019s Housing Affordability Task Force in 2022 unequivocally demonstrated that new land is not needed for housing, stating \"Land\u202fis available, both inside the existing built-up areas and\u202fon undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture (p. 10).\u201d  As such, it is imperative that municipalities continue to demonstrate the need for expansion. Removing this requirement will lead to unchecked urban sprawl and the further loss of valuable agricultural land and environmentally sensitive areas.\nTherefore, I strongly urge the government to amend this provincial planning statement to preserve agricultural land in Ontario.\n",

The growing rate of farmland loss in the province, (currently at a rate of 319 acres per day!), makes it more important than ever that provincial leaders take actions to protect this land.\nOntario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP.\nObviously, housing availability and affordability is important. However, policies proposed in PPS 2023 will not adequately address these needs. Instead, the proposed changes will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector.\nAgricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nPrevious requirements for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe are diluted in proposed changes. Encouraging municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping is not enough. Specific requirements are needed to ensure municipalities have a clear understanding and appreciation of its purpose. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, which provide economic and environmental benefits, protects the natural heritage as well as important hydrological features and functions.\nRecommendation 1: Amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 to require agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nRecommendation 2: PPS 2023 must include requirements for municipalities to use provincial guidelines to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: Remove S.4.3.3 in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nRecommendation 4: Remove S.4.3.3.2 to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect agricultural systems, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nThese changes will help to ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario, while protecting the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment.\n",

We then become dependent on countries who recognize the value of food production.  Control the food supply and you control a people.  The countries who can supply us the cheapest food don't care about food quality or soil sustainability, or even about paying their farmers a living wage.  Canada should be feeding the world -- but instead we can hardly feed ourselves, if you judge by the imports we are already putting on our shelves.\nI am not so naive to think that a homeowner living next to a farmer will accept the inconvenience: dust; noise; noxious smells; spray drift; mud splattered, tire worn roads -- it's all part of the agricultural reality, but NEVER for the suburbanite.  The 'city slickers' have the time to complain and pressure the farmer to defend his operation, thus doing serious harm to a dangerous, high-stress, risky business so critical to the wellbeing of all Canadians.  The farmer always loses.\nWith the threat of starvation during WWII, European nations recognized the importance of protecting their farmers, and continue to do so with legislation.  Canadians, never having been threatened by an invading army, have no such respect for the bounty they take for granted. WAKE UP!!  If you don't want your children and grandchildren to know the threat of starvation, we need to protect the rights of the people who feed us today.  Once land has been \"converted\" from agricultural to residential, it can never be reclaimed.  Are we so narrow-minded?  Really?  Take the business away from farmers and give it to developers because they're more important?  Really?  Whatever happened to intelligent thinking?\n",

Housing is nice to have but food is essential and it can't be grown in many areas of Ontario.  I live in a rural area and the increase in housing is in my backyard.  The destruction of wildlife habitat, the flattening of trees that are hundreds of years old is extremely sad to witness.  The distance people commute is exhausting and  speeding on the roads around here kills thousands of animals every year and takes its toll on commuters.  I see no upside to continuing to create horribly planned miles of housing.  All greenspace is eliminated (are you really in the country then), there is no public transport (do we need more cars driving farther and farther), there is no use of green energy (why are we still building housing with fossil fuels when we know so much about greenhouse gases).  It is the 21st century and our planning and approach is unchanged from the 1950s.  Do I believe people want to live 2 hours from their workplace.  I sincerely doubt it.  One day we are going to be knocking down these same houses to get some farmland so we can have access to affordable food.  Look at your grocery bill - it is shocking and there is no end in sight.  I believe the current Ontario government is more interested in furthering the riches of the few at the expense of the many.  Go back and scour Toronto and areas that are relatively close to maximize the use of all unused and underused land.  Yes it is more expensive but in the end, it will meet your needs.  Put an end to the situation where a handful of people are buying up all farmland and leaving it vacant (often parking vehicles so we can pretend it is domestic housing) waiting for the big government payout - a shameful situation.\n",

As a Senior, I have seen over the years the different Governments of this province either close down or allow foreign companies to buy and close our farms or food production companies.  If the Government of the day continues on this path, the citizens of Ontario will have to get all their food from out of province, increasing the cost of food.  And, like the Pandemic showed, the supply of food will be hampered by transportation problems resulting in lack of food and higher prices.  People in this province are already paying too much for food.\nYes there is a need for housing, but taking farm land is not the answer.  Why do we need huge homes on huge lots?  Smaller homes on smaller lots will house more people.  And build them on infill lots in cities, towns and villages that are available now.  And there should be more smaller one-floor homes for we seniors who want to downsize.

If housing and development must be expanded, it is critical that it is not done on agricultural lands. The Greenbelt was constructed with the practical intent to restrict urban sprawl and protect existing farmland. Moreover, the Greenbelt reduces the risk of floods, protects ecosystems and wildlife, supplies clean air, and supports nurturing the well-being of citizens. I have attached a link that highlights the importance of nature, specifically the Greenbelt, and how it is beneficial to humans' mental and physical health. By opening land for development in these areas, years of environmental protection efforts will be undone, jeopardizing the well-being of present and future generations.\nOntario is home to limited widespread greenspaces. It is imperative to preserve what we have left; if not for us presently, then for the sake of our future. Farmland is a finite resource, and when these lands are developed, the soils are permanently barred from their previous functionality, which has been so prevalent in the production of crops like Niagara peaches and Durham strawberries. The 2021 Canadian Census notes that Ontario is losing 319 acres of farmland each day, which is incredibly alarming for the province's future. When more farmland is lost, it becomes more difficult to produce a sufficient quantity of food to support the existing population, and the cost of living will increase significantly. This can and has exacerbated and increased existing social issues like homelessness and poverty.\nI sincerely hope that the negative implications of increasing development in Ontario, specifically on agricultural lands, are considered.

The relative small Greater Toronto un-economical farms (100-200 acres) may be reduced to 25-40 acre lots - still leaving lots of green space and encouraging continued development - and adequate size for a small hobby farm for families enjoying the lands.\nWe maintain, for a farm to be economical, the cultivated land must comprise at least 500 acres, preferably 1-2,000 acres.

This is especially true with shifting development charge costs to the tax base.  It will be more difficult for municipalities to avoid significant increases in property taxes which hurts a wide variety of residents of Ontario.  It remains unclear what will be considered affordable and attainable housing.  The ability to create new lots in agricultural areas will reduce Ontario's farm outputs and increase imports.  Not to mention the potential loss of specialty crop lands to aggregate extraction.  I urge  you to pause and consult with your partners at AMO, OFA, CFFO, and ROMA before moving ahead.\n",

Although such zoning limits our potential to make money from our land, my husband and I are content with the situation for the greater good of the area - including the health of the adjacent pond which is a classed as a provincially significant wetland.  I see nothing in the proposed legislation which would protect that wetland, nor which would protect our quality of life. All I see is the goal of opening land for development i.e. profit-taking from an irreplaceable resource for the short-term profit of a few. In my opinion, destruction  of productive farmland is a short-sighted and wrong-headed objective in an age when our food supply chain is threatened by political and climate change realities.\n",

We have plenty of land and opportunity for densification inside the existing built areas and brownfield areas of the Toronto Region where the introduction of medium density multiplexes of up to 4 stories in established neighbourhoods could meet the demands of millions in very comfortable not too congested environments that have many urban amenities, transit, walkability for health, churches and other cultural facilities in close proximity that will help support a healthy, happy and productive quality of life.\nWe all very well know how unhealthy the suburban lifestyle that is proposed here is for our bodies, minds and the environment and its impact on climate change.\nI hope you will consider my comments and others seriously, but I suspect secret deals have already been made with the rich corporate elites that effectively run this province.\n",

The expansion of high density housing into our rural zones comes as the direct result of unopposed federal immigration policies that are ballooning the amount of people seeking habitation to never before volumes. Instead of increasing the population to inflate economic activity, governments should be encouraging the return of industry from China, supporting free enterprise, and funding skilled trades and apprenticeships at the high school level, so as to increase real GDP, that is, real productivity. We cannot afford to lose fertile, productive, farmland in an era in which food security is coming under increasing pressure because of ideologically simple-minded federal government policies that care more about virtue-signalling to the U.N. than they do about the Canadian people. Because our current provincial Conservative government stands \"shoulder to shoulder\" with the federal Liberal government, I suspect you don't care about the real needs of the people of Ontario. Nevertheless, as a free born citizen of this great province, I want you to know that I do not consent to the wrongful development of prime agricultural land.

        "comment":"I do not believe this bill should pass as it would endanger important agricultural land and present increased health safety risks for any new housing development near farms.\nFirstly, there has been no sign that increased residential zoning changes has had an impact on the actual amount and affordability of housing projects being completed. There is a record number of housing projects approved within major cities that have never been started or are still under construction years into the process. Furthermore, this bill does not address key affordability issues when it comes to housing. These issues, supply cost and construction employee numbers, should be prioritized rather than expanding where housing can be built.\nSecondly, agriculture and farming involves potential exposure to chemicals and biological toxins on a near constant basis. While farmers have experience in keeping themselves and their employees safe through proper PPE, the impact of these dangerous substances remains in the land as well as spread out over significant distances. Any residential building project would be exposed to health risks and potentially contaminated land which would negate any possible affordability benefits.\nThirdly, there is already a major farming crisis in Ontario and Canada. As the cost of farming has increased over the years and the interest in this important jobs has decreased, Ontario is already facing a lack of accessible and local food supplies. To further reduce the agricultural facilities of Ontario would see the price of food and farm-related goods sky-rocket even more. Ontario must protect the farming industry by providing assistance to farmers and helping them find successors as they age out of the workforce.\nLastly, the unnecessary expansion of housing projects on agricultural would have significant ecological impact as it would reduce already endangered habitats for animals, increase the carbon footprint of the province, and cause significant disruptions on local communities. Housing is a large producer of carbon footprint, and expanding possible housing project brings with it significant costs. From getting the supplies for making a house to digging up the grounds for sewer access or sanitation necessities, the amount of CO2 produced by the process is significant. Ontario is already not fulfilling its ecological obligations. It should not be increasing the carbon emissions at such a time.\n",

We all receive an economic benefit of working in southern Ontario from Niagara to London to Barrie to Bowenville and we should all work together for the benefit of all.  Without coordinated water, sewers, transportation (roads, highways, transit, cycling, sidewalk), police, fire and paramedics we are doomed to fail.    You cannot build more housing without the top three of water, sewer and transportation.   That is the reality!!  Where are the trade schools??\nLook at the mess we are in now and we need at least three service boards to coordinate the southern Ontario area.  We need a strong Transportation Board (We kind of have it with Metrolinx), Underground (sewer, water, treatment plants) Service Board and an Emergency Services Board (Police, Fire & Paramedics).  These three strong boards need to be created to support every town and City, no one should be left behind.  Regional governments have acted too independently for far too long and we do not need this upper tier government.\nI also recommend that boundary roads be given to one municipality, too many issues when it falls within the middle of the roadway or the new \"Transportation Board\" takes on the responsibilities.\nI recommend the following amendment to the first section: 3.1 General Policies for Infrastructure and Public Service Facilities.\n1.

With climate change already threatening the future of global and local food supplies, Ontario needs to ensure the protection of our arable land.

I hate driving through agricultural areas and seeing huge tracts of land being turned into sprawling housing developments. It also threatens small local ecosystems and further contributes to clinate change. Densify existing cities without destroying our farmland. This government seems to give little consideration to anyone other than developers and fully willing to sacrifice both greenbelt and farmland alike to promote development for houses that won't even be in the price range for first time home buyers. I am also deeply concerned by the impact such expansions will have into the environments of farming communities. Increased toxins from emissions going into the soils and crops that are for human consimption, to say nothing of the environmental impact on waterways and wildlife in the area is great concern. The government already weakened the environmental assessments process to facilitate development, so I have no confidence that any serious thought has been given to the impacts of such development plans beyond the financial gaylins of developers and investors.

Land values skyrocket pricing out new farm operations and encouraging further development.\nThose province needs to focus on building density in serviced urban areas. Leave the farms to feed Ontario and our greenbelt lands alone.\n",

        "comment":"Existing serviced green and brown lands in cities are sufficient for the expected urban growth in southern Ontario without the need for any expansion into the Greenbelt as proposed by these two bills.  The expansion will result in costlier homes, not only in terms of rental and purchase prices, but also in pollution and environmental damages.  Food prices will increase.  The only benefit I see is for the real estate developer in the short term.  We have followed the maxim of urban sprawl since the sixties and are seeing the damaging consequences.  Let us learn from the past and let these bills due on the order paper. No to the expansion of urban sprawl into the farmlands of southern Ontario.\n",

However; that cannot supersede the potential for future food scarcity by removing locally grown produce. The way of the future is building infrastructure that allows for continued access to locally grown food sources. Southern Ontario has the most fertile soil, and once we start building on it we will never again have access to this resource.\nThere are also health risks associated with living close to commercial farms, such as an increase of neurodegenerative diseases due to being in close proximity to pesticides used on the farms. There are many studies in this area, but this form doesn\u2019t allow for multiple website submissions.\nIn addition new research has linked exposure to blue-green algae, caused by phosphorus in the water associated with new builds (etc), to be a cause of ALS.

These changes would further exacerbate urban sprawl and the ongoing loss of farmland and natural areas in Ontario. The continued onslaught to long standing conservation safeguards must stop. For years, YREA has advocated against sprawl and the unnecessary Hwy 413 in favour of protecting farmland. Our exact words included \u2018what will happen when climate change & drought reduce agricultural capacity in the USA?\u2019 WELL THAT TIME HAS COME as US fruit giants Driscoll & Naturipe look north to Canada to establish berry farms in Quebec & Ontario. In place of these sprawl amendments, Ontario should be making provisions to accommodate the continued waves of farming migrants by protecting and expanding farmland so we can ensure greater agricultural capability and local food security in the emerging climate crisis which will impact agriculture and food supply worldwide.\nSprawl development will not solve current housing needs, as this government pretends. A shortage of land is not the cause of Ontario\u2019s housing scarcity, it is inefficient land use which can be resolved in existing areas through intensification. The amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets. The Oak Ridges Moraine and Greenbelt must be protected by retaining all PPS and Growth Plan policies. YREA is strongly opposed to  proposed policy changes that would:\n- Eliminate mandatory intensification and allow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a full review of infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n- Force municipalities to allow severances from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n- Exempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n- Remove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning and protection;\n- Weaken and eliminate policies intended to address climate change.\nThese proposed policies will spell disaster for the lands and waters that sustain Ontarians. We urge you to do what is right. Withdraw ERO 019-6813 and retain all PPS and Growth Plan policies that are designed to curb sprawl and protect farmland and natural areas. The politicians, cronies and influencers who have no qualms about eliminating the plans that protect our environment will soon be gone while the damage caused by their self-interests and foolhardy decisions will last forever.\nSincerely\nGloria Marsh, Executive Director\nYork Region Environmental Alliance\nPartnering for a greener planet\nhttp:\/\/www.yrea.org\n",

Growing up in the 70s in southwestern Ontario I am shocked by the amount of agricultural land lost. Of course we can\u2019t just have fields and houses we need trees or we loose all of the soil to erosion. Looking at our province it would be forward thinking to encourage development north in places like Sudbury and the Sault where housing is more affordable and we are not using prime agricultural land. I have grave concerns with the close proximity the Premier has to developers in the GTA. South western and eastern Ontario is not where we need more people living. Move governement buildings and provide incentives for regulatory organizations etc to move out of South Ontario to communities north.\nAdditionally It would be beneficial if Municipalities were to relinquish some of their archaic control of how people use their own land. I know many young people who are attempting to get into the real estate market but a traditional brick and mortar home  is often beyond their reach. I see that you have included farms being able to build more then one residence on a property. Good first step but those homes need to be a bit more flexible. Tiny homes, renovated trailers and converted shipping containers are also viable options for young people who are trying to just get into the market.\nNot being able to get a mortgage on vacant land is another barrier to future real estate acquisition. Vacant land is more affordable but only if a person can get a mortgage on vacant land.\nI would also like to see limiting regulations on companies that purchase single family dwellings and convert to rental units. Home ownership is being limited to the old and extremely wealthy.\nJust building more homes is not necessarily the answer to our housing crisis. As a mother of 4 adult children, all of whom have careers and good jobs, I would hope they can one day purchase a home.\n",

        "comment":"At their meeting on May 16th, 2023, the Council of the Municipality of Morris-Turnberry received a staff report outlining the proposed changes in the new Provincial Policy Statement and Bill 97. Council was supportive of proposed changes to the requirements for considering a settlement area boundary expansions, but expressed great concern regarding the proposed changes that would allow for additional lot creation in agricultural areas. Below is a summary of the concerns identified by Council for your consideration.\n1.\t Agricultural Lot Severances\nProposed Changes\nThe most significant change for the Municipality of Morris-Turnberry proposed under the new PPS 2023 is new policies for residential lot creation in prime agricultural areas. The current PPS discourages residential lot creation in prime agricultural areas, with the exception of surplus farm residence severances.  The changes would allow additional permanent residences and the severance of the additional residences, and the creation of new residential lots in the agricultural area (4.3.2.5 and 4.3.3.1).\nComments\nResidential lot creation in prime agricultural areas has been discouraged since the Countryside Planning\/Foodland Guidelines were issued by the Province of Ontario in the 1970s. The purpose of this provincial-wide planning document was to ensure the protection of prime agricultural land for food production. Despite this, it is estimated by the Federation of Agriculture of Ontario that approximately 319 acres of farmland are lost to development and taken out of production in Ontario every day. Our agricultural lands are not only a finite resource, but also the foundation of the livelihoods of many families and family run agribusiness.\nThe Municipality of Morris-Turnberry is a prime agricultural area and agriculture is extremely important to the economy and the production of food for the province.  For decades, the Municipality has had strong Official Plan policies protecting this agricultural resource and directing non-agricultural related development to settlement areas.  Staff and Council do recognize the need for housing in the agricultural area and in response have updated Zoning By-laws to allow for additional residential units in the AG1 and AG4 zones, and expanded permissions for on-farm housing for farm labour.  This allows for additional housing related to agriculture but does not fragment the land base. With current policies, Council is regularly asked to make decisions regarding conflicting land uses and considers many Minor Variance applications to regulate either agricultural operation expansion or residential development that doesn\u2019t conform to MDS restrictions. The Province\u2019s proposal to allow for scattered residential development through lot creation will harm existing operations and threaten the sustainability and growth potential of the existing agricultural industry.\nThe opening up of scattered residential lot creation in the prime agricultural areas may:\n\u2022\tincrease conflict with modern farming practices,\n\u2022\tincrease MDS restrictions on the placement of new barns;\n\u2022\treduce the number of units being built in settlement areas where municipalities have invested substantial funds on services (hard and soft),\n\u2022\tlost opportunities for infrastructure efficiency in settlement areas;\n\u2022\tand increase the demand on municipalities to provide enhanced rural services e.g. more frequent snow plowing, road maintenance, garbage collection, emergency services, etc.\n\u2022\tring serviced settlement areas with unserviced residential development making it more difficult and costly for future settlement area expansions and extension of services.\nIt is requested that the Province provide clarification on the criteria in the policies for creating new residential lots, including what is considered to be adjacent to a non-agricultural use, and what are lower-priority agricultural lands.  It is unclear if this is limited to areas adjacent to Settlement Areas, Recreational uses and Institutional uses, or if it introduces the potential for 3 new residential lots next to all existing residences including farm residences and those that have been severed as surplus. Further, does this also allow residential lot creation on any area that a farm considers lower priority or inconvenient to farm rather than just areas with lower capability soils.   Clarification is also requested on the criteria that requires an existing access on a public road and whether that access must exist or can it be obtained as part of the process.  This clarification would help to determine the number of new residential lots that could be eligible to be severed across the Municipality and the effect of the policy on the agricultural industry.\nIf the Province\u2019s intention is to permit the creation of 3 residential lots from every farm parcel, this has the potential to result in thousands of non-farm related lots in the agricultural area across the Municipality.  The Province should reconsider this substantial policy direction change and the long term effects it will have on the protection of prime agricultural lands and maintaining the ability for farmers to farm.  In addition, there may be other unintended consequences such as the effect of additional residences on the potential for future aggregate extraction.\n2.\t Settlement Area Expansions\nProposed Changes\nThe requirement for a Comprehensive Review to identify a new settlement area or expand a settlement area boundary has been removed in the proposed 2023 PPS.\nWith no requirement for municipal comprehensive reviews, municipalities could consider settlement area expansions at any time.\nStaff Comments\nMunicipal staff and Council are supportive of the change to streamline the process for expanding settlement areas based on logical extensions, while taking agricultural impacts into account.  This is a more efficient use of land than scattered residential lots in the prime agricultural areas.  The Province only encourages municipalities to set density targets for these expanded areas but should give consideration to stronger language to ensure efficient use of these additional development lands.\n",

This is severely limit the ability to produce food in Ontario.\nOntario's prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario's land base1. Ontario has lost 20% of our farmland in the last 40 years.  With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day, it is more important than ever before that we protect our prime agricultural areas. Once farmland is developed, it is gone forever.\nFarmland is the foundation of the agri-food sector that provides us with locally produced foods, employs more than 750,000 Ontarians, or 1-in-10 of the province\u2019s labour force, and contributes over $47 billion annually to the province's GDP.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed Provincial Planning Statement and in Bill 97 will not contribute to the housing issues. Bill 97 and the proposed PPS will further only exacerbate sprawling development and fragment Ontario\u2019s best farmland, threatening the viability of the agricultural sector.\nThe sections in Bill 97 and the new PPS that are the most concerning and must be addressed include:\nThe weakening of policy language that will undermine the implementation of agricultural system planning that will lead to inconsistencies in designating prime agricultural areas;\nThe removal of municipal comprehensive reviews that assessed settlement boundary expansion to protect prime agricultural land;\nReducing existing density targets for fast-growing municipalities and removing density targets for the remaining municipalities within the Greater Golden Horseshoe. This will lead to inefficiencies of land use in existing settlement areas and will require boundaries to expand on farmland more quickly; and\nThe requirement for municipalities to permit up to three severances on prime agricultural areas for residential lot creation.\nThe additional powers afforded to the use of Minister's Zoning Orders (MZOs) in the land use planning process.\nWith the current rate of farmland loss, Ontario\u2019s farmland will be completely lost in the next 100 years. We do not have time to sprawl and fragment Canada\u2019s best farmland.\nI urge you to address these concerns and save Ontario\u2019s limited agricultural land. Until these amendments are made, I urge to vote NO on Bill 97 and the newly proposed Provincial Planning Statement.\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

WE are farmers, my son farms full time, and his sons also want to farm.\nFarms and farmland  - that is the basis of our food land producing systems -need to be given the same high degree of protection as underground resources and environmentally sensitive areas. The food system in Ontario cannot contribute to economic growth if the basic resource to support it - productive farmland - is lost.\nIn an urban setting, houses would not be allowed in an industrial area, and vice versa. To reduce the same kind of neighborhood conflicts in farming areas, residential uses need to be kept apart from farms, that produce noise often 24\/7 in parts of the year, and smells from livestock, dust from machines, and paranoia from the use of chemicals fertilizers and crop protection agents.  Most new home owners adjacent to farms are not aware that they are not living in a park, but rather in an intensely managed, semi-industrial area.\nModern machinery that contributes to efficiency - ie cheap food -needs large fields, with a minimum of obstacles, of areas requiring stopping, starting, turning around, that severance produce.\nWhile a small number of farmers may desire the ability to carve the farm into small parcels for financial gain, the majority, and any with successors interested in farming, and therefore take a long view, rather than just cash in the bank today and nothing tomorrow, will be opposed to the proposition to effectively roll back land use planning by 50 years.\n",

Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on sections of the proposed PPS 2023 dealing with intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion.\nComments regarding proposed changes to intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion:\nI have significant concerns regarding the proposed policy changes found in the PPS 2023 regarding intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion. These policies should ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. However, while the proposed PPS 2023 generally states support for intensification, it does not require targets for municipalities across Ontario and provides many permissions that would undermine attempts at intensification. Additionally, the intensification targets for many municipalities in the Growth Plan have been reduced or removed altogether, which will use up lands in municipal boundaries faster and lead to increased rates of urban boundary expansion. Without the requirement to complete municipal comprehensive reviews, this poses a significant threat to farmland. As noted below, reducing and eliminating density targets is contrary to encouraging complete communities found within the proposed PPS. This will lead to fragmented patterns of development, including when settlement boundary expansion occurs.\nI have noted concerns under s.2.3, Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions. The policy in s.2.3.2 now states that \u201cland use patterns within settlement areas should be based on densities and a mix of land uses\u201d. The province opted to change the language from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d, which weakens the policies that are meant to support intensification. Additionally, the language that states land use patterns should \u201cminimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, promote energy efficiency\u201d and \u201cprepare for the impacts of a changing climate\u201d has been removed. This is concerning given the climate crisis we are facing and that agriculture relies on healthy and stable ecosystems to produce a consistent supply of quality local food. By removing this language, the province is undermining the future viability of the agricultural sector, the largest sector of the Ontario economy.\nRecommendation 1: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.2 that will require municipalities to adopt land use patterns that support density targets and also minimize negative environmental impacts.\nFurthermore, s.2.3.3 states that \u201cplanning authorities should support general intensification and redevelopment to support the achievement of complete communities, including by planning for a range and mix of housing options and prioritizing planning and investment in the necessary infrastructure and public service facilities.\u201d Once again, the use of \u201cshould\u201d is not strong enough to ensure the deliverables of complete communities. Furthermore, the policy no longer requires planning authorities to identify appropriate locations or take stock of suitable existing sites, eroding the possibility of efficient land use. While I encourage the use of complete communities in the planning framework, the removal of intensification targets will not only have sever impact to farmland but it will undermine the existing urban planning framework to achieve complete communities.\nRecommendation 2: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.3 that will require municipalities to identify appropriate locations for intensification.\nThe policy on settlement area expansion has also been weakened, which will further threaten Ontario\u2019s prime agricultural land. A major concern is removing the requirement of a municipal comprehensive review that demonstrates the need for expansion. Additionally, the language in s.2.3.4 has been changed from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d which weaken the policy, making it possible for development to occur on prime agricultural lands. While proposed s.2.3.4.b states that applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas, this is a subsection under s.2.3.4 which states planning authorities \u201cshould\u201d consider this. Since the language does require planning authorities to consider this, there is the likelihood of it still occurring. This is also the case for s.2.3.4d regarding impacts on agricultural lands and operations that are adjacent or close to the settlement.\nRecommendation 3: The province should require municipal comprehensive reviews prior to settlement boundary expansion and require the planning authority to demonstrate the need. Furthermore, the province needs to adopt stronger language in s.2.3.4 that ensures the applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas and that prime agricultural areas are avoided to the greatest extent possible as determined through an agricultural impact assessment.\nI have also noted the removal of policies from s.2.6 Rural Lands in Municipalities, in particular, \u201cwhen directing development on rural lands, a planning authority shall apply the relevant policies of Section 1: Building Strong Healthy Communities, as well as the policies of Section 2: Wise Use and Management of Resources and Section 3: Protecting Public Health and Safety.\u201d I suggest that the removal of this policy will undermine the future resiliency of rural communities.\nRecommendation 4: The province should reinstate the policies pertaining to directing development on rural lands that require planning authorities to apply relevant policies that support strong and resilient communities as found in the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020.\nFinally, there is concern pertaining to the language in s.2.1.1 that states, \u201csufficient land shall be made available to accommodate an appropriate range and mix of land uses to meet projected needs for a time horizon of at least 25 years.\u201d As noted above, without improving language and goals pertaining to density targets, it will be increasingly difficult for municipalities to plan accurately for beyond 25 years. This will likely lead to further settlement area expansion to accommodate the likelihood of urban sprawl, which will reduce investments in agricultural operations surrounding urban boundaries.\nRecommendation 5: The province should maintain the current requirement for planning authorities to plan for up to 25 years in order to minimize unnecessary and premature settlement area expansion.\nIn conclusion, the proposed changes to intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion weaken policies that would ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. The use of weaker language and the removal of requirements will lead to increased rates of settlement boundary expansion and further threaten farmland and the agricultural sector. It is essential that the policies are strengthened to ensure efficient land use and protect Ontario\u2019s agricultural operations and communities.\n",

        "comment":"I have issues with some of the amended land use policies proposed in this Statement as they apply to heritage properties in the Province. Along with amendments to the Heritage Act in Bill 23, these put a significant number of heritage properties under risk and make it much more difficult for municipal heritage planners to effectively do their jobs. Under this \"use it or lose it\" approach many listed properties on heritage registers will be struck from the list by January 1, 2025, and cannot be re-instated within 5 years. In the attendant scramble to officially designate individual properties of major historical and architectural importance within the next two years, it's logical to conclude that many significant structures will fall through the cracks and miss this deadline, resulting in a loss of many irreplaceable heritage buildings to new development.\nSome of the proposed language in the new PPS seems to continue the erosion of protections for heritage properties found in Bill 23. \u201cSignificant built heritage resources and significant cultural landscapes\u201d is gone, replaced with \u201cprotected heritage property which may contain heritage resources...shall be conserved\u201d. Protected heritage property is defined as property designated either individually or as part of a HCD. So, going forward, properties that are under consideration for designation, listed properties, and properties that are designated as a result of a demolition or development application will not be included in this new PPS as they were before. This again has the effect of removing protections for certain types of properties.\nThe definition of  \u2018adjacency\u2019 is also changed. A more restrictive meaning of \u201ccontiguous\u201d means that there may be no more latitude for Official Plans definitions that go beyond strict contiguity. This is a potential problem.\nAlso, the recommendation that \u201cproactive strategies for the identification of property evaluation under the OHA\u201d be undertaken is not clear. The intent of this phrase should be clarified.\n",

Specifically, OFT is concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario's prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario's land base[1]. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day[2], it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario's farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province's GDP[3].\nWhile OFT recognizes the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, OFT is concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario's agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023, section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments. However, OFT has a breadth of concerns regarding several of the proposed policies and Ontario's agricultural land that are addressed in other submissions.\nComments regarding section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nOFT is concerned about proposed s.4.3.3 which permits the severance of three residential lots from parcels in prime agricultural areas. This poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. As it currently reads, this policy could apply to any parcel of agricultural land, regardless of its size or whether it was previously severed before January 2023. Given that there are 48,346 farms4 and as many as 170,000 farmland properties in Ontario5, the province could see anywhere from 145,038 to 510,000 lots severed from agricultural properties. Therefore, if each lot is approximately 1-acre in size, this policy alone would be responsible for removing anywhere from 1.25% to 4.3% of Ontario's finite agricultural land base.\nThe use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays6. While OFT appreciates that proposed s.4.3.1 states \"Planning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach,\" this policy does not provide the strength needed to require agricultural systems, and appears to be in contradiction to the permissions of s.4.3.3. When you factor in s.4.3.2.5, which permits up to two additional dwellings in prime agricultural areas, this could result in as many as 1.5 million dwellings on newly severed lots in agricultural areas. This will lead to significant farmland fragmentation, which is contradictory to the purpose of an agricultural system, and will cause significant disruptions to surrounding agricultural operations.\nMoving to rural areas often means embracing the realities of agricultural living, such as noise, dust, odors, and farm equipment on the roads. Unfortunately, this leads to land-use compatibility conflicts that are difficult to mitigate once residential units are developed in agricultural areas. This poses significant challenges for farmers, especially when Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) is not properly followed during development approvals. This is concerning given that Bill 23 prevents third-party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal, making it difficult for nearby farmers to address MDS concerns. Additionally, constructing residential units up to the MDS line will limit any future growth of the agricultural operation, threatening the future viability of animal agriculture in Ontario.\nFurthermore, additional residential units on prime agricultural areas will result in an increase in water usage from underground aquifers. Three additional lots, including three additional residential units would put a significant strain on the water usage and increase the likelihood of water source issues for both the residents and the agricultural operation. Agriculture uses significant amounts of water to irrigate crops and provide water to livestock. Although a large percentage of water is returned to the source, often it has been changed and carrying soil and dissolved compounds7. With less water available in the aquifer, any contaminants will be more concentrated. Therefore, permitting three lot severances in prime agricultural areas will have significant implications for water availability and safety.\nBy permitting lot severances, the province will be impacting the financial accessibility of farmland for the next generation of farmers, making farming less financially viable. Each farm property will likely increase in price relative to the value of three vacant lots in the respective region. Ontario experienced a 19.4% increase in property values in 20228, making it unattainable or financially unfeasible for many young farmers to buy land. The proposed severance policies will incentivize developers, who can outbid young farmers, to purchase farmland or provide cash incentives for farmers to sever lots, contributing to the increase in farmland prices. This will result in the next generation experiencing a fragmented agricultural system and keeping ownership of farmland out of their reach. This is concerning because if the next generation of farmers cannot afford to farm, and experience it as increasingly difficult to farm, the province will not have a viable agricultural sector for much longer.\nWe have noticed that the new proposed PPS 2023 states in policy 4.3.1.2, \"As part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\" However, permitting lot severances for residential use contradicts lands being designated for the long-term protection for agriculture.\nWe believe that the proposed s. 4.3.2.5, which would allow two additional units on existing farm properties, could be significant in providing housing opportunities for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. Similarly, the proposed s. 2.2.1.b.2 allows more land for housing by converting existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use. Given these other proposed policies permitting additional housing and the significant concerns over the proposed lot creation policies, OFT questions why there is a need to permit such a significant allowance for severances.\nFurthermore, permitting these severances is in contradiction to proposed s. 2.2.1.c, \"promoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation.\" S.4.3.3 will not promote efficiency in these areas and will detract from the intentions to support intensification.\nWe believe that municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising between non-farming residents and the agricultural community. However, proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being more restrictive, which could be vital for preventing these types of conflicts. For rural communities whose economies and culture are intricately associated with agriculture, s.4.3.3.2 will prevent municipalities from protecting a key component of their communities and is contradictory to the content on page 3 that states the PPS 2023 recognizes the diversity of Ontario and that local context is important. S.4.3.3.2 restricts rural municipalities from ensuring the local context of their agricultural system is protected from farmland fragmentation.\nWe, therefore, urge the province to consider these concerns and remove s.4.3.3 in its entirety so that the proposed changes do not harm the province's agricultural lands and the farmers who depend on them. The province should require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping and allow municipalities to implement additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and prevent conflicts with non-farming residents.\nThank you for considering our submission, and our organization looks forward to the province's response. OFT hopes you also refer to our other submissions regarding settlement area expansion and agricultural system planning.\nSincerely,\nMartin Straathof, Executive Director\nOntario Farmland Trust\n",

        "comment":"We are writing to express our concerns regarding the proposed changes in the Provincial Policy Statement and their impact on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario has some of the best farmland in the country but it is concentrated in the southern part of the province where there are also pressures to construct more housing. There is already a significant amount of farmland that is being lost every day so it is extremely important for the province to strengthen protections for this critical resource rather than weaken them.  Farming is an important economic driver in Ontario not to mention the food security that it provides.  As we deal with the climate crisis it is imperative that we protect the environmental benefits of farmlands and their adjacent natural areas as well ensuring food security for future generations.\nWe understand the critical need for housing as our population increases but compromising farmland to meet this need is not the answer.  Intensification of our urban areas is a better solution both to protect farmland but also to provide accommodation where people can have easy access to services and public transportation.\nThe proposed changes to the Provincial Policy Statement weaken local planning policies that are meant to support intensification. In addition, the language that states land use patterns should \u201cminimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, promote energy efficiency\u201d and \u201cprepare for the impacts of a changing climate\u201d has been removed.  This change poses a significant threat to both members of the community and to the agricultural sector at a time when all of us are faced with adapting to a changing climate.  Our government needs to ensure that regulations regarding land use help to mitigate the impacts of climate change, not contribute to them.\nThe plan to allow severance of three residential lots on farm properties will have very negative repercussions for the agricultural sector.  Rules have been in place for many years here in Waterloo Region to prevent the fragmenting of farmland. These rules were put in place to protect farmland and prevent disruption to agricultural areas.  Allowing this severance policy has the potential of removing many acres of farmland at a time when farmland is already being lost as mentioned previously. The severance policy will also increase the price of farmland as developers get involved in purchasing parcels of severed farmland.  New farmers won\u2019t be able to afford to purchase land, furthering the decline of the agricultural sector.\nWe strongly urge the provincial government to abandon the proposed changes to the Provincial Policy Statement and instead consider what measures must be taken to ensure the long-term health of our agricultural sector.\n",

However, OFT has a breadth of concerns regarding several of the proposed policies and Ontario's agricultural land that is addressed in other submissions.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile OFT appreciates the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \"planning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\" The use of the word 'encouraged' is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays[4].\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nOFT noted the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. OFT has submitted another detailed response that addresses these concerns in greater detail, however, it is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nWe acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\n\u2003\nWe urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector's significant contributions to the province's GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\nMartin Straathof, Executive Director\nOntario Farmland Trust\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

Ontario's farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province's GDP[3].\nWhile OFT recognizes the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, our organization is concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario's agri-food sector.  This submission will focus primarily on sections of the proposed PPS 2023 dealing with intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion. However, OFT has a breadth of concerns regarding several of the proposed policies and Ontario's agricultural land that is addressed in other submissions.\nComments regarding proposed changes to intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion:\nOFT has significant concerns regarding the proposed policy changes found in the PPS 2023 regarding intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion. These policies should ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. However, while the proposed PPS 2023 generally states support for intensification, it does not require targets for municipalities across Ontario and provides many permissions that would undermine attempts at intensification. Additionally, the intensification targets for many municipalities in the Growth Plan have been reduced or removed altogether, which will use up lands in municipal boundaries faster and lead to increased rates of urban boundary expansion. Without the requirement to complete municipal comprehensive reviews, this poses a significant threat to farmland. As noted below, reducing and eliminating density targets is contrary to encouraging complete communities found within the proposed PPS. This will lead to fragmented patterns of development, including when settlement boundary expansion occurs.\nOFT has noted concerns under s.2.3, Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions. The policy in s.2.3.2 now states that \"land use patterns within settlement areas should be based on densities and a mix of land uses\". The province opted to change the language from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d, which weakens the policies that are meant to support intensification. Additionally, the language that states land use patterns should \u201cminimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, promote energy efficiency\u201d and \u201cprepare for the impacts of a changing climate\u201d has been removed.  This is concerning given the climate crisis we are facing and that agriculture relies on healthy and stable ecosystems to produce a consistent supply of quality local food. By removing this language, the province is undermining the future viability of the agricultural sector, the largest sector of the Ontario economy.\nRecommendation 1: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.2 that will require municipalities to adopt land use patterns that support density targets and also minimize negative environmental impacts.\nFurthermore, s.2.3.3 states that \"planning authorities should support general intensification and redevelopment to support the achievement of complete communities, including by planning for a range and mix of housing options and prioritizing planning and investment in the necessary infrastructure and public service facilities.\" Once again, the use of \"should\" is not strong enough to ensure the deliverables of complete communities. Furthermore, the policy no longer requires planning authorities to identify appropriate locations or take stock of suitable existing sites, eroding the possibility of efficient land use. While OFT encourages the use of complete communities in the planning framework, the removal of intensification targets will not only have sever impact to farmland but it will undermine the existing urban  planning framework to achieve complete communities.\nRecommendation 2: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.3 that will require municipalities to identify appropriate locations for intensification.\nThe policy on settlement area expansion has also been weakened, which will further threaten Ontario\u2019s prime agricultural land. A major concern is removing the requirement of a municipal comprehensive review that demonstrates the need for expansion. Additionally, the language in s.2.3.4 has been changed from \"shall\" to \"should\" which weaken the policy, making it possible for development to occur on prime agricultural lands. While proposed s.2.3.4.b states that applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas, this is a subsection under s.2.3.4 which states planning authorities \"should\" consider this. Since the language does require planning authorities to consider this, there is the likelihood of it still occurring. This is also the case for s.2.3.4d regarding impacts on agricultural lands and operations that are adjacent or close to the settlement.\nRecommendation 3: The province should require municipal comprehensive reviews prior to settlement boundary expansion and require the planning authority to demonstrate the need. Furthermore, the province needs to adopt stronger language in s.2.3.4 that ensures the applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas and that prime agricultural areas are avoided to the greatest extent possible as determined through an agricultural impact assessment.\nOFT has also noted the removal of policies from s.2.6 Rural Lands in Municipalities, in particular, \u201cwhen directing development on rural lands, a planning authority shall apply the relevant policies of Section 1: Building Strong Healthy Communities, as well as the policies of Section 2: Wise Use and Management of Resources and Section 3: Protecting Public Health and Safety.\u201d OFT is suggesting that the removal of this policy will undermine the future resiliency of rural communities.\nRecommendation 4: The province should reinstate the policies pertaining to directing development on rural lands that require planning authorities to apply relevant policies that support strong and resilient communities as found in the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020.\nFinally, there is concern pertaining to the language in s.2.1.1 that states, \"sufficient land shall be made available to accommodate an appropriate range and mix of land uses to meet projected needs for a time horizon of at least 25 years.\" As noted above, without improving language and goals pertaining to density targets, it will be increasingly difficult for municipalities to plan accurately for beyond 25 years. This will likely lead to further settlement area expansion to accommodate the likelihood of urban sprawl, which will reduce investments in agricultural operations surrounding urban boundaries.\nRecommendation 5: The province should maintain the current requirement for planning authorities to plan for up to 25 years in order to minimize unnecessary and premature settlement area expansion.\nIn conclusion, the proposed changes to intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion weaken policies that would ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. The use of weaker language and the removal of requirements will lead to increased rates of settlement boundary expansion and further threaten farmland and the agricultural sector. It is essential that the policies are strengthened to ensure efficient land use and protect Ontario's agricultural operations and communities.\nSincerely,\nMartin Straathof, Executive Director\nOntario Farmland Trust\nReferences:\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"RE: Agricultural Lot Severances, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario's prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario's land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario's farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province's GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario's agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023, section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments.\nComments regarding section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nI am concerned about proposed s.4.3.3 which permits the severance of three residential lots from parcels in prime agricultural areas. This poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. As it currently reads, this policy could apply to any parcel of agricultural land, regardless of its size or whether it was previously severed before January 2023. Given that there are 48,346 farms4 and as many as 170,000 farmland properties in Ontario5, the province could see anywhere from 145,038 to 510,000 lots severed from agricultural properties. Therefore, if each lot is approximately 1-acre in size, this policy alone would be responsible for removing anywhere from 1.25% to 4.3% of Ontario's finite agricultural land base.\nThe use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays6. While I appreciate that proposed s.4.3.1 states \"Planning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach,\" this policy does not provide the strength needed to require agricultural systems, and appears to be in contradiction to the permissions of s.4.3.3. When you factor in s.4.3.2.5, which permits up to two additional dwellings in prime agricultural areas, this could result in as many as 1.5 million dwellings on newly severed lots in agricultural areas. This will lead to significant farmland fragmentation, which is contradictory to the purpose of an agricultural system, and will cause significant disruptions to surrounding agricultural operations.\nMoving to rural areas often means embracing the realities of agricultural living, such as noise, dust, odors, and farm equipment on the roads. Unfortunately, this leads to land-use compatibility conflicts that are difficult to mitigate once residential units are developed in agricultural areas. This poses significant challenges for farmers, especially when Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) is not properly followed during development approvals. This is concerning given that Bill 23 prevents third-party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal, making it difficult for nearby farmers to address MDS concerns. Additionally, constructing residential units up to the MDS line will limit any future growth of the agricultural operation, threatening the future viability of animal agriculture in Ontario.\nFurthermore, additional residential units on prime agricultural areas will result in an increase in water usage from underground aquifers. Three additional lots, including three additional residential units would put a significant strain on the water usage and increase the likelihood of water source issues for both the residents and the agricultural operation. Agriculture uses significant amounts of water to irrigate crops and provide water to livestock. Although a large percentage of water is returned to the source, often it has been changed and carrying soil and dissolved compounds7. With less water available in the aquifer, any contaminants will be more concentrated. Therefore, permitting three lot severances in prime agricultural areas will have significant implications for water availability and safety.\nBy permitting lot severances, the province will be impacting the financial accessibility of farmland for the next generation of farmers, making farming less financially viable. Each farm property will likely increase in price relative to the value of three vacant lots in the respective region. Ontario experienced a 19.4% increase in property values in 20228, making it unattainable or financially unfeasible for many young farmers to buy land. The proposed severance policies will incentivize developers, who can outbid young farmers, to purchase farmland or provide cash incentives for farmers to sever lots, contributing to the increase in farmland prices. This will result in the next generation experiencing a fragmented agricultural system and keeping ownership of farmland out of their reach. This is concerning because if the next generation of farmers cannot afford to farm, and experience it as increasingly difficult to farm, the province will not have a viable agricultural sector for much longer.\nI have noticed that the new proposed PPS 2023 states in policy 4.3.1.2, \"As part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\" However, permitting lot severances for residential use contradicts lands being designated for the long-term protection for agriculture.\nI believe that the proposed s. 4.3.2.5, which would allow two additional units on existing farm properties, could be significant in providing housing opportunities for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. Similarly, the proposed s. 2.2.1.b.2 allows more land for housing by converting existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use. Given these other proposed policies permitting additional housing and the significant concerns over the proposed lot creation policies, I question why there is a need to permit such a significant allowance for severances.\nFurthermore, permitting these severances is in contradiction to proposed s. 2.2.1.c, \"promoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation.\" S.4.3.3 will not promote efficiency in these areas and will detract from the intentions to support intensification.\nI believe that municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising between non-farming residents and the agricultural community. However, proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being more restrictive, which could be vital for preventing these types of conflicts. For rural communities whose economies and culture are intricately associated with agriculture, s.4.3.3.2 will prevent municipalities from protecting a key component of their communities and is contradictory to the content on page 3 that states the PPS 2023 recognizes the diversity of Ontario and that local context is important. S.4.3.3.2 restricts rural municipalities from ensuring the local context of their agricultural system is protected from farmland fragmentation.\nI, therefore, urge the province to consider these concerns and remove s.4.3.3 in its entirety so that the proposed changes do not harm the province's agricultural lands and the farmers who depend on them. The province should require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping and allow municipalities to implement additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and prevent conflicts with non-farming residents.\nThank you for considering our submission, and I look forward to the province's response.\nSincerely,\nTamara Brown\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\n(your name \/ organization name)\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

As our population swells every square inch of tillable, productive Agricultural land will be needed to simply feed our population. We may gain acres for housing the increasing population, but if there is not food to feed them, a roof overhead becomes meaningless.\nFurthermore, the lands set aside for Greenbelt protection should be deemed sacrosanct and not meddled with in any way lest in 25 or 50 years from now we are forced to live in a desert of our own making.  If any individual, corporation or other entity is found to have bought and sold land at a profit within 25 km of any public work such as the proposed Highway 413, said profits should be taxed away from the speculator by a land speculation tax and those funds used to defray the cost of the Public Work being undertaken.\n",

Policy 2.) would dramatically remove municipal power and render aspects of municipal Official Plans inoperative, terminating some local planning autonomy, and directly interfering with municipalities' ability to meet local variation and unique community needs;\nWhereas the proposed PPS changes that would allow proliferation of lots with protection restricted to specialty crop areas only diminishes the purpose, uses, and integrity of rural and agricultural lands, thereby removing protection and restricting future uses of those lands (Section 4.3);\nWhereas the proposed PPS changes encourage sprawl and rural roadway strip development, rather than more fiscally and environmentally sustainable practices like intensification in established settlement areas (Sections 2.5, 2.6, and 4.3);\nSo be it that the Council of the Municipality of Trent Hills urges the province to cancel proposed changes to the PPS with respect to; a) removal of municipal planning autonomy (sections 2.8.1 Policy 4 and Section 4.3.3 Policy 2) and b) rural and agricultural lands (sections 2.5, 2.6, and 4.3).\nSincerely,\nMayor Bob Crate\nThe Municipality of Trent Hills\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Detail from Municipal Staff Report to form basis of Council Comments:\nThe proposed PPS 2023 integrates the Provincial Policy Statement 2020 and A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Growth Plan) into a singular, province-wide policy document. The proposed PPS 2023 is intended to simplify existing policies and refocus on housing outcomes. The Province has been promoting the new document as an answer to the age-old complaint of municipalities that \"one size does not fit all\" and advertises the document provides for a flexible approach for municipalities to respond to individual market needs.\nWhile the proposed changes might promote streamlining and refocusing existing policies to achieve the province\u2019s housing mandate, it also presents further challenges to the municipalities' authority in establishing Official Plan policies to further protect urban sprawl and protect prime agriculture land from being removed from the production system. While there may be elements of flexibility added through the removal of clunky provincial policy that proved difficult to apply, the proposed PPS 2023 includes new policy that fully restricts a municipality's ability to deviate from very specific planning policies to find a \"size that fits better\" for Trent Hills.\nBased on the review of proposed changes, staff have the following comments to provide:\nMunicipal Planning Autonomy\nThe majority of changes within the proposed PPS 2023 may support Municipalities reach the provincial goal of 1.5 million houses by 2031, provided municipal power is preserved to determine Official Plan policies that work best for each individual municipality.\nPrevious policy statements allowed Municipalities to exceed protections and requirements, where it made sense and was locally appropriate. The proposed PPS 2023 removes this and goes a step further in explicitly stating a municipality shall not contain restrictive policies in their local documents.\nStaff would generally support most changes outlined, should municipal planning autonomy be restored within the document. A municipality should have a choice which locations of our municipality are best suited for additional housing, allowing more fiscally responsible and environmentally sustainable solutions that work locally. A locally focused approach would permit municipalities to meet local variation and unique community needs.\nStaff recommend the policies specifically removing municipal variation in local Official Plans and Zoning by-laws be removed from the proposed changes (Section 2.8.1 Policy 4 and Section 4.3.3 Policy 2).\nRural and Agricultural Residential Development\nDecades of evidence, research, and provincial policy has supported the clear planning principles that fiscally responsible and environmentally sustainable development best occurs through Settlement Area development on municipal infrastructure and services. This approach also supports the protection of rural and agricultural lands for viability within the agricultural system.\nThe proposed PPS 2023 permits up to three residential lots on an existing agricultural parcel as well as multi-lot residential development on rural lands. Policies like this have led to estate lots that are both expensive and permanently remove land from the commercial agriculture system. Additionally, the loss of farmland through this new policy will lead to unsustainable sprawl without solving the housing affordability crisis. Moreover, it will constrain the municipalities' authority in protecting agricultural lands that are crucial to food production and rural employment across Ontario.\nIt is worth noting that government-initiated review occurred in 2022 on approaches for leveraging the housing supportive policies to remove barriers for the creation of housing. Through the review, the government posted an overview of issues raised on the ERO broken into six themes (ERO #019-6177). With respect to natural resources, the Agricultural sector was quoted as, \"supportive of maintaining current agricultural policies\".\nThe Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) was a respondent, along with the National Farmers Union, the Ontario Farmland Trust, and the Beef Farmers of Ontario (not an exhaustive compilation of agencies request policies remain), among many land use planners from the many municipalities across the Province. All submissions echoed the request for policies on rural and agricultural lands to protect farmland and continue directing the majority of housing development to the Settlement Areas.\nIn reviewing the purpose for the inclusion of policy changes within the Rural and Agricultural lands, the ERO posting cites 'an appropriate housing supply' as the rationale for the change. In addition to the rationale provided above, staff do not feel additional housing within sensitive land use designations, beyond what the current provincial policy allows, can be considered an appropriate housing supply. The allowance of additional housing creates land use conflicts and sterilizes agriculturally viable lands from farming, due to new separation distances introduced.\nStaff do not support the changes to the Rural and Agricultural lands. Staff recommend the policy changes to the Rural Lands (Section 2.5 and 2.6) and Agriculture (Section 4.3) be removed and the current PPS 2020 policies be maintained.\n",

Farm land helps us with food security.  Green space helps cool against extreme heat.  Green spaces absorb excess water instead of flooding.  They capture carbon.  Green spaces provide necessary and essential biodiversity required for pollinators to survive.  They are key to growing food as well.  We cannot overlook that face that humans are one small piece of a much larger puzzle. All living things work together to provide the life we enjoy on Earth.  We can't pretend they are irrelevant to human living.\nWe need greater city density around existing transit and infrastructure.  This provides community, costs less and provides the residents with established opportunity and quality of life.  The great thing about cities is the access to everything, locally.\nCanada is known internationally for it's natural beauty and green space.  Why would we trade that in?  It's value never declines.  It is there for everyone.  No one wants to drive hours and hours to enjoy it.  Our green spaces are our legacy.  They define us as Canadians.  Once they are gone, they are not coming back.\nThere are decades of science that refute urban sprawl on every level.  Don't forsake our future.  There are far more benefits to density in existing cities while maintaining essential and necessary green space  for farmers and citizens.\n",

        "comment":"1.\tWhat are your thoughts on the policies that have been included from the PPS and A Place to Grow in the proposed policy document, including the proposed approach to implementation?\nIn general, incorporating policies from the Growth Plan opens up more opportunities for smaller urban and rural municipalities that are not located within the Greater Toronto Area. This includes the ability, should a municipality choose to define areas that are strategic growth areas or major transit station areas. The policies for these areas recognize the benefit of concentrating growth and compact form in specific areas of a municipality.\nOverall, when reading through the policies and thinking carefully about the problems \/ restrictions of the past as well as what the Province is trying to achieve, many of the proposed changes make sense.  While some may lament and dwell on the removal of local authority to be \"more restrictive\" than the overall PPS, others will welcome relief from what were previously seen as agents of rural stagnation.\nThe lessening of a number of restrictions is welcomed, most notably, providing greater flexibility to expand existing settlement areas and\/or define new ones.  It is clear that, within our Township, the free market has not responded in any significant way to the imposition of density policies.  Forcing us to direct development towards settlement areas while at the same time restricting the boundaries of those areas has not generated tangible results in a decade or more.  Clearly, a new approach is required and the proposed PPS does that.\nWith respect to implementation, the Township continues to work in a coordinated approach with the United Counties on Planning matters.\n2.\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policy direction for large and fast-growing municipalities and other municipalities?\nThe Township of Elizabethtown-Kitley is not identified as a large or fast-growing municipality. The opportunity to be able to adapt the requirements for large and fast-growing municipalities is appreciated. There are areas of the Township that would benefit from the policy directions provided for strategic growth areas. Although the Township does not have a transit system that would fit the definition of a major transit station areas, the planning statement leaves it open for municipalities not identified as large and fast growing to adopt the policy principles within the statement.\n3.\tWhat are your thoughts regarding the proposed policies to generate housing supply, including an appropriate range and mix of housing options?\nThe proposed changes to the policy statement requires that municipalities provide a range of housing options. As defined in the Planning Statement, the housing options relates the different typologies of dwelling units (single detached, semi-detach, multi-generational housing, low-rise apartments etc.).\nThe new Planning Statement removes the language from the 2020 Provincial Policy Statement as it relates to affordable housing and housing for low- and moderate-income families. Removing policy language around requirements for affordable housing is concerning. How will this impact the ability of municipalities to require affordable housing as part of a residential development project?\nPolicy language is softened in the Planning Statement regarding the requirement to plan for residential infill and intensification, including removing the requirement for municipalities to establish minimum density targets. The policy changes being brought in through the Planning Statement lend themselves to the creation of more urban sprawl. The lack of density requirements and removal of policies related to residential infill and intensification may lead to the creation of one typology of housing options, being largely single-detached dwellings. It is unclear how these policy changes will support achieving complete communities, which requires density to be successful.\nIt needs to be better understood on the expectations for collaboration with Housing Service Managers on ensuring a range of housing options. Will the Housing Service Managers establish specific targets through County Official Plans that local municipalities need to achieve?\n4.\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policies regarding the conservation of agriculture, aggregates, natural and cultural heritage resources?\nIn the new PPS, the requirement has been removed for a proponent of sensitive land use to demonstrate need, etc., when it is not possible to avoid contaminants.  This raises the question of what happens the other way around \u2013 i.e., when the after-the-fact proponent is the \"polluter\", not the sensitive use?  What tests \/ policies \u2013 if any \u2013 apply in those cases?\nThe proposed changes to the agricultural and rural land policies opens up more opportunities for lot creation and development, which often conflict with the conservation of agriculture, aggregates, natural and cultural heritage resources.\nThe agricultural policy change will allow up to three residential lots to be created from a property that is actively farmed. This opens up a large potential of new residential severances. This further introduces more non-compatible land uses into the agricultural area, and further reduces the capacity for the establishment and expansion of livestock facilities. This policy change is concerning, and although the Township understands the desire for families of multi-generational farms to be able to create additional lots for the next generation, when this policy is combined with the PPS's overall direction that local policies cannot be more restrictive, this overall direction seems problematic \u2013 and counterproductive to the overall goal of preserving prime agricultural lands for future use.  This is an area where local governments should be able to be more restrictive than the PPS (e.g, prescribing maximum lot sizes, etc.), responding to prevailing local needs and attitudes.\nThe remove of compatibility with the rural landscape may have a negative impact with allowing for incompatible development to be located in rural areas. The policy changes will no longer require development to be concentrated within rural settlement areas, opening up more opportunities for commercial and industrial uses to be located throughout the rural area.\nAlthough the elimination of the requirement to use the provincially mapped Agricultural System may be seen, at first, as downloading a new responsibility to municipalities, the Township ultimately see this as a positive change.  Our current OP contains language which makes use of \"broad stroke\" mapping (think: protected woodlands, etc.) and a corresponding disclaimer that it may not be accurate \u2013 and that field verification will be required.  This can create very restrictive presumptive circumstances, based on inaccurate data, which can then only be overcome by a proponent consuming considerable resources (time and $) to correcting the errors.\nThe Township is concerned about, what appears to be a contradiction in the policies to protect speciality crop areas.  The weakening of the threshold to \"should consider\" seems to be inconsistent with a policy to protect prime agricultural areas for long term use and mandatory compliance with MDS.  Some clarity is needed.\nFurther clarification is required on the intent of multi-lot development. Is it the expectation that municipalities will now be required to permit rural estate subdivisions again?\nAdditional considerations for the Agricultural policy changes includes:\n\u2022\tResidential lot creation in the agricultural area should be scaled based on the size of the property. For example, a 10-acre parcel under agricultural production could not reasonably support three new residential lots and have enough land leftover to cultivate.\n\u2022\tEnsure Minimum Distance Separation is still adhered to.\n\u2022\tRequire that new lots being created do not take good farmland out of production. For example, there are parts of properties that cannot be cultivated (e.g. bedrock at the surface). These areas should be considered first for a new residential lot.\n\u2022\tThe residential lot creation could create opportunities for farm families to create housing for their family members.\n\u2022\tClarity on appropriate development in the rural area and agricultural area should be expanded on to limit sprawl.\n5.\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policies regarding planning for employment?\nEmployment uses are being more well defined to ensure that adequate lands are being set aside for uses that require greater separation from sensitive land uses. This may restrict municipalities who have used these lands for larger format commercial areas.\nFurther guidance should be provided to protect employment areas from being converted to non-employment uses. Additional direction should also be given to how employment areas can expand.\nIt is appreciated that the Province is detailing the ability to locate smaller scale industrial, or warehousing uses where they do not have an adverse impact into strategic growth areas and in proximity to residential uses. This helps achieve the policy goal of having complete communities.\nRestricting the uses within Employment Areas will create non-conforming uses. Municipalities will need to review their current employment lands and decide as to whether the lands should be converted to another designation where the predominant use is commercial or maintain the uses as a non-conforming use.\n6.\tAre there any other barriers to, or opportunities for, accelerating development and construction (e.g., federal regulations, infrastructure planning and approvals, private\/public partnerships for servicing, provincial permitting, urban design guidelines, technical standards, zoning, etc.)?\nProvincial permitting for Environmental Compliance Approvals for Stormwater and the review of documentation to receive a Record of Site Condition should be expedited to reduce the delay in the development process.\nAllow municipalities ample time to catch up with the policy and legislative changes that are being made.\nEnsure that municipalities are properly funded to support the creation of more housing units. This includes efforts to train and recruit more building officials.\nIt is important that settlement expansions be either initiated or approved by a municipality, and that a municipal decision to not support a privately initiated application to expand a settlement not be subject to appeal (to the OLT), as has been the approach under the current Planning Act.  The alternative would lead to more speculation and uncoordinated\/inefficient settlement expansions, due to possible pressure from development proponents to expand settlements and infrastructure in multiple directions. This continuous pressure would distract municipalities from completing the necessary growth and infrastructure planning that is important to sustainably accommodate growth and build great communities.\nThe Province needs to provide through the Bulletin identified in Bill 23 what the Affordable Housing Rates are for rental and homeownership. This is creating a barrier to ensuring that affordable housing units are being created in new developments.\n",

These changes will accelerate urban sprawl and contribute to the ongoing loss of farmland and natural areas in Ontario.\nA shortage of land is not the cause of Ontario\u2019s housing shortage, as noted by the Housing Affordability Task Force in 2022:\n\"Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (p. 10)\"\nIt is time to listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets.\nThere is no need for these proposed policy revisions. Such changes would:\n- eliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to reduce urban sprawl;\n- allow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of infrastructure needs or potential negative impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n- force municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n- exempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n- remove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and\n- weaken and eliminate policies intended to address climate change.\nOntario is losing farmland at an alarming rate. This is absolutely unacceptable! The proposed policies will make matters much worse and be highly detrimental to the land (and water) required to sustain our citizens.\nIncreasing development and urban sprawl will not solve current housing needs. Accordingly, I urge you to retain all PPS and Growth Plan policies that are designed to mitigate urban sprawl and protect farmland and natural areas in the Province of Ontario.\n",

What the pandemic has taught us or should have taught us is that food security and supply line security are critical concerns. Housing at the expense of farmland is dangerous.  Historically villages, towns and cities were built where it was also possible to farm.  Just because that is where our houses, towns and cities initially sprung up should not dictate that we continue to build on or adjacent to farmland.

'A clean and healthy environment' and mitigation and adaptation to climate change depends heavily on natural heritage and farmland, and we already have destroyed a great deal of it.  We need to protect what is left so that current and future Ontarians will have a 'clean and healthy environment'.\n\u2022\tComment: Several studies have shown that there is already more than enough land available to accommodate housing for population growth expected to 2050 and beyond.  New housing needs to be concentrated in already built up areas to create walkable, liveable communities, so people can live near where they work and shop and don't have to commute.  The empty office space in downtown Toronto should be included in the  potential housing supply and people encouraged to work from home so they don't have to commute.  No need to 2. 'Make land available for development'.  It already is.\n\u2022\tComment: The current PPS and 'A Place to Grow' plans need to be tweaked to help '1. Generate an appropriate housing supply.'  The focus needs to be on 'establishing (increased) minimum density targets' for built up areas, especially near public transit'.  There needs to be a focus on higher 'intensification targets', and higher minima set for 'affordable housing units'.\n\u2022\tComment:  Ontarians, including farmers have clearly said they don't want 'more residential development in rural settlements and multi-lot residential development on rural lands, including more servicing flexibility (e.g., leveraging capacity in the private sector servicing ' or 'more housing on farms, including residential lot creation subject to criteria, additional residential units and housing for farm workers'.  Our farmland is precious, especially if we are expected to feed a growing population.\n\u2022\tComment: Funding: a great number of the proposed policies would 'require municipalities to....'. If the provincial government plans to require all these things of municipalities, it should provide them with funding as needed to do all these things, including the need to hire on staff who are knowledgeable about natural heritage, 'watershed planning' and 'hazard lands' so that they can knowledgeably direct development away from valuable wetlands, woodlands, valley lands, grasslands and other forms of crucial natural infrastructure that human and other life depends upon.  Since this critical function has been removed from Conservation Authorities, Ontarians are at the mercy of developers who are happy to destroy all our remaining natural heritage in order to profit from the sale of a few over-sized houses.\n\u2022\tComment: policy needs to require all new housing to be built on already existing infrastructure to save resources and labour.  This is the most efficient way to add to our housing supply.  And these houses need to be smaller and more affordable, and multiple unit, affordable housing needs to be a priority.  These are the most efficient ways to add to the housing supply that Ontario needs.\n\u2022\tComment: the most efficient and cost-effective way 'to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate and develop approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions' is to protect natural heritage\/infrastructure such as wetlands, woodlands, valleylands, grasslands.  These are the features that contain huge amounts of carbon and the potential to soak up so much more as the years pass.  Destroying a wetland releases tonnes of GHG into the atmosphere and removes the future potential for absorption.  These features are crucial to our future climate change mitigation strategies.\n\u2022\tComment: one of the best ways to preserve 'a healthy environment' for Ontarians is to preserve farmland.  So requiring municipalities to 'to designate specialty crop areas and prime agricultural areas, and to protect specialty crop areas and maintain minimum separation distances between livestock operations and houses, and promote an agricultural systems approach to support the agri-food network' is excellent.  But the provincial government should also retain these same policies at the provincial level and protect good farmland like the Duffins Rouge Agricultural Preserve so that our farmland is protected and future Ontarians will have local sources of food as climate change brings about reductions in food supply from geographies threatened by climate change such as California, Florida, and other big sources of our current supply.\n\u2022\tComment: Conclusion: Policy that truly protects farmland and natural heritage lands is what is really needed in Ontario, along with restoration of Conservation Authorities with strengthened powers to accomplish this work.  Natural heritage lands and farmland are what support our healthy lifestyles, along with the biodiversity of life that they support.  Without these crucial resources, human life in Ontario will not be healthy, prosperous or enjoyable.\n",

        "comment":"I really have to wonder why this government bothers to spend public money on having task forces such as the  Affordable Homes Task Force spend time and energy drawing up and making reports if the government ignores the findings and does as it pleases anyway. The task force clearly stated that there was room in the province to build 2,000,000 homes WITHOUT having to encroach on the Greenbelt or sprawl onto farmland. But this bill supports the idea of sprawl onto farmland by:\n*fragmenting and permanently removing irreplaceable farmland,\n*lining rural concession roads with non-farmer residential housing,\n*overwhelming municipal\/regional service providers, and inflating farmland prices for the benefit of speculators and developers and to the detriment of future farmers\n*disrupting agricultural operations\nIf we learned nothing else from the Covid crisis it was that local food supplies were critical to our survival. There is no point in building homes if people are unable to afford them and unable to purchase wholesome affordable food. We are already losing farmland at an unsustainable rate. This needs to STOP, NOW!\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\nLaura\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

The amount of newly created lots and additional accessory units on subdivide lots as a cumulative total as proposed is a concern. This potential scenario of clustered residential uses creates concern in regards to established livestock facilities and their ability to expand.\n3.5 Land Use Compatibility\nI disagree that sensitive areas (residential areas) should encroach at all on industrial areas.\n4.3.5 Non-Agricultural Uses in Prime Agricultural Areas\nThe Draft policy 4.3.5.2 requiring an agricultural impact assessment should be mandatory regardless of the circumstances.\n4.5.2 Protection of Long-Term Resource Supply\n\u201cDemonstration of need for mineral aggregate resources, including any type of supply\/demand analysis, shall not be required, notwithstanding the availability, designation or licensing for extraction of mineral aggregate resources locally or elsewhere.\u201d\nThis statement should not be included until such time that the Province completes a comprehensive study of supply of aggregate in order to determine how much aggregate is currently licensed and therefore subsequently required.\nThe minor changes to the existing term \u201cagricultural condition\u201d raise a concern about what the added term \u201cenhanced\u201d means as it relates to the rehabilitation of agricultural soil. The direction of \u201cmaintained\u201d or \u201crestored\u201d seem to indicate that the pre-extraction soil conditions will be brought back once rehabilitated, but \u201cenhanced\u201d is an added term which could have a much broader meaning. Clarification on the meaning of this term is necessary.\n2.8.2 Employment Areas\nEmployment areas should include commercial and institutional in order to support the concept of complete communities and areas that support the community\u2019s local employment and economic development.\nThe Government must give municipalities sufficient time to understand and implement the final Provincial Planning Statement before introducing more planning policy and regulatory changes.

Responsible land-use planning is critical to balancing the needs of our growing communities and to ensure that our agriculture and agri-food sector survives and thrives. Among the proposed changes is an overhaul to residential development in rural areas, which would give municipalities the ability to split large farms into smaller lots to make it easier to build homes.\n",

        "comment":"Agricultural Lot Severances\nResidential lot creation in prime agricultural areas has been discouraged since the Countryside Planning\/Foodland Guidelines were issued by the Province of Ontario in the 1970s. The purpose of this provincial-wide planning document was to ensure the protection of prime agricultural land for food production.\nThe Counties of Prescott and Russell is a prime agricultural area and agriculture is extremely important to the economy and the production of food. For the past 23 years, the county has had strong Official Plan policies protecting this agricultural resource and directing non-agricultural related development to settlement areas. The Province\u2019s proposal to allow for scattered residential development through lot creation does not further the interests of the agricultural industry.\nThe opening up of scattered residential lot creation in the prime agricultural areas may\n\u2022\tincrease conflict with modern farming practices,\n\u2022\tincrease MDS restrictions on the placement of new barns;\n\u2022\treduce the number of units being built in settlement areas where municipalities have invested substantial funds on services (hard and soft),\n\u2022\tlost opportunities for infrastructure efficiency in settlement areas;\n\u2022\tand increase the demand on municipalities to provide enhanced rural services e.g., more frequent snow plowing, road maintenance, garbage collection, emergency services, etc.\nIt is requested that the Province provide clarification on the criteria in the policies for creating new residential lots e.g., what is considered to be adjacent to a non-agricultural use and what are lower-priority agricultural lands. It is unclear if this is limited to adjacent to Settlement Areas, Recreational uses and Institutional uses, or does it open it up for 3 new residential lots next to all existing residences including farm residences and those that have been severed as surplus. And further, does this also allow residential lot creation on any area that a farm considers lower priority or inconvenient to farm rather than just areas with lower capability soils.\nIf the Province\u2019s intention is to permit 3 residential lots from every farm parcel, this has the potential to result in thousands of non-farm-related lots in the agricultural area across the County. The Province should reconsider this substantial policy direction change and the long-term effects it will have on the protection of prime agricultural lands and maintaining the ability for farmers to farm. In addition, there may be other unintended consequences such as the effect of additional residences on the potential for future aggregate extraction.\nSettlement Area Expansion\nThe UCPR is supportive of the change to streamline the process for expanding settlement areas where required based on adequate servicing (provided priority is given to expansion in fully serviced areas), logical extensions and addressing agricultural impacts. This is a more efficient use of land than scattered residential lots in the prime agricultural areas. The Province only encourages municipalities to set density targets for these expanded areas, but should give consideration to stronger language to ensure efficient use of these additional development lands.\n",

(CLS) wishes to submit this letter in response to Province\u2019s new draft Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) document. These comments are in respect to lands located within the block of Twenty Road West, Upper James Street, Dickenson Road and Glancaster Road, in the City of Hamilton (Subject Lands). It is understood that the Province is reviewing and amending policies to replace the existing Provincial Policy Statement, and a Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe. On the UWSLG behalf, CLS has conducted a review of the proposed Provincial Planning Statement, and offer the following over-arching comments for the Province\u2019s consideration:\n1.\tThe Province should consider maintaining provincially established density and intensification\n         targets (despite MCR removal);\n2.\tThe Province should remove Provincially Significant Employment Zones (PSEZ) overlay (as\n         proposed);\n3.\tThe Province should allow first-party appeal rights on Employment Area conversions, subject to\n         the satisfaction of \u2018tests\u2019 outlined in proposed policy 2.8.2.4.\n4.\tThe Province should incorporate additional policy on clarifying \u201ctransition\u201d within employment\n        areas. Policies establishing metrics to identify areas of transition, adjacent to employment areas,\n        may open up areas for additional housing and which do not detract from the operation of the\n        employment area.\n5.\tThe Province should build upon existing noise and airport policies to require Official Plans\n        compliance as well as the requirement for scheduled improvements to noise related\n        mapping\/policies; and,\n6.\tThe Province should incorporate language explicitly permitting privately initiated Secondary Plan.\nIn support of the above, the following provides further clarification to the above recommendations:\n1.\tMunicipal Comprehensive Review: The in-effect Growth Plan requires municipalities conduct Municipal Comprehensive Reviews (MCRs) to implement population and employment forecasts, undertake integrated planning, and establish minimum intensification and density targets (amongst other requirements). Under the proposed PPS policies, municipalities will no longer be required to conduct municipal comprehensive review\u2019s but rather continue to apply 2051 targets at a minimum and carry out individual forecasting on an as needed basis. While this is intended to provide municipalities more independence in land use planning as well as alleviate delays associated with the administration of land use policies (i.e. appeals). The sudden departure from this style of planning, may inadvertently challenge the ability to achieve provincial targets as well as result in other unintended consequences. Instead, the Province may which to maintain some level of reporting timelines to ensure achievement of provincial interests.\nIn addition, with the removal of MCRs, applications for new settlement areas should have the ability to appeal or include policies in the PPS permitting first party appeal rights.\n2.\tProvincially Significant Employment Areas: The Province is proposing to remove policies pertaining to Provincially Significant Employment Zones (PSEZs), as put forth in 2019 under the Growth Plan. The UWSLG is supportive of the removal of the classification of PSEZs, as the added layer of planning policy contributes little to the protection of areas of employment as well as prohibits the ability to achieve a complete community in proximity to places of employment.\n3.\tEmployment Areas \u2013 Appeal Right: Considerable changes are proposed to employment policies including the implementation of a new definition of \u2018employment areas\u2019, which is to be updated both within the Planning Act and within the New PPS. The definition emphasizes how employment areas are perceived in terms of compatibility, economic value and the importance of maintaining heavy industry, manufacturing and large scale warehousing. Within the proposed policy of \u2018employment areas\u2019, conversions are no longer required, but rather municipalities can remove employment lands if there is a need for the removal, the removal does not negatively impact the viability of the employment area, existing or planned infrastructure are available (Section 2.8.2.4). This is a positive direction that is supported by the UWSLG. With having said this, it is recommended that employment conversion application requests should have the ability to be appealable.\nDespite the removal of the PSEZs and refinement of \u2018Employment Area\u2019, Section 22 (7.3) of the Planning Act continues to prohibit appeals to employment area removals. It is recommended that policy be incorporated within the Planning Act to broaden appeal rights on employment area removals. It is proposed that policy be crafted which allows select first-party appeals if certain tests, such as the achievement of draft PPS Sec. 2.8, have been demonstrated. This would ensure the protection of employment lands while still allowing the broadening of the uses in an appropriate fashion.\n4.\tEmployment Areas \u2013 Transitional Uses: Within the proposed PPS policies on Employment Areas, transitional policies (Section 2.8.1.3 and Section 2.8.2.2) have been introduced. However, the intent of these policies would benefit from further delineation. Improvements could occur by way of an explicit definition or metrics outlining the specific locations of \u201ctransition areas\u201d. Defining this and outlining the key differences and planning objectives for these distinct areas (as opposed to Employment Areas) would be helpful in clarifying locations for non-employment uses and broadening locations to potentially achieve housing. The benefits would be particularly useful for employment areas that are evolving in land use (i.e., manufacturing to office), those which are in proximity to existing, stable residential areas or could facilitate the creation of land use buffers between sensitive land uses and employment areas.\n5.\tNoise: Under current PPS policy new infill residential development and other sensitive land uses are permitted up to the 30 NEF. Further, the PPS advises that redevelopment or infilling of residential land uses and other sensitive land uses may occur in areas above NEF 30 but must demonstrate that there will be no negative impacts on the long-term function of the airport. In addition, and as stated, \u201cTransport Canada recommends that where the NEF exceeds 30, new residential development should not proceed. If it does, regardless of this caution, a detailed noise analysis should be conducted and noise reduction practices should be implemented\u201d (Ministry of Transportation).\nAlthough these policies are not proposed to change, it is recommended that the language of the overall policy be strengthened through explicit direction that municipalities \u201cmust\u201d be in compliance. Further, to ensure the capturing of the most current forecasting, municipalities should be directed to adopt the latest NEF forecasts (as available) and adopt minimum timeline windows to ensure regular and consistent updates. It is believed that these recommendations protect both the operation and viability of the airport as well as broaden the ability to deliver housing.\nTo support the above rationale and other policies within documentation provided by Transport Canada , the following policy update is suggested below:\nSection 3.4 Airports, Rail and Marine Facilities\n2. Airports shall be protected from incompatible land uses and development by:\na) Regulating new residential development and other sensitive land uses in areas near airports above\n    30 NEF\/NEP;\nb) considering redevelopment of existing residential uses and other sensitive land uses or infilling of\n     residential and other sensitive land uses in areas above 30 NEF\/NEP only if it has been\n     demonstrated that there will be no negative impacts on the long-term function of the airport;\nc) discouraging land uses which may cause a potential aviation safety hazard; and,\nd) that where the NEF exceeds 30, new residential may be considered if the responsible authority is\n     satisfied that:\ni) appropriate acoustic insultation features have been considered in the building and,\nii) a noise impact assessment study has been completed and shows that this construction or development is not incompatible with aircraft noise,\niii) notwithstanding point ii), the developer will be required to inform all prospective tenants or purchasers of residential units that speech interference and annoyance caused by aircraft noise are, on average, established and growing at NEF 30 and are very significant by NEF 35.\n6.\tPrivately Initiated Secondary Plans: Absent from the proposed policies are direction on the administration of secondary planning. Although this is a process that is best resolved at the local level, municipalities vary in the method of secondary planning. While some seek to manage the process internally, others allow for involvement and direct participation by the private sector. It is recommended that the proposed PPS be updated to acknowledge the importance of secondary planning as well as establish that secondary plans can be advanced by private landowners, subject to the participation of the municipalities and achievement of certain process requirements (public consultation). It is believed that privately initiated secondary planning could assist the Province in achieving provincial interests in an accelerated manner, by speeding up the administration of the process. In addition, inserting policy that dictates which types of areas can better support a privately initiated Secondary Plan such as guiding categories like infill development, areas adjacent to existing built areas that are already serviced, and brownfield etc. This allows for the municipality to better allocate which areas to focus on growth and the resources that need to be allocated appropriately.\nCONCLUSION\nThis submission is intended to provide further information to the Ministry in consideration of the new proposed PPS planning document. It is the hope of the UWSLG that the above comments will assist in the Province\u2019s changes and implementation to the new PPS planning document. Should there be any questions or a need for further information, feel free to reach out to the below.\nSincerely,\nJohn Corbett\n__________________________________\nJohn B.

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely, H.Clark\n",

Affordability is needed with both housing and transportation. You can't have one without the other. This can be accomplished by creating well-designed neighbourhoods where people don't need cars. Building more houses in rural areas is the exact opposite of where we need to be going. People are barely scraping by, and to build houses that are not within walking distance of basic necessities is totally wasteful and unaffordable.\nIt is also wasteful to destroy some of the best farmland we have. If you are increasing the population, obviously you are going to need more food, but there are limits to production increases. Putting urban people in rural areas where they are not used to the unpleasant smells associated with food production will only lead to complaints from both sides.\n",

That's a conservative estimate.\nThat loss will make our communities even more dependent on non-local food sources in a time when climate change is creating droughts and fires. Building on green belt lands will also damage watersheds, and ecosytems, creating further climate damage.\nIn order for the survival and prosperity of future generations, sprawling suburbs can no longer be the norm.

Just admit it. We know that this plan can\u2019t work as written - it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nRespect the democratic decisions of municipalities that have said they don\u2019t want to expand their urban boundaries.

Stop paving wetlands and green spaces we need to prevent flooding and protect the ecology in Ontario.\nThis plan and all of Ontario\u2019s current housing and development plans are criminally negligent and obviously ineffective in what they say they aim to do. This government ought to be ashamed, both for lying directly to our faces continually and without shame, as well as for how blatantly self-serving these policies are.\nI guess that\u2019s my last comment: I humbly request that every member of the majority conservative party in Ontario be ordered to at least attempt to understand their hypocrisy and moral failing with this plan and their governance in general.

We run a small 150 acre farm in which margins are very tight. In spite of these tight margins, we were able to tile 95 acres of land, which is now in organic production, only because we were able to sever and sell a surplus dwelling from the property. Without the ability to leverage our property to reinvest into the farm infrastructure, we would not now be producing over 90 acres of organic food. Farmers need to be able to make the decision to do what\u2019s best for their farming operation. For too long, we have been at the mercy of municipalities and (what can be) arbitrary rules, which have impeded small farmers and concentrated more land in the hands of larger corporate farmers.\nI could offer more input about my experience and why I think that allowing farmers some leeway to build housing and sever small amounts of land can have the effect of making farm operations more viable and productive, but hopefully this suffices to offer a brief counterpoint. We need to protect our farmland, but sometimes protecting a resource requires decisions to make an operation viable.\n",

As a country dweller myself, I am now being faced with an out-of-county farmer who has purchased 95 acres of prime agricultural land adjacent to me, tile drained the majority of it two years ago but has decided it is more lucrative to turn it into a < 60 home subdivision. This individual is requesting rezoning of the land and expansion of the town (hamlet\u2019s) limits to include this entire property and the county is already stressing \u201cFord\u2019s policy\u201d to support it.

They represent us because it\u2019s mandatory to pay their dues to get a Farm Registration number. All 3 groups in total have less than 100 employees many do not own a farm. We are 46,000 farmers and no one sent out a survey to what we thought about lot severance. How do you think all these homes scattered around farms came about in the 70-80\u2019s. They came from farms. If the few farmers that oppose this are worried about smell and odour then don\u2019t severe. But I can tell you many want to severe for their family member or themselves when they retire and pass the farm down. I see a renewed sense of happiness among all my farming friends that are now encouraged that their family can live next to them or the generational farmers in my farm group that are struggling and actually selling off 2 lots will give them money to survive. The farming groups scream  and rant but never think about what is best for us. Not every 46,000 farmers are going to severe off lots. It is 38,000$ for city fees alone to ask for a lot severence and that doesn\u2019t include studies . By the time one is finished it will be 100,00$ in fees and that doesn\u2019t include a well or septic or cistern or electrical hookup. These farm groups are dreaming!!! But if you allow it and a farmer follows through then you will actually be helping the family that actually votes PC each and every time\u2026 remember this is private property and not a public asset and compare the farm groups to the teachers union\u2026 they do not always represent the teachers!!!\nWhich  groups were the ones that promoted that wind turbines should go on farms and look what the ramifications were from that move!!! And any farm that has or had a wind turbine on it took up way more than an acre of the farm. And no one thought about the neighbours living around those horrible wind turbines and the health implications they had on livestock and human health.\nThis opposition is a political left movement supported by Environmental groups that want Ontario to remain the same with no growth, no immigration and this is totally unrealistic and unreasonable. No one wants to discuss the full scope of why farmland is being lost and it is not entirely from development, it is also from environmental regulations.\nMinimum , you the government needs to promote ARUs, OFDUs and at least a lot severence even if it is  only 1. Someone has to speak up for private property rights in this province as well for the little guy who works out in the fields or in the barn.\n",

People don't just need a place to live, they also need food to eat. There is limited farmland in Ontario. Once it is gone, it is gone forever and shifts the balance of food produced locally. Food will now have to be trucked in from distant places. Did we learn nothing about supply chain disruptions during covid? Look at Europe and the problems smaller countries have with food production because housing has taken over agricultural uses. This is what southern Ontario will look like in 25 years if you allow farms to be paved over. Intensify urban development instead. Build more mutli-plexes and low rise multiple unit buildings instead of honking great big single family homes that sprawl out and require multiple cars per family. Higher urban density is smart as it is amenable to greater public transportation and vibrant communities where people can walk to services.\nForget making your developer buddies richer and instant millionaires out of speculative farmland owners - the majority of Ontario society will be robbed in this scenario of allowing oligarchs to steal Ontario assets for themselves.\n",

Highly educated workers with good paying jobs can't afford houses. Many houses are left empty or used solely for short-term vacation rentals. Why aren't we doing more to find better uses of these homes? Corporate profit and international investment should NEVER be higher priority than Canadians owning homes on their own territory. It's understandable that more housing is needed for a growing population, but Canadians feel like we aren't being set up for success and our government is failing us.

I grew up in the middle ring of a major UK city, moved to Canada and lived in midtown Toronto for 15 years, before moving to a small town in rural Ontario where I have lived for 25 years.\nFarmers are right in pointing out the issues of infrastructure (well systems, sewage, heating systems\/cooling systems, internet availability, road access--especially in the winter and spring) and transportation (even rural towns often have no public transit), along with issues of environmental difference where you have animal and\/or crop farming, such as widespread smell from manure spreading, dust from harvesting, burn off of residual in fields. There are also issues of social infrastructure such as provision of schooling, shops, entertainment (even basic things such as cinema or a public pool or park) which urbanites anticipate to be available.\nNor do they understand that the nature of work and entrepreneurship are quite different. You no longer have the same traffic factor that can apply to marketing concepts you might use in thinking about opening a small business in an urban setting.\nFrom experience, I know how little understanding urbanites have of a rural environment and how fast dissatisfaction sets in.

I would, however, expect development to be permitted on farms already impacted by prior practices; things like quarrying for aggregates, or landfill that is not a garbage (methane-producing) dump. Farms that were historically or recently allowed to be compromised in such ways are never likely to again be Grade 1 farmland anyway, and likely to never be consolidated with larger farm holdings because they require much higher inputs to succesfully grow any crops. These farms may be increasingly uneconomic and there should be tolerable potential to develop them for uses other than agriculture. All still with environmental impact studies and other necessary caveats to ensure it is the right development in the right way, in the right place, at the right time. All that said, the Normal Farm Practices Board will need a significant boost to handle the inevitable complaints and issues as more people move into what is, still, an industrial area - that's what farming is, industry. The current process, with three years typical for a NFPB hearing to be completed, is untenable. If houses are permitted on low-grade farms and farmland they should not also be able to have extra dwelings (basement suites) or tiny homes as of right; this quickly will exceed the carrying capacity of well- and sewer- capacities amongst other service-related difficiencies. Rural living is already difficult - there are no trades (because there is so much work to be done in the cities), schools continue to be threatened with closure, shops struggle to compete with big box stores, doctors have closed patient lists, and off-farm work is essential for most farmers to get by. When you deplete even the successful farms, you make all of these issues that much worse; where are the trades that will maintain those homes? Who will deal with hoarding and \"scrap yard\" appearances, and livestock losses to loose dogs, or trespass mowing of hay \"because it looks weedy\", as we already see in our neighbourhood? People moved to the rural areas because they fell out with urban neighbours, and they bring their selfish attitudes with them; they think our farmland is their playground, and theirs for the taking. If you allow more development then please make sure to educate people about rural living and behaviours so the first time a new neighbour shows up at the door it isn't to complain about an overhanging tree, long grass in hay fields, or that their dog should be able to run free over the fields all day and chase animals in paddocks.

        "comment":"The Municipality of South Huron has the following comments with respect to:\n1.  Agricultural Lot Severances:\nResidential lot creation in prime agricultural areas has been discouraged since the Countryside Planning\/Foodland Guidelines were issued by the Province of Ontario in the 1970s. The purpose of this provincial-wide planning document was to ensure the protection of prime agricultural land for food production.\nSouth Huron is a prime agricultural area and agriculture is extremely important to the economy and the production of food. For over 40 years, South Huron and its former municipalities have had strong Official Plan policies protecting this agricultural resource and directing non-agricultural related development to settlement areas. Staff and Council recognize the need for housing in the agricultural area and have allowed for on-farm housing for farm labour. The Province\u2019s proposal to allow for scattered residential development through lot creation does not further the interests of the agricultural industry.\nThe opening up of scattered residential lot creation in our prime agricultural area may:\n\u2022 increase conflict with modern farming practices,\n\u2022 increase MDS restrictions on the placement of new barns;\n\u2022 reduce the number of units being built in settlement areas where municipalities have invested substantial funds on services (hard and soft),\n\u2022 result in lost opportunities for infrastructure efficiency in settlement areas;\n\u2022 increase the demand on municipalities to provide enhanced rural services (e.g. more frequent snow plowing, road maintenance, garbage collection, emergency services, etc.); and\n\u2022 ring serviced settlement areas with unserviced residential development making it more difficult and costly for future settlement area expansions and extension of services.\nIt is requested the Province provide clarification on the criteria in the policies for creating new residential lots; for example: what is considered to be adjacent to a non-agricultural use and what are lower-priority agricultural lands. It is unclear if this is limited to adjacent to Settlement Areas, Recreational uses and Institutional uses, or does it open it up for new residential lots next to all existing residences including farm residences and those that have been severed as surplus. And further, does this also allow residential lot creation on any area that a farm considers lower priority or inconvenient to farm rather than just areas with lower capability soils. Clarification is also requested on the criteria that requires an existing access on a public road and whether that access must exist or can it be obtained as part of the severance process. This clarification would help to determine the number of new residential lots that could be eligible to be severed in South Huron (and across Huron County) and the effect of the policy on the agricultural industry.\nIf the Province\u2019s intention is to permit 3 residential lots from every farm parcel, this has the potential to result in thousands of non-farm related lots in the agricultural area across the County. The Province should reconsider this substantial policy direction change and the long term effects it will have on the protection of prime agricultural lands and on maintaining the ability for farmers to farm. In addition, there may be other unintended consequences such as the effect of additional residences on the potential for future aggregate extraction.\nUnderstanding that some agricultural land may be needed to address the demand for housing, the municipality is supportive of eliminating this requirement for expansions and directing development to settlement areas which is a more efficient use of agricultural land than scattered residential development throughout the countryside.  Rather than the creation of non-farm related residential lots to increase the potential for housing in the agricultural area, the Province could consider amending the policy for surplus farm residence severances that requires the retained farmlands to be rezoned to prohibit a residence. The current limitation on the retained land could be removed, allowing a residence on these farm parcels where the severance was completed a certain number of years ago \u2013 perhaps 10-15 years or longer to avoid speculation. This would allow for additional housing related to agriculture and would not result in additional severances.\n2. Settlement Area Expansions:\nThe municipality is supportive of the change to streamline the process for expanding settlement areas where required based on adequate servicing (provided priority is given to expansion in fully serviced areas), logical extensions and addressing agricultural impacts. This is a more efficient use of land than scattered residential lots in the prime agricultural area. The Province only encourages municipalities to set density targets for these expanded areas, but should give consideration to stronger language to ensure efficient use of these additional development lands.\n3. Employment Areas and Employment Land Conversions\nNo concerns with this proposed change as the South Huron Official Plan already limits employment areas to Industrial designations and does not include Commercial or Community Facility designated lands as employment areas.\n4. Growth Targets\nNo concerns.\n",

This scheme has already been tried and tested throughout the world. Dense urban centres are much more productive, desirable, and environmentally beneficial than suburban sprawl, all research and planning principles agree on this.\nThe only motivation for the business as usual case of building the largest homes possible is greed and a lack of imagination.

Our heritage committee is making excellent, initial progress on recommending historic and culturally valuable buildings and structures for listing and designation to our Council.\nWe have approximately 100 properties in mind to recommend for listing, and the two year time-frame for designation, and the additional waiting time should this not occur - puts many of our community's heritage assets in peril.  Introduction of this process and unrealistic time limits is short-sited from a conservation point of view, and puts many buildings and structures at risk of active demolition before thoughtful consideration of its heritage contribution to our communities.\nThe appetite for heritage conservation varies greatly from one township or municipality to another, and these arbitrary timelines - specifically imposing a years' long wait before a building can be listed again -  further complicates the delicate collaboration between municipal Heritage committees and Councils.\nThe greenest building is the one already standing. Buildings can be re-purposed while maintaining valuable heritage elements that provide a sense of place and connection for residents. Adjustment to the process and timelines will provide much needed planning time to strike that balance. Currently the process feels punitive and anti-conservation.

The Town of Arnprior as a lower tier municipality is limited by the boundaries of the municipality and does not have the option of expanding village boundaries in future if additional vacant commercial land is needed. There is already extreme pressure to convert mixed-use commercial employment lands to residential uses, however, previously these lands could be protected from conversion to ensure sufficient land was available for expected future commercial needs. The new definition of employment land would result in the loss of these lands to residential uses, despite a 2021 growth forecast which indicated a surplus of vacant residential land available for development with the Town and an identified need for these commercial lands in the 2021 growth forecast.\nThe expanded role of Ministers zoning orders is of concern in that it allows the Minister to issue orders and make regulations that were previously solely directed by municipalities. The Town of Arnprior is concerned as Planning decisions and policies at the local level are developed and implemented within the local context. Official Plans intend to incorporate provincial policies but also to reflect that local context and the vision communities have for their future growth. Further expanding the role of the Minister ignores this local context and the work that has gone into incorporating provincial policies while developing places that reflect community values.\nThe Town of Arnprior proposes that once passed there is a delay in implementation to allow municipalities sufficient time to propose and approve Official Plan amendments and zoning by-law amendments to reflect the policy changes approved.\n",

I think it's important for a core policy of this plan to be connecting communities indiscriminately with infastructure that accommodates everyone.\nEven in larger cities like St. Catherine's and Niagara Falls, it's very clear that the focus is catered almost entirely to car drivers. Additionally, unwalkable swathes of land that are designated solely as suburbia and disallow the construction of fully accomodated neighborhoods (Services, entertainment, commerce, grocery.) are continually resulting in antisocial and even violent behaviour.\nIf this plan is to focus on housing more Ontarians, it should house them in a way that will actually work for them and benefit them. It should prioritize establishing culturally rich and high density regions that encourage social and healthy behaviour.\n",

        "comment":"The City of Guelph appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the adaptation of the Provincial Policy Statement (\u201cPPS\u201d) and A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (\u201cthe Growth Plan\u201d) into a new proposed Provincial Planning Statement (\u201cPlanning Statement\u201d). As stated in the preface to the Planning Statement, the overall goal of this policy adaptation is to support the achievement of housing objectives across Ontario, primarily to build more homes faster.\nIn comments provided on December 23, 2022, regarding Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) posting 019-6177, which initiated the conversation between municipalities and the Province on merging the PPS and the Growth Plan, the City of Guelph requested the following broader considerations:\n\u2022\tA balanced tone be presented when integrating the two documents.\n\u2022\tGreater local autonomy through a combined provincial planning framework that respects local growth constraints and fiscal impacts.\n\u2022\tContinued support of the vision that municipal official plans are the most important tool for implementing provincial policy at the local level and for achieving comprehensive, integrated, and long-term planning that also accounts for local priorities and circumstances.\n\u2022\tEmpower local decision-makers to bring lands online more quickly that have gone through a secondary planning process by exempting these plans from appeal.\n\u2022\tContinued recognition of the importance of an integrated approach between land use planning and infrastructure investment in a manner that is fiscally responsible.\n\u2022\tConsultation with municipalities directly on the proposed changes and draft document, and,\n\u2022\tContinued support and guidance by local decision-making towards the achievement of complete communities.\nMore policy-specific requests were also made in the December 2022 memo.\nThe proposed Planning Statement addresses most of the City of Guelph\u2019s broader requests, particularly those that offer the continued support of complete communities. Overall, the proposed Planning Statement appears to provide municipalities, including the City of Guelph which is identified as a \u201clarge and fast- growing municipality\u201d, a greater ability to forge its own path as it relates to population forecasts and potential expansions of municipal boundaries.\nThere are some revisions, however, that will make respecting local growth constraints and fiscal impacts a continuing challenge. The looming challenge connected to the loss of development charges, introduced through the More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022 (Bill 23), is the financial stability and sustainability of the City of Guelph. This has not been addressed through the Planning Statement. Rather, it appears to make it even more difficult for municipalities to make decisions around growth management in a fiscally responsible manner and further opens the City to increased financial risk and potential liability.\nThe City of Guelph is a desirable place to live and will continue to be, particularly with a sound, consistent, and strategic Planning Statement that reflects an inclusive, environmentally-sound, economically sustainable, and a balanced approach to land use planning. With some suggested revisions, the proposed Planning Statement can more effectively facilitate the creation of new housing, which Guelph has supported though its pledge, and more importantly, housing that is affordable, while also adhering to the fundamental principles of good community planning.\nResponses to ERO Posting #019-6813 Questions\nIn addition to the above comments, the City of Guelph has responses to the questions provided in the ERO posting for provincial staff to consider.\n1.\tWhat are your thoughts on the policies that have been included from the PPS and A Place to Grow in the proposed policy document, including the proposed approach to implementation?\nGuidance Policies\n\u2022\tConcern with moving the policy \u201cthe official plan is the most important vehicle for implementing [the] Provincial Policy Statement\u201d to the non-policy preamble since an Official Plan will remain as one of the most effective mechanisms to direct and guide local land use planning.\n\u2022\tSupport for carrying forward that the Planning Statement policies represent minimum standards, especially for the Natural Heritage System, and that planning authorities and decision-makers may go beyond these standards to address matters of importance to the City of Guelph.\n\u2022\tConcern with the proposed changes to the vision of the proposed Planning Statement and the movement away from protections for the environment and agricultural lands.\nPopulation and Employment Forecasts\n\u2022\tAs proposed with Guelph, no longer planning to provincially-mandated forecasts gives the City more control over planning for growth or limiting growth. At the same time, without provincial guidance on forecasts, this could potentially weaken existing coordinated and strategic decision-making across the province, causing further fragmentation of land use planning. Comprehensive planning for the province will be lost without a coordinated approach to population and employment forecasting resulting in further housing and employment gaps province wide.\nHousing Policies (Section 2.2)\n\u2022\tSupport for maintaining the Growth Plan\u2019s concepts of Strategic Growth Areas (SGA) and Major Transit Station Areas (MTSA). The City of Guelph is identified as one of 29 \u201clarge and fast-growing municipalities\u201d in the proposed Planning Statement, and supports the requirement to identify SGAs and meet certain density targets in MTSAs on higher order transit corridors through their official plans. The City of Guelph has implemented these requirements through Official Plan Amendment 80.\n\u2022\tSupport for expanding the definition of \u201chousing options\u201d to specifically include more examples of gentle density and broader housing arrangements. This proposed revision aligns with work recently completed by the City on the 2023 Comprehensive Zoning Bylaw.\n\u2022\tGuelph is concerned with the conversion of existing commercial buildings for residential use can cause long-term economic implications for job growth and erode employment areas, especially those primarily comprised of office uses. Recommend that local municipalities be given flexibility to identify areas appropriate for residential conversion rather than permitting that conversion as of right for all existing commercial and institutional uses. (Policy 2.2.1 b).\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support the removal intensification targets. The intensification targets ensured that a percentage of all new residential development would be within the built-up area. Intensification targets ensure that a portion of new development is near infrastructure such as transit, water and wastewater servicing and community amenities. Intensifying existing urban areas allows for housing units of varying types and sizes and limits the need for expansion of urban boundaries to accommodate additional population and employment. Intensification uses land and infrastructure efficiently and because amenities are close-by, encourages a more walkable community. Intensification targets allow the City to plan infrastructure capacity in growth areas to maximize growth to ensure a compact and sustainable community.  Although the proposed PPS encourages intensification, removing the target reduces certainty and transparency, eliminates an indicator for measuring and reporting progress, reduces certainty on infrastructure capacity and long term servicing capacity, and reduces the focus of working toward more sustainable communities. The City of Guelph is open to establishing a \u2018made-in-Guelph\u2019 approach, as demonstrated in our recent Growth Management Strategy (July 2022) and Official Plan Amendment 80, which will maximize the use of existing services within our boundary.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support the removal of the policy related to consideration of a range and mix of housing from the Growth Plan (current policy 2.2.2.6c). As shared with the Province in the City\u2019s December 23, 2022 memo, \u201cthis policy requires municipalities to consider the range and mix of housing of the existing housing stock while planning for a diverse future housing stock. Our existing housing stock should continue to be captured and utilized as part of a comprehensive policy framework.\u201d Our ability to produce a more balanced mix of housing, as presented through Guelph\u2019s Council-adopted Growth Management Strategy (July 2022) and Official Plan Amendment 80 is weakened with the removal of this policy.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support removing the definition of \u201caffordable\u201d or the proposed definition of \u201caffordable\u201d through Development Charges (DC) Act (Bill 23). The implications of this proposed revision result in two issues that do not address the creation of housing, specifically affordable housing, at a threshold that is reasonable for low to moderate income earners. Rather, this policy revision works counter to the overall objectives of recent land use planning legislation (More Homes Built Faster Act, 2023). These issues are:\n\u2022\tThe lack of a clear Provincial definitions of \u201caffordable housing\u201d and \u201clow and moderate income households\u201d means municipalities would not have a clear standard threshold\/benchmark to facilitate the construction of affordable housing.  A measure of accountability for those who indicate they are building affordable housing would no longer exist, and,\n\u2022\teliminating the requirement for municipalities to establish any affordable housing targets means that municipalities would no longer have the mandate to monitor and measure their progress in achieving affordable housing.\nSettlement Area Boundary Expansion Policies (Section 2.3)\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support allowing municipalities to expand their urban boundaries more easily, by either identifying new settlement areas or allowing the expansion of existing settlement area boundaries. As stated in the December 2022 comments, \u201calthough boundary expansions may be necessary, they should be discouraged, and growth should continue to be accommodated through intensification.\u201d\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support eliminating the need for a Municipal Comprehensive Review process. A MCR process provides municipalities with the consistency that is necessary to continue to plan desirable complete communities. By no longer requiring municipal comprehensive reviews and therefore the requirement to demonstrate the need for expansion under a new, simplified and flexible approach for settlement boundary expansion, this risks \u201ccreating an ad-hoc approach to efficient and orderly development\u201d (December 2022 memo).  Furthermore, this could lead to greater uncertainty for how, where and when a municipality will grow over the long-term which can then lead to increased financial costs to the municipality to provide roads, services and infrastructure to these areas, which will not support a growth paying for growth.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support the weakening of justification for boundary expansions. There is a considerable amount of research and data that demonstrates an abundant supply of land for residential development \u2013 both in Guelph and across Ontario. Mitigating the housing supply challenges across the Province, which is the overall goal of the revision of the Planning Statement and other more recent legislative changes, will not be solved by opening up lands on the periphery of the City. Rather, this will result in more expensive home- building efforts and long-term implications for existing and future taxpayers. This will also impact other services including schools and bussing to schools, paramedic response times, fire response times and will increase car dependency. It is widely acknowledged that suburban development imposes significant economic and environmental costs on the entire taxbase at a disproportionate rate.\nEmployment Protection and Conversion Policies (Section 2.8)\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support the revised definition of \u201cemployment area\u201d to remove the employment use protection from business and research parks and to prohibit any commercial uses that are not associated with the primary employment use and\/or institutional uses. While the City of Guelph understands the need to focus employment areas on uses that cannot locate in mixed use areas (e.g., heavy industry, manufacturing, and large-scale warehousing), the removal of the words \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d regarding the types of uses that could be included in an employment area in an Official Plan, removes the discretionary ability of municipalities to plan according to local context.\n\u2022\tThere is a limited amount of employment land in the City of Guelph and the densities are already low, simply due to the nature of employment uses. As of April 2023, more employment lands have been removed through the Province decision on OPA 80, jeopardizing our ability to have employment lands to meet our 2051 population. By further limiting the types of uses on these lands, the potential implications \u2013 such as lowering the ratio of residents to jobs (activity\nrates) and decreasing our non-residential tax base \u2013 puts Guelph at a greater risk of moving away from our community vision as embedded in our Official Plan, and climate action, sustainability, and economic objectives.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph supports the revision around scoping and clarifying the test for employment conversion requests but does not support removing the requirement for a municipal comprehensive review from the overall process. The City of Guelph is supportive of the revised conversion tests, including demonstrating that there is a need for the removal of the land from employment, and the land is not required for employment uses over the long term. In the absence of land budgets and targets to be met with the proposed repeal of the Growth Plan, the application of these tests will rely on targets contained in the City\u2019s Official Plan.\n\u2022\tThe lack of consistent and clear direction on criteria or assumptions creates a challenging planning environment for municipalities when estimating the availability of land to accommodate future growth. Requiring a Land Needs Assessment formalized good land use planning principles. Due to a lack of methodology or requirement to demonstrate the need for an expansion, this could result in inconsistent, uneven, and incongruous development patterns across Ontario.\nClimate Action Policies (Section 2.9)\n\u2022\tThis City of Guelph does not support eliminating the direction to reduce dependence on the automobile as this is a central piece that supports the modal shift to transit and active transportation.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support eliminating language that currently requires a municipality to consider the significant relationship between climate change mitigation, local food, and the agricultural land base. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to mitigate climate change and creating\/maintaining a thriving local food system helps reach our collective reduction goals.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support eliminating language that currently encourages municipalities to develop greenhouse gas inventories or establish any specific targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Municipal targets and climate action strategies are typically standard practice and without continued Provincial support, it will become more challenging for municipalities, like Guelph, to make informed decisions around climate for existing and future citizens of Ontario.\nGeneral Policies for Infrastructure (Section 3.1)\n\u2022\tRequirements to ensure viability of infrastructure over its lifecycle in 3.1(1)a is critical and needs to remain clearly called out.\n\u2022\tInfrastructure takes time to plan and build, it is recommended that the PPS direct proponents to develop in areas with servicing or servicing is planned, whenever possible, as outlined in the municipality\u2019s Master Plans.\nSewage and Water Servicing Systems (Section 3.6)\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support removing the references to climate change in this section of the proposed PPS 2023. Climate change is essential to take into consideration when planning for sewage and water services \u2013 if we are to experience wilder, wetter, and warmer weather in the years to come, preparing our sewage and water servicing infrastructure to mitigate these changes is critical.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph is concerned with the policy language that speaks to expanding available wastewater servicing capacities to settlement areas since this could increase the risk of directing growth to areas with insufficient servicing capacity.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph is also concerned with introducing additional flexibility for allowing on-site or private communal systems as this could put added risks on the City to inherit ownership of these systems in the future, at potential considerable cost to the municipality and could lead to substantial threats to the safety of our groundwater drinking system. The City has wellhead protection areas, that are identified in the City and the County of Wellington that need to be protected from contamination in order to have a safe supply of water for the citizens of Guelph.\nCultural Heritage and Archaeology\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph is concerned that through the proposed introduction of the term \u201cprotected heritage property\u201d in policy, a significant number of properties within Guelph that are identified as a built heritage resource (on the Municipal Register) will not be conserved.\nWater Resource Protection\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support removing the requirement to maintain or increase existing pervious surfaces. Guelph is a groundwater-dependent community and has capacity limitations; long-term solutions to this capacity need to be environmentally and fiscally responsible and sustainable. This policy revision may reduce the sustainability of the City\u2019s existing municipal drinking water supply sources and force the City to halt growth.\nCreation of Residential Lots in Prime Agricultural Areas and Rural Lands\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support the creation of up to three new residential lots from an existing farm property located in a prime agricultural area. This policy encourages fragmentation of the agricultural land base and threatens the quality and character of the City\u2019s surrounding agricultural lands.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph does not support permitting multi-lot residential development on rural lands where appropriate sewage and water servicing can be provided. Removing the test for when infrastructure is proposed to be expanded for rural development is also a concern.  This proposed policy encourages fragmentation of the agricultural land base and threatens the character of rural lands, in addition to placing increased financial responsibility and risk on a municipality around maintaining infrastructure for private servicing.\nPublic Spaces, Recreation, Parks, Trails and Open Space (Section 3.9)\n\u2022\tThe City recommends including a need to balance requirements for increasing housing density with requirements with expanding publicly available parkland and green space. Public spaces, recreation, parks, trails, and open spaces are important areas that contribute to overall health and well-being. These areas enhance both physical and mental health and are also important for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Most notably in higher density areas, ensuring equitable access to green space and opportunities for recreation, physical activity, socialization, and relaxation are critical in the development of healthy, complete communities.\nProposed Approach to Implementation\nThe document titled \u201cProposed Approach to Implementation\u201d provides an approach to implementation on some of the key proposed changes in the proposed Planning Statement.  The City of Guelph offers the following thoughts:\n\u2022\tTiming for Official Plan Updates \u2013 the City of Guelph supports maintaining the Planning Act\u2019s requirement that official plans be revised every five years (or every ten years after a new official plan) and will update our official plan to implement the Planning Statement policies during the next review cycle.\n\u2022\tOfficial Plan Updates related to Change to the Definition of \u201cArea of Employment\u201d \u2013 As previously mentioned, the City of Guelph requests that the Province consider additional revisions to the definition of \u201cemployment areas\u201d that would maintain the discretion of a municipality to determine what uses could locate within an \u201cemployment area\u201d. Should the Province move forward without additional revisions, the City of Guelph would respectfully comply with the Province\u2019s direction and update our official plan to explicitly authorize the site-specific permission of any existing uses that do not align with the new definition; as stated in the implementation document, areas that do not meet the definition would no longer be subject to policy requirements for \u201cconversions\u201d to nonemployment uses.\n\u2022\tContinued Implementation of 2051 Forecasts (at minimum) \u2013 The City of Guelph supports maintaining the population and employment growth forecast horizon of 2051, the Province should ensure consistency on comprehensive, standardized approach to growth management across the province.\n\u2022\tGo-Forward Approach to Provincially Significant Employment Zones (PSEZs) - There is qualified support for eliminating PSEZs. The City of Guelph requests that the employment protection and conversion policies within the PPS 2023 be strengthened to allow for the protection of employment lands from conversion to residential lands. If revised, then it would be reasonable to eliminate PSEZs.\n2.\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policy direction for large and fast-growing municipalities and other municipalities?\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph is one of 29 municipalities identified in Schedule 1 of the proposed Planning Statement \u201clarge and fast-growing\u201d. The City of Guelph supports the requirement to identify appropriate minimum density targets for Strategic Growth Areas as identified in our Official Plan.\n\u2022\tSupport for the proposed requirement to delineate the boundaries of the Major Transit Station Area (MTSA) through a new official plan or official plan amendment adopted under Section 26 of the Planning Act. OPA 80 has already fulfilled this requirement.\n\u2022\tSupport for the proposed requirement to establish prescribed minimum density targets (aligned with the current Growth Plan) within MTSAs. The City of Guelph\u2019s minimum density target is 150 people and jobs per hectare and this has been established through OPA 80, and increases to 200 people and jobs per hectare.\n3.\tWhat are your thoughts regarding the proposed policies to generate housing supply, including an appropriate range and mix of housing options?\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph supports the direction from the Province that municipalities must continue to facilitate the creation of housing at an accelerated pace; the City\u2019s commitment to the March 2023 Housing Pledge is evidence of this with assistance from the province.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph is concerned that, by not carrying forward a definition of \u201caffordable\u201d or \u201clow and moderate income households\u201d, this will create an even greater inability to offer homes that are affordable to the majority of the population of income-earners in Guelph.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph is concerned that the proposed Planning Statement does not carry forward the Growth Plan\u2019s policy 2.2.2.6c, which requires municipalities to consider the range and mix of housing of the existing stock while planning for a diverse future housing stock. As stated in the December 23, 2022 comments from the City, our existing housing stock should continue to be captured and utilized as part of a comprehensive planning policy framework, but the proposed Planning Statement does not take this into consideration.\n\u2022\tThe City of Guelph supports the proposed Planning Statement\u2019s recognition that development proponents have the capacity, financial and otherwise, to also facilitate and increase a diverse range and mix of housing stock. There is concern, however, that some of the proposed policies could result in placing a municipality at increased financial risk and liability, particularly with respect to allowing development proponents to \u201cleverage\u201d their capacity and compel a municipality to enter into an agreement to service lands in advance of staging of development (proposed policy 3.1.1).\n4.\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policies regarding the conservation of agriculture, aggregates, natural and cultural heritage resources?\nPlease see previous comments on the conservation of agriculture.\nThe Natural Heritage System policies are still being considered by the Province and are not yet available for review or comment. City of Guelph staff will provide comment when available through a future ERO posting.\nPlease see previous comments on the conservation of cultural heritage resources.\n5.\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policies regarding planning for employment?\nPlease refer to comments contained in responses to Question 1.\n6.\tAre there any other barriers to, or opportunities for, accelerating development and construction (e.g., federal regulations, infrastructure planning and approvals, private\/public partnerships for servicing, provincial permitting, urban design guidelines, technical standards, zoning, etc.)?\nThe City of Guelph fully appreciates the challenges with respect to housing supply and meeting the needs of current and future Ontarians \u2013 accelerating the pace of housing development is a monumental task that requires a sustained level of commitment from all stakeholders. We recognize time is of the essence and are willing to work with the Province to realize the proposed vision in the PPS 2023 for a prosperous, strong, and competitive economy and a clean and healthy environment. We, too, want Ontario to continue to be a \u201cgreat place to live, work, and visit and where all Ontarians enjoy a high standard of living and an exceptional quality of life.\u201d\nThe proposed PPS 2023 also offers some barriers to accelerating development and construction, particularly under a fiscally-responsible model. For example, the revised policy language appears to encourage the expansion of settlement area boundaries and the conversion of lands to residential in municipalities, like Guelph, that have already identified an plentiful supply of existing and future land for housing.  It is well-acknowledged that intensification and higher-density development not only generates more revenue for a municipality than low- density development, but the life-cycle cost associated with low-density development far exceed that of high-density development.\nWe respectfully request that the pace at which proposed legislation and policy direction is being released and receiving royal assent decelerate, both for our benefit as reviewers and commenters, and for your benefit as legislative leaders and policy writers. These are some very significant changes to the land use planning framework \u2013 which, again, we understand the reasoning behind - but the fast and furious pace at which they are being written, released, and reviewed can lead to some significant, permanent, and detrimental unintended consequences (e.g., the premature development agricultural lands). This is a serious barrier to achieving the overarching goal of building more homes faster. Our staffing resources are not able to advance housing units while continuing to re-write policies based on changing legislation, amending operational practices, monitoring reports, and reevaluating infrastructure timing with ongoing staffing challenges.\nWe all want to serve in the best interests of our community. We all want existing and future residents of this Province to have a safe and affordable place to live, which includes safe drinking water. There is an enormous opportunity for Provincial leaders and staff, and municipal leaders and staff, to come together to work collaboratively, with transparent and open communication, on crafting legislation, policy, and regulations that consistently weaves together and advances building homes quickly that people can afford and in communities that people want to live, work, and visit.\nThe City appreciates the opportunity to provide input on the direction of land use planning direction and policy in Ontario. These comments are the first version and may be expanded upon based on future amendments provided by the province. The City looks forward to working with the Provincial Land Use Plans Branch and staff are available to discuss these comments. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.\n",

The only limits on opening up land for housing and related development appears to be to avoid hazardous sites and to mitigate for natural disasters.  This new Planning document neglects everything but housing and development.\nYes, we have a shortage of homes, but homes can be apartments, condos, multiplexes, town-homes, etc.  HOMES DO NOT NEED TO BE SUBURBAN, DETACHED, GREATER THAN 1800 SQ FT WITH A YARD.\nI realize that this is as much (or more) about the profits to developers and the automotive industry.  Paving the province for car-dependent housing clusters will make many people very rich in the short run, but will greatly exacerbate issues with pollution, resource shortages and climate change.\nAny policies on an increase in housing must greatly limit suburban sprawl.  There should be maximum average lot sizes in municipal areas.  If a community wants an \"executive subdivision\" then they have to also have affordable homes on small lots or multiplexes to offset and limit the sprawl.  The prices of the larger homes in less dense areas should also include development charges for the infrastructure (including schools, etc) required, since these homeowners are not effectively using existing infrastructure and with often require an inefficient new infrastructure to be built and supported.\n",

The cost of food is sky high right now, and being able to supply food to feed our country should be high on the list of important things to make sure we are doing. We import a lot of food, but I always buy local wherever possible, and I love seeing produce and such in the grocery tore that was grown near me.\nI am surprised there are not better plans in place for the creation of more houses. We are letting developers dictate how the plan is unfolding (as far as I can see).\nIn areas that are seeing the most growth, why do we not have a team of economists, city engineers, tradesmen, architects, designers, etc that come up with plans to create more living spaces in the most economical way. While simultaneously making sure there is enough greenspace, social services and infrastructure to support the added density and THEN have developers bid on the projects. Creating not only condos, but semi and fully detached houses, with detached houses being created with multi-generational living in mind. Use people who work and live in that city to come up with the plans. These are people who drive in the areas that they will planning in and are more aware of existing issues in the area than some developer who has their eye on the profit margin instead of what would benefit the city as a whole (like how in the city of Barrie, there are not enough day camp slots, or day care services, or enough resources for shelter to house the homeless). As someone who works in renovations, is passionate about space planning, and would like to be able to afford a house some time in this century, I would LOVE to work on a project like this.\nBut all of that should not come at the expense of our farm land or what SHOULD be protected natural spaces. These help us be able to feed our own citizens,  keep temperatures down, give animals places to live, and keep our air and water clean.

        "comment":"Dear Premier Ford and Minister Clark\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed new Provincial Planning Statement.  I have been a Registered Professional Planner in the Province of Ontario for over 19 years and I am employed in a Director-level role in the planning field.  I am also the President of two Condominium Corporations in Ontario.  I am sending my comments confidentially in order to ensure there is no conflict between my professional opinons and those of my employer.\nAs I see it, the proposed policy statement attempts to achieve two goals:  1) significant intensification of new development on serviced land near transit stations; and 2) significant growth of low density, ground related housing in un-serviced areas inaccessible by transit.  I support the first goal and commend the government for being bold in implementing as-of-right development in urban centres.  However, the second goal is entirely contradictory to the first and such a contradictory approach to urban planning policy can be detrimental to the development and well-being of municipalities. In my opinion, eliminating the award-winning Places to Grow Plan and replacing it with a much simplified and contradictory policy document will have life-long negative impacts on the health and welfare of Ontarians.  This proposed policy document provides scant direction to municipalities and essentially downloads growth planning to landowners .  In my opinion, the proposed policy statement has several flaws, as follows:\n1. Lack of Coherence: The policies lack a unified vision and fail to provide a clear direction for urban development. This lack of coherence and conflicting objectives will result in inefficient and unsustainable new development. For example, if one policy promotes density and compact development while another encourages sprawl, car-dependent infrastructure, and expensive new servicing, it creates confusion and undermines the overall effectiveness of urban planning efforts.\n2. Inefficient Resource Allocation: There appears to be no current research-backed justification for the policies. Many of them are antithetical to current professional practice (highways and low density land consumptive development).  The policies will lead to inefficient allocation of resources. Urban planning requires careful allocation of resources maximizing redevelopment, existing infrastructure, and public services so that they can be budgeted for. Many of the proposed policies will make it challenging to prioritize and allocate these resources effectively, with municipalities competing for limited resources. This can result in wasted investments, underutilized infrastructure, and disparities in service provision across different areas of the province.\n3. Uncertainty for Stakeholders: The contradictory policies especially the lack of comprehensive regional planning will create uncertainty for various stakeholders, including developers, investors, and residents. When policies are inconsistent, it becomes difficult for these groups to make informed decisions about investment, development, or even daily activities. Land pricing will become even more volatile and speculative. The constant changing of planning policy, legislation and regulation is extremely difficult and expensive to implement at the regional and local level.  Uncertainty can hinder economic growth, discourage investment, and in my experience is leading to delays in urban development projects.\n4. Inequitable Outcomes: Contradictory policies can exacerbate social and economic inequalities within the province. For example, if one policy emphasizes affordable housing and inclusivity, while another promotes luxury development and gentrification, it can result in displacement and segregation of marginalized communities. This has been happening for years and should have been addressed head on in any new planning policy \u2013 it has not. Inconsistent policies can widen the gap between different socioeconomic groups, leading to social tensions and unequal access to resources and opportunities.\n5. Environmental Impact: Contradictory urban planning policies will have negative environmental consequences. It does not appear that this government has spent much time consulting with environmental experts, either here or internationally.  One can see the impacts of a low density, land consumptive development pattern right now in Halifax, where subdivisions are burning. The proposed residential lot creation on prime farmland will result in more vulnerable populations and investment losses due to environmental disasters such as fires. It is critical that the Conservation Authorities be given back their ability to advise municipalities on natural heritage matters as they are directly linked to natural hazard planning.  Taking this away has already resulted in delays and extra costs for the development community and the municipalities.\n6. Long-term Planning Challenges: Contradictory policies make long-term planning and implementation difficult. Urban planning requires a long-term perspective to accommodate future population growth, technological advancements, and changing societal needs. In the proposed policy, municipalities would be able expand settlement area boundaries (SABE) at any time (because there is no MCR) and the criteria for expansion are less stringent, especially for critical environmental constraints. Devolving growth planning to individual municipalities means the need for more planners (they are scarce), more resources and an inconsistent approach to public service planning. How does this fix the housing problem?\nAddressing these contradictions in the proposed policy statement is crucial to ensure effective and sustainable urban development. It requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to align various policy objectives, engage stakeholders, and establish a clear vision for the province\u2019s future.  I encourage the government to proceed with the necessary policy changes to encourage high density infill development near the existing and new transit stations the government has been (rightly so) funding and accelerating, provided these communities can be well designed; however, please take a pause on the contradictory suburban and ex-urban expansion policies you\u2019ve included in the proposed policy statement.\nAs noted by many others, the housing issue in Ontario is not a planning or a land supply problem, it\u2019s a financial problem.  Growth of the entire housing sector in Ontario (except for a tiny percentage) is left to the free market.  While this has produced much needed housing, especially in the GTA, it has resulted in increasingly expensive housing.  Some lessons should be learned from places like Vienna, Austria which adopted a public housing development plan in the 1930\u2019s that continues to this day.  Citizens of Vienna do not spend upwards of 30 \u2013 50% of their disposable income on housing, and the middle class have access to well built, transit friendly and predictably\u2013priced homes.  Ontario is nowhere near this because we have not for years addressed the financial side of housing development, and the proposed changes to the policy statements are not going to change the cost of housing.\nI urge you to please put a pause on the proposed policy statement and engage with professionals both locally and internationally to adopt bold best practices.  The proposed policy statement is not best practice but rather reverts to a 1980\u2019s-style approach with all of the predictable negative impacts this will cause society.\n",

Our GTA cities\u2019 infrastructures are not built to withstand the influx of cars and traffic is irritatingly unavoidable. We need to build jobs and homes in regions outside outside of the GTA in order to attract families to them.\nTo relieve the stresses currently placed on our communities, the government needs to place caps on classrooms sizes according to the age of students. This will increase jobs across the province for teachers, administrators, educational assistants, and facilities workers in schools, etc., while giving students and families the resources they need to overcome learning gaps from the pandemic. As well, smaller classrooms is smart planning for any future outbreaks, where we would have more manageable numbers of staff and students in the same room. This would make new neighbourhoods more attractive to families as they would enjoy new school facilities with perks we can build in such as daycares, sports facilities, and arts facilities.

And that's at the CURRENT pace of construction.\nIf you won't listen to the farmers themselves, who are clearly advocating for a stoppage of farmland loss, then just listen to basic logic.  Without adequate farmland, this province will be unable to feed itself without imports, and that is also a dangerous prospect.\nPlease abandon the idea of building residences on farmland in Ontario.\n",

        "comment":"I understand that once farmland has been removed from agricultural use, we will lose employment, the potential to sustain our food security and increase the transportation of food and the greenhouse gases released in that transportation. I am concerned about Bill 97 because once prime agricultural areas are allowed to be severed and have housing built on them, we can never recreate that farmland. Further, in Northern Ontario, a lot more inputs are required, as there is rocky terrain, so losing southern Ontario food production would require more investment in greenhouses and input in farming in parallel - again this is not ideal. Where is the public participation component in this policy other than letters? In a time of climate change and associated challenges, we need mitigation. Green space helps cool areas, farmland can be green. Currently, farm areas can already house staff and farm owner families. Urban densification is what is required. The Netherlands have limited farm areas, due to low lands and flooding from the ocean. Where is the research that backs up this change in policy. We can borrow from countries like the Netherlands that have solid protection for agricultural areas and discourage sprawl.\n",

As a rural\nmunicipality with a population of approximately 5,000 residents, Southwold is\npredominantly an agricultural and farming community, encompassing hamlets such as\nShedden, Fingal, and Iona.\nOur foremost apprehension lies with the proposed policies that would permit the creation\nof three (3) new residential building lots on Agricultural Parcels. We believe that this\nprovision has the potential to significantly impact the character and integrity of our\nTownship, posing substantial challenges to our existing infrastructure, including roads and\nwater systems. The prospect of fragmented development arising from small building lots\nraises concerns about the preservation of our agricultural lands, as further division of farm\nparcels for residential purposes may become a trend.\nA critical consideration is the absence of sanitary sewers throughout most areas of\nSouthwold, with the exception of Talbotville. Consequently, the proposed new residential\nlots in agricultural areas would heavily rely on septic systems to handle sewage waste.\nHowever, due to the diverse topography of our Township and the presence of potential\nenvironmental hazards, particularly in proximity to Lake Erie, certain lands may not have\nthe capacity to support full septic systems. We also have local planning policies in place\nthat establish setback distances from natural hazard lands, which may prohibit or\nsignificantly reduce the development area even if the land meets the criteria set forth in\nthe proposed PPS.\nIn the context of Ontario's vast and diverse landscape, we recognize the significant\nundertaking involved in updating a policy document of this magnitude. Policies need to be\nadaptable to accommodate the varying regional characteristics across our province.\nNevertheless, it is crucial that any policy put in place provides comprehensive guidance\ntel 519-769-2010 email planning@southwold.ca\n35663 Fingal Line, Heartfelt and homegrown Fingal, Ontario, N0L 1K0\nand supports responsible and sustainable development for the long-term future of all communities, including Southwold Township.\nMoreover, we would like to emphasize the importance of safeguarding our agricultural lands. Agriculture plays a pivotal role in our local economy, food security, and environmental sustainability. Therefore, it is imperative to mitigate the loss of valuable crop land resulting from unchecked development. By actively managing land use and curtailing urban sprawl, we can ensure the preservation of our agricultural sector, protect our invaluable resources, and secure a prosperous future for both rural and urban communities.\nLastly, we would like to draw attention to the disconcerting trend of annual agricultural land loss due to development in Ontario. The continuous erosion of agricultural lands poses a significant threat to our farming industry's sustainability and our ability to meet the increasing demand for locally sourced food. It is imperative that we address this issue and implement policies that strike a balance between responsible development and the preservation of our agricultural heritage.\nWe appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments and concerns on behalf of the Township of Southwold. We firmly believe that our feedback will contribute to a more informed and inclusive policy-making process. We trust that our concerns will be given due consideration as you continue to refine the proposed Provincial Planning Statement.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\nYours truly,\nJosh Mueller\nJosh Mueller BES URPT CPT MCIP\nPlanner\nTownship of Southwold\n",

Nothing is more stressful than being otherwise detained when the cows need tending to or the wheat needs to be combined.\nAfter recent travel to Scotland, where sheep abound and sprawling 'farms' still exist, I realized how much of our farmland has already been gobbled up for row upon row of cookie cutter town homes or industry. I recall Sunday afternoon drives with family to go out to the country side and marvel at the cows, pigs and other livestock grazing, in vast quantities, in the endless fields. I remember the winds making the planted crops look like a sea of green waves.  Now... the farms are small, the quantity of livestock has greatly diminished, I can see houses at the edge of fields where they have no right to be and the crops fields aren't near as vast as they once were~ yet our population grows... how does it make any sense to deplete the farmlands which feed us? This makes absolutely no sense to me.\nPlease, quickly reconsider your decisions to populate land with people and let the cows and corn flourish.\nTimely decisions need to be made in a lawful, organized and succinct way to keep farmers whwrethey belong, let theur children grow and live on the land and continue to feed the rest of us. It's rare that a city dwellers grows up thinkink, 'hey, I want to be a farmer', however,  those who do grow up in rural farming area DO grow up thinking, 'Id love to continue in my parents footsteps, build and grow my own family here and fatm!'.\nPreserve this! You have the power, SAVE OUR FARMLANDS!\n",

        "comment":"We live and farm in a small, rural municipality which is growing fast.  Our farm properties have already been surrounded by rural housing.  There is a plan to build a new hospital and nursing home on land adjacent to ours.  We wonder at our age (we're in our sixties) how long farming will be viable in this area.  We may have difficulty selling our land for agricultural use only.  Land values are already so high that no one can buy land without a severance opportunity for housing to help pay for it.  For us, the ship of preserving agricultural land for agriculture has already sailed.  Therefore we have to disagree with our professional organizations like DFO and OFA.  We want to be able to sell three lots to help finance our retirement or to sell land with a severance opportunity to enable a farmer to buy it for agriculture and help offset the astronomical cost of land.\nWe don't think there should be a one size fits all policy for agricultural use.  Perhaps in areas with large tracts of agricultural land there should be an effort to preserve that,  but in areas where the process of building in agricultural areas is already well under way, farmers should be allowed to also sell some of their land for housing.\n",

Ontario has to build more dense, more compact, and more affordable instead, so that existing natural environment and farmland will stay untouched. Building \u2018more houses faster\u2019 is not contrary to protecting our natural environment!\nAlthough the proposals \u2018encourage\u2019 density, especially in transit hubs, there is no longer a requirement or mandate to keep the density to at least 80 residents and jobs per hectare (earlier by the Ontario government already downsized from 80 to 50%).\nThe same goes for increasing density by infill, where the requirement in high-demand municipalities to use existing infrastructure and space for at least 60% of the new to build houses (earlier already down to 50 from 60%) will be eliminated. And especially for the elimination in the Provincial Policy Statement requirement to seize all opportunities for efficient infill development, such as changing the zoning requirements in neighbourhoods for single-family homes.\nAs a resident of Ontario and a grandfather I demand of the Environmental Registry of Ontario to take all steps necessary to prevent the proposed changes as mentioned in my first paragraph and instead to enable municipalities to plan and work towards a livable future with sustainable cities and protected farm\u2013, wet\u2013 and woodlands.\nThank you for your attention.\n",

        "comment":"There is very little to encourage densification, and gentle densification is too vague with a very narrow scope. Previous development plans called for housing density targets for new development. This current proposal is silent. New development should strive for at least 50 people\/ha average for developments greater than 5ha. This encourages a diversity of housing styles to meet large families, single parent families, students, and elderly people. This was successful in the south end of Guelph but density could be much higher still.\nIt is good that density increases around transit, but transit design (including stations) should be part of larger developments, not an afterthought. The plan is too silent on public transit.\nThe plan is silent on encouraging multiple use development that includes public and commercial services near homes (libraries, medical, daycare, and stores).\nThere is no mention of energy efficiency. The plan should encourage reduced transportation requirements (increased density, workplace development near housing). The plan should reinstate the renewable energy building code provisions that were removed from the building code 5 years ago.\nConservation Authority lands are also parkland. This should be recognized and protected. There is a federal and provincial commitment to increase natural space protection to 30%. The natural space Conservation Authority land should be protected from development and only CA land that is currently farmed should be permitted for development.\nAgricultural land severances should not be permitted at all.\n",

While the Board concurs with the general intent of the proposed policies as they relate to large and fast growing urban centres in relation to increasing the affordable housing supply, they are somewhat concerned and confused by some of the proposed policies as they may relate to small northern and rural communities where growth and housing supply is not an issue.  Perhaps this is in part due to a need for more and clearer definitions. For example, what is meant by the term \"rural settlement area\" as used in section 2.5.2?  How does a rural settlement area differ from a defined settlement area in a rural community, or is there any difference other than that one is defined and the other may not be?  The use of terms such as that and others need clarification or more precise definitions.\nIt is and has always been a primary goal of our Official Plan to protect and enhance the natural heritage features and rural character of our Island while providing for limited residential and economic development.

The proposals that are outlined in the posting are deeply concerning and raise the overarching questiion - Why is it necessary to eliminate the exisiting PPS and Places to Grow Act, documents that already encompass all of the proposed planning guidance and direction that is needed? Moreover, the existing PPS and Places to Grow Act provide the essential basis for planning and protection of Agricultural and other resources. The Proposals to allow expanded development on farmland is sheer madness and is unsustainable. We are already losing some of the best farmland in Ontario at the incredible rate of 319 acres PER DAY!

I was raised in a small village in southwestern Ontario which has grown over the years and is completely surrounded by farming.  I attended rural schools in which many of the kids were part of a family farm.  I never understood a lot of it.  Fast forward to today. I\u2019m a wife to a third generation farmer.  Becoming a part of that has been eye opening.\nOxford County (where I call home) located in southwestern Ontario is not only the dairy capital of Ontario, but is considered the dairy capital of Canada and this bill will have a major impact on century farms.\nDo I agree with the fact that we have a housing crisis absolutely.\nBut filling up our agricultural areas with homes not only limits the growth and development of it established agricultural business.  it will also displace areas which still allow wildlife to have a space without constant human interaction.  Our cities are already crying because of the wildlife that has been displaced and is trying to survive in an environment they do not enjoy.\nThe other side of this, developers are unable to keep up now to demand now.  Many are already questioning if they are able to proceed with current plans. Increased supply costs and lack of workers, & huge increases in fees to develop in areas and increased interest rates. So making more land available isn\u2019t going to help if we don\u2019t have the workforce to build.\nOur government is pushing 15 minutes cities in areas because of the climate crisis.  Bill 97 pushes more people to the rural areas where they have to travel for all amenities sort of counter productive to the actual plan.  There are still rural areas that do not have access to reliable high speed internet , natural gas let alone getting more then 2 cell bars if that\u2019s you main source of communication. So you\u2019ll have increased living expenses that towns can provide making living a little more affordable.  There\u2019s no public transit to get from \u201ca\u201d to \u201cb\u201d\nThere are things that need to be addressed before allowing a free for all pass.\nConcerned Ontario resident\n",

        "comment":"The proposed PPS would no longer require municipalities to use the provincially mapped Agricultural System in developing lands within prime agricultural areas. Municipalities would still be required to designate and protect prime agricultural areas for long-term use but it will be easier to establish more housing within prime agricultural lands.  Agricultural lands would be permitted to sever up to 2 new lots, creating three lots out of lands that were previously zoned Significant\/Prime Agriculture.  Ontario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas.\nGiven that provincial agricultural system mapping is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. The added responsibility on rural municipalities like ours with limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support means we will be working with whatever system we can come up with on our own that works for us. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land and the province should have stronger wording in the new PPS that ensures the correct system is followed throughout the province rather than simply encouraging it.\nThe proposed PPS 2023 specifically permits multi-lot residential development on rural lands where appropriate sewage and water servicing can be provided and removes the justification test for when infrastructure is proposed to be expanded for rural development, providing greater flexibility for private servicing. Municipalities must consider \u201clocally appropriate\u201d rural characteristics when directing development in rural settlement areas.  How do we maintain a \u201crural character\u201d when we will end up with lots that have 3 houses on them \u2013 not to mention the toll that could take on our water and lands.\nOnce again we find that the documents are created in and for Southern Ontario where there is less and less room for development, and that pours over into rural northern areas that do not have the means to address these changes, or to accommodate them.\n",

        "comment":"May 30, 2023\nMinister Steve Clark\nMinistry of Municipal Affairs & Housing\n17th Floor - 777 Bay Street\nToronto, ON M7A 2J3\nDelivered via email: PlanninqConsultation@ontario.ca\nDear Minister Clark,\nRe: Comments from the City of Greater Sudbury on ERO Posting - 019-6813 - Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nThe Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MMAH) is consulting on proposed policies for an integrated province-wide land use planning policy document. MMAH is seeking input on a proposed Provincial Planning Statement (Statement) that takes policies from A Place to Grow and the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) to support the achievement of housing objectives. The City of Greater Sudbury (the City) has identified \u2018Housing\u201d as a priority of its 2019-2027 Strategic Plan, specifically to ensure all of its citizens have access to \u2018\u2018safe, affordable, attainable and sustainable housing options in the City of Greater Sudbury\u201d. As a direct provider of social housing, funder of housing-related programs, facilitator of development and regulator of building safety, the City is witnessing the provincial housing supply crisis first-hand. With this perspective, the City offers the following comments with respect to proposed Provincial Policy Statement and ERO Posting - 019-6813.\nGeneral\nAs proposed, the Statement does not clearly distinguish between policies designed for high-growth, densely populated areas from having province-wide application. This increases the potential for the Statement to inadvertently slow development in other parts of the province, like northern Ontario, where the factors influencing land use policies for dense, fast-growing areas might be less applicable.\nOpportunities\nThe Statement presents many policies that support the City\u2019s ongoing commitment to good planning practices, including:\n(1) Continued Focus on Compact Built Form and Complete Communities\nThe proposed Statement introduces definitions for \u201ccompact built form\u201d, \u201ccomplete communities\u201d, \u201clow impact development\u201d, \u201cstrategic growth areas\u201d, \u201curban growth centres\u201d, and \u201cwatershed planning\u201d which support both new and amended policies.\nThese definitions and their associated policies are supportive of the City\u2019s good planning practices, such as focusing growth in serviced areas, protecting the climate through compact development, and promoting mixed-use development that leads to complete communities. Additional policies that enhance good planning practices include those that address:\n\u2022 Intensification of employment uses;\n\u2022 Compact, mixed-use development that incorporates compatible employment uses to support the achievement of complete communities; and,\n\u2022 Permitting and facilitating all types of residential intensification, the conversion of existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use, development and introduction of new housing options within previously developed areas, and redevelopment which results in a net increase in residential units.\n(2) Housing\nThe Statement would require municipalities to provide for a range and mix of housing options and establish broader permission for residential intensification, including:\n\u2022 Conversion of existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use;\n\u2022 Development and introduction of new housing options within previously developed areas; and,\n\u2022 Redevelopment that results in a net increase in residential units.\nMunicipalities would be required to align land use planning policies with housing policies, including addressing homelessness and facilitating development of a full range of housing options and affordability levels to meet local needs. This aligns with studies underway in the City.\n(3) Employment\nMixed Use - Land for Employment Outside of Employment Areas\nOverall, the Statement protects and preserves lands used for industrial and manufacturing purposes while promoting mixed-use development where the mix of uses are compatible, consistent with the City\u2019s Employment Land Strategy.\n(4) Other\nThe Statement complements other initiatives such as the City\u2019s Nodes and Corridors Strategy and the Downtown Master Plan Update by encouraging planning authorities to identify and focus growth and development in Strategic Growth Areas, which include settlement areas, nodes and corridors. The intent is to develop complete communities that offer a greater range and mix of housing options and mixed uses. It also encourages the prioritization of investments in infrastructure and public service facilities to support these strategic growth areas.\nChallenges\nNotwithstanding proposed definitions and policies of the Statement that support good planning, the following policies present challenges to good planning in the context of northern Ontario:\n(1) Private Communal Servicing\nThe current PPS directs development to areas of municipal servicing, for both water and wastewater, and permits private communal servicing only in instances where municipal services are not available or not feasible. The proposed Statement notes that municipal services are the preferred form of servicing, but it does not prioritize the utilization of municipal services over private communal services. Additionally, the proposed Statement has struck the provision that intensification and redevelopment within settlement areas be directed to locations of existing municipal services to optimize the use of these services.\nThe Statement could result in the following negative impacts:\n\u2022 Existing and planned municipal services that become less financially viable as development is less focused on serviced areas;\n\u2022 Increased development in rural, unserviced areas that counter the trend of good planning practices; and,\n\u2022 Risk of forced transfer of ownership of the private communal services to the City should they fail, including all ongoing operational and replacement costs in perpetuity.\n(2) Settlement Area Creation and Expansion\nThe Statement permits settlement area creation or expansion at any time, and suggests that planning authorities only \u201cconsider\"\u2019where there is sufficient infrastructure and public service facilities and the general protection of agricultural lands, rather than requiring a planning authority to do so.\nThis policy change is concerning given that, overall, there is more than sufficient land supply both for residential and employment lands within the existing settlement areas throughout the City and staff would not recommend an expansion of settlement area. If implemented, the anticipated impacts could allow for development in areas unsupported by municipal water and wastewater services, making those existing and planned municipal services less financially viable as development is focused elsewhere. A departure from the City\u2019s master plans, such as approving settlement area expansions in\nareas where they were not accounted for, will create hardship in infrastructure planning and viability.\nThis policy change would also have the double effect of impacting prime agricultural areas given that settlement areas exist adjacent to the communities of Azilda, Chelmsford, Blezard Valley and Val Therese, possibly removing prime agricultural lands from the agricultural reserve through a settlement area adjustment. Reducing the amount of area reserved for food production runs counter to the City\u2019s Official Plan, the Greater Sudbury Food Strategy, and the general aims of sustainable development and\ngood planning.\nIt\u2019s important to note that a request to expand a settlement area would need to be considered by Council; should Council refuse, the applicant would not have a right to an appeal and the decision is final.\n(3) Lot Creation in Prime Agricultural Lands\nThe Statement prescribes lot creation standards in prime agricultural areas. The City is concerned that the proposed changes with the Statement would lead to the further fragmentation of the City\u2019s prime agricultural areas and increase the risk of land use conflicts between residential and agricultural operations. This fragmentation leads to the loss of farmland and could result in negative impacts on species at risk. As stated in the previous section, converting food producing lands to other uses is contradictory to good planning and sustainable development. Several local reports conclude that that\nthere is ample supply and choice of residential lots in the City given the City\u2019s existing policies, land supply, and rate of uptake. A 2018 report, for example, notes that, over a 9-year period, 60-70% of the newly created rural lots had not yet been built upon.\n(4) Contradictory Approach to Development\nThe Statement includes contradictory policies from the standpoint of sustainable development and good planning. On one hand support is given to the development of compact and complete communities with mixed uses that utilize municipal services. On the other hand, support is also given rural development of lots with private communal services, the creation of residential lots in prime agricultural areas, and the ability to create and expand settlement areas without substantial justification. This conflicting approach in setting development priority is concerning for reasons already noted elsewhere.\nConclusion\nThe City of Greater Sudbury is ready to do its part in supporting growth and housing in Ontario, but the Province must create policies and development approval processes that recognize the unique circumstances in northern Ontario where the context, issues and growth are much different that southern Ontario. Although the challenges facing housing supply in the North are complex, these can be overcome with support from the Province.\nRespectfully submitted,\nKris Longston, MES, MCIP, RPR\nDirector, Planning Services\nPlanning Services Division\nCity of Greater Sudbury\nPhone: (705) 674-4455, ext. 4353\nEmail: kris.longston@qreatersudbury.ca\nwww.greatersudbury.ca\n",

Below, please find my comments regarding the policies proposed.\nThe Province of Ontario\u2019s proposed combination of the Provincial Policy Statement 2000 (PPS) and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Growth Plan), presents policies and definitions not required for the creation of more, and affordable, housing, which we had been led to believe was the problem Ontario was trying to solve. The policies proposed in the replacement of the PPS and the Growth Plan are going to harm communities, commuters, the environment, and people, all while not addressing the problem Ontario purports to address: affordability.\nThe proposed changes to the PPS and Growth Plan are taking the province back to the development approach of the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, when anything could be built anywhere. It has taken the past 50 years to \u2018heal\u2019 the impacts of these short-sighted development decisions and to develop policies and legislation which consider development for the long term benefit of this province. We strongly recommend that the 1950\u2019s approach to development not occur again.  The integrity of this province has too much to lose in the short and long term.\nIt is very clear that the proposed policies and legislation were prepared based on the direction and to the satisfaction of the building industry and land development associations.  Municipalities of all sizes were excluded from the discussion and yet  the municipalities will be expected to do the approvals and to provide the various services.  The citizens and taxpayers of this province deserve much better: science-based land use planning, which appreciates and respects all residents and landowners, not only developers and future developers.\n",

        "comment":"The Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement through ERO 019-6813 suggests that municipalities will be required to plan for infrastructure needed to support development, such as stormwater management, water and wastewater infrastructure.  The City of Cambridge will continue to plan for all infrastructure required to support development of the community, as we have for many years; however, the recent legislative changes to the Development Charges Act through Bill 23 will create significant challenges to ensure the City has adequate funding to build the required infrastructure in a timely manner.\nThe proposed policies of the PPS will fundamentally change the way land use planning is conducted in Ontario.  The draft PPS eliminates many provincial planning objectives that have been in place since 2006 (inception of the Growth Plan).  This will impact staff recommendations on development planning applications and policy projects such as the Official Plan review.  Some of the main changes include:\n-\tElimination of provincial population and employment forecasts \u2013 lower tier municipalities (Cambridge) will be required to prepare their own population and employment forecasts to accommodate growth. Currently this is completed by the Region through a municipal comprehensive review process which includes the allocation of population and employment growth to individual area municipalities.\n-\tSettlement boundary expansions \u2013  draft PPS permits urban expansions at any time, including at the request of a private landowner.  The City may be under pressure to expand municipal infrastructure to service areas not intended for development.\n-\tElimination of Intensification and Density targets \u2013 draft PPS no longer contains provincial intensification and greenfield density targets \u2013 municipalities will be required to determine their own requirements.\n-\tAgricultural severances \u2013 draft PPS proposes to permit up to three severances of an existing agricultural lot.  Current Official Plan policies prohibit this.\n",

I am now at retirement age and have aquired a wealth of knowledge that I have shared with all of my grown children. To me, it would make perfect sense that I should be able to sever a small lot from my farm and pass it on to one of my children so that they could keep on living where they have grown up and would love to raise their own family, right here on our family farm. From what I have seen in my life and through personal experience, children who have been able to stay on home-farm properties tend to be hardworking, reliable taxpayers, good stewarts of agricultural lands, supportive to their parents allowing them to stay active in the farming community and out of retirement and nursing homes for decades longer than would be otherwise, and tend to settle in for the long term raising their families on the same ground that they were raised on with plans for their own children to do the same. As it is now they have to move far away to an area where real estate is cheaper and more affordable, leaving our aging generation to fend for ourselves. And worse yet with current real estate valuations at such high values, some of my grown children have no opportunity to even enter the housing market. To build on a reasonably priced lot would open the door to owning a home that otherwise would only be a dream. Perhaps if the current plan to sever 3 lots per farm is found to be excessive, why not plan to allow for 2 lots per farm or even 1 lot per farm. One or two lots severed from my farm would impact our production very little, these lots would undoubtedly grow gardens with fresh fruits and vegetables lessening our depedence on store bought foods, children would help aging parents stay out of long term care facilities and remain productive members of our farming communities, and municipalities would increase their tax base with added tax paying residents. I here by support the Ford government in their proposal to promote and encourage rural lot creation on agricultural land.       Thank-you\n",

        "comment":"Few more comments in support of land severance of non-prime-agricultural land within agricultural areas for residential use\nRedevelopment of Non-Agricultural Land: Identifying and repurposing non-agricultural land within agricultural areas for residential use can help avoid encroachment on productive farmland. This approach maximizes land use efficiency and preserves valuable agricultural resources.\nNon-agricultural land within agricultural areas often has existing infrastructure, such as roads, utilities, and access to services. Redeveloping this land for housing takes advantage of the already-established infrastructure, reducing the need for costly and environmentally impactful expansion into undeveloped areas.\nTransitioning to Non-Farm Family Members: In cases where non-farm family members have ownership stakes in the agricultural property, redeveloping non-agricultural land for residential use allows for a fair division of assets. It provides an opportunity for non-farming family members to receive their share of the property's value while maintaining the farm's integrity.\nOff-Farm Housing for Farm Workers: Redevelopment can also address the housing needs of farm workers. By creating residential units on non-agricultural land, farmers can provide on-site housing for their employees, improving their quality of life and promoting stable employment relationships.\nRetirement and Income Generation: For farmers planning their retirement, the redevelopment of non-agricultural land can provide an opportunity to generate income. By converting a portion of their property into residential units, farmers can diversify their revenue streams and secure their financial future.\nAgritourism and Farm Diversification: If the non-agricultural land is suitable, farmers can consider incorporating agritourism activities into the residential development. This could include features such as farm stays, farm-to-table experiences, or educational programs. Agritourism can help generate additional income while promoting a connection between residents and the farming operation.\nCollaborative Farming Models: Redevelopment of non-agricultural land can provide opportunities for collaborative farming models. Farmers can consider forming partnerships or cooperatives to collectively manage agricultural operations on the remaining farmland. This can help share costs, resources, and expertise, ensuring the continued viability of the farming enterprise.\nTransitioning to Value-Added Agricultural Activities: The income generated from residential development can be reinvested in value-added agricultural activities. Farmers can explore diversifying their operations by establishing farm stands, food processing facilities, or agronomic ventures. This transition can enhance profitability and create new markets for farm products.\n",

        "comment":"Here are also a few comments on the benefits of lot creation on non-agricultural land within agricultural areas for residential use as it relates to farm and estate planning with regards to severing off a lot or the current main dwelling.\nPersonal Connection: Retiring on the farm allows farmers to remain close to the land they have worked on for years, preserving the emotional and personal connection they have with their farming heritage. It can provide a sense of continuity and comfort during the transition to retirement.\nLifestyle Convenience: Severing off the existing home for retirement living provides convenience and familiarity. Retiring farmers can continue to enjoy the comforts of their established home, with all the amenities and infrastructure already in place, such as access to utilities, roads, and other services.\nFinancial Benefits: Retaining ownership of the existing home on the farm can offer financial benefits. It eliminates the need to purchase or rent a new residence, potentially freeing up capital for retirement savings or other purposes. It also allows farmers to maintain control over their living expenses, such as property taxes and mortgage payments.\nEase of Transition: Transitioning to retirement can be emotionally challenging for farmers who have spent their lives working on the farm. Retiring in the existing home on the property can make the transition smoother and provide a sense of familiarity and comfort during this life stage.\nLifestyle Flexibility: Retiring on the farm offers lifestyle flexibility. Farmers can continue to engage in certain agricultural activities or pursue hobbies and interests related to farming, on a smaller scale and at their own pace. This flexibility can contribute to a fulfilling retirement experience.\nFamily Considerations: Retiring on the farm can also accommodate family considerations. If family members are involved in the farming operation or live nearby, maintaining the existing home can allow for continued family connections and support, facilitating multigenerational interaction and involvement.\nEstate Planning and Succession: Retaining the existing home as part of the retirement plan can simplify estate planning and farm succession. It allows for a clear division between the farm's residential and agricultural components, making it easier to pass on ownership or management of the farming operation to the next generation.\nThank you!\n",

        "comment":"Further regarding estate planning and succession, becomes even more significant when considering non-farming children in the context of retiring on the farm. Here are some additional considerations to keep in mind:\nFair Distribution of Assets: Severing off the existing home for retirement living allows for a fair distribution of assets among farming and non-farming children. Non-farming children can receive their share of the property value through other assets or financial arrangements, while the farming child can continue to manage and operate the agricultural portion of the farm.\nFinancial Stability for Non-Farming Children: Retaining the existing home on the farm can provide financial stability for non-farming children. They may choose to live in the home, rent it out for income, or sell it to secure their financial future. It offers them a tangible asset that can contribute to their own retirement plans or other financial goals.\nCollaboration and Cooperation: Retiring on the farm while involving non-farming children can promote collaboration and cooperation among family members. By including them in the decision-making process and allowing them to be part of the farm's ongoing activities, a sense of family unity and shared responsibility can be fostered.\nIncome-Generating Opportunities: The existing home can be seen as an income-generating asset for non-farming children. They may choose to rent it out as a source of passive income, convert it into a bed and breakfast, or explore other entrepreneurial ventures that align with local regulations and market demand. This can provide non-farming children with financial independence and opportunities for business ownership.\nLong-Term Family Connections: Retaining the existing home on the farm allows for continued family connections and intergenerational relationships. Non-farming children can visit or stay on the property, maintaining a connection to their agricultural heritage and fostering a sense of family unity across generations.\nFuture Flexibility and Options: The existing home provides flexibility for non-farming children to decide their long-term plans. They can choose to maintain the property, sell it at a later date, or pass it on to their own children. This flexibility ensures that non-farming children have options to adapt to changing circumstances or personal preferences in the future.\nCommunication and Transparent Planning: Open communication and transparent planning are crucial when considering the involvement of non-farming children in the retirement and succession process. Clearly articulating the intentions and expectations, involving all relevant parties in discussions, and seeking professional advice can help mitigate potential conflicts and ensure a smooth transition.\n",

        "comment":"With respect to the changes to the growth management policies the County has concerns that the removal of the comprehensive review process will lead to ad hoc and inconsistent approaches as to how urban expansions are approached across the Province.  While some flexibly is warranted to address variations in regional contexts and growth levels, a consistent province-wide approach to urban boundary expansions creates certainty for local and county councils, as well as the development industry, as to how expansions will be evaluated.  It further places undue pressure on councils to develop and enforce these policies alone.  While the County supports greater flexibility in the preparation of comprehensive reviews, we believe that the Province has an important role to play in establishing a consistent approach to managing growth.\nWith respect to new residential lot creation policies in the agricultural area, the County was happy to hear of your office\u2019s decision to reconsider the proposed changes.  The County has significant concerns with the proposed policies and their implications on farm operators, economic development, the potential loss of agricultural land, the general conflict with provincial and local goals to direct growth to settlement areas, and the administrative requirements to implement the proposed policy.  As well as the removal of any discretion for councils to determine whether such a policy is appropriate for a given municipality.\n",

        "comment":"I\u2019m concerned that the proposed legislation will make it more difficult for communities to preserve their heritage buildings by eliminating or weakening existing protections like municipal heritage registries. Heritage buildings are irreplaceable assets that add great value to communities throughout the province. People tend to gravitate towards places with a lot of well-maintained heritage buildings, which means increased cultural and economic vitality, more money spent at local businesses and attractions, and a greater sense of communal identity.\nHeritage buildings make our province\u2019s rich history apparent to everyone who observes them, including the many who have no time or interest to read history books.

        "comment":"I agree that protection for a Provincially Significant Employment Zone is needed.\nThe Lake Erie Industrial Park, located in Haldimand County, currently contains several businesses which support employment for Haldimand County and surrounding areas, most immediately, Norfolk County.\nStelco Lake Erie Works is the largest employer in the park. Other businesses in the park are Imperial Oil, an asphalt plant, a soil regeneration operation, Air Products, a potential hydrogen plant, and they all provide jobs.\nThe businesses in the industrial part, in particular Stelco Lake Erie Works, also support other important businesses, such as trucking, and of course, all of these operations provide employment directly. In addition, many of these employees live locally or in surrounding areas and support many smaller businesses.\nThe Lake Erie Industrial Park certainly meets the requirement under this proposal that the industrial use is unsuitable for mixed use areas (i.e. steel manufacturing and houses) and that the park itself with Stelco and the other operations in the park create a provincially significant employment zone. A current proposal to significantly reduce the provincially determined buffer zone around the park to allow a new housing development for 40,000 people next to this heavy industry would threaten this important employment.\nPlease retain the current industrial zone designation on these lands and protect them as a Provincially Significant Employment Zone.

This would enable hamlet growth using physical constraints brought-in by the 407 creating natural de facto hamlet boundaries.\nIn 2016, some municipalities (Clarington), completed and passed, all the public consultations and official plan amendments to round-out hamlets but were delayed in regional bureaucracy for so long that the Provincial 2017 Greenbelt Plan came into effect without including the rounding-out of hamlets making the process a waste of tax payers\u2019 money and resources.  This left green belt farmers adjacent to Hwy 407 with financially unviable lands in zoning limbo.\nAllowing the rounding-out of hamlets adjacent to the 407 in the green belt plan, and the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement would permit farmers whose lands were significantly truncated because of the 407, to expand the hamlet to the physical boundary of the 407, rounding-out the Hamlets\u2019 residential zoning for much needed housing that would also be close to a major highway.\n",

        "comment":"The Province has presented a proposed Provincial Planning Statement for review and comment, which is intended to replace the existing Provincial Policy Statement and A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe. The proposed policy document includes a vision which establishes an intention to support building more homes. However, the Policy Statement has removed minimum density targets, relaxed processes, and requirements for settlement area expansions, and reduces protections for prime agricultural lands, including those lands identified specialty crop area.\nDespite the draft policy document being incomplete, with natural heritage policies still being considered by the Province, the implementation plan indicates fall 2023 for the policies to take effect.\nStaff have concerns that the proposed policies are not adequate to guide appropriate development and land use planning in the Province, do not address the housing crisis, and will lead to development patterns that are unsustainable and will have detrimental effects in the long term.\nRelationship to Strategic Plan\nProvincial policy documents, including the Provincial Policy Statement and A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, which are the subject of this report, provide the framework and guidance for creation of growth and development policies at the local level. The Province\u2019s proposal to change these policy documents will necessitate changes to the City\u2019s planning documents (the Official Plan and Zoning By-law) and adversely impact the City\u2019s long-term strategy towards a dynamic, innovative, sustainable and livable community, including provision for economic prosperity, diversity, social well-being, environmental stewardship and organization excellence.\nBackground\nIn Fall 2022, the Province posted a notice to the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO) indicating intention to review and combine the Provincial Policy Statement (Policy Statement) and A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Growth Plan) to create a streamlined province-wide land use planning policy framework. The proposed Provincial Planning Statement (Planning Statement), which would replace the existing Policy Statement and Growth Plan, is another step in the Province\u2019s plan to address housing supply in Ontario. The Planning Statement was posted for review (ERO number 019-6813) on April 6, 2023, with the commenting period closing June 5, 2023.\nReport\nCurrent Policy Framework\nLand use planning in Ontario functions within a hierarchy of provincial, regional, and local policies and plans (Appendix 1). Regional and local policy is informed by and must be consistent with provincial policies. The Policy Statement and Growth Plan are key provincial planning documents that guide growth, development, and land use planning in the Province of Ontario.\nThe Policy Statement establishes the policy foundation for development and use of land within the Province. The Policy Statement directs appropriate development, protection of resources, public health and safety and enhancement of the natural and built environment.\nThe Growth Plan designates the boundaries of the City\u2019s Urban Area and establishes policies and direction for the accommodation of growth. It sets out policies encouraging compact, service efficient development, infill and intensification, mixed use, and transit supportive intensification growth corridors and nodes. The Growth Plan establishes minimum housing and employment density targets that must be planned for in the local Official Plan.\nProposed Provincial Planning Statement (Planning Statement)\nThe proposed Planning Statement is a significant shift from the current policy framework. The proposal would result in the revocation of the Growth Plan, one of four existing provincial land use plans, and a plan which establishes policies directing growth, development, and land use within the Greater Golden Horseshoe, one of the fastest growing regions in North America. Rather than a planning document addressing growth in a specific region, the proposed approach involves incorporating some of the policies from the Growth Plan in the proposed Planning Statement, which would apply province wide.\nVision and Objectives\nThe proposal indicates the Planning Statement incorporates policies captured under the following five pillars:\n1.\tGenerate an appropriate housing supply\n2.\tMake land available for development\n3.\tProvide infrastructure to support development\n4.\tBalance housing with resources\n5.\tImplementation\nAbsent from the stated pillars of the proposed streamlined policy framework is any mention of affordability, public health and well-being, climate change adaptation or sustainability. These are of particular interest and concern when the City, along with numerous municipalities in the Province, has declared both a Climate Emergency (2019) and more recently, a Mental Health, Homelessness and Addiction Crisis (April, 2023).\nHousing and Growth\nThe Planning Statement proposes to eliminate minimum density and intensification targets for cities. Instead, local planning authorities are to conduct their own growth forecasting, establish growth targets and have enough land designated in the Official Plan to meet projected needs for at least 25 years. Staff are not concerned with the extension of the time horizon, from the existing requirement of up to 25 years. However, the removal of provincially established growth targets is of concern, as it will lead to variation and inconsistencies in the approach to and accommodation of growth in the Province. The changes could allow valuable land resources to be squandered for low-density, inefficient development patterns in some municipalities that may be resistant to change and the need to use land more efficiently.\nThe Planning Statement indicates any development potential resulting from a Minister\u2019s Zoning Order (MZO) shall be in addition to the projected needs for the planning horizon, established in the official plan. The additional growth is to be incorporated into the official plan at the time of the local planning authority\u2019s next official plan update, however until the update occurs, any resulting development potential would not be considered to contribute to the municipal accommodation of growth. This approach has the potential to skew local growth metrics and create confusion on the progress of the municipality towards accommodating projected growth.\nThe Planning Statement has identified a list of large and fast-growing municipalities, which includes the City of St. Catharines. Large and fast-growing municipalities will be required to identify and focus growth and development in strategic growth areas and identify an appropriate minimum density target. However, density targets for strategic growth areas have been removed from the policies and no policy guidance or direction has been provided in their place. Again, this will lead to inconsistencies and variation in the approach to accommodation of growth in the Province.\nWithout policy and direction from the Province establishing appropriate minimum densities, each local planning authority will be left to undertake significant study and evaluation independently, which is likely to be inconsistent with approaches and outcomes in other areas. Without provincial guidance on growth targets, growth and development will be disproportionate, will create conflicts at municipal boundaries, and compromise achieving the Province\u2019s vision of providing a sufficient supply of housing.\nSettlement Areas\nThe Planning Statement proposes less stringent tests for identification of new settlement areas or allowing a settlement area boundary expansion and would no longer require a municipal comprehensive review for their consideration. As such, they can be considered at any time, and will result in increased pressure on local planning authorities to consider expansions, perhaps most concerningly, without the requirement to evaluate the need or the availability of suitable alternatives. In addition, the policy outlining the considerations for establishment of a settlement area or boundary expansion uses supportive language \u201cshould\u201d rather than the stronger term of \u201cshall\u201d. This will further increase pressures for growth beyond existing settlement area boundaries by weakening the criteria. Of significant concern is the removal of policies that prohibit settlement areas and boundary expansions into specialty crop areas and the natural heritage system (identified in the Greenbelt Plan). These prohibitions exist within the Policy Statement and Growth Plan today. The lack of protection for prime agricultural lands, including speciality crop, as well as natural heritage features, will threaten agricultural lands, resulting in adverse impacts on the agricultural economy and the potential proliferation of sprawling, unsustainable land use patterns.\nEmployment Areas\nIn addition to removing growth targets, the Planning Statement proposes to eliminate employment targets and to no longer require a municipal comprehensive review to consider removal of lands from an employment area. The Planning Statement proposes a new definition of employment areas, which places more focus on uses that cannot locate in other zones, such as heavy industrial, manufacturing, and warehousing. Retail and office uses would now be prohibited in an employment area, unless associated with the primary employment use. Similar to the approach with settlement areas and boundary expansions, the removal of the municipal comprehensive review will mean that conversion or removal of land from the employment area can occur at any time.\nThe policies for major office and major institutional are proposed to now include supportive language \u201cshould\u201d rather than the stronger term \u201cwill\u201d. Where the policies currently require that major office and major institutional uses will be directed to urban growth centres, major transit station areas or other strategic growth areas, the proposed policies state these uses should be directed to major transit station areas or other strategic growth centres. This could lead to more employment sprawl, in addition to housing sprawl.\nNatural Heritage\nThe Planning Statement posted for review does not include any natural heritage policies. Within the section of the document intended to address natural heritage, it is noted that the policies and associated definitions remain under consideration by the Province. The document indicates the proposed policies will be made available for review and comment under a separate ERO posting, however no anticipated date or timeline has been provided.\nThe absence of these policies from the published draft presents a challenge for review, as the policy document clearly states that the document is to be read in its entirety. The exclusion of these policies limits the ability for staff to review, interpret, and communicate a complete set of comments to Council, the public or the Province, when an entire section of policy is absent.\nAgriculture\nThe Planning Statement also proposes a significant change within prime agricultural areas (outside of specialty crop areas), where up to three new residential lots may be created from a parcel of land that existed on January 1, 2023. There are criteria that need to be achieved for the lots to be created, but the policy prevents local planning authorities from establishing more restrictive provisions than those outlined in the Planning Statement, except to address public health or safety concerns. The introduction of new residential lots in prime agricultural areas will affect the ability of farms to expand their operations, as they will have to maintain minimum distance separation from adjacent residential dwellings. Policies that have discouraged residential lot creation within prime agricultural were implemented to protect agricultural land for agricultural uses. This change in policy direction reduces those protections and will result in significant impacts to the agricultural industry.\nHeritage\nThe Policy Statement requires that significant built heritage resources and cultural heritage landscapes be conserved, which could refer to properties that are listed or designated under the Ontario Heritage Act. The Planning Statement proposes use of the term \u201cprotected\u201d in place of \u201csignificant\u201d, referring to designated properties, properties with a heritage conservation easement, properties identified by the province, properties with known archaeological resources (covered under Part VI of the Ontario Heritage Act), properties protected under federal legislation and UNESCO World Heritage Sites. While the list of possible ways that a property may be considered \u201cprotected\u201d appears to have been expanded, it actually refers to far fewer properties than the Policy Statement. This is because of the omission of properties on Heritage Registers, which have not been designated. These properties will lose their status at the end of 2024 unless they are designated.\nAs such, in St. Catharines, the approximately 150 properties that are currently on the City\u2019s Heritage Register would not be covered by the language used by the proposed Planning Statement unless those properties are individually designated before 2024 or designated as part of the Downtown Heritage Conservation District Study that will begin in 2023.\nDefinitions\nThe Planning Statement includes amendments to various defined terms from both the Policy Statement and Growth Plan. The term \u201caffordable\u201d is currently defined in both the Policy Statement and Growth Plan. The proposed Planning Statement has removed the term in its entirety. Further, recent amendments to the Planning Act have made reference to both affordable and attainable dwelling units. The proposed Planning Statement does not include a definition for the term \u201cattainable\u201d.\nStaff are concerned that the amended definition of \u201chousing options\u201d introduces housing for identified individuals, which may violate human rights and contradict the long-accepted understanding that land use planning is intended to establish how land may be used and not who can use it. For example, the amended definition expands on housing arrangements and is proposed to include student housing, multi-generational housing, and culturally appropriate housing, amongst others. While staff are supportive of providing housing for all, the inclusion of language that identifies specific individuals or groups could be implemented contrary to the spirit and intent and misused to exclude specified individuals or groups from access to residential units.\nThere are also various environmental terms, such as \u201cthreatened species\u201d, \u201cvalleylands\u201d, \u201cwetlands\u201d, \u201cwoodlands\u201d, and \u201cwildlife habitat\u201d, and many others that are not included in the list of defined terms but are currently defined in the Policy Statement and \/ or Growth Plan. As the natural heritage policies and definitions have not yet been released for review, it is unclear if all of these definitions will be published at that time or if they are proposed to be removed as defined terms in the Planning Statement.\nImplementation\nAs part of the ERO post (019-6813), the Province has included a document outlining an approach to implementation of the proposed Planning Statement. The document indicates a plan to release final policies for a brief review period, allowing for planning authorities to understand the new policies and plan for implementation before the policies take effect, which is anticipated for fall 2023.\nThe proposed implementation strategy indicates planning authorities can continue to update their official plans on their ordinary review cycle (every five years, in accordance with the Planning Act, or ten years after a new OP), to implement the new policies. The City has not completed a review of the Official Plan since its adoption in 2012 and is due to conduct the required 10-year review, in accordance with the Planning Act. With the anticipated introduction of new provincial policy, as well as the recent approval of the Niagara Region Official Plan (November 2022), review of the Garden City Plan should be anticipated as part of the 2024 work plan.\nWhile local planning authorities may continue to update their official plans on their ordinary review cycle, the Province has noted that time sensitive official plan amendments will be required to align with the new definition of \u201cArea of Employment\u201d. These official plan amendments will be required to authorize site specific permission for any existing uses that do not align with the new definition (if approved). This will trigger review of employment sites within the City and preparation of an Official Plan Amendment, if necessary, prior to the Planning Statement taking effect (targeted fall 2023). This official plan amendment was not anticipated as part of the 2023 work plan and will cause delays for other projects.\nAs the proposed Planning Statement would replace the existing Policy Statement and Growth Plan, the implementation document indicates that the Growth Plan may be revoked. The Province indicates that an amendment is being proposed to the Greenbelt Plan that would allow existing policies from the Growth Plan and Policy Statement to continue to apply in cases where the Greenbelt Plan refers to them. Staff are unclear how specific policies from these plans can continue once the documents have been revoked.\nThe proposed Planning Statement includes significant policy changes that will take time for local planning authorities to understand. The timeline for implementation is extremely limited and is anticipated to result in significant impact to local planning authority work plans and staff resources.\nFinancial Implications\nThere are no financial implications associated with this report. However, it should be noted that the policy direction proposed by the Province creates opportunity for increased sprawl which is a more costly, unsustainable form of development, which will result in long term financial implications for the City, Region, and Province.\nEnvironmental Sustainability Implications\nThere are no environmental sustainability implications associated with this report. However, as the proposed natural heritage policies have not yet been published for review, any potential impacts resulting from those policies are not yet known.\nIt should also be noted that the proposed policies weaken protections for prime agricultural lands, and create opportunities for new and expanded settlement areas, including within lands identified as specialty crop area. If the proposed Planning Statement is approved as proposed, there will be significant and generational impact to where and how growth occurs, resulting in increased sprawl, loss of agricultural lands, and settlement patterns that are not sustainable.\nOperational Implications\nThere are no operational implications associated with this report.\nConclusion\nThe City has declared both a climate emergency and a mental health, homelessness and addictions crisis. These, along with housing availability and affordability challenges, are being experienced within the City, Region, and Province. Land use planning plays a critical role in determining how a community functions, grows, and supports its citizens. Provincial land use policy establishes the vision and goals for land use planning in the province, as all regional and local planning policy must be consistent with provincial policy. As a provincial planning policy document, the proposed Planning Statement is an important tool that determines how we use, develop, protect, and enjoy land for decades to come. The policies outlined in the proposed Planning Statement fail to provide the strong foundation required to address the significant challenges facing our community and communities throughout the province.\nThe proposed Planning Statement eliminates growth targets and places the responsibility on municipalities to establish their own growth targets. Not only does this result in a loss in guidance for municipalities, but it will result in a loss in overall vision, direction, and consistency within the Province as a whole. With such an emphasis on increased housing supply and the importance of providing housing for all, eliminating minimum growth and density targets is inconsistent with the intention of the Planning Statement.\nThe Planning Statement proposes amendments that deviate from best practices, weakening support for growth and intensification within existing built-up areas, eliminating protections of agricultural lands, and creating opportunities for inconsistencies in accommodating and planning for growth.\nThe Province has an opportunity to review, amend, and implement policies to address the many significant challenges facing our communities. The proposed Planning Statement will create additional challenges for local planning authorities and result in long term negative impacts for our community and environment.\n",

It is very obvious the government is supporting developers without any concern for the environment whatsoever. Mentioning that you are finding land to \"replace\" what is taken is not true since the majority of the replacement areas were already designated by municipalities as areas that cannot be developed.\nI live in a condo with a serious concentration of population to minimize environmental impact. I also grew up on a farm that thankfully still exists, however city growth is only 3km away. Will the next generation have any land left for food production without very careful and concentrated growth?\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed Provincial Planning Statement . The Town of Halton Hills\u2019 comments are attached and summarized below.\nSummary of Key Concerns:\n\u2022\tKey comments that staff wish to highlight regarding the sweeping changes proposed through Bill 97 and the proposed Provincial Planning Statement include the following:\n\u2022\tOverall, the changes proposed through the draft Provincial Planning Statement and Bill 97 appear to be heading back to the planning regime as it existed prior to introduction of the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe in 2006, wherein there were limited growth management targets and requirements for the municipalities within the GGH.\n\u2022\tWith respect to Site Plan Control for 10 or fewer units, staff believe that the regulations should be extended more broadly to apply to all parcels proposed for multi-unit residential developments, to ensure that health, safety and accessibility considerations are addressed.\n\u2022\tStaff does not support the proposed change to allow for appeals to an Interim Control By-law at the time of initial passing rather than only at the time of extension as this creates an unnecessary burden on municipalities and the OLT and increases the possibility that land uses that are contrary to the public interest are established.\n\u2022\tStaff have significant concerns with the proposed changes regarding Employment Areas. Staff believe that prohibiting institutional and commercial uses is not in keeping with the proposed PPS goal of supporting a modern economy, and that it will require that employment areas in the Town, such as the Premier Gateway Employment Area, to be stripped of existing institutional and commercial land use permissions.\n\u2022\tStaff have concerns that overarching growth forecasts post 2051 will no longer be prepared by the Province, requiring individual municipalities to ultimately carry out population and employment forecasting on their own. This creates considerable uncertainty for local municipalities regarding the preparation of longer-term growth forecasts.\n\u2022\tWith respect to settlement area boundary expansions, the proposed changes are of concern to staff. Allowing applications for urban boundary expansion at any time will create a lack of stability with respect to a municipality\u2019s urban boundary and in the case of Halton Hills, given the extent of lands approved for future growth to 2051, this policy provision could lead to premature applications to expand the Town\u2019s urban boundary.\n\u2022\tStaff are of the opinion that the proposed changes related to development within prime agricultural areas are significant and could have long term implications to the Town\u2019s agricultural land base.\n\u2022\tStaff have significant concerns with the proposed change to allow new applications for rural lot subdivisions outside of settlement areas.\n\u2022\tStaff have significant concerns with the removal of the definition and references to \u201caffordable housing\u201d from the proposed PPS and strongly recommends that the Province re-introduce the existing definition, policy framework and requirements with respect to affordable housing in Ontario.\n\u2022\tAs it relates to the climate change policies of the draft PPS, staff recommend that the existing Growth Plan and PPS 2020 policies regarding climate change remain.\nTransportation\n\u2022\tStaff question the removal of the term \u201cpersons with disabilities\u201d through the document. It is important to recognize that the term \u2018persons with disabilities\u2019 is used in the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act and the Planning Act. Many of the Town\u2019s transportation infrastructure is based on providing accessibility for \u201cpersons with disabilities\u201d. Staff suggest that the term continue to be used in the new PPS to ensure alignment with the AODA.\n\u2022\tStaff disagree with the removal of section 2.1.4 (g). It is crucial for the Town that the necessary infrastructure and public service facilities are\/ will be available to meet current and projected needs. This is an important component when planning any type of housing. Town staff request to keep this policy in the new PPS.\n\u2022\tIt is vital to recognize the importance of transit to support complete communities and high-density areas. Staff disagree with the removal of \u201cand transit in areas where it exists or is to be developed\u201d and recommend including \u201cand transit as appropriate\u201d at the end of Section 2.2.(C).\n\u2022\tTown staff support the proposed amendment under Section 2.4.2 which allows municipalities that are not in the list of Fast and Growing Municipalities to continue to delineate MTSA boundaries and establish minimum density targets.\nWater\/wastewater infrastructure\n\u2022\tStaff understand that Section 3.6.1 b) is consistent with the new Complete Linear Infrastructure Environment Compliance Approval (CLI ECA) process. However, with the removal of site plan control requirements for most projects with fewer than 10 residential units, there are no tools to ensure that these requirements are met for those types of proposals. Staff recommends that consideration is given to incorporating appropriate tools for municipalities to ensure that these requirements are met for all development proposals.\n\u2022\tIt is anticipated that the Town will not be able to implement Source Water Protection policies as per Section 3.6.1 f) when dealing with as-of-right developments i.e., up to two additional residential units or fewer than ten residential units which are exempted from Site Plan Control. A different mechanism to implement these policies, e.g., through the OBC, is potentially needed. In addition, the Region of Halton is currently responsible for implementing source water protection with the exemption of the implementation of salt management plan and water balance. Neither of these processes are considered under a building permit.\n\u2022\tQuestions remain on the role of the Region in administering some of these processes i.e. Source Water Protection, Communal sewer systems, etc. if the role of the Region is to be transferred to the Town, additional resources such as technical expertise will be required in order to meet the Provincial requirements in the new PPS.\n\u2022\tClarification is required regarding policy 3.6.8. Particularly Policy 3.6.8 g) indicates that planning for stormwater management shall align with any comprehensive municipal plans for stormwater management that consider cumulative impacts to stormwater from development on a watershed scale. Additional information is required to assess what is excepted from the local municipalities to satisfy this requirement.\n",

The remaining three acres is not viable agricultural land to produce anything and it never has been farmed, as per our planning consultant this three acre portion of our property located directly at the road is mis-designated and we\u2019ve been trying very hard to work in partnership with the municipality to re-zone it and severe off the three acres to be able to build another modest sized family dwelling so another family can enjoy the beautiful nature surroundings that we have. We\u2019ve been working with the Grand River Conservation authority since we bought the land and built our home to re-naturalize and re-vitalize the ninety two acres of environmentally protected conversation land by planting over 1200 trees and working with them to plan natural wetland space with all of that  done in less than a year all of which was done on our own initiative. Our municipality officials are making it extremely difficult for us to be able to do this even though it is very clear from seeing our property and where the proposed land to be severed is situated that there is no way it can be farmed. We\u2019ve received resistance and push back at every every step. We\u2019ve hired a planning consultant who\u2019s told us that the land is clearly not agricultural and that the land doesn\u2019t even meet the current policies definition. Despite this, the municipality is still unwilling to even consider our proposal. Land is not infinite, we rely on our government officials to make sure that our land is used responsibly whether the case may be for agricultural, conservation or housing.

I currently live a distance from the farm and somewhat neglect the farm.  By living there I can improve the farm and the land.  You are giving farmers a choice.  They do not have to server the farm land if they don\u2019t want and they can continue as the current state.  I have farm land and some areas I cannot get tractors in the area so I cannot farm it so this would be a great place to build a house.  Disrupts nothing.  Furthermore, I feel that if the land has city water rights then what is the harm in making 3 lots.  Please reconsider your policy and allow the severances as I heard this policy may be thrown out.    It is the only way farming will last and be sustainable.  Consider all the stake holders not just a few.  Once again please reconsider your policy and allow three severances on farm land especially if there is municipal water rights.   It is time to move forward and not backwards.

It is an opportunity for us to become land owners\/workers, something that in today's housing market we cannot afford to do. I hear the concerns farmers have with Bill 97, and I agree with them, but I also do not feel like allowing up to 3 houses to be built on a farm is enough. My husband and I cannot afford to take the risk of investing\/building our own house on land that we do not own. For various legal reasons and issues that can arise, we are not comfortable with this. I know Bill 97 was originally designed to meet this very concern, but I think the solution instead of eliminating it completely is to put regulations onto a severance (not 3).\nIt does feel frustrating that currently my family has land that they could give us (at a time where we can't afford to buy it) but that this isn't currently an option. Where we would build on the farm is area that has not been used actively for farming in over 30 years, so the impact to currently farmed land would be very minimal.\nI hope a solution where both sides can agree comes quickly.

A recent report by UofGuelph and RBC shows that about 40% of farmers are set to retire in the next 10 years.\nWhile farm land adjacent to cities and towns is being gobbled up, farms farther out have no housing for new farmers or aging farmers.\nWe don't want to sever lots from our farm.  We want good building code and policy that encourages zero impact attainable beautiful housing on the farm.\nBeautifully designed, smart, modular co-housing designed to LEED standards  can create little communities of families, caregivers, new farmers, elderly.  They will get expertise and support to manage these delicate lands with food forests, permaculture design, and regenerative agriculture methods.\nBut we must be very careful that in the pursuit of supplying housing on farms that we do not allow estate homes or sprawling subdivisions to address this need. We need innovative solutions.\nCO-Housing is one option that allows a greater number of units to be constructed to address the issue of housing supply in rural areas. There are several models to look at, including Groundswell Co-housing in British Columbia that houses over 100 people in 35 units on 3-acres of land while preserving another 25 acres for farmland. This model has created a form of rural densification that addressed the need for housing while still protecting farmland, which provides the residents access to land to produce their own food.\nFarmers Wanted: The labour renewal Canada needs to build the Next Green Revolution, Royal Bank paper, April 2, 2023.\nThe Farm Succession Crisis, Ontario Farmland Trust,  https:\/\/ontariofarmlandtrust.ca\/2020\/08\/03\/the-farm-succession-crisis\/ excerpted May 25, 2023.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to submit a comment regarding Bill 97, specifically, the language allowing for three residential severances on farm lots. I previously submitted a comment expressing how giving small farmers the ability to sever small plots of land, particularly land which may  be unsuitable for farming, can help to improve agricultural infrastructure rather than hinder it. I am a younger farmer myself, and I can tell you from personal experience that I would not have been able to develop my current operation into an organic farm without being able to sell a surplus dwelling, which we were then able to reinvest into tiling our property. The small loss of an acre of land is minuscule when considering that we were able to convert 90 acres over to organic production.\nI have read in recent media reports that the Ontario government has succumbed to pressure from large farm lobbyists, such as the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, and backed down on this proposal. While I do understand and agree with many of the concerns raised by the OFA, I feel that the severance concerns mostly represent corporate farm operations and larger\/wealthier players who own 500+ acres of land. Based on an anecdotal sample of smaller farm owners I am connected with, all of them welcomed the idea of being able to make decisions to sever small amounts of property to leverage the remaining operation.\nWhile it is disappointing that the Ontario government has decided to back down on the severance changes, I am hoping that you are still working to find a middle ground that will help smaller farmers to leverage their properties as a way to improve their overall operations. In particular, it makes little sense that more than one dwelling can\u2019t exist on a 50 or 100 acre plot of farmland. Allowing more housing options will help with family succession planning: it would give smaller farm operations the ability to house their children, and therefore get them involved in the business. There\u2019s also the possibility of renting out such housing to those who wish to be more connected with rural and agricultural life, and perhaps even grow their own food. This will offer another income stream in a business where profit margins can be razor-thin. Of all the smaller farmers I know (those managing 200 acres or less), 100% of them have to work other jobs because farm revenues are not enough to be a full-time farmer. Therefore, other sources of revenue are essential.\nMoreover, in terms of environmental sustainability, consider this: it is currently permitted to build a ten-bedroom, five-bathroom, sprawling mansion that gobbles up five acres of farmland, simply because it is considered a \u201csingle-detached\u201d dwelling. However, it is currently not permitted to use two or three acres to build three single-detached dwellings that can house multiple families. This makes absolutely no sense, and it\u2019s time to take a common sense approach to how our properties are managed.\nIn summary, please do not back down on the proposal to allow farm operations multiple  detached or semi-detached dwellings on a property. If managed properly, this approach would actually be more sustainable than what is currently permitted, that being massive, sprawling, single-detached dwellings. Three or four dwellings all connected to the same septic system could easily fit into 1.5 to 2 acres of land. The benefits of allowing farmers to use their property in this way far outweigh the supposed losses speculated by lobbying groups, and will have the added benefit of helping to ease the housing crisis.\n",

We need to remind folks we do not build housing. When we look at these targets, they are strictly in the form of permitting. We\u2019re making a commitment to permit, not to build. We don\u2019t do construction, we don\u2019t do building. If developers don\u2019t come and ask for permits, we can\u2019t control that.\u201d\nThe city has approved 13,900 yet-to-be-developed units, Nuttall said.\nIt is time to listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets.\nThere is simply no need for proposed policy changes which would:\n- Eliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to rein in urban sprawl;\n- Allow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n- Force municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n- Exempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n- Remove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and\n- Weaken and eliminate policies intended to address climate change.\nOntario is losing farmland at the shocking rate of 319 acres per day. The proposed new policies will make matters much worse and spell disaster for the lands and waters that sustain us.\nSprawl development will not solve current housing needs, as your government pretends. I urge you to retain all PPS and Growth Plan policies that are designed to curb sprawl and protect farmland and natural areas.\n",

        "comment":"I am echoing the comments from the OFA (Ontario Federation of Agriculture) with my own personal commentary.\nAs a seventh generation farm family (and future farm operator) I understand that you are interested in hearing from farmers in Ontario to gauge our reaction to Bill 97 and the new proposed Provincial Planning Statement.\nI am writing to voice my opposition to the proposal to allow for the severing of three lots per farm parcel.\nThere are many good reasons why existing legislation restricts residential lot creation in agricultural areas. Allowing farmland severance will fragment and shrink a finite agricultural land base, increase conflicts between residential uses and farm operations, inflate farmland prices, and increase costs to municipalities.\nWhile there may be some farmers who welcome the opportunity to have their farm severed into lots, I feel this is a short-sighted approach.  We have a housing shortage in this province but severing farm parcels is not the way to balance that shortage. Building houses at the cost of impacting the ability of farmers to produce agricultural products is not a wise decision. Limiting lot creation protects farmland for farmers so they can continue to feed the towns, villages, and cities in the province.\nAdding a significant number of new lots with owners not familiar with farm, or even rural life, will make it more difficult for me to maintain good relations and to produce the food, fibre, and\/or fuel my neighbors need to live.\nI also support the current and future use of Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) standards to regulate development in rural areas.\nI am proud to be part of a farming family in Ontario with some of the best soil and growing conditions in North America.  All I ask is that the land still be here to produce agricultural products for a growing nation, to continue to protect the land and waterways, and for our children and grandchildren to have the choice to farm and to invest in their businesses.\nI respectfully ask that the government step back from its proposal to allow for the severing of farmland parcels in recognition of the current and future value and importance of agriculture to the province\u2019s economy, food security, and to ensuring vibrant rural communities. Our finite and irreplaceable farmland needs to be reserved to produce food, not to build houses.\nI feel that our way of life is at risk, and could not be recovered. The richness our lives and that of the entire province hangs in the balance. I ask you to please reconsider.\n",

Mandatory intensification would be eliminated; municipalities could expand settlement areas without ensuring the protection of natural areas. Lands subject to a MZO would no longer need to comply with official plans.\nAffordable housing is needed but there is already enough land set aside for development. The new policies, if enacted, would weaken smart growth. The proposed policies would obstruct the provincial goal of building along transit lines leading to even more need for new roads, car-dependency, and air pollution.\nThe new policies would not result in more affordable homes being built. The proposed policies would lead to more sprawl, less livable communities, fewer natural areas and many less well-off Ontario residents unable to find adequate places to live.\n",

        "comment":"SUPPORT for the Proposed Planning Statement (section 4.3)\nWe are owners of a small 50 acre farm in the Oro portion of Oro-Medonte Township and were happy about the original Proposed Planning Statement that provided the opportunity for us to potentially sever off three lots (section 4.3).\nThe plan for us was to allocate two of the lots to our two grown children and sell off the third to provide some income for us as we are now at retirement age.\nThis would have permitted us to \u201cage in place\u201d on the property that we have lived for the past 27 years. Prior to us taking over the farm, it belonged to my husband\u2019s father and grandfather before that, making us third generation on the farm. Our hope was that this would continue into the next generation and beyond.\nThe other benefits of the severance proposal include our children being able to enter the housing market with property and mortgages (to build a house) of their own, increasing housing supply, substantially increasing tax revenue for our township while having to offer minimal additional services, increasing a presence on our country road with the hopes of decreasing illegal dumping (yes, this is a weekly occurrence). There are so many additional benefits to the three lot severance!\nWe understand the potential downsides, which could include decreasing a small amount of farmland; the areas our three lots would be located are a combo of not great farmland combined with a dying bush (ash trees ravaged by the Emerald Ash beetle).\nIt\u2019s also understandable that some folks may not like hearing tractors or the dust or smells that go along with farming. I can assure you that there are many folks that would prefer that to living in a city so close to the noise and smells of neighbours!\nWhile there are some vocal farmers and farm associations that disagree with the proposal and presented a NIMBY argument recently, there are many of us less vocal farmers that are in support.  We have informally talked with our farming neighbours who see the benefits for the same reasons listed above. We have also watched our Oro-Medonte Council meetings where they expressed support.\nWe implore you to reconsider and to continue with the three lot severance option as this is the only way we will be able to keep our farm in our family. Prior to this proposal being released,  we were consulting with real estate agents to place our farm on the market to sell to the highest bidder, which could result in the land not being farmed at all going forward should a speculator or non-farmer purchase it.\nFurther, please consider consulting with the Mayor and Councillors of our township to hear their views on the three lot severance proposal, they too are hearing from farmers that are supportive.\nThank you for your consideration.\n",

Development here will not help create more housing, nor will it help with affordability. These lands are out at the edge of the countryside, with no infrastructure to service them. It would be ridiculous to build in these areas before we have used up the vacant land in our existing urban boundary.\nWaterloo Region has shown that we can build lots of housing fast, exceeding our housing targets and planning for even more. We don\u2019t need to sacrifice the countryside or expand our urban boundary to do that.\nSprawling neighbourhoods need services whereas inner city neighbourhoods services can be improved rather than building from the ground up. There are plenty of parking lots and vacant space that are not only seldom used but contribute to stress on wastewater management. Once good farmland and greenspaces get paved and torn up they are nearly impossible to restore.\nRemoving parking lots makes vehicular transit less accomodated. The harder it is to get services, and the more spread out neighbourhoods are the more we have to rely on cars. Let's improve our transit and preserve green space and increase housing density.\nPlease stop expanding housing for the benefit of investors. Affordable housing is not a commodity. Please. It's short-sighted. For future generations we need to be thoughtful. Building more doesn't actually lead to less demand. Improving what we have does. Let's be thoughtful about this.\n",

Other private lots available (with flexible zoning orders) through infill could accommodate more housing, without creating sprawl. We cannot sacrifice greenfield development to private interests over the interests of the community! This would be a step backward.\nWhile most of our vegetables are coming from the US, and these areas are facing drought conditions, when are we going to wake up and realize that preserving and developing domestic agriculture is not a priority?

It is especially concerning considering the increasing effects of Climate Change. These proposed policy changes take us, as a species, in the WRONG DIRECTION. The changes to what IS a well balanced Provincial Policy Statement, continue to be based on a political decision NOT ON SCIENCE. I'm a lifetime Ontarian and VERY saddened to see these politically driven and not needed changes. They are GREED driven and disregard our need to protect what's left of our environment, especially as we see the horrifying effects of Climate Change, that WILL get worse.\nRegarding the \"A Place To Grow\" plan.  It is totally NOT NEEDED, it is a waste of the taxpayers dollars and will result in putting people at risk who will, regretfully, build in flood plains, too close to our Great Lakes shorelines and on unstable slopes at serious risk. It will destroy our much needed farmlands, allow property severances on farms that will created incompatible uses resulting in many conflicts. It will speared the destruction of wetlands and back up the very BAD decisions that watered down the well established Ontario Wetland Evaluation System.

Farming is already incredibly difficult and not a job that people seek out, with climate change the risk of loosing crops is incredibly high, as well as the rising cost of everything making profitable farming even more difficult.\nMaking it more difficult for farmers to earn a living means they will give up, sell their land and try another profession.

        "comment":"June 5, 2023\nThe Honourable Steve Clark\nMinister of Municipal Affairs and Housing\nCollege Park 17th Floor\n777 Bay St.\nToronto, ON\nM7A 2J3\nDear Minister Clark,\nRe. ERO #019-6813 Replacement of the Provincial Policy Statement and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe\nOn behalf of the 62 undersigned organizations, we would like to express our strong opposition to the proposal to replace the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Growth Plan) with the new Provincial Planning Statement. The proposed changes would accelerate urban sprawl and the ongoing loss of farmland and natural areas in Ontario, especially in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, one of the largest and fastest growing regions in North America.\nThe government\u2019s underlying premise, that more land is needed for housing development outside existing settlement boundaries, is demonstrably false. Research has shown that there is more than enough land already designated for urban growth in southern Ontario to meet all housing needs until at least 2050.  Your ministry has provided no evidence to the contrary. In fact, the 2022 report of the government-appointed Housing Affordability Task Force clearly indicated that a shortage of land is not the cause of Ontario\u2019s housing shortage:\nLand is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (p. 10)\nThe proposed replacement of the PPS and the Growth Plan is deeply concerning, given that these key provincial policies provide comprehensive, integrated, balanced direction on land use planning. Instead, the proposed new Provincial Planning Statement would jeopardize decades of progress on land use policy with changes that would:\n\u2022\tEliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to rein in urban sprawl.\n\u2022\tRemove the requirement for municipalities to plan according to specific population and employment targets for a horizon year, thus eliminating a fundamental aspect of coordinated growth planning for Ontario.\n\u2022\tAllow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of associated infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas.\n\u2022\tRemove the policy for and definition of \u201caffordable\u201d housing, so that it would no longer be required to be built as part of residential developments.\n\u2022\tForce municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas.\n\u2022\tExempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans. For example, the Minister would have the power to apply an MZO for housing on lands not designated for housing and force the municipality to provide infrastructure and servicing for the development (paid for by taxpayers).\n\u2022\tWeaken the commitment to watershed planning and remove the requirement for municipalities to complete watershed plans prior to expanding urban boundaries.\n\u2022\tAllow aggregate operations on specialty crop lands (e.g., tender fruit, grape, Holland Marsh).\n\u2022\tWeaken and eliminate policies that address climate change. Growth Plan climate policies \u2013 for example, those focusing on achieving more compact, transit supportive design through increased intensification and denser greenfield development \u2013 would be abandoned in their entirety.\nThese are only some of the proposed changes that would fundamentally undermine smart growth and sustainable land use planning in Ontario. Others involve weakening rules and standards for water pipelines, employment areas and development along public transit lines.\nIn sum, we are deeply concerned that the government is abandoning its long-standing policy commitment to promote compact, transit-friendly development and prevent sprawl. Instead, it appears that the new policy thrust is to allow unfettered growth and scattered residential lots and subdivisions anytime and anywhere, including on prime agricultural land.\nThis approach spells disaster for the lands and waters that sustain us, especially in places that support high levels of biodiversity and at-risk species, such as southern Ontario. The approach would also fuel more farmland loss which is already occurring at the shocking average rate of 319 acres per day.\nWe urge you not to proceed with the proposed policy changes outlined above.\n",

        "comment":"I have real concerns re: the Provincial Policy Statement. I feel strongly that we should be building up, not out. Here are my reasons:\n1) Southern Ontario has some of the top class farmland in the world. We need to preserve it. Agricultural groups have been telling the provincial government that allowing 3 severances on a farm would eat up the land on which food crops are grown. Agriculture is currently facing so many challenges (including aging farmers, climate change, soil erosion, finding enough farm labour, etc.), they don't need the additional challenge of farm severances;\n2) \"Farmers Feed Cities.\" We, in Ontario, depend on farmers to grow the food we eat. I much prefer eating fresh locally produced food because I want to support my local farmers, thereby supporting the local economy. Farms need to remain intact. In Ontario, we lose over 300 acres of farmland each day. This is a bad trajectory. It can't continue.\n3) No one in Ontario would deny we need more housing, especially affordable housing. The current Provincial Policy Statement encourages sprawl. This is devastating for our farmland and forests. Build within urban areas. Intensify. Densify. This would cost much less because the infrastructure is already there. On the other hand, sprawl encourages bigger homes and the use of more space per home. We need to build compactly.\n4) We need to keep natural areas intact. Nature's natural systems keep our air and water clean. Trees keep our homes cool. All this saves billions of dollars each year.\n5) Keep our parks intact. We need these green spaces for leisure, relaxation, our mental health. Reducing the amount of money developers put toward parks is a mistake.\n6) Restore the important, vital work of the Conservation Authorities. They do much more than flood control.\n7) Learn from Indigenous Peoples who have lived within nature and the ecosystem for eons. We have much to learn from them. Live  within our (ecological) means.\n",

        "comment":"Minister Clark,\nThe National Farmers Union - Ontario (NFU-O) is an accredited farm organization representing thousands of sustainable farmers in Ontario and has advocated for farmers across Ontario and Canada since 1969. Members work together to achieve agricultural policies that ensure dignity and income security for farmers while protecting and enhancing rural environments for future generations. We believe in the importance of a healthy, viable, and sustainable supply of food products grown, harvested, and processed right here at home. The NFU-O is confident that long-term food system security for the people of Ontario, Canada, and the world is a shared priority for the general public and our governments.\nIt is encouraging that the Government is committed to working with Ontario\u2019s farming community to find solutions that support farm succession and access to farmland for new and young farmers without jeopardizing our finite agricultural land base or the current operation and expansion of agricultural businesses. We appreciate the extension to August 4, 2023 for submissions to be received from the agricultural community.\nThe NFU-O has the following recommendations based on the current version of the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement.\nSummary\nWe are requesting that the provincial government abandon the following policies in the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement:\n\u2022\tthe relaxation of settlement boundary expansion (2.3) into land currently used for agricultural purposes, including specialty crop areas; and\n\u2022\t \u201cLot Creation and Lot Adjustments\u201d (4.3.3) permitting the creation of up to 3 new residential lots in prime agricultural areas.\nInstead of adopting these proposals, we believe the provincial government should maintain the existing 2020 PPS lot creation policies. We also ask for any language within Bill 97 that enables the changes within the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement be removed.\nLot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nThe changes in the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement allowing for up to three severances of pre-existing farm plots is an attack on agriculture in Ontario. Farmers, farm organizations and commodity groups were not consulted on these proposed changes. The Proposed Provincial Planning Statement gives the impression that the current Ontario government cares little about its rural farming constituents or for the eaters and consumers who depend upon the agricultural products grown by the farmers in this province.\nResidential lot creation in agricultural areas has long been controversial and the detrimental impacts for agriculture are well demonstrated, including fragmentation of the agricultural land base, increased conflicts between neighbouring land uses, risk of inflating farmland prices and increasing costs to municipalities. In addition, we have significant concerns regarding the speculative investment that this proposal will drive, resulting in farmland values that make farming even more unattainable for the next generation. Any policies that might open land for speculative purchase and investment need to be discouraged.\nWith the average agricultural operator over 55 years old, the province is facing a serious shortage of farmers. Farmland severances within the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement will permanently discourage aspiring agriculturalists. Farm property values increased by almost 20% in 2022; carving up existing farmland for residential use will mean new and young farmers will have to compete with housing developers willing to pay more than quadruple the current exorbitant value of Ontario\u2019s finite farmland.\nThe negative implications of the proposed farmland lot severances go beyond squeezing current and aspiring farmers off the less than 5% of land in Ontario with prime agriculture soils. Servicing rural residential sprawl will burden municipalities and villages and lead to increased taxation. Finite ground water will be depleted to supply as many as 1.5 million new homes. Residential and farm land use conflicts are bound to increase, including complaints surrounding animal noises and smells, and the application of crop nutrition and crop protection products. Traffic congestion and speed limits will cause frustration along county roads.\nWe have already lost 20% of Ontario\u2019s farmland in the last 40 years\u2014with current farmland loss estimated by Statistics Canada to be occurring at a staggering 319 acres per day.\n4.3.3 in the proposed PPS will accelerate these trends, with rural planning experts forecasting that, should the approximately 170,000 farmland parcels in Ontario be rubber stamped for three one-acre lot severances, more than a half a million acres would be permanently removed from agricultural production. That amounts to the loss of yet another 5% of the total remaining productive farmland of the province.\nThe overall reduction of our finite farmland will be even higher when one takes into account the impact this rural residential sprawl will have on Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) requirements for livestock operations, squeezing out many livestock farmers in counties across the province. We support Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) and see it as a valuable tool to minimize conflicts between farm operations and residential areas with respect to livestock operations.\nSettlement Area Boundary Expansion\nLivestock farmers are not the only farmers whose livelihood is threatened by the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement. Under the proposal, planning authorities need only \u201cconsider\u201d not \u201cdemonstrate\u201d (as required under the current legislation) whether settlement area boundary expansions compromise specialty crop areas, potentially undermining the production of some of our most valuable agricultural commodities (2.3.4). We strongly recommend that the province maintain current 2020 PPS standards on specialty crop areas and prime agricultural lands as they enforce the minimum standards required to protect the environment, farmland, and public health and safety.\nAdditional Residential Units\nThe NFU-O does welcome the proposal to allow for up to two additional residential units on a pre-existing farm plot (4.3.2 Permitted Uses, #5 a.-d.). We believe this change will give farmers flexibility to provide housing for extended family or employees and will not\u2014unlike the proposed plan to sever farmland\u2014undermine or hinder agricultural operations. In fact, we believe allowing for additional residential units on existing farmland parcels makes 4.3.3, \u201cLot Creation and Lot Adjustments,\u201d entirely unnecessary, and recommend that 4.3.3 be removed, while maintaining 4.3.2 #5 a-d.\nNatural Heritage\nThe proposed PPS changes only hint at future changes to \u201cnatural heritage policies.\u201d The NFU-O is extremely concerned by the repercussions of farmland severances and the attendant residential sprawl will have on our sensitive wetlands, waterways, and natural heritage areas.\nFor a Sustainable and Affordable Housing Strategy\nThe NFU-O supports a housing strategy that incentivizes affordable housing construction in pre-existing settlement boundaries and that does not impinge on agricultural lands. The NFU-O does not believe that the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement and the broader reforms encompassed by Bill 23 and Bill 97 will encourage anything other than rural sprawl. Housing needs can be met in serviced settlement areas on a much smaller land base. This reduces farmland loss and potential land use conflicts while encouraging ongoing investment in farm and farm-related businesses. It also ensures efficient use of municipal infrastructure investments and reduces service provision costs. Responsible land-use planning is critical to balancing the needs of our growing communities and to ensuring that our agriculture and agri-food sector survives and thrives.\nWe cannot afford to lose any more agricultural land; nor can we stand idly by as our threatened natural heritage areas are paved over for Swiss-cheese sprawl and development. Provincial food security, rural economies, and the public health of our communities are at stake. Aside from the allowance of two additional residential units on pre-existing farm plots, the NFU-O advocates maintaining the existing 2020 PPS as it offers the minimum required support to protect Ontario\u2019s farmland and the public good.\nSincerely,\nMax Hansgen,\nPresident, National Farmers Union - Ontario\ncc: The Honourable Lisa Thompson, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs\n",

        "comment":"There are several proposed changes to the PPS that are very short-sighted and unsustainable, but the most egregious is the proposal to permit three severances on each farm throughout the province. I agree with the joint statement issued by the Ontario Federation of Agriculture that indicated this plan will undermine the ability of farmers to continue to function in the province of Ontario. These severances will result in destructive fragmentation of rural areas, and create absolutely avoidable conflicts between residents and farmers trying to carry on farming operations - due to noise, odours and traffic.\nHave the implications of drastically increasing the number of access points along rural roads been fully considered by the Ministery of Transportation? This is a massive safety concern. Each of these newly created lots will require a driveway.\nPrime farmland is a non-renewable resource. The proposed severances will increase the rate of farmland loss, which is already estimated to be 319 acres per day. Allowing these severances will boost the price of farmland - pushing it further out of reach for new farmers and farmers who would like to expand existing operations. The proposal creates uncertainty that is destructive for farming operations.\nThe people who live in Ontario need a reliable, stable source of Ontario grown food. Agriculture is also an important pillar of the Ontario economy and it creates a significant amount of employment. This proposal puts our food supply and our economy at risk.\nI wholeheartedly support the submissions from Ontario Nature and Ontario Farmland Trust on this matter.\nRural residential (estate) zoning was put to an end over a decade ago for a good reason. Ontario should not need to be forced to re-learn lessons from the past.\nPlease withdraw the proposal to allow three severances on each farm.\nIn addition I request the removal of proposed changes to the PPS that will promote sprawl. For example: municipal density targets should remain in place, growth needs to be directed towards areas already designated for residential development within existing settlement and urban boundaries. Proposals to allow boundary expansions with little or no justification are poorly thought through - this will result in sprawl. MCRs provide evidence to justify expansion or retaining existing boundaries. MCRs should continue to be required. Sprawl that is caused by allowing growth outside existing boundaries, and in rural areas. Sprawl will result in increasing unsustainable costs for municipalities due to the need to create and maintain new infrastructure.\nOntario needs to improve public transit and reduce reliance on cars. We are seeing increased evidence of the impact of climate change ass a result of fossil fuel dependence. Building more roads and highways is not helpful. Expanding development further from built up areas also results in public transit being less feasible, causing increased reliance on cars, not less.\nThe assertion that Ontario needs more land to build much needed housing is not supported by multiple studies, including the findings reported by the Ontario Housing Affordabilty Task Force in 2022.\nThere is absolutely no evidence that supports opening the Greenbelt and farmland for housing. Ontario needs more affordable housing. Housing in remote areas is more expensive, not less.\nThank you for considering these comments.\n",

But I also believe that no one knows better than the farmer what is good for the land and good for their family.  Many farms (most?) have more marginal or awkward areas that should be allowed to be severed and sold for dwellings.  That little bit of cash infusion could be the difference for so many smaller farmers.  The difference in being able to send their kids to school or not being forced to sell a family farm out of the family in order to fund a retirement.

The implications of this are staggering \u2013 not only for efficient farming, MDS regulations, and ensuring we can produce enough food to feed our population in the future but even for things like rural schools, infrastructure, highway entrances, the electrical grid, internet and telephony infrastructure, rural hospitals, etc.  It has never been anticipated to relocate hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of people scattered across the rural parts of the province in the most inefficient manner possible.  The implications and costs we will all pay are staggering \u2013 particularly compared to the far more sustainable options to properly house people within existing communities where much infrastructure already exists (and may even be currently underutilized) without destroying our countryside, farms, groundwater recharge and natural areas.\nIt has been clearly demonstrated and become broadly accepted that land for development is not the issue \u2013 there is no land shortage \u2013 there is decades of land supply already designated in municipalities across the province and developers have been sitting on massive inventories for years as there is no approval expiry and no incentive for them to move forward to meet the market needs \u2013 in fact, the opposite by restricting supply they keep prices high and ensure constant demand at premium prices.\nThe proposed removal of intensification targets and population forecasting is confounding and allowing municipalities to expand settlement areas anytime without and MCR or justification is a recipe for disaster that will bankrupt many municipalities in the years ahead.\nThe ongoing attacks on our Conservation Authorities and the continued weakening of watershed planning will be looked upon by future generations as unfathomable and will guarantee Doug Ford a place in history as one of the most short-sighted leaders ever to be removing the safeguards and common sense policies put into place to protect people and infrastructure.  Much like there are the Darwin Awards currently recognizing people who have done humanity a favour by ending their genetic lineage and removing their not so smart genes from the gene pool, I predict future Ford Awards will be used to describe something done only for greed and profit, defying all common sense, greater public good and even basic human safety in an era of rapid climate change and climate chaos.\nWhich brings up the absolutely logic-defying removal and weakening of all policies addressing climate change.  At a time that the rest of the world is moving forward, increasing resilience and preparing for a very different future, here is our provincial government moving in the opposite direction and dooming future generations.\nMy family and I urge you for the sake of our children \u2013 currently 4 and 6 years old to abandon these confounding, absurd and poorly considered proposed policy changes and go in the opposite direction of providing the sustainable solutions we need for the future, building upon our current world-leading successful planning system, and implementing regulations that will actually solve our housing challenges while preparing our province for the climate crisis we are already facing.\nThank you!\n",

We are the envy of most other cities attracting leading firms from around the world, revitalizing our core areas, creating world-class institutions, having the most profitable and successful farmers in Canada, and doing it all while decreasing our carbon footprint, protecting our farmland and increasing our greenspace.\nWe are a model of pioneering planning, innovation, barnraising spirit and good planning that people are coming from around the world to study.  We should be the model for the rest of Ontario, however quite unfortunately the Premier and provincial government feel that instead our system is broken and needs to be replaced with backwards, decades-old methodology and concepts such as what is being proposed for the new PPS that have been proven not to work, to be the cause of many serious planning issue, and the reasons why so much of North America is in decline and crisis.\nThe proposed policies to sever farmland into multiple pieces and promote housing anywhere at any cost defies all logic and good planning principles - it will destroy our farms and ability to feed ourselves as well as imperil our groundwater sources we are totally dependent on here in Waterloo Region while doing almost nothing to solve the housing crisis - in fact it will likely worsen it by diverting scarce resources to the most inefficient uses conceivable.\nThe elimination of intensification and density targets, removal of population forecasts, the unfettered expansion of settle areas and urban boundaries, the removal of affordable housing, the ongoing MZO fiascos, the expansion of aggregates, the ongoing destruction of greenspace, wetlands and tender fruit areas, and finally the elimination of watershed planning and conservation authority activities is all beyond absurd, completely confounding and is the complete opposite of everything responsible for our success here in Waterloo Region.\nThese policies seem to only be for the benefit of a couple well-connected billionaire developers and are clearly against the greater public good and benefit of the citizens who need good government and good planning the most.\nWe cannot state enough how misguided, wrong and totally inappropriate these proposed policies compared to what is actually going to be needed for the success of future generations here in Ontario.\nWe urge you completely abandon these proposed policies, stop undermining SMART growth, focus on sustainability and use Waterloo Region as the model of successful planning for the rest of the province.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark,\nOn behalf of the Municipality of East Ferris, we acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 6, 2023, regarding the Provincial Planning Statement.  We are pleased to hear that the government is committed to addressing the housing supply problem in Ontario.\nWe wanted to let you know that despite the external economic challenges that are impacting new housing construction, residential construction activity in East Ferris remains vibrant.  As a rural, northern municipality with a population of approximately 5,000, we continue to work hard to encourage construction.  We were particularly impressed when in 2022, 50 new home permits were issued, representing a 150% increase in new homes over a three-year period and a 235.7% increase in total construction value over that same three-year period.  While this is positive for our community, most of the housing being built is single-detached residential homes costing in excess of $500,000. There is a need and demand for housing that is affordable.\nOver the past 15 years, a local non-profit organization has built 30 affordable units for seniors in our area. With rising costs, they are struggling to service and maintain these units.  As a municipality, we struggle to fund additional affordable housing in our community as our budgets are stretched thin. Funding and best practices to create and sustain affordable and attainable housing in our community is important for its growth and vitality. Strong leadership in this area would be greatly appreciated.\nIt is because of the growth in our community that we did want to take the opportunity to comment as part of the government\u2019s 60-day consultation on the proposed new Provincial Planning Statement. We were particularly pleased to learn of the emphasis the government is placing on the requirement for coordination between municipalities and school boards to consider school and childcare needs earlier in the planning process so that families moving into new housing can expect local schools to be available for their children.  This is critical to East Ferris parents as in the past few months they have been impacted by regional school boards and day care providers seeking to centralize classes and services. Many parents have told us, \"We chose to move our young family to East Ferris because of the excellent residential opportunities as well as the quality schools and childcare services.\u201d\nWe are struggling to maintain the quality childcare services. The childcare services that partner with the two school boards are operating below capacity because the service providers struggle to retain and attract Registered Early Childhood Educators (RECEs) to run quality programs. There needs to be a focus in the Provincial Policy Statement on the care economy specifically how to support our working families so they can be employed to their potential knowing there are available services to care for their children.  At a public meeting in our community, we heard stories of parents unable to work, having to take sick days, and\/or traveling distances due to the lack of childcare spaces in our community. The lack of RECEs is making their lives very challenging.  Again, strong leadership in this area is needed to create RECE jobs with appropriate salaries, benefits, and training so that people want to care for our children. This is important for our citizens to work to build the homes, and infrastructure needed and service our communities.\nThe Municipality of East Ferris welcomes the proposed changes to the use of site plan control on lakefront lots. We have two major lakes in our community and have relied heavily on site plan control as a tool for shoreline protection and managing lakefront development. Approximately 35% of the parcels of land within East Ferris fall within 120 metres of the shoreline of one of our major lakes and as a result, this tool is vital for us in managing the health of our lakes. Many of our planning policies are based on this tool being available to us.\nEast Ferris has reviewed changes relating to Rural Areas in proposed Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of the new Provincial Policy Statement (PPS). Although minor in nature, East Ferris appreciates the continued flexibility in rural development policies to allow municipalities the ability to implement development plans that are locally relevant based on the unique conditions of our municipality. Further, East Ferris is supportive of the PPS focus on providing a range of housing options and encouraging the use of a wide range of all housing options to help create complete communities.\nOn behalf of East Ferris and its citizens, thank you Minister Clark for hearing our concerns and for providing this further opportunity to provide input into the ongoing planning process.\nSincerely,\nPauline Rochefort\nPauline Rochefort\nMayor\nMunicipality of East Ferris\n",

        "comment":"1.\tLot creation and multi-lot residential development in rural areas re section 2.6\nPrince Edward County Field Naturalists (PECFN) Recommendations re#1:\n\u2022\tWe urge you to reconsider implementing this policy.  Policies should be forward-looking.  This policy puts this province back to a time when residential development could be located virtually anywhere in rural areas.   If that didn\u2019t work then, it certainly isn\u2019t going to work now.  Developers were not proposing high rises and subdivisions in rural areas fifty years ago.\n\u2022\tIn the event that the government chooses to implement this policy, a way needs to be found to differentiate between low and high density residential development.  High density residential development should without exception only be permitted in settlement areas designated in official plans.\n\u2022\tPut at least some limits on lot severances.  As is, this policy has the potential to undo in an instant years of concerted efforts in many municipalities to protect the natural environment.  If the government cannot achieve its agenda of building 1.5 million new homes in the next 8 years without harming the natural environment, the solution is not to bring in  new policies and regulations that will allow the environment to be harmed.\n\u2022\tWe understand that multi-lot development will (only) be permitted where site conditions are suitable.  However \u201cwhere site conditions are suitable\u201d is so open-ended that basically all site conditions seem to be suitable.  For example, section 3.6.3 states that: \"Where municipal sewage services and municipal water services are not available, planned or feasible, private communal sewage services and private communal water services are the preferred form of servicing for multi-unit\/lot development to support protection of the environment and minimize potential risks to human health and safety.\u201d  There would appear to be few (if any) rural areas where multi-lot residential development will not be permitted. Unbelievably, this policy would even appear to permit large scale residential developments to have private communal sewage and water services.\n\u2022\tRecognize that there is no one-size-fits-all policy.  Certain types of residential development may be appropriate in one rural area where the exact same type of development will have serious adverse impacts on people and on the natural environment in another.  For example,  municipalities that have highly vulnerable aquifers should be given the option of opting out of this policy. A 2004 Groundwater Study undertaken by Quinte Conservation found that 59% of the Prince Edward County population relied on groundwater, with the majority relying on private wells.  The addition of large numbers of well-users in rural areas will further strain the groundwater supply, conceivably to the tipping point where wells  frequently run dry during the summer months and potentially beyond the summer months.\n2.\tBiodiversity\nPECFN Recommendations re #2:\n\u2022\tThe current PPS begins by noting that: \u201cOntario's long-term prosperity, environmental  health, and social well-being depend on conserving biodiversity, protecting the health of the Great Lakes, and protecting natural heritage, water, agricultural, mineral and cultural heritage and archaeological resources for their economic, environmental and social benefits.\u201d\nThis section has not been carried over into the proposed Planning Statement.  This is an important section and there is no possible reason we can think of for leaving it out. We urge you to reconsider its inclusion.\n\u2022\tThe Planning Statement clearly needs to take biodiversity more seriously. A good start would be a policy that supports the conservation of biodiversity in rural areas as opposed to promoting policies that do exactly the opposite.\n3.  Utilizing Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) as a new planning tool\nPECFN Recommendation re #3:\n\u2022\tMZOs should not be part of this provincial planning statement and putting them in this Statement sets a dangerous precedent.  The provincial government should not be using provincial policy statements in this way, i.e., as a means to support and legitimize the provincial government\u2019s authority and prerogative to override local planning authorities and official plans.\n4.\tOfficial Plans\nPECFN Recommendation re #4:\n\u2022\tRestore section 4.6 in its entirety in the Planning Statement including the first two paragraphs as follows:\nThe official plan is the most important vehicle for implementation of this Provincial Policy Statement. Comprehensive, integrated and long-term planning is best achieved through official plans.\nOfficial plans shall identify provincial interests and set out appropriate land use designations and policies. To determine the significance of some natural heritage features and other resources, evaluation may be required.\n5.\tClimate Change  and lack of leadership from the province\nPECFN Recommendation re #5:\n\u2022\tThe provincial government should take responsibility for its own policies that will only exacerbate the climate emergency instead of shifting it onto municipalities to deal with.\n6.\tDefinitions in the current PPS that are not carried forward into the Planning Statement\nPECFN Recommendations re #6:\n\u2022\tThat when the natural heritage section is completed and posted on the Environmental Registry  definitions for \u201cAdjacent Lands\u201d; \u201cCoastal Wetland\u201d; \u201cEcological function\u201d; \u201cEndangered Species\u201d; \u201cFish\u201d; \u201cFish Habitat\u201d; \u201cHabitat of Endangered Species and Threatened Species\u201d; \u201cNatural Heritage Features and Areas\u201d; \u201cNatural Heritage System\u201d; \u201cNegative Impacts\u201d; \u201cSignificant\u201d; \u201cThreatened Species\u201d; \u201cValleylands\u201d; \u201cWetlands\u201d;  \u201cWildlife Habitat\u201d; \u201cWoodlands\u201d and any other definitions with respect to the Province's natural heritage will be included.\n\u2022\tThat all definitions found in the current Provincial Policy Statement are included in Part 7 of the Planning Statement.\n7.  What, exactly, is the \"provincial interest\" and why isn't this clearly stated in the Planning Statement?\nPECFN Recommendations re #7:\n\u2022\t There are a number of references in the Planning Statement to the \u201cprovincial interest\u201d and to \u201cprovincial interests\u201d, but the Statement is vague on details about what the provincial interest is, exactly.  This is problematic, particularly when the Planning Statement requires that Official Plans identify provincial interests and that they \u201cprovide clear, reasonable and attainable policies to protect provincial interests\u201d s. 6.1(5) and when planning authorities are being instructed to keep their official plans up-to-date in order to protect provincial interests.  Planning authorities and the public should not be left in the dark like this.\n\u2022\tThe inclusion of Part IV in the current PPS in the proposed Planning Statement. This section states up front in clear terms that the province\u2019s key provincial interest is the wise use and management of natural heritage resources, water resources, agricultural resources, etc.  It also clarifies the Provinces\u2019 responsibility to ensure that resources are managed in a sustainable way to among other things, conserve biodiversity, protect essential ecological processes and minimize environmental and social impacts.\n8.   Protection of natural heritage, etc.\nPECFN Recommendations re #8:\n\u2022\tThe only reference to protection in the Planning Statement (other than in the Definitions section) is in the context of protecting the provincial interest.  The Planning Statement should recognize the importance of leveraging rural assets and amenities while at the same time protecting the environment.  At the very least, we therefore recommend retaining the following section in the current Provincial Policy Statement:\nSection 2.0: \u201cOntario\u2019s long-term prosperity, environmental health, and social well-being depend on conserving biodiversity, protecting the health of the Great Lakes, and protecting natural heritage, water, agricultural, mineral and cultural heritage and archaeological resources for their economic, environmental and social benefits.\u201d\n",

        "comment":"RE: Intensification, Municipal Comprehensive Review, and Settlement Area Expansion, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognizes the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector.  This submission will focus primarily on sections of the proposed PPS 2023 dealing with intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion.\nComments regarding proposed changes to intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion\nI have significant concerns regarding the proposed policy changes found in the PPS 2023 regarding intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion. These policies should ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. However, while the proposed PPS 2023 generally states support for intensification, it does not require targets for municipalities across Ontario and provides many permissions that would undermine attempts at intensification. Additionally, the intensification targets for many municipalities in the Growth Plan have been reduced or removed altogether, which will use up lands in municipal boundaries faster and lead to increased rates of urban boundary expansion. Without the requirement to complete municipal comprehensive reviews, this poses a significant threat to farmland. As noted below, reducing and eliminating density targets is contrary to encouraging complete communities found within the proposed PPS. This will lead to fragmented patterns of development, including when settlement boundary expansion occurs.\nI have noted concerns under s.2.3, Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions. The policy in s.2.3.2 now states that \u201cland use patterns within settlement areas should be based on densities and a mix of land uses\u201d. The province opted to change the language from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d, which weakens the policies that are meant to support intensification. Additionally, the language that states land use patterns should \u201cminimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, promote energy efficiency\u201d and \u201cprepare for the impacts of a changing climate\u201d has been removed.  This is concerning given the climate crisis we are facing and that agriculture relies on healthy and stable ecosystems to produce a consistent supply of quality local food. By removing this language, the province is undermining the future viability of the agricultural sector, the largest sector of the Ontario economy.\nRecommendation 1: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.2 that will require municipalities to adopt land use patterns that support density targets and also minimize negative environmental impacts.\nFurthermore, s.2.3.3 states that \u201cplanning authorities should support general intensification and redevelopment to support the achievement of complete communities, including by planning for a range and mix of housing options and prioritizing planning and investment in the necessary infrastructure and public service facilities.\u201d Once again, the use of \u201cshould\u201d is not strong enough to ensure the deliverables of complete communities. Furthermore, the policy no longer requires planning authorities to identify appropriate locations or take stock of suitable existing sites, eroding the possibility of efficient land use. While I encourage the use of complete communities in the planning framework, the removal of intensification targets will not only have sever impact to farmland but it will undermine the existing urban  planning framework to achieve complete communities.\nRecommendation 2: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.3 that will require municipalities to identify appropriate locations for intensification.\nThe policy on settlement area expansion has also been weakened, which will further threaten Ontario\u2019s prime agricultural land. A major concern is removing the requirement of a municipal comprehensive review that demonstrates the need for expansion. Additionally, the language in s.2.3.4 has been changed from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d which weaken the policy, making it possible for development to occur on prime agricultural lands. While proposed s.2.3.4.b states that applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas, this is a subsection under s.2.3.4 which states planning authorities \u201cshould\u201d consider this. Since the language does require planning authorities to consider this, there is the likelihood of it still occurring. This is also the case for s.2.3.4d regarding impacts on agricultural lands and operations that are adjacent or close to the settlement.\nRecommendation 3: The province should require municipal comprehensive reviews prior to settlement boundary expansion and require the planning authority to demonstrate the need. Furthermore, the province needs to adopt stronger language in s.2.3.4 that ensures the applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas and that prime agricultural areas are avoided to the greatest extent possible as determined through an agricultural impact assessment.\nI have also noted the removal of policies from s.2.6 Rural Lands in Municipalities, in particular, \u201cwhen directing development on rural lands, a planning authority shall apply the relevant policies of Section 1: Building Strong Healthy Communities, as well as the policies of Section 2: Wise Use and Management of Resources and Section 3: Protecting Public Health and Safety.\u201d I suggest that the removal of this policy will undermine the future resiliency of rural communities.\nRecommendation 4: The province should reinstate the policies pertaining to directing development on rural lands that require planning authorities to apply relevant policies that support strong and resilient communities as found in the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020.\nFinally, there is concern pertaining to the language in s.2.1.1 that states, \u201csufficient land shall be made available to accommodate an appropriate range and mix of land uses to meet projected needs for a time horizon of at least 25 years.\u201d As noted above, without improving language and goals pertaining to density targets, it will be increasingly difficult for municipalities to plan accurately for beyond 25 years. This will likely lead to further settlement area expansion to accommodate the likelihood of urban sprawl, which will reduce investments in agricultural operations surrounding urban boundaries.\nRecommendation 5: The province should maintain the current requirement for planning authorities to plan for up to 25 years in order to minimize unnecessary and premature settlement area expansion.\nIn conclusion, the proposed changes to intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion weaken policies that would ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. The use of weaker language and the removal of requirements will lead to increased rates of settlement boundary expansion and further threaten farmland and the agricultural sector. It is essential that the policies are strengthened to ensure efficient land use and protect Ontario\u2019s agricultural operations and communities.\nReferences:\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

As a farm fencing contractor a few years ago I was contacted by a man who had just inherited farm property from extended family, he wanted to build a new house and barn and have a hobby farm. Some time in the past a lot had been severed off the farm and while planning the fence a man came out of the house and asked what I was doing. He told me he did not want his yard fenced in, I laughed and said well then I guess cows will be pasturing on your lawn. He then told me a firmer voice there would not be a fence, I suggested he read the line fences act and the fence viewers would be called and there would be a fence.

        "comment":"From Rescue Lake Simcoe Coalition\nxxxx\nJune 6, 2023\nDear Provincial Land Use Plans staff,\nRE: ERO 019-6813 Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and the PPS (ERO 019-6813). Below, please find our specific comments regarding the policies proposed.\nThe Province of Ontario\u2019s proposed combination of the Provincial Policy Statement 2000 (PPS) and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Growth Plan), presents policies and definitions not required for the creation of more, and affordable, housing, which we had been led to believe was the problem Ontario was trying to solve. The policies proposed in the replacement of the PPS and the Growth Plan are going to harm communities, commuters, the environment, and people, all while not addressing the problem Ontario purports to address: affordability.\nThe proposed changes to the PPS and Growth Plan are taking the province back to the development approach of the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, when anything could be built anywhere. It has taken the past 50 years to \u2018heal\u2019 the impacts of these short-sighted development decisions and to develop policies and legislation which consider development for the long term benefit of this province. We strongly recommend that the 1950\u2019s approach to development not occur again.  The integrity of this province has too much to lose in the short and long term.\nIt is very clear that the proposed policies and legislation were prepared based on the direction and to the satisfaction of the building industry and land development associations.  Municipalities of all sizes were excluded from the discussion and yet  the municipalities will be expected to do the approvals and to provide the various services.  The citizens and taxpayers of this province deserve much better: science-based land use planning, which appreciates and respects all residents and landowners, not only developers and future developers.\nIt has been proven in many reports that at present there are sufficient dwellings at various states of planning approvals, and land designated for growth in Official Plans, to meet the province\u2019s perceived demand. It is not the municipalities but the developers who have chosen to hold back construction. These residential units \u201cin the pipeline\u201d are situated in areas which can be adequately serviced without negative impacts to the valued natural heritage resources, agricultural lands, water and top-soil resources of this province.  These should be the priority, not new approvals in Greenfields and the Greenbelt.\nThese changes will exacerbate affordability problems\nThe proposed legislation and policies, being presented erroneously to create more affordable housing, are based on a very strong top-down approach. The definition of \u2018Affordable\u2019 has been removed from the PPS, which tells us everything we need to know about the province's intention to address this crisis.\nThere has been no meaningful municipal involvement or reference as to how each municipality will be able to afford to provide the wide variety of infrastructures and services required for housing on lands not identified for the proposed use in the official plan, regardless of the density or location. This approach will increase the price of all types of housing, in the form of higher taxes for less services for the existing and future residents. Thus the result is not housing affordability, but the creation of residential units for the rental market based on an unsustainable approach.\nAllowing for greater numbers of multiple families and culturally appropriate housing (definition unknown) appears to be another means of increasing density in low-density residential areas. Increasing the number of occupants in a single-family dwelling has been shown to have immediate negative impacts on all of the existing services and infrastructure planned for the intended population. Allowing significantly greater numbers of residential units and people living within each unit, will have a long-term impact on the quality and quantity of water from the context of surface water and aquifers.\n Natural Heritage\nOntario citizens have learned over the years of development, to appreciate and protect our natural resources. Natural heritage features and functions, water bodies, water courses, topsoil, wildlife, open spaces and clean water and air are essential to our future and yet are often taken for granted.  Why is this science-based knowledge, interest and foresight being negated to build residential dwellings which will be not affordable to most of the province\u2019s population? The proposed policies will result in a decrease in the number of \u2018affordable\u2019 units.\nThe proposal to change the existing policy language from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d reduces the protection of the natural heritage area and their features and function, which encourages development in areas which contain identified flood plains, flood-prone areas, high water tables and susceptibility to erosion. The avoidance of such areas is crucial to protect future development areas from the impacts of severe weather events, in particular extreme rain events, which are occurring more frequently and with greater severity.\nWhy have the natural heritage policies and definitions been \u2019set aside\u2019 for future discussion? These policies and definitions are integral parts of long-term sustainable development in Ontario.\nThe Lake Simcoe Protection Plan identifies a target of 40% high quality natural cover, and \u201cno loss of wetlands\u201d. These targets cannot be met if natural heritage policies are weakened. And if the province\u2019s solution is to protect it all with land trusts, do understand that this would be the least economically sensible way to protect lands. Our provincial Natural Heritage policies currently protect 21% of the Lake Simcoe watershed very well. Is the province going to buy up all that land? Of course not. We need more policy protection for Natural Heritage features in the PPS, not less.\nUpper Tier Government Changes\nRegarding the dissolution of Upper-tier governments, this too needs much greater consideration. Democratic representativeness and reflecting one\u2019s own Council direction are areas that need improvement in regional governments. But the \u201centire system\u201c is not useless or broken. The idea that many small rural municipalities can handle growth, environmental plan review, the coordination of infrastructure, and efficient use of tax dollars is a fantasy. We have seen no specifics about how municipalities can reasonably do this, and your government is ignoring all the experts in this field. It\u2019s a complete abdication of responsibility.\nSimcoe County has 16 lower-tier municipalities and 2 separated cities (Barrie and Orillia).  Only one of those municipalities has a population over 50,000 people, according to the 2021 census (Barrie).  Most of them (13) have a population less than 30,000 people.  This means that the tax generation of many of the municipalities in our area is lower and generally this translates to few staff at the municipal level as well.  Consequently, those municipalities rely on provincial policy to help guide them.\nSimcoe County has been at the center of Ontario\u2019s sprawling past and was once referred to as the \u2018wild west\u2019 of planning.  Regional staff and local governments have largely tried to turn that reputation around and commit to growth that is sustainable, financially sound and evidence-based.  All of these changes will remove much of the good work that has been done.  To underscore the real and present danger our natural, agricultural and watershed communities face, recognize that even though there are tens of thousands of housing units fully approved that aren\u2019t being built, developers still requested an additional 15, 886 acres of land to build on.\nOur recommendations:\n\u25cf\tDo not proceed with these proposals.\n\u25cf\tStop threatening regional planning dissolution; instead address the actual regional problems in these reviews. Those are: coordinating infrastructure; watershed management; water \/ wastewater planning; climate adaptation and mitigation; local job procurement; regional road building, and building an appropriate supply of affordable housing.\n\u25cf\tGive Conservation Authorities\u2019 plan-review and Natural Heritage protection powers back.\n\u25cf\tAbandon this initiative in lieu of more consultation with municipalities, Indigenous governments, community organizations and other stakeholders to ensure that unintended consequences of these policy proposals are mitigated or avoided\n\u25cf\tDo not eliminate the Natural Heritage System or the Agricultural systems in the Growth Plan.\n\u25cf\tRemove the ability to sever rural agricultural lots beyond one severance. This isn\u2019t even supported by farm associations. It\u2019s to promote more sprawl and is dangerously short-sighted.\n\u25cf\tMaintain urban, suburban intensification requirements, and Greenfield density targets in order to best use our limited building and infrastructure resources and dollars.\n\u25cf\tDevelop a credible plan for increasing our province\u2019s affordable housing stock in every single town and city.\n\u25cf\tDo not force municipalities to enter into servicing agreements with developers in lands that were not a part of the municipality\u2019s designated growth areas, or for infrastructure that wasn\u2019t included in capital plans.\nAs the saying goes, \u2018the devil is in the details\u2019. The citizens of Ontario, especially Southern Ontario, which appears to be the focus of these changes, will only benefit from maintaining the existing PPS and Growth Plan.

        "comment":"Input from Transport Canada:\nIn section 3.4(2)c), the word \"discouraging\" should be changed to \"forbidding\".  The rationale is that development on the land surrounding airports is always a sensitive topic.  Provinces and municipalities are always trying to squeeze out every last acre of land for development.  Airport Zoning Regulations (AZR) and Provincial Zoning Regulations attempt to put some controls on this but, from what we are hearing, there are an increasing number of circumstances where zoning in the vicinity of airports is not adhering to the AZR\u2019s.  While my point relates to safety, I suggest the highlighted word below be changed to forbidding.  Discouraging is too weak.\nThe section in question currently reads as follows:\n3.4 Airports, Rail and Marine Facilities\n1. Planning for land uses in the vicinity of airports, rail facilities and marine facilities shall be undertaken so that:\na) their long-term operation and economic role is protected; and\nb) airports, rail facilities and marine facilities and sensitive land uses are\nappropriately designed, buffered and\/or separated from each other, in\naccordance with policy 3.5.\n2. Airports shall be protected from incompatible land uses and development by:\na) prohibiting new residential development and other sensitive land uses in areas\nnear airports above 30 NEF\/NEP;\nb) considering redevelopment of existing residential uses and other sensitive land\nuses or infilling of residential and other sensitive land uses in areas above 30\nNEF\/NEP only if it has been demonstrated that there will be no negative impacts\non the long-term function of the airport; and\nc) discouraging land uses which may cause a potential aviation safety hazard.\nSection 1.6.9.2a) should read \"(\u2026) 25 NEF\/NEP\", rather than 30.  The Transport Canada tehcnical standard for sensitve land use dvelopment is 25 NEF; in other words, Ontario has a higher tolerance for noise than TC does.\nIn terms of the Implementation portion, the second bullet should be changed, as follows:\nFrom -\nRequire municipalities to undertake early engagement with Indigenous communities and coordinate with them on land use planning matters to facilitate knowledge-sharing, support consideration of Indigenous interests in land use decision-making and support the identification of potential impacts of decisions on the exercise of Aboriginal or treaty rights\nTo -\nPlanning authorities shall engage early with Indigenous communities and ensure their interests are considered when identifying, protecting and managing archaeological resources, built heritage resources and cultural heritage landscapes.\nLand use authorities and developers alike are encouraged to consider consulting with NAV CANADA\u2019s Land Use Planning Program as well as aerodromes (airports and non-certified aerodromes) in their vicinity in advance of construction, and before official documents\/authorization\/permits are issued.\nWhile some airports have Airport Zoning Regulations, both permanent (e.g. high-rises, cell towers) and temporary structures (e.g. construction cranes) well outside the boundary specified in the regulation can impact on the usability of a particular runway or the ability for certain aircraft to take-off and land at a given airport. Additionally, some land uses can impact on the sensitive air navigation equipment that is relied upon to safely land such as during inclement weather.\nThe safety and efficiency of the aviation system, which contributes to local economies and the movement of people and goods, relies on the cooperation of all parties involved in land use planning and development to take action on the concerns raised by airport operators and technical experts at NAV CANADA.\nWith respect to Section 3.4, part 2a and 2b which references Noise Exposure Forecast (NEF) \/ Noise Exposure Projection (NEP), Transport Canada notes that the use of NEF\/NEP mapping is a voluntary undertaking for airports. While most major airports have NEF contours in place, smaller airports may not. Sensitive land uses and development around an airport of any size, without or without a NEF, may have impacts.\nFor any questions on the aforementioned input, please contact Sarah Jardine (Standards, Civil Aviation, Transport Canada)\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognizes the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector.  This submission will focus primarily on sections of the proposed PPS 2023 dealing with intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion.\nComments regarding proposed changes to intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion\nI have significant concerns regarding the proposed policy changes found in the PPS 2023 regarding intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion. These policies should ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. However, while the proposed PPS 2023 generally states support for intensification, it does not require targets for municipalities across Ontario and provides many permissions that would undermine attempts at intensification. Additionally, the intensification targets for many municipalities in the Growth Plan have been reduced or removed altogether, which will use up lands in municipal boundaries faster and lead to increased rates of urban boundary expansion. Without the requirement to complete municipal comprehensive reviews, this poses a significant threat to farmland. As noted below, reducing and eliminating density targets is contrary to encouraging complete communities found within the proposed PPS. This will lead to fragmented patterns of development, including when settlement boundary expansion occurs.\nI have noted concerns under s.2.3, Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions. The policy in s.2.3.2 now states that \u201cland use patterns within settlement areas should be based on densities and a mix of land uses\u201d. The province opted to change the language from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d, which weakens the policies that are meant to support intensification. Additionally, the language that states land use patterns should \u201cminimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, promote energy efficiency\u201d and \u201cprepare for the impacts of a changing climate\u201d has been removed.  This is concerning given the climate crisis we are facing and that agriculture relies on healthy and stable ecosystems to produce a consistent supply of quality local food. By removing this language, the province is undermining the future viability of the agricultural sector, the largest sector of the Ontario economy.\nRecommendation 1: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.2 that will require municipalities to adopt land use patterns that support density targets and also minimize negative environmental impacts.\nFurthermore, s.2.3.3 states that \u201cplanning authorities should support general intensification and redevelopment to support the achievement of complete communities, including by planning for a range and mix of housing options and prioritizing planning and investment in the necessary infrastructure and public service facilities.\u201d Once again, the use of \u201cshould\u201d is not strong enough to ensure the deliverables of complete communities. Furthermore, the policy no longer requires planning authorities to identify appropriate locations or take stock of suitable existing sites, eroding the possibility of efficient land use. While I encourage the use of complete communities in the planning framework, the removal of intensification targets will not only have sever impact to farmland but it will undermine the existing urban  planning framework to achieve complete communities.\nRecommendation 2: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.3 that will require municipalities to identify appropriate locations for intensification.\nThe policy on settlement area expansion has also been weakened, which will further threaten Ontario\u2019s prime agricultural land. A major concern is removing the requirement of a municipal comprehensive review that demonstrates the need for expansion. Additionally, the language in s.2.3.4 has been changed from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d which weaken the policy, making it possible for development to occur on prime agricultural lands. While proposed s.2.3.4.b states that applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas, this is a subsection under s.2.3.4 which states planning authorities \u201cshould\u201d consider this. Since the language does require planning authorities to consider this, there is the likelihood of it still occurring. This is also the case for s.2.3.4d regarding impacts on agricultural lands and operations that are adjacent or close to the settlement.\nRecommendation 3: The province should require municipal comprehensive reviews prior to settlement boundary expansion and require the planning authority to demonstrate the need. Furthermore, the province needs to adopt stronger language in s.2.3.4 that ensures the applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas and that prime agricultural areas are avoided to the greatest extent possible as determined through an agricultural impact assessment.\nI have also noted the removal of policies from s.2.6 Rural Lands in Municipalities, in particular, \u201cwhen directing development on rural lands, a planning authority shall apply the relevant policies of Section 1: Building Strong Healthy Communities, as well as the policies of Section 2: Wise Use and Management of Resources and Section 3: Protecting Public Health and Safety.\u201d I suggest that the removal of this policy will undermine the future resiliency of rural communities.\nRecommendation 4: The province should reinstate the policies pertaining to directing development on rural lands that require planning authorities to apply relevant policies that support strong and resilient communities as found in the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020.\nFinally, there is concern pertaining to the language in s.2.1.1 that states, \u201csufficient land shall be made available to accommodate an appropriate range and mix of land uses to meet projected needs for a time horizon of at least 25 years.\u201d As noted above, without improving language and goals pertaining to density targets, it will be increasingly difficult for municipalities to plan accurately for beyond 25 years. This will likely lead to further settlement area expansion to accommodate the likelihood of urban sprawl, which will reduce investments in agricultural operations surrounding urban boundaries.\nRecommendation 5: The province should maintain the current requirement for planning authorities to plan for up to 25 years in order to minimize unnecessary and premature settlement area expansion.\nIn conclusion, the proposed changes to intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion weaken policies that would ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. The use of weaker language and the removal of requirements will lead to increased rates of settlement boundary expansion and further threaten farmland and the agricultural sector. It is essential that the policies are strengthened to ensure efficient land use and protect Ontario\u2019s agricultural operations and communities.\n",

        "comment":"From: the Peterborough Alliance for Food and Farming (localfoodptbo.ca)\nDate: June 6, 2023\nPROPOSED PROVINCIAL PLANNING STATEMENT\nhttps:\/\/ero.ontario.ca\/notice\/019-6813\nThe Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MMAH) is seeking input from all interested residents, as well as organizational leaders, on proposed policies for an integrated province-wide land use planning policy document. This proposed Provincial Planning Statement takes policies from both A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 to support the achievement of housing objectives across Ontario.\nSpecific to rural communities and our food-producing lands, this direction proposes more flexibility in the development of rural areas, allows increased residential development and promotes residential lot creation in prime agricultural areas.   However, it is not supportive of a strong and healthy rural community in terms of adding needed infrastructural services to support the new residences nor does this policy ensure protection of our agricultural sector\/lands.\nOver the past decade Peterborough City and County have worked collaboratively to build and maintain a strong food system and thus a sustainable Peterborough for future generations.  Specifically, the intent of the Peterborough Alliance for Food and Farming (PAFF) is to collaborate to strengthen community food security and sustainable, resilient local food systems in the context of the global food and climate crises.\nPAFF aims to facilitate connections to benefit those living and working within Peterborough City, County and First Nations, through education, research, planning, consultation, coordination, and communication.  It has documented the need for a sustainable Peterborough and it has had input from local residents through a variety of research reports and community summits over the last thirteen years.\nWe are writing to voice extreme concern over the proposed provincial directions the Province of Ontario that will:\n\u2022\tundermine good planning,\n\u2022\tallow for inappropriate development of food producing lands and agricultural practices,\n\u2022\tresult in the degradation of rural communities and uncontrolled rural sprawl without providing resources to develop appropriate services\nOur comments have their basis in our work to date.  Our questions are being posed because we are not confident that consideration has been given to the needs of our rural communities and the requirements to maintain our ability to feed Ontario in the future.\nHere are some things to consider as the province attempts to reduce appropriate planning policies.\nSome statistics and implications for decision makers to consider:\n\u2022\tStats Canada (2022) reported 48,346 farms in Ontario in 2021\nThe proposed directions could result 145,038 acres taken out of agricultural production (in 48,346 x 3acres and this does not include all those non-farm agricultural parcels (2+ acre lots)\n\u2022\tStats Canada (2022) reported 11,766,071 acres of farmland in Ontario in 2021. This policy could remove approximately 1.25% of Ontario's farmland (again this does not include all those non-farm agricultural parcels (2+ acre lots)\n\u2022\tLess than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base is prime agricultural lands (OMAFRA, 2016) and these proposed changes allow development on those lands\n\u2022\tAccording to Ontario Farmland Trust, Ontario is already losing 319 acres of farmland every day (farmland transitioned to other uses)\n\u2022\tOntario has the largest percentage of livestock farms in Canada at the present time. This new lot creation policy will ultimately reduce opportunities to create and expand livestock in Ontario.  Again this will result in land-use conflicts and an increased reliance on other geographic areas for our food.\n\u2022\tIt is estimated that on a typical concession block the proposed planning changes will allow approximately 30 new residential lots.  With Minimum Distance Separations (MDS) between lots and farm use, this will result in no space for growth in our food production re livestock sector.  This will result in even more reliance on other countries to meet our needs for animal agriculture in Ontario.\n\u2022\tGiven MDS restrictions, many farmers and farmland owners may be forced to choose between selling lots and maintaining barns for future use. If they choose to decommission currently unused barns in order to sell lots, this is a permanent action that will restrict any future possibility of livestock agriculture on the farm.\nQuestions to consider about this direction to allow sprawl:\n\u2022\tThe proposed Provincial Policy Statement re agricultural severance policy will allow\/encourage hundreds of thousands of new residential lots and more residences to be scattered amongst farms.  How will that support good farming practices and our need for more local food production?  How will municipalities and community agencies deal with the population increases and an erratic social infrastructure requiring increased services (hospitals, health care, schools)?\nThe impact of sprawl on our water system:\n\u2022\tConventional strip development of residences has been concentrated along farm boundaries and a road. Because they are individually developed, they are not on municipal water and sewer. This generally means that each dwelling lot has to have a well and a septic system.\n\u2022\tBecause the septic will seep into the ground water and the potable water is drawn from the ground water there is a possibility of contamination of the potable water supply. This possibility increases with the density of strip development. Any septic discharge into a nearby watercourse could impact source water in other areas beyond the strip development. This possibility would have a negative impact on downstream source water areas (places where individuals or municipalities drawn potable water).\n\u2022\tBecause strip development is generally taken from agricultural land, normal farming practices may impact the strip development potable water supply.\n\u2022\tBy imposing separation distances between the agricultural lands and the strip development, land available for agricultural will be further reduced.\nThe impact of sprawl on the social infrastructure of our rural communities:\n\u2022\tGiven that good planning, environmental responsibility and community consensus states that affordable housing must be located in an area with adequate transportation corridors, how will the province accommodate these additional transportation needs?  This proposed policy promotes development that is reliant on cars.\n\u2022\tHow will municipal and provincial governments deal with the land use conflicts between farmers and non-farmers that these policy changes will engender?\n\u2022\tHow can a community be built sustainably if municipalities are not permitted to decide what is best for their own area? (ie if the county\/townships locally want to do things differently and more restrictively, they are not permitted to do so by the Province).\n\u2022\tIt is proposed that language about healthy communities be removed. However, land use planning is an important health promotion tool to support reducing the burden on the healthcare system. Removing language about built boundary lines has implications for community connectedness specifically connections to physical and mental health. What are plans to ensure that the link between health and land use planning, is acknowledged?\nThe limitations for community consultation:\n\u2022\tWith the new proposed changes, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing will have the ability to over-ride municipal decision-making processes without consultation. Are there plans to ensure that decisions made reflect the needs and voices of local communities with consideration given to the needs of Indigenous communities?\nFinally, sustainable communities can only be built upon good planning values and principles.  Decisions made today will impact the next generations.  How will these proposed planning policies:\n\u2022\tensure safe and adequate water systems?\n\u2022\tSupport community resiliency in the face of climate-impacted weather extremes such as droughts and high rain events?\n\u2022\tPreserve our natural heritage?\n\u2022\tCommit to the development of social, health and education services that support rural communities?\nWe understand that the province is under great pressure to allow development.  However, the development of a sustainable community requires strong and insightful planning principles.  We hope that our comments will provide you with information that will result in a return to appropriate planning policy and the values of sustainable communities.\nAddendum:\nThis letter was prepared with extensive consultation and reflection on the issues cited above.\nAs of June 1st, the government has indicated that it is reconsidering its position on the issues to which we are providing comment.  We have chosen to continue to provide comment because of the importance and concern for our rural communities, our commitment to protecting farmland and building sustainable communities.\nWe hope that the government has taken to heart the need to plan a strong rural Ontario.  We will continue to monitor and engage with the Province as the process unfolds.\n",

        "comment":"As a Canadian student I am deeply aware of the Canadian housing market and the issues that have arose in the last couple years. However, I am also aware that the housing that the government is providing is exceedingly unaffordable to anyone. The housing developments that are erasing arable land, also increase food costs and deplete locally grown product from our stores. These housing developments are not affordable to the average Canadian.\n      In regard to Bill 97's connection to the greenbelt, removing the protection of the greenbelt and allowing even further development action in quick succession is a stark reminder as to why the greenbelt was protected in the beginning. The greenbelt exists to protect Ontario from urban sprawl, and the reversal of that protection is a dangerous precedent to set, not only for Ontario but all of Canada as we largely base our decisions and policy on case law. Farmers and agricultural land are the backbone of Canadian cities, without farms and farmers there are not cities. Without Canadian farms and farmers we increasingly become dependent on other states for resources and develop a less independent economy.\n       In regard to our environment, protection from flooding or pollution requires sustained and flourishing ecosystems. Ecosystems that are largely maintained by conservationists and farmers. Marshes and woodlots provide the proper systems to prevent erosion and flooding and the biological filters accommodate our industrial pollution, which in turn helps our carbon footprint reduction.\n       Overall, it is a bad idea to reverse the protection of the greenbelt and allow Bill 97 to increase housing developments on arable land.\n",

These changes would accelerate urban sprawl and the ongoing loss of farmland and natural areas in Ontario.\nA shortage of land is not the cause of Ontario\u2019s housing shortage, as noted by the Housing Affordability Task Force in 2022:\n\"Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (p. 10)\"\nMunicipalities have already set aside enough land within their borders to build well over 2 million homes, far surpassing the 1.5 million housing units the Premier wants built by 2031.\n\u200d\nReport after report verifies these facts. There are a limited number of investment dollars, construction workers and building supplies. They should be directed to help developers succeed in building housing where people already live, in the municipalities that have the land ready for development.\nIt is time to listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets.\nThere is simply no need for proposed policy changes which would:\n- Eliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to rein in urban sprawl;\n- Allow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n- Force municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n- Exempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n- Remove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and\n- Weaken and eliminate policies intended to address climate change.\nOntario is losing farmland at the shocking rate of 319 acres per day. The proposed new policies will make matters much worse and spell disaster for the lands and waters that sustain us.\nSprawl development will not solve current housing needs, as your government pretends.

The original farm, which is 100+ acres...cannot be touched...which is ridiculous.  I can understand not allowing selling of parcels, or even making severances that are for future farmers...ie 50 acre lots.  That is reasonable.

        "comment":"Comments submitted on behalf of the Kawartha Lakes Municipal Heritage Committee related to section 4.6 - Cultural Heritage:\n\u2022\tThe removal of \u201csignificant\u201d from both the definitions and policy 4.6.1 does not align with the relevant legislative direction under the Ontario Heritage Act and Ontario Regulation 9\/06 which identifies how significance is determined. The change from \u201csignificant\u201d cultural heritage resources to \u201cprotected\u201d heritage resources does not recognize the need for or ability of municipalities to preserve and protect heritage resources which are not necessarily protected through the land use planning process. Given the limited resources of most municipalities to identify and protect heritage resources in advance of the receipt of development proposals, it does not allow for flexibility or scope to protect resources within the context of the land use planning process which may have a detrimental impact on communities which value these resources and liveable vibrant communities within Ontario.\n\u2022\tThe revisions related to development and site alterations related to adjacent properties under policy 4.6.2 do not identify how a proponent can demonstrate that the heritage attributes of a protected heritage attribute will be conserved. The former policy, which expressly directs evaluation of the proposal to occur, was clearer for both a municipality and proponent as to how this policy direction could be fulfilled.\n\u2022\tPolicy 4.6.5 correctly adds that municipalities should engage early with indigenous communities which provides additional direction as to the expectation with regard to indigenous engagement. However, further clarification as to the meaning of \u201cearly\u201d needs to identified within this policy to ensure expectations between indigenous communities and municipalities are the same and reflective of the duty to consult as delegated to municipalities by the Crown.\n\u2022\tSimilarly, the scoping of the matters on which municipalities must engage with indigenous communities is problematic within this policy. As written, the policy direct planning authorities to engage in relation to \u201carchaeological resources, built heritage resources, and cultural heritage landscapes\u201d as opposed to \u201ccultural heritage and archaeological resources\u201d more broadly. This limits the direction to municipalities to engage on matters related to intangible indigenous cultural heritage and other heritage resource that do not fall within the specific categories mentioned in the proposed policies. This has the potential to violate indigenous treaty rights and the constitutional duty to consult by limiting the scope of consultation and should be reconsidered.\n\u2022\tThe removal of municipal discretion in defining the definition of adjacent is problematic in light of the many municipal Official Plans across the province which have alternative or expanded definitions of adjacent. In particular, it is problematic in rural municipalities where properties may be visually contiguous but not legally contiguous through land features such as unopened road allowances and where there may be substantial scope for impact on an adjacent heritage property.\n\u2022\tThe change in definition of archaeological resources means that archaeological fieldwork is no longer required to identify and evaluate archaeological resources. This has the potential to significantly impact development by not undertaking appropriate on-site due diligence prior to development approval and increases the likelihood of unexpected finds during construction and the delay of project completion.\n\u2022\tThis change in definition to archaeological resources and the removal of the requirement to do fieldwork may also have the potential to impact indigenous treaty rights by not requiring a level of due diligence that could identify indigenous archaeological concerns on a site and identify mitigation measures prior to construction. Through a lack of due diligence, there is the potential to have a negative impact on indigenous cultural heritage resources, which may result in delays for development proponents, challenges for municipalities and potential violation of treaty rights.\n\u2022\tThe new definition for areas of archaeological potential notes that areas are to be evaluation using processes and criteria established under the Ontario Heritage Act. Theses processes and criteria do not exist and will need to be established for this definition to mean anything.\n\u2022\tThe new definition of heritage attributes limits the heritage attributes of a property to physical features on a property and exclude a range of intangible heritage attributes that may have a significant bearing on the cultural heritage value of the property. This definition does not align with the criteria identified for designation under Ontario Regulation 9\/06 which explicitly identify categories for evaluation based on intangible attributes. From a more practical perspective, it limits the ability of municipalities to address attributes such as views and viewscapes when evaluating a development proposal which may have significant impact on both a heritage property and streetscapes and landscapes in general and, by extension, a substantial impact on how communities develop and livability for their residents.\n\u2022\tSimilar to other amendments being proposed, the change of definition to heritage attributes also has the potential to impact indigenous treaty rights by limiting the scope of heritage attributes as many heritage attributes related to indigenous cultural heritage resources are intangible and cultural features. The inability to consider these within a development proposal may have substantial impact on indigenous cultural heritage resources and limit the ability of municipalities to fulfil their delegated obligations with regard to the duty to consult to mitigate impact on indigenous cultural heritage resources.\n",

        "comment":"June 7, 2023\nDear Sir\/Madam\nRE: Review of Proposed Policies Adapted From A Place To Grow And Provincial Policy Statement To Form A New Provincial Planning Policy Instrument.\nHello, I am the President of Pleasant Bay Camp, a charitable organization located in Prince Edward County. On behalf of the Board of Directors I want to thank the Province for this opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to PPS.\nThe Camp owns approximately 80 hectares of land in Prince Edward County.  Pleasant Bay Camp is a both a children's summer camp and a seasonal trailer park.  For 60 years, we have provided a safe place for children to attend summer camps in a safe and beautiful environment while also providing a place for families and individuals to unplug, have fun and build lifelong friendships.\nIn addition to the land we use for our Camp, we have land that is surplus to our needs. Our Camp and the surplus land are located in the rural area of Prince Edward County. The surplus land could be ideally used for rural residential development. The lands are within the Rural Waterfront Designation in the County\u2019s Official Plan. In this designation only one lot is permitted to be created by Consent and no plans of subdivision are permitted in the rural area. Our land is not designated Agricultural but it is in the Rural designation.\nWe have read the proposed changes to the PPS and the desire of the Province to increase the number of residential units. Specifically, the proposal includes a new policy that would permit creation of up to three residential lots from an existing agricultural parcel.\nCurrently, the County\u2019s Official Plan does not permit creation of new lots in agriculturally designated areas except for an existing surplus farm dwelling. We think that the policy to permit the creation of additional lots should be expanded to include other Rural designations and not only lands designated agricultural. This would include creation of lots by Consent or by Plan of Subdivision.\nThe current practice of limiting development of residential lots in rural areas has led to the increase in land values and limits the choice of housing options for residents of the Province.\nIn summary, the Board of Directors of Pleasant Bay Camp supports the direction of the Province in amending the PPS to permit more residential lots that will provide a greater choice to residents of Ontario.\nSincerely,\nPresident, Pleasant Bay Camp\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to leave a comment.  I would like to express my deep concern and strong opposition to the proposed development of precious farm land in our area. As a resident and passionate advocate for sustainable and responsible land management, I believe that the decision to convert farm land into other forms of development should be carefully reconsidered for the following compelling reasons:\nIntensification in Established Areas First: Before embarking on new development projects, it is imperative to focus on utilizing existing infrastructure and land in established areas. By maximizing the potential of these areas, we can minimize urban sprawl, reduce the strain on resources, and preserve the character and integrity of our community.\nPreservation of Agricultural Heritage: Our farmlands have a rich history and play a vital role in preserving our agricultural heritage. They provide a sustainable source of food, support local farmers and businesses, and contribute to the overall ecological balance of our region. Destroying these farms would not only lead to the loss of agricultural traditions but also disrupt the delicate balance of our ecosystem.\nEnvironmental Impact: Farm lands are not just vast green spaces; they serve as critical habitats for various flora and fauna, many of which are already under threat due to rapid urbanization. By converting these lands into developments, we risk irreversible damage to our local biodiversity, loss of open green spaces, and the fragmentation of wildlife corridors.\nCost of Infrastructure: Developing farm lands often requires significant investment in new infrastructure such as roads, utilities, and public services. This investment would be an unnecessary burden on taxpayers when there are existing areas that could benefit from infrastructure improvements and revitalization. We should prioritize optimizing the use of existing resources before committing to new and costly projects.\nFood Security and Self-Sufficiency: In an era of increasing global uncertainties, it is paramount that we prioritize food security and self-sufficiency. Our local farm lands contribute to the production of fresh, nutritious food that supports the well-being of our community. By encroaching upon these lands, we jeopardize our ability to meet the growing demand for locally sourced, sustainable food in the future.\nI urge you and your esteemed colleagues to carefully consider the implications of developing farm lands and explore alternative strategies for growth and development that align with the principles of sustainability and community well-being. It is essential that we embrace a long-term vision that takes into account the needs of current and future generations.\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will give due consideration to the concerns raised by myself and other like-minded individuals in our community. Your wise decision in this regard will help safeguard our environment, protect our valuable resources, and promote a prosperous and harmonious future for our area.\n",

For one thing, the only homes that would be built in such areas would be large, expansive and expensive mini-mansions, which would require obscenely expensive public tax investments to install water, sewer and power services, while doing nothing to solve the problem of housing affordability.  For another, there is NO NEED to attack our environment to make room for more housing.  Municipal long term plans effectively show how our communities can grow without crossing our countryside lines.  Beyond all the lies and misrepresentation that this is about housing rather than about satisfying the endless and vocacious appetites of developers, it borders on absolute insanity to pave over some of the best, richest, most productive farmland in the world, farmland we are going to need to feed us and our future generations as climate change and the need to stop the emission of fossil fuels results in far less transportation of foods from other nations, even other continents.  A government's role is to safeguard our Commons, to protect the population from the depredations of toxic capitalism, not to act as handmaidens togreedy corporate interests at the expense of everyone and everything else.\n",

Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (p. 10)\"\nIt is time to listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets.\nThere is simply no need for proposed policy changes which would:\n- Eliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to rein in urban sprawl;\n- Allow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n- Force municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n- Exempt lands that are the subject of Minister's Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n- Remove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and\n- Weaken and eliminate policies intended to address climate change.\nOntario is losing farmland at the shocking rate of 319 acres per day. The proposed new policies will make matters much worse and spell disaster for the lands and waters that sustain us.\nSprawl development will not solve current housing needs, as your government pretends.

        "comment":"Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters Submission\nProposed Provincial Planning Statement\nOntario manufacturers support bold measures to densify communities and improve the supply of housing, so our sector can get the workers it needs to be successful. There is an urgency in that regard. In the CME\u2019s 2022 Labour and Skills Survey, Ontario manufacturers reported that labour and skills shortages in the sector cost Ontario\u2019s economy almost $4 billion in the last year.\nSuch policies must be balanced by corresponding protections for employment areas. People need housing as well as quality employment in their communities to pay for this housing. As such, the proposed Provincial Planning Statement (PPS) should prioritize the utilization of existing residential areas for additional housing while minimizing the disruption to critical, scarce, and sensitive protected industrial lands.\nTo accomplish this, provincial land use policies must include clear provisions and safeguards to deter speculation and encroachments. These provisions are absent from the current draft PPS circulated for input. In fact, existing protections for employment and industrial lands are proposed to be removed, inviting more disruption for Ontario manufacturers in the future.\nTo provide appropriate certainty for companies to attract the investment needed to propel our sector forward, CME recommends the following:\n1.\tDesign areas of employment to fulfill the original policy intent of Provincially Significant Employment Zones (PZEZs) and push further where this framework fell short\nAccording to preliminary analysis conducted by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, there were hundreds of requests to convert industrial lands to residential in the Greater Toronto Area during the current Municipal Comprehensive Review (MCR). While a small number of conversions are being approved, these requests and the land speculation associated with them drive up property values, which increases costs and uncertainty for manufacturers.\nThis is happening because key industrial areas south of highway 401 in the Toronto area were omitted from the original designation of Provincially Significant Employment Zones (PSEZ) in 2019.  Further, the province never acted on the original policy intent which was to provide long-term certainty for these areas and protect them from re-zoning. Without enforcement mechanisms, the policy became less relevant.\nThe removal of the Municipal Comprehensive Review is expected to only exacerbate the situation, as it will mean conversion requests for employment lands can now occur at any time.\nWhat will replace the current framework for employment lands protection is not yet clear. On p.2 of the document outlining the implementation approach for the new PPS, there is mention of possibly identifying \u201cselect PSEZs or portions of PSEZs for the sole purpose of protecting lands exclusively for employment uses through an alternative approach (e.g., section 47 of the Planning Act)\u201d.  This lack of clarity suggests a willingness to let more industrial areas be converted in absence of an explicit guidance issued by the province to protect them.\nWhile CME is not opposed to the idea of using MZOs to protect employment lands, we are concerned that the current wording suggests a very limited scope for the policy. Such a laissez-faire approach is concerning, as the re-shoring of our industries is happening now, and once an industrial area is converted to residential use, it is usually gone forever.  We will not get another opportunity to get it right.\nTo be effective, an employment area framework must be comprehensive and provide enhanced protections to deter speculation driving up costs for manufacturing operations.  As such, the new process should:\n\u2022\tProvide ability for both municipalities AND the province to create new employment areas.  The province should retain a say and provide specific direction for planning in those areas to be implemented in coherence with economic development strategies. Consultation with other departments such as MEDJCT should also remained explicitly mandated when a subtraction from an existing Area of Employment is proposed.\n\u2022\tEnshrine long-term protection against conversion of industrial areas deemed critical (10 years or more) to provide additional planning and investment certainty. The longer areas are explicitly protected, the stronger the signal to companies that those areas be relied upon to operate, therefore increasing certainty that costly equipment and real estate will deliver a return on investment.\n\u2022\tRetain the current five-year limitation on when conversions can occur. Previously, the Municipal Comprehensive Reviews (MCR) allowed municipalities to preserve a holistic view by consolidating requests every five years. With this process effectively removed, conversions can now occur at any time, leading to a \u2018death by a thousand cuts\u2019 effect where incremental encroachments erode industrial areas over time.\n\u2022\tDifferentiate across various areas of employment types. Building on successful approaches in Sydney, Australia and the London area in the UK, the PPS should provide differentiated guidance for different types of industrial lands, moving away from the current \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach. Where it makes sense, light industrial can act as a buffer between heavy industry and residential, allowing intensification in a more coherent way.\n2.\tExplicitly prioritize the intensification of existing residential areas to end creeping encroachments on areas of employment\nThe proposed, modified definition of \u2018areas of employment\u2019 enables conversion of employment zones to residential development.  The implementation is left to municipalities, which in our experience often pursue short-term residential tax revenue maximization to the detriment of long-term economic planning. As a general principle, residential development should take place in designated residential areas before employment land conversions are permitted. Not doing so may result in an over-designation of residential land and undermine densification efforts, while also compromising the availability of employment lands.\n3.\tInclude broader provisions to include appropriate buffer space between residential and industrial areas\nSection 2.8.1.3. of the policy currently provides that residential uses shall be permitted on lands for employment outside of employment areas. In some case however, development on adjacent land may be problematic and lead to encroachments, impacting industrial operations. We would welcome more flexible language leaving room for appropriate exclusion zones to be created for other motives than public health and safety.  For example, a company may need to be further removed from residential developments if it requires nighttime operations, generates noise or emissions.\n4. Consult on a fully developed framework to protect industrial areas of employment prior to implementing the consolidated Provincial Planning Statement\nThe proposed process using s. 47 of the Planning Act (Ministerial Zoning Orders) needs to be fully detailed and take effect simultaneously with the new policy. At this time, there is simply too little known about the proposed framework to determine if it will be adequate and effective. We believe the policy must be crafted with explicit involvement of manufacturers to preserve operations and ability to attract investment for the future. There also needs to be a mechanism for ongoing consultations with relevant stakeholders on appropriate land use planning policies and designations\n",

        "comment":"Tay Valley Township supports a number of the proposals in the Draft 2023 Provincial Planning Statement:\n\u2022\tClimate change mitigation and adaptation are of great importance to Tay Valley Township. The Township has already experienced exacerbated flooding, as well as drought, and other devastating impacts such as the derecho, extreme heat, and increased disease carrying pathogens (Lyme disease, West Nile virus, etc.). Tay Valley has adopted a Climate Action Plan approved by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and has a Green Energy and Climate Change Working Group;\n\u2022\tRetention of natural hazards policies related to flooding and slopes is welcome because the Township contains 32 lakes and 9 rivers and many steep slopes;\n\u2022\tLow Impact Development as it relates to stormwater management through green infrastructure (swales, permeable pavement, etc.) will help to maintain the Township\u2019s rural landscape and supports biodiversity and is usually cheaper than pipes and concrete to manage stormwater;\n\u2022\tWatershed Planning (undertaking planning at the scale of watersheds) provides better protection of the Township\u2019s many lakes and rivers than planning by artificial municipal boundaries;\n\u2022\tWater Resource Systems planning provides for better ecological and hydrological integrity for the Townships 32 lakes and 9 rivers; and\n\u2022\tRetention of policies on human made hazards is welcome as the Township contains some brownfields, etc.\nTay Valley Township also has strong concerns about a number of proposals in the Draft 2023 Provincial Planning Statement:\n\u2022\tLoss of local control.  The 2020 Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) states that, \u201cMunicipal Official Plans are the most important vehicle for implementation of this Provincial Policy Statement and for achieving comprehensive, integrated and long-term planning\u201d. The 2023 Draft Provincial Planning Statement removed that statement and added section 4.3.3.2 which states that Official Plans and Zoning By-laws, \u201cshall not contain provisions that are more restrictive than policy 4.3.3.2 except to address health or safety concerns\u201d.  Tay Valley Township objects to this major curtailment of its ability to manage land uses throughout its geography.\nThe Draft 2023 PPS gives the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing the power to override municipal decisions (e.g., Official Plan, Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders) and impose the development of large carbon-footprint housing that is more profitable for developers to build instead of supplying affordable housing.\n\u2022\tLoss of rural landscape.  The 2023 PPS removed wording from the 2020 PPS that stated \u201crural settlement areas shall be the focus of growth and development\u201d and that sought \u201ccompatibility with the rural landscape\u201d. Tay Valley Township has eight Hamlets. The remainder of its geography is largely rural (approximately 70%) or agricultural land (approximately 30%). With the removal in the Draft PPS 2023 of the requirement for a comprehensive review to justify settlement area expansion, Tay Valley Township\u2019s landscape will face pressure to allow low density inefficient development that is the hallmark of sprawl (as defined by the Ontario Professional Planners Institute, the American Planning Association, and the American Farmland Trust).\nSprawl style land use has been shown repeatedly to cost municipalities more money in inefficient infrastructure costs than clustered development (e.g., in studies by Hemson, Smart Prosperity Institute, Bloomberg, and Strong Towns, etc.).\n\u2022\tThe Township would like to see language included in the Draft 2023 PPS requiring new settlement area designation and settlement expansion to demonstrate financial sustainability of infrastructure costs, avoid leapfrog development, and protect other provincial interests (e.g., mitigate climate change, protect biodiversity, provide a range of housing types, etc).\n\u2022\tThe removal of the requirement for consideration of \u201ccross-jurisdictional issues\u201d makes it unclear whether sprawl style development could occur on the borders of the Township without its input.\n\u2022\tLoss of agricultural land.  Agricultural lots makes up 27% of all lands in Tay Valley Township. The multiple dwellings and multiple severances proposed for the first time in prime agricultural land represent a seismic change in Ontario\u2019s land use policies. The impact of allowing three residential units on prime agricultural land and allowing for the severance of up to three lots in prime agricultural land would affect lots in two of the three geographic townships in Tay Valley Township (Bathurst and North Burgess) that have not seen their land use pattern change in decades.\nPermitting these severances and additional dwellings reduces Tay Valley residents\u2019 food security by allowing sprawl on the Township\u2019s most productive farmland.\n\u2022\tReversal of affordable housing. The housing stock in Tay Valley Township is currently 98% single family dwellings. The Draft 2023 PPS proposes to remove the 2020 PPS definition of \u201caffordable\u201d for both rental units and home ownership based on the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation\u2019s (CMHC) definition of \u201caffordable\u201d as a household paying no more than 1\/3 of their income for shelter.  This definition continues to be the standard for housing providers. Changing wording to encourage a range of housing options is a step backward in achieving affordable housing.\nA recent study by WSP for Lanark County indicated that less than half of the residents in Lanark County could afford to purchase a house in 2022. To provide a greater range of housing options, the province should support the County of Frontenac\u2019s proposal for it to provide a public utility for communal septic services so that multi-unit dwellings could be offered in Tay Valley Township\u2019s eight Hamlets.\n\u2022\tRemoval of Natural Heritage Systems. The natural heritage features of Tay Valley Township are unique.  Tay Valley Township lies at the southernmost point of northern Ontario ecosystems and the northernmost point of southern Ontario ecosystems.  It is the easternmost point of the biosphere known as The Land Between (headwaters for most of southern Ontario) and the westernmost point of the Frontenac Arch Biosphere.\nThe Draft 2023 PPS removes the entire section of the 2020 PPS covering the protection of Natural Heritage (including significant wetlands, woodlands and wildlife habitat). Instead a box with the statement that \u201cnatural heritage policies remain under consideration by the government\u201d was all that was offered. The Township believes that it is premature of the province to present a document designed to guide land use across the province without a section on natural heritage.\n\u2022\tIncreased environmental impacts.  Changes presented in the Draft 2023 PPS that allow more scattered low-density housing, reduce the previous 2020 PPS focus on waste management, and are silent on protecting biodiversity will undermine the ability of the Township to achieve the objectives in its Climate Action Plan.\n\u2022\tLack of Indigenous consultation. The Township sits on unceded Algonquin Territory. The province has not communicated with local indigenous communities about increasing sprawl within their traditional territories. In addition, the Draft 2023 PPS requires municipalities to undertake early engagement with Indigenous communities and coordinate with them on land use planning matters to facilitate knowledge-sharing, support consideration of Indigenous interests in land use decision-making and support the identification of potential impacts of decisions on the exercise of Aboriginal or treaty rights. However, without providing funding, the province is promoting a superficial approach to engagement.\n\u2022\tEconomic Impacts to the Township. The Draft 2023 PPS will result in increased costs to Township for undertaking liaison with the County Housing Manager, consulting with Indigenous interests; watershed planning; promotion of inefficient land use, and increased costs for infrastructure.\nFor specific responses to the ERO questions please see below.\n1.\tWhat are your thoughts on the policies that have been included from the PPS and A Place to Grow in the proposed policy document, including the proposed approach to implementation?\nThe Township is opposed to many of the proposed policies because they are a huge step backward in community and land use planning and the harm the policies will do does not even seem necessary. (See attachment 1.)\nReports by The Alliance for a Liveable Ontario, the Regional Planning Commissioners of Ontario (RPCO) and others have concluded that there is more than enough land within existing urban boundaries across the Greater Golden Horseshoe to accommodate and exceed the housing target set by the province. In fact, the RPCO concluded that Ontario has more than 1.25 million permits approved to build, but because there is no set timeline by which a developer must build the home they are not being built.\nThe Township is opposed to the policies that promote sprawl development by:\n\u2022\tremoving the previous requirement that planning authorities establish and implement minimum targets for intensification and redevelopment within built-up areas,\n\u2022\tallowing Settlement Area boundary expansion or creation of a new Settlement Area without a comprehensive review or the requirement to demonstrate the need for expansion,\n\u2022\tallowing 3 severances on Agricultural land plus 2 additional dwelling units for the primary dwelling\n\u2022\treducing density targets from 80 units\/ha to 50 units\/ha in 29 large and fast-growing municipalities.\nSprawl development has many negative consequences that planners have worked hard to prevent over the past 50 years in Ontario. Sprawl consumes farmland. Sprawl consumes nature whose features (plants, streams, insects, fish and animals) provide biodiversity.\nThis sprawl development is low density development (one home per lot) so it does not provide a wide enough range of housing types to produce affordable housing.\nThese sprawl policies do not provide enough density outside of Large and Fast-Growing Municipalities to support transit. Lack of access to transit means whole groups of residents cannot live in sprawl subdivisions which increases inequity. More cars and no transit means sprawl promotes a decrease in air quality.\nThe policy proposals for lowered density that increase sprawl also increase greenhouse gas emissions due to the need to travel by car to get to work or stores. The policy proposals related to sprawl increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere because the carbon sequestration provided by the plants is lost when they are built on for housing and roads. These policy proposals accelerate climate disruption and make it harder for Tay Valley Township to meet its Climate Action Plan goals for mitigation.\nThe policy proposals related to encouraging housing on farmland threaten food security which makes it harder for Tay Valley to meet its Climate Action Plan goals for adaptation to climate disruption.\nThe proposed wording change in Section 2.1.4 of \u201ccomplete communities\u201d rather than the previous reference to \u201chealthy, livable and safe communities\u201d focuses on combining uses (housing, stores, schools) which is a good thing.  But it leaves out any focus on promoting health and wellness, connection, programming for arts and recreation, etc.\nThe Township supports the retention of the policies on natural hazards, human made hazards and climate change.\nThe Township supports the added definition of Low Impact Development as it relates to stormwater management through green infrastructure (swales, permeable pavement, etc.).\nThe Township supports the added definition of Watershed Planning as undertaking planning at the scale of watersheds provides better protection of natural resources than planning by municipal boundaries.\nThe Township also supports the added definition of Water Resource Systems because recognizing that nature is best described through a systems perspective, rather than as discrete segments provides for better ecological and hydrological integrity.\n2.\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policy direction for large and fast-growing municipalities and other municipalities?\nAlthough the Township is not one of the 29 large and fast-growing communities, the impacts from the sprawl development that will occur from their reduced density targets will affect Tay Valley residents through increased air pollution, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and greater food insecurity.\n3.\tWhat are your thoughts regarding the proposed policies to generate housing supply, including an appropriate range and mix of housing options?\nThe Township is concerned that Proposed Policy 2.2.1(a) removes the former definition and requirement that planning authorities establish and implement minimum targets for the provision of housing which is affordable to low- and moderate-income households. Instead, planning authorities would be required to co-ordinate land use planning and planning for housing with Service Managers to address the full range of housing options, including \u201chousing affordability needs.\u201d\nThe Township is concerned that the 2023 Proposed Provincial Planning Statement removes the requirement for compatibility with the rural landscape.\nThe Township would welcome funding to undertake the province\u2019s requirement for \u201cearly engagement with Indigenous communities and to coordinate with them on land use planning matters to facilitate knowledge-sharing, support consideration of Indigenous interests in land use decision-making and support the identification of potential impacts of decisions on the exercise of Aboriginal or treaty rights\u201d. Without funding for Indigenous communities to undertake studies, it will be difficult to have meaningful discussions.\n4.\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policies regarding the conservation of  agriculture, aggregates, natural and cultural heritage resources?\nThe Township believes it is a dereliction of responsibility by the province that a new Provincial Planning Statement would be presented without any description of Natural Heritage Policies.\nThe Township shares the serious concerns of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, Dr. Wayne Caldwell, Guelph University and the Ontario Farmland Trust that the proposed changes to agricultural policies will make it easier to establish more housing within prime agricultural lands (see attachments 2 and 3).\nThe Township is concerned that Draft policy 4.3.2.4 would permit a principal dwelling associated with an agricultural operation \u201cto be located in prime agricultural areas as an agricultural use\u201d.\nThe Township is concerned that following from 4.3.2.4, Draft policy 4.3.2.5 would permit,\u201d subordinate to the principal dwelling, up to two additional residential units in prime agricultural areas, provided certain conditions are met, including compliance with the minimum distance separation formulae and the appropriate provision of sewage and water services (among other requirements)\u201d.\nWhile the Township supports additional residential units, it does not support those units then being able to be severed as is proposed by policy 4.3.3.1, meaning up to three lots may be created, potentially conflicting with the concept that they are subordinate to the principal dwelling.\nWith the estimated increase in number of houses that could be built on Agricultural land provided by Dr. Caldwell, the Township believes serious questions about groundwater supply, nitrate dilution capacity, and the ability of livestock operations to expand need to be answered before these policies are adopted.\nDr. Caldwell also questions whether these new lots will even increase affordable housing supply. \u201cWill most farmers take the opportunities quickly to sever and then sit on these lots for their children or for a rainy day?\u201d\nThe Township strongly objects to this form of development being proposed because it typifies sprawl with all its negative impacts.\nThe Township believes the province\u2019s policy on aggregates should be revised as, again, the amount of aggregate extraction approved is well over the amount needed well into the future.\nThe Township only has one designated heritage building and that is privately owned so the requirements for maintenance are not of particular significance.\n5.\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policies regarding planning for employment?\nThe Township does not have a concern with the changes to employment lands as it contains very little land with that designation. The Township does wonder if by scoping the test for employment conversion, some residential developments may be negatively impacted by being built beside industrial uses in employment lands.\n6.\tAre there any other barriers to, or opportunities for, accelerating development and construction (e.g., federal regulations, infrastructure planning and approvals, private\/public partnerships for servicing, provincial permitting, urban design guidelines, technical standards, zoning, etc.)?\nPerhaps the province should consider a lapsing date for development approvals if housing is not built since research by the Regional Planning Commissioners of Ontario reported that over 1.2 million units of housing have received development approvals but builders are not building these approved units.\nThe province should contribute funds to create co-operatives as they are one of the most effective ways to provide long term affordable housing.\nThe province should also require all new housing to meet Net Zero standards these standards produce lower heating and cooling bills thereby making housing more affordable.\nThe province should identify its land holdings that could be set aside to create affordable housing (using the Canada Mortgage and Housing Association definition).\n",

Myself and my entire family support lot severances and feel that it is up to the land owner to decide whether or not they make use of the lots that they choose to sever off of their farm. I agree that there should be every attempt to not use highly productive farm land in place of a severance but feel that it should be something that the county work with the owners of the land to find the best suitable placement of lots. I do not believe that farmers are asking for multiple severances rather 1 lot per 50 acres. We also support multiple lot severances on land that is not farmable. Example 3 acre parcel that can not be used for agricultural farming be granted severances for 6 1\/2 acre lots. This would have no impact on agricultural land and would help let others enjoy county living along with make use of land that is dormant and has no use. Just having the opportunity to use the lot as capital to expand one\u2019s operation or to simply leverage a loan against the lot will be instrumental in helping farmers keep up with rising inputs that are moving faster than the return. I am a member of OFA and I am very disappointed that they played a very significant roll in having the government pull farm severances out of bill 97. There support was from land owners that do not support lot severances because of the type of farming that they do. Very simple if you do not want to participate in severances than don\u2019t but for those that do than do not stand in there way. Again it should be up to the owner of the land.\n",

        "comment":"Our Family owns a farm of around 125 acres in Dufferin County, on a main county road.  Our hope has been to sever a small 1-2 acre site off of the farm (which not more than 1-2%) of the farm, so that we may build another home for our family.  A home where we could be closer to our family, able to help more on the farm, a place to retire and stay on the farm.    Dufferin County will not allow us to do this.\nI understand the municipality wishes to preserve farmland, and will only allow lot severances for businesses related to farming.  It's a good policy for farming, however it fails to recognize that families who own these farms want to share the land with their growing children, and keep a place to retire on the land they tended for years.\nThe policy also fails to recognize the need for housing in the province.  Urban expansion can't continue to be the only option for housing.  Not everybody wants to live in a packed urban environment.  I grew up on a farm. I want my daughter to have that upbringing, while also having some space to call our own. With land costs so astronomically unaffordable, there is no hope.  We also would not be able to afford the legal battle with the County to get them to change their policy or allow us an exception; a legal battle we would likely not win.  However my family farm can afford to give us a tiny 1-2% of the land without sacrificing crop yields.\nI hope that the government directs Dufferin County to allow for rural residential lot creation. And I really hope that they don't necessarily restrict this to a single severance.  A lot had been severed from our farm before our family purchased it in 1980.  That lot has remained empty and nobody can find the owner.  Waist of land.   We would build a beautiful home on a new lot, and have more options to keep the farm in our family.\nThank you for taking the time to ready my thoughts.\n",

The new changes that are proposed in the new Provincial Planning Statement puts many of those buildings at risk. The benefits of preserving these spaces and allowing for a continued window of 90 days to seek recognition, allows for the continued character of the downtown spaces, and can be reused in new and innovative ways without building completely new spaces. The use, reuse,and expanded use of heritage buildings is better for the reduction of greenhouse gases that are exacerbated during new construction projects and the construction of materials for these new builds - something which the reuse of buildings would create and use less of. It is also more financially responsible to retrofit and reuse buildings, contrary to common belief that such projects are more expensive, they are less expensive on a whole and allows for continued community connections to the spaces.\n",

        "comment":"This planning policy is based on a number of unrealistic assumptions about future transportation demands by mode, especially given the impact of Covid 19 on transit trip making, and our ability to dramatically increase the supply of new houses.   It has long been assumed that increasing residential and employment densities in proximity to rapid transit (any form) will lead to dramatic modal shifts to transit.   We have more than 30 years of historical data on the evolution of travel demand by mode (the Transportation Tomorrow Survey) that demonstrate that the observed increases in transit (TTC and GO Rail) were associated with the large increases in downtown jobs (mainly office based) that we saw in the post 1986 period, and that transit modal splits to non-downtown employment centres, including North York City Centre, did not increase as had been assumed, back in the 1980s.\nCovid and the dramatic increase in \"work from home\" supported by new technologies (e.g. Zoom) substantially reduced transit demands, as most downtown office workers were able to work from home.   This new reality led to empty GO Rail parking lots across the Region and dramatic drops in transit operating revenues (the main reason for the City of Toronto's revenue deficit).   While my friends in the transit industry are hoping for a \"return to normal\" it will be a new normal which, it appears, is being ignored by planners and policy makers (who would rather not deal with the financial and transportation implications of the \"new normal\").\nThe other area where planning assumptions are unreasonable relates to the belief that we can somehow double our annual production of new housing in Ontario and the GTA and that the only constraint is the land use planning process.   While I support the move to reduce delays in the approval of new projects and allowing more new housing to be built in urban areas,  the industry does not appear to have the resources required to accommodate the population growth targets associated with both new immigration targets and the decisions to dramatically increase the number of foreign students and temporary foreign workers that we let into the country in recent years.    No one at the Federal level seems to understand that we don't have enough houses, in the affordable cost ranges, to accommodate the new residents, most of whom have limited incomes.     It is about time for the Feds to get involved in supplying affordable housing to our current and new residents once again.\n",

        "comment":"Much of the PPS proposal is admirable as far as addressing current municipal\/provincial problems.  In perusing the content of PPS, we find sorely missing the extremely important concepts of conservation and sustainability.  Due to the limited amount of arable land in all of Ontario, the utmost effort to keep agricultural land as such, should be paramount in all development proposals.  As well, all developments need to have the view of sustainability.\nCurrently, the increase in auto traffic is not sustainable.  Far more public transit needs to be built, along with incentives to use it, which of course includes the building of shared housing (apartments, condos, and townhouses), and the intensification of land use for housing.  Incentives must be implemented to encourage folks to live near their work places.\nMore land should be included in the Greenbelt instead of taking some away or substituting undesirable lands in order to build single family homes.  Increasing the amount of single family homes is completely unsustainable.  As well, protecting the water table of the Greenbelt is becoming more urgent as the atmosphere is becoming drier and thus unable to renew that level regularly.  Alternate energy producers, particularly wind turbines must be built to supply the increased population expansion.  More charging stations should be dramatically increased as autos become more and more electrified.\nSince there's always a cost of implementation of all these proposals, a great amount of care must be taken not to take away funds from the most important of all govt. programs, which is health care.  Already this current govt. is far behind in allocating tax dollars to health care as evidenced in its promise of spending at least $1B more on health care, and even having its recent $1B surplus is proof  that there's already enough resources for that.  Using that surplus on building a new highway is entirely foolish, as a new highway leads to increased fossil fuel waste, pollution, less public transit use, and land taken away from agricultural or recreational use.\n",

        "comment":"Farm severances to open up development can be done while protecting the agricultural industry and here is a proposal on how and why it needs to be done.\nWe need to look at the past present and future of all farming types and classes.\nIt has been decades where agricultural lands were protected from severances. The \u201cspirit\u201d behind this decision was to protect farmland, but its intention has failed and we continue to loose farmland. It\u2019s what I call the \u201call or nothing\u201d approach.\nFarms are different across Ontario, dairy, meats, grain, produce etc. Soil and land topography are also different so to best serve the need of each farm then we need to collectively address this issue on a case by case issue.\nReasons why a farmer may want to sever comes for many different reasons, to allow a child to live near the farm operation to assist and work the farm, to transition the farm operation with improved technology without taking on high interest debt or to eliminate debt or taxes on transition to the next generation. Each reason ultimately is to keep farms farming.\nWhen a farmer meets these business frictions they may find themselves (under the current rules) in an \u201call or nothing\u201d situation. This may cause the farmer to have to sell. Most prime ag land is in southern Ontario and close to developing cities, as these farms go up for sale investors purchase the land and \u201cland bank\u201d the property for future development that is anything but agricultural.\nMy proposal is to treat prime ag severance similar to rural but with added protections.\nFirst the farmer must be a registered farmer working the land. The land must of been owned by the farmer for 10 yrs before the first severance and then subsequently every 5 yrs thereafter for any additional severance. The total maximum allowed to be severed cannot exceed 5% of the total land owned. (Ie 100ac farm will only be able to sever a total of 5 ac regardless how many lots make up the 5ac severed). Further to this the farmer must provide proof the land to be severed is not viable to farming and then relate how the severance will promote and sustain the farm business.\nThere was a recent article written about an Ontario farm that was forced to be sold due to business frictions and then it was developed into a housing development project. The son of the farmer regretted not being able to take over the farm and later moved onto a lot that was severed by another farmer who is still farming. The difference to notice here is one farmer could sever and one could not. The farmer allowed to sever is still farming and the other isn\u2019t and the land has now been lost forever. So is it not better in todays time of high land values and high inflation to be willing to sacrifice 5% of non viable land to save the remaining 95% to support agriculture?\nIn my opinion to say no to a solution that supports both views for new homes and saving agriculture by continuing with our status quo will only accelerate the reduction of the farming industry as it has over the past several decades especially in todays economic landscape.\n",

However, the current policies related to partial services has mired the opportunity for the Municipality of McDougall to expand the Nobel settlement area and reach the goals and objectives of the More Homes, More Choice Act, and More Homes Built Faster Act.\nSection 3.6 of the proposed PPS prescribes that \"Partial services shall only be permitted [ ] within settlement areas to allow for infilling and minor rounding out of existing development on partial services\u2026\"\nNo consideration has been given to the outdated policies with respect to partial services. The Municipality has been waiting for several years for developments to proceed to help offset the significant infrastructure costs associated with the municipality's capital investments in public water and roads. There is a demand to expand the Nobel area, and this is the Ministry's opportunity to review the policies related to partial services to allow for growth, make new land available, and build new homes.\nIn terms of partial services being municipal water, and private sewage systems; It is the Municipality's experience that in an effort to maximize private septic systems the users of municipal water are more cautious with water consumption than those on a municipal sewer system. Septic systems are expensive to replace, and owners will protect their investment.\nThe Municipality of McDougall is asking that the Ministry recognize, and update  the new Provincial Policy Statement to include policies to permit growth and development within areas that provide partial service.\n",

Steve Clark\nMinister of Municipal Affairs and Housing\n17th Floor, 777 Bay Street\nToronto ON M5G 2E5\nRE: ERO 019-6813, the Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nThe Township of Ramara has reviewed the proposed draft Provincial Planning Statement and offer the following comments for consideration:\nAgricultural Changes\n1.\tAdditional Residential Units \u2013 The Township has no concerns with the explicit allowance of additional residential units on agricultural properties.  Current policies in the Township allow for additional residential units, however there would be difficulties in allowing these structures to be severed.\n2.\tLot Creation \u2013 The Township of Ramara has great concern with proposed lot creation in the agricultural zone.  Our Agricultural land should be protected and promoted, allowing for lot creation will remove lands from farm production.  Lot creation in the agricultural designation would impact the viability of our existing and potential future agricultural industry.\n4.3.3.1.v is subjective.  There is no method for measuring \u201clower-priority\u201d agricultural lands.\nLand Parcels for farming purposes in Ramara are generally at most 40 hectares in land area. As measured in the Township records, an 8 km2 area contains 28 separate agricultural parcels as of January 1, 2023 (which does not include smaller residential lots created in the past).  Based on the new PPS legislation, there would be a potential for 84 new residential lots within this area.\nWith the average size of a lot created in the rural zone for residential purposes being between 1 and 2 acres to accommodate a well and septic, there is an estimated 84 to 168 acres of agricultural land that could be removed for residential purposes in this area alone.\nAn increase in lot creation in the Agricultural areas is not necessary in Ramara.  The Township contains several settlement areas with development potential, and rural areas that could accommodate this Rural Residential need.  In order to assist the municipality in achieving more houses as the province promotes, more support is needed in equipping these areas for development as opposed to allowing for severances on wells and septic spread throughout agricultural lands.\nIt should be noted no direction has been given for lands that had a surplus farm dwelling severed off for farm consolidations.  Will these properties also then be entitled to 3 severances since the zoning has had residential development restricted on the lands?\nIf the Province deems it necessary to allow for lot creation in the Agricultural zone, municipalities should have the ability to restrict the number of lots to be created allowing for the review of the impact of the agricultural sector and the justification behind requiring more than one residential lot.  There should also be a clear definition on how to prioritize agricultural uses to allow municipalities to identify areas where lot creation in agricultural areas is appropriate.\nRural Changes\n1.\tResidential development, including lot creation and multi-lot residential development. The Township of Ramara is pleased to see more flexibility with multi-lot residential development in rural areas where site conditions are suitable, and there is provision for appropriate services and infrastructure.  This allows for flexibility for the municipality to identify areas where appropriate residential growth can be established, opportunities for infilling or a rounding out of existing built up areas where there is land parcels that are not viable for farming.\nControls from a municipal perspective would be important to ensure that the municipality can identify areas in their Official Plan in consultation with applicable agencies regarding waste collection, infrastructure, Ministry of Environment and school boards etc.\n2.\tRecreational Dwellings. The Township has endured the difficulty with \u201crecreational dwellings\u201d not intended as permanent residences.  This stipulation can make it difficult for prospective home owners to obtain financing for projects.  This is also very difficult from an enforcement perspective.  Now that Residential development, including lot creation and multi-lot residential development is permitted in the rural zone, more direction should be provided on how to differentiate between the two development types would be identified and implemented.\nIn closing we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the ERO and draft Provincial Planning Statement.  While lot creation outside of settlement areas is desirable, protecting agricultural land and the pressures put on the Settlement Areas in our municipality are the key to striking a balance between our farming and residential communities.\nWalied Zekry,\nDirector of Building and Planning, CBO\nRamara Township\n",

It is my understanding from various sources that there is currently enough housing land available without cutting into additional agricultural land and the greenbelt.  Using existing designated lands and higher density residences where feasible would go a long way, as would developing new communities in currently underserviced areas of little agricultural value.  Why are new industries such as the Volkswagen battery plant on high quality farmland?  Create the jobs and people will follow.  As to the proposal for three severances on farms, I feel this will only lead to conflicts on land use and will be especially difficult for livestock farmers as well as limiting future options for existing farms.  I can speak to this from experience.  Perhaps allowing a retirement house of limited size to be built on a farm without a severance would be a better solution.\nMunicipalities  should not be the ones to have the final say on \"development.\"  There is too much potential for conflict of interest.\n",

        "comment":"Response to The Conservative Provincial Governments;\nProposal to Change the Provincial Policy Statement.\n20 June 2023\nI support the recent May 2023 Joint Statement of the 14 Ontario Agricultural Farm Organizations on Bill 97 and Proposed Provincial Planning Statement. They are all adamantly against the proposal to allow three lot severances per farm. I believe this is not only in the best interest of the farming community but for all Ontario residents.\nFarm lot severances historically were allowed so a retired farmer could remain on the farm in their home while passing on the family farm to their sons and daughters, so they could raise their family in their own home on the farm. They should remain within the farm community and not be sold to non-farmers. Alternate options have not been completely explored such as more temporary type housing. Farm Severances have never been based on good planning principles, taking the normal broad range of planning criteria into consideration. When residential expansion is proposed in the urban areas the planning process is very rigorous exploring all aspects of their creation both positive and negative, such as for example, municipal servicing. Over the years the cumulative impact of farm severances has resulted in mostly urbanites purchasing these residential properties. The proliferation of rural residents in Norfolk County has impacted farmers' normal agricultural practices negatively.  Urbanites see living in the rural area as some sort of idyllic living situation having no regard to the reality of how their neighbouring farms actually operate. These residential properties also are more expensive to provide municipal services, plus the urbanites complain about the lack of municipal services as provided in an urban setting. It is much more economical, efficient and effective to service residents in more compact areas such as existing urban centres like Simcoe, Waterford, Dover, Delhi and Port Rowan. There may also be opportunities to expand Hamlets but only when considered based on good planning practices and where the sale price is based on farm acreage prices going to the adjacent farmer while the remaining residential rate goes to a different municipal account to support all farmers.\nHaving a few residential lots in the rural area may not have been a problem in the past but the explosion of urban inhabitants in the rural area has created a negative imbalance. It seems ironic to me when governments in the past as well as farmers thought it was a good idea to create lot severances as their focus at the time was limited to the additional wind-fall of selling off an acre for a financial gain. But over time as more and more urbanites moved into the rural area, they began to put pressure on farmers and their normal farm practices. Urbanites complained about noise, smells, dust and use of chemicals on crops. Government and Farmers created this problem by allowing farm severance to occur easily and regularly. The situation came back to haunt them, having opened up a pandora's box. Now that the rural residents are established in the agriculture zone; what to do to stop their pressure on farmers. The farmer's answer a few years ago was to ask the conservative provincial government of the day to create the \u201cRight to Farm Legislation\u201d that outlined normal farm practices in detail to stop the rural resident from complaining; the very rural resident that were at one time welcomed by the farmers and government. Is this what they call having your cake and eating it too? The need for provincial intervention through establishing legislation, to in essence stop the rural residents from complaining, is clear evidence that lot severances negatively impact a farmers ability to farm, so why would this same government that created the \u201cRight to Farm Legislation\u201d want more urbanites in the agricultural zone placing more pressure on farmers? Encourage urbanites into the rural area then enact legislation to stop their complaints; a complete contradiction! If any one should know better it is the current Conservative Government. We have planning departments for a reason as they provide well thought out public policy for development that includes public processes and as much consideration of impacts, positive and negative, as possible. I see no evidence that allowing three severance per farm or any severances for that matter, is based on good Planning Principles.  Planning Departments look at what is in the interest of the greater public good. They are not focused on one or a few self interested groups or individuals. This is one of the hardest situations for Politicians. Pressure from stakeholder individuals or groups is hard to resist. Politicians must broaden their knowledge to include what is best for the long term and for the public greater good.\nDo not allow agricultural farm lot severances as proposed. The costs far outway the benefits of residential intrusion into the agricultural areas. Base the Provincial Policy Statement on Good Well Established Planning Principles.\nThank you for providing this opportunity to outline the problems associated with allowing rural lot severances.\n",

Hamiltons citizens wants the brown-spaces within the city developed before development is extended to farmland and green spaces. We have spoken out and now the province wants to take over. We don\u2019t want that kind of development period. We want housing but not at the cost of building more roads and infrastructure we don\u2019t need yet until all else has been done to build inside the existing city limits. Such as building below ground parking garages over existing parking lots, so people may live above in multi floored town homes or condos that can house larger families more densely.

        "comment":"I would first like to congratulate Mr. Doug Ford and his government for being forward thinking and having the courage and ability to do what is needed to make Ontario grow and deliver affordable housing to our communities.\nI am in favour of Bill 97 which offers alternative choices to the people of Ontario.\nBill 97 allows \u2026for the creation of three lots in a rural area\u2026I believe this will benefit the rural community by bringing people back to the country and revive the interest in farming.   It will not result in fragmented farming as is being suggested.  In fact, as an example, every farmer has some parcel of land that can\u2019t be farmed due to the inability of machinery to enter the area and poor soil conditions.   This portion can be used for development, bring families back to the farm or even better stay on the farm to continue farming.  This will also have the extra benefit of increasing the housing supply for Ontario at no cost to farming.\nWhen I first heard about Bill 97 I was excited because I have a parcel of land that is in a rural area (not part of the green belt) that was zoned rural residential first density.  In 1970, when development charges were not in existence I had to pay for the water rights to run in front of my property.  At that time we were told that the municipality understood the cost but stated we could have a few lots (five in fact), I agreed and paid.  To date that water line is still under utilized as additional homes are still not able to be built!!!  This parcel can\u2019t be farmed.  It is serviced with natural gas, water and hydro and homes cannot be built? The former government changed our zoning from rural residential to agriculture without consultation and due process. This wasn\u2019t fair and negated our rights as land owners in this country with no recourse.\nBill 97 would make sense for my parcel of land and many others in Ontario in the same situation. It will not remove land from farming (this land has not been farmed in the over 40 years that we have owned the land) and allowing this land to be used for residential purposes will only help increase the supply of homes in Ontario.\nCoupled with the services at the road this makes sense, creates infilling and completes the street with houses on each side.  Furthermore, this land is outside the green belt area and is completely surrounded by homes.  The point here, is that each parcel of land is different and unique and working together with all stakeholders will allow us to develop a plan that will benefit us not only today but in the future.  I would gladly join a group and help come up with a policy that can be applied fairly and equitable for all. Not a group such as OFA that favours or protects only ONE groups interest.  Or, for example, allowing a very substantial amount of homes that have already and continue to be built on\nOntarios PRIME agricultural lands in Niagara On The Lake.\nAs I stated above, each farm situation is unique.  I currently rent my farm out for cash cropping.  The payment is minimal and at best only 70% is workable so I do not understand the logic that the 30% that is not workable will remove farm land from farming.  Bill 97 will NOT fragment land for farming nor increase farm land price.   In fact, a small change in legislation can reduce or even eliminate speculation on farm land.  This will allow for some severances and assist with the shortages of housing that is currently making it difficult for people to find affordable housing.  After all, there is no way to deal with the housing shortage except to build more houses.\nCountry properties that are currently not used for farming and with services can assist in providing housing for our communities.    In addition, certain areas are more suitable for farming than others.  Is there any harm in allowing severances on these parcels of land that are fully serviced already?\nSolutions can be achieved by working together. I have lived in the country for a number of years.  In those years, I and my neighbours have respected farming operations.  No conflicts have arisen between farming and non farming communities. In fact, they co-exist and help each other tremendously as they are a close knit community.\nIn conclusion, Bill 97 will benefit all and allow us to utilize rural land that is currently not used for farming.  We need to work together for Ontario.  The removal of Bill 97 will allow us to fully maximize  parcels of land that are currently not used for farming in rural areas.  Protect farm land with rich agricultural ability, yes. However, allow infilling of land to address the desperate housing shortage by using available farm land that is not conducive to agriculture and is already fully serviced, should be allowed. This can only be achieved by working together and coming up with a plan that incorporates all stake holders.  Being committed to helping the supply of housing and making home ownership a reality for all requires all organizations including the farming community to realize that we need to bring more land into the mix.  All parties must work together to make this a reality!!!\n",

Haldimand County has concerns in particular with the following:\n1) The ability for farm parcels to sever 3 residential building lots.  This will significantly alter the agricultural landscape and negatively impact on the lands available for agricultural production. There would be the loss of thousands of acres of valuable land in Haldimand County alone, and hundreds of thousands of acres of land across Ontario.   It will bring a number of new and sensitive uses to the farming community.  There would be an impact to livestock operations and their potential to expand or simply operate without complaints from the residential uses.  Additionally, there will be increased pressures to municipal infrastructure to provide basic services to these rural areas.\n2) Removal of the requirement for a MCR for Settlement Boundary expansions.  This change could again see the potential for a number of developer driven settlement area expansions on agricultural lands.  this could see the reduction of prime agricultural lands and the increase of inefficient urban sprawl. There could be substantial impacts on municipal servicing plans and land supply that exceeds need and population projections.\n3) Removal of intensification targets and residential intensification.  This could also result in additional lands being required to accommodate the projected population targets, thus putting pressure on urban boundary expansion, which in turn, could mean the loss of additional farm land.\n4) Change in the definition of Employment Area. This change will have a limiting effect on municipalities and remove a municipalities ability to consider discretion when evaluation employment uses.  This could result in incompatible land uses or loss of key lands for development.\nAdditional commentary and analysis is included within the attached report.\n",

We understand that the proposed changes by the Province are made with the intended outcome of improving the lives of Ontarians by increasing housing supply. We commend your efforts in this regard. However, housing supply needs to also include leadership on the delivery of affordable housing and ensure that the livability of the Region is maintained or enhanced.\nAt its meeting of June 14th-15th, 2023, Toronto City Council considered the staff report (Attachments 1 to 2) and adopted the recommendations which address the feedback being requested through the ERO posting. The Decision History (Attachment 3) is enclosed that contains the adopted recommendations, together with the written communications from interested individuals submitted for City Council\u2019s consideration (Attachment 4).\nThe City has concerns with the proposed policy changes and these concerns are articulated in the enclosed Staff Report, in particular the fundamental changes to the growth management framework that has guided development and infrastructure investments across the Greater Golden Horseshoe. The proposed repeal of the Growth Plan would treat the region generally the same as any other part of the Province despite it being home to 70% of Ontarians. Virtually all the foundational policies have been eliminated and the overall policy intent of establishing a regional plan to coordinate planning, resource and infrastructure management efforts has been abandoned.\nIt is our contention that the wholesale changes contained in the proposed Provincial Planning Statement are not necessary or needed, as they would replace the predictability and comprehensiveness of the current system in favour of a system that encourages one-off decision making and increased land-use speculation.\nThe City remains committed to working with the Province and other municipal partners to ensure\nthat the housing needs of our communities are met without compromising agricultural lands, employment areas, the health of the natural environment, and the investments in infrastructure made over the past several decades. City staff welcome the opportunity to work with Provincial staff and other municipal partners to assist in refining the proposed policies as there is a potential that they may not, when operationalized, achieve the intended outcomes.\n",

        "comment":"Regarding agriculture and housing, I support allowing owners of agricultural lands to create additional housing WITHIN their lot boundaries, to provide housing for family members, farm workers, etc. Such housing could also add to the rental stock of an area, without increasing demand for services such as water and sewer systems. Such housing would need to be accommodated with, and limited by, existing or new wells and septic systems. For example, a new dwelling could share an existing well with an existing dwelling, if close by. Most farms are large lots that can easily support a second or third dwelling within the same lot, without exceeding the potential capacity of septic systems, etc. In fact, most farms already deal with large quantities of animal waste that dwarf the inputs from another dwelling or two. Historically, this often happened, that a secondary dwelling could be built for family members, and another for farm workers. Modern land use planning has often restricted such uses, and required severances to create new lots instead. That has had serious implications for farms, with the lots\/dwellings being sold, fragmentation of farmland, people moving to the area who are bothered by typical farming practices, etc.\nCreating this housing within the existing farm lot will avoid many of the concerns related to severances, people by unwilling to live near farms, servicing requirements, etc. It could also generate much needed income for farm families, which are often struggling and require off-farm income to get by. This could provide on-farm but non-farming income, which is compatible with continuing farm operations.\nI do not support encouraging severances of agricultural lands to allow for creating new lots for housing, as that contributes to problems such as those referenced to above.\nIn general, I'd like to see continued strong protection for Greenbelt lands, natural habitats, and agricultural lands. Housing needs should be met through increasing density wherever possible. Building more large homes on the outskirts of cities will not solve the housing crisis.\n",

I find the rush to strip protection from heritage buildings, conservation areas and cultural sites problematic.\nMr. Ford, your government has reiterated that you will hit the 2030 target for 2030 to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 30% from 2005 levels.  I am asking you to keep that promise.  One of the ways that you would be able to accomplish this goal would be the refitting and reusing heritage buildings.  One of the biggest contributors to GHG is the concrete and steel industry.  The demolition of buildings are also contributors.  There is no way to offset the GHG that is created in this demolition, no matter how energy efficient you design the new construct. Add into this the emissions that are created hauling waste away, bringing new material to the building site and construction of the building and GHG levels start to climb even higher.  It is hard to imagine how you will keep that promise with this destruction of heritage buildings.\nHeritage is an important facet to the education and grounding of society.   To deny the background of those components that make up our citizens is to deny the pieces that contributed to the building of Ontario and Canada.   Our Indigenous neighbours, settlers, immigrants and 2SLGBTQIA people have given their hard work to enhance the cities, towns, villages and hamlets they live in.  These include buildings, cultural sites and natural areas.\nWhen we take away the importance of our heritage, we lose pieces of ourselves.  We will be less if we deny the importance of these places and take away the protections for them.\nThere is more to our province than the next big tower or mega house.  While housing is a critical part of our societal obligations, our heritage doesn\u2019t need to be bulldozed in order to achieve this.  Repurposing and adapting existing buildings will not only protect our history but our environment.  Instead of depleting existing resources and creating a waste disposal emergency, we could develop an industry that repurposes building and become worldwide leaders in protecting our environment.\nPlease reconsider the proposal and include the necessary protections for our heritage and history.  Help us become world leaders in heritage and environmental protection.  Help us embrace the past that leads to our future by weaving the heritage sites into that destiny.  Please reconsider.\n",

I also believe that restricting farming practices primarily because of neighbouring residential development is unproductive. Unfortunately we are at the point where somebody is going to identify a problem with virtually every piece of land that is developed. The lowest levels of concern for protection must be dropped.  At the same time, we can make better use of the land that is developed with higher densities.\nAlthough municipally serviced land can support much higher density, there is also value to increasing the density of rural serviced land that has already been developed and developing land that is not sensitive or ideal for modern farming practices. Blocking all rural development wastes this potential. Protecting an entire township or municipality without regard to land quality or shape is not productive. Some rules may also be outdated. Do we really need lots to be a minimum of 1 acre with the new technology that is available for septic systems? Is the cost of supplying municipal water to smaller settlements justified by the increase in density that it allows?\nWe have good, smart people in place in our local municipalities. Can we not use this talent to help implement \u2018best practices\u2019 instead of solely determining if something falls within some all-encompassing, politically motivated policy.\nTo the extent that these new policies allow our local talent to actually use some judgment and develop innovative solutions, I say amen!\n",

Wow e the governments provincial policy statement released on April 6 2023 is an excellent document which enables our province to deal with the current housing crisis which we are currently experiencing in the Province.\nThe 3 residential lot proposal for farm parcels is a very reasonable and sound proposal that allows for farm properties the option of severing lots along road frontages to deal with future generational farmers in the family and at the seeking allowing farms to attract full time farm employees.\nOntario is in an excellent position when food security concerns are taken into account.  During the  last 30 years agriculture has doubled productivity with plant breeding, they have increased livestock production with improved genetics and vegetable production has more than doubled along with year greenhouse vegetable production has increased ten fold in the same time time frame. Small increases in global temperatures are providing  new farming opportunity\u2019s in Northern Ontario and Western Canada opening new tracts of farmland.\n Rural Ontario can do a small part in Ontario governments goal of building  1.5 million homes by 2031.\n Rural lot severance would would not be mandatory for landowners to sever lots and many  farmers will not sever lots.  There are many tiny parcels of non viable farmland that can be turned into housing which can be a benefit to all Ontarians during this housing crisis we are currently facing. If the housing crisis subsides then we will have done a small part in achieving our goal to ensure every person in Ontario has access to affordable housing.\nTo satisfy all stakeholders some powers could be given to individual municipalities to enact a more restrictive severance policy in response to their own grower groups or demographics.\n Additional housing units situated  within existing farm operations or in between the barnyard  animals is not a safe nor healthy environment  for raising a family with children as farm operations are large in size with very large machinery and transport trucks moving in and out of farm operations all hours of the day.\n Horticultural growers have a high demand for on farm labour and full time employees like to live near the workplace without having to live in the workplace. This may explain some of the increasing reliance farms are having on offshore labour when some Canadians may be willing to accept employment with full time potential.\nHorticulture producers often  supplement their income and sell their farm products off the farm and some rural residents will become regular  customers via roadside stands pick you own operations etc.\n  Small rural municipalities can get a property tax boost through farm  lot severances without having to put more strain on municipal infrastructure ie water, sewer, sidewalks, roads in -ground services.\nThe lot severance proposal should be enacted as first proposed on April 6 2023. The rural municipalities could  be given the flexibility to be able to limit the farm lot severances making the provincial standard a maximum allowable standard. That would make following the provincial guidelines at the maximum rate a voluntary program rather than a mandatory one satisfying all parties involved. I encourage the provincial government to implement the Procincial Planning Statement that was introduced on April 6,2023 as written\n",

In urban areas homes might have third stories once renovated and structurally improved.\nThe province should be doing more to assure the affordability of food and that wages keep pace with inflation. This would make existing homes more affordable.\nIt is also possible to provide homeowners with renovation grants and credits so that they can create granny\/ adult child flats in their homes.\nConstant sprawl must stop. Landgrabs must stop. The Greenbelt must remain protected and out of the hands of developers.\nThe Ford government needs to leave the Greenbelt alone.\n",

        "comment":"I am a farm owner in Norfolk County.  I ask that you reconsider doing away with the lot severances on farms in Ontario.  As members of a small community in the west end of the amalgamated Norfolk County, we watch as enrolment in our schools decline and the numbers attending our churches and members volunteering in our nonprofit organizations dwindle.  In recent years, people moving into Norfolk have been the only increases we have seen in these numbers.  Many of our children are moving into town to find jobs and housing for their young families.  In many cases, these towns are not located in our county.\nAs an owner of several farm properties, which had formerly belonged to other families, I can attest to the fact that there are more non farmers living in on-farm housing now than there are actual farmers.  My husband and I, for example, own farms which had belonged to six former farm families.  We have owned up to five homes on various farm properties which were rented out to non-farm owners.  a large number of our neighbours are not farmers and, for the most part, we all get along.  Many are tradespeople which are desperately needed here in Norfolk and, indeed, all over Ontario!  Many have roots here in Norfolk but not all.  In my opinion, the OFA is creating a great deal of  fear amongst its members with regards to people building and living next door.  We know for a fact that this is a non issue and that the real threat to rural Norfolk is the decline in numbers of people able to build and live here in the country leaving us stagnant and leading to us not being able to access services which availability in in urban centres is taken for granted.  High speed, or indeed, any internet service is one thing that comes to mind!\nCurrently we own two homes besides the one where we reside.  One of those homes is inhabited by our former hired hand and his wife.  We have recently semi-retired and built a new home on the corner of one of our properties and, in order to do so, we were told we must change the designation of the existing house on the property to a bunkhouse.  The couple that resides in this house is older and  lower income.  He still works on a farm here in Norfolk.  Their family has expressed interest in purchasing this home in which they have lived for about ten years.  Changing this house to a bunkhouse does not save farm land and it could potentially cause an older, lower income family to lose their rental home at a time when rent for an equivalent house would be unaffordable for them.\nThe land where we built our new home is not highly productive farm land.  It is blow sand and the deer are great in number to the extent that crops we have endeavoured to grow on this land are rendered unsalable after the deer have nibbled on them.  We were organic vegetable producers and we had an issue with the deer munching on our squash and pumpkins on this location.  Many farms have such pieces within their acreages.  Would it not make sense to allow homes which would provide and manage their own water and sewers rather than putting further strain on these resources within time limits?\nAnother consideration is the shortage of employees available to work on our farms.  Gone are the days where the farm family can bring in a crop with just  family members and a few extras.  The labour needs on the farms in \u201cOntario\u2019s Garden\u201d  today are huge with many vegetable farms needing 50, 100, 200 or more employees every season.  We all compete for the same local labourers.  We run our farms short staffed and cannot possibly find adequate numbers to work on our farms and are increasingly needing to rely on more and more temporary foreign workers.  If we had more families building homes in rural areas in Norfolk, there would likely be more young people looking to work on area farms as the children of these families would work at summer jobs on the farms.\nAs well, more people coming into the rural area would drive the local economy as more people would support local farmers markets and other attractions within the area.\nThese are just a few of the reasons why I believe that allowing more severances on farm properties makes sense for the farm communities, the counties and for Ontario!\n",

        "comment":"I have great concern about the proposal.\nI live in a rural community surrounded by prime agriculture land interspersed with manage forest, wetlands, and residential areas.\nOur community recently had to fight a proposed development to the level of the Ontario Land Tribunal (OLT) to the cost of over $60,00.  It would have put a highway-commercial use on our inadequately-maintained rural road on a lot that included wetland and prime agricultural use.  Our municipal government had done their due diligence over more than 2 years and declined the development, but the landowner appealed to the OLT.  Due to the rules that don't allow citizens to represent themselves thru that process, the cost was over $60,000 due to the lawers and experts.  Thankfully the OLT upheld the decision of our local government, but there was always the risk that they would overrule.  And what a large amount of money to have to spend on such a thing.\nOur local governments already have much freedom in where they can develop for housing, and it is quite disturbing that the plans made at a local level, by people who know the land and community, can be overruled by the provincial government which is unaware of those local details.\nMy biggest concerns involve the loss of local communities (due to both safety and the nature of how a community changes when housing and business development grows at an accelerated pace that doesn't fit the location) as well at the complete lack of regard for local food self-sufficiency.\nWhen it comes to local food self-sufficiency, if our prime agriculture and protected lands can continue to be dictatorially used for housing developments, where are we to grow our food?  We have a beautiful province that has the ability - if supported through policy and education of the public - to grow and raise the vast, vast majority of our own food year-round.  If these policies go through, we will be relying even more on shipping food in (often from the US and other countries) which impacts not only our immediate health and pricing, but obviously is not a reliable method of feeding our communities when there are supply chain issues (or even just a week of snow storms!).  We should be focusing on building housing in the already-developed areas and allowing small and medium sized farms to flourish around them.\nThere are so many empty buildings in both cities near my house that could easily be made into affordable housing.  Stop the condos and paving over paradise!  Think of our current needs, and the needs of our children.\n",

        "comment":"As a small farm owner in Hamilton I agree with the proposal to allow severance of farm land in Ontario. This would allow families to stay together through generations on the same land and find affordable housing. However, large farming organizations \"representing\" farmers including the National Farmers Union, the Beef Farmers of Ontario and Dairy Farmers of Ontario will be against the proposal. The proposal will make it more difficult for corporate farms to consolidate small farm land and operations, consequently resulting in less cashflow being received by the governing bodies from these large farm organizations. Publicly, these bodies have claimed the proposal will materially decrease the total agricultural output of the province, however this is simply not true. If the farm owner choses to sever, the newly built home would likely take up less than 1% of the total property given the average lot size of farm land in Ontario. Lets not confuse large scale developments with family homes. The Government should sit down with actual farm owners who are most impacted by the proposal, rather than profit focused governing bodies.\n",

To continue this practice of keeping the land in the family, we will need to have land severed for our sons so that they can continue to live on the land and keep it as a farm.\nMany people that own land used by the farmers no longer farm but rent their land out.

However, the Township is concerned with some of the proposed changes to the Provincial Policy Statement and Growth Plan contained in Bill 97 The Township is also unclear on certain proposed policies\/amendments introduced through the new Provincial Planning Statement.\nThe Township is supportive of the general move to combine the two Provincial planning documents into a single document and the streamlining of the planning framework.\nThe Township is concerned with the impacts that the ERO posted proposed policy may have on the agricultural land base, including the fragmentation of agricultural land and increased non-agricultural uses into the agricultural areas.  Mulmur values its agricultural heritage and contributions to the food chain and understands the importance of having a protected prime-agricultural area.  The Township has received correspondence from Minister Clark regarding the removal of the proposed severance policy and is hopeful that a revised policy statement will address the Township\u2019s concerns regarding fragmenting farmland. The Township supports the concept of allowing more residential units on a current farm site, but favours a clustered approach on existing lots over the creation of additional non-farm parcels.\nThe Township is concerned that the strong policies of the growth plan, directing the majority of residential growth to fully serviced urban areas is being weakened and replaced with rural settlements and unsustainable sprawl.\nThe Township has had an opportunity to review the recent Natural Heritage policies and note a decreased level of protection within the definitions.  The Township is happy to see that there is no policy proposed to prevent the Township from applying a greater level of protection than what is proposed in the PPS.\nAfter reviewing the proposed policy, the Township is seeking the following:\n\u2022\tClarification regarding additional study requirements\/plans for watershed, natural heritage identification, stormwater, energy\/climate, etc.\n\u2022\tClarification required whether surplus dwelling severance are in addition or within the permitted three lots to be considered from agricultural properties. Additional consideration on how this may impact rural lot creation is warranted.\n\u2022\tClarification on whether municipalities could set minimum parcel size for farms or utilize other tools to ensure that prime agricultural soils and future livestock farming is protected.\n\u2022\tClarification on revised terminology of \u201cparcel of urban land\u201d to be replaced with \u201cparcel of land\u201d (related to additional dwelling units being permitted through draft policy 4.3.2), and further clarification related to farm help dwelling policies.\n\u2022\tClarification is required on whether additional lot creation policies would apply to previously sterilized lands.\nThe Township of Mulmur supports the movement towards housing affordability but feels very strongly that maintaining a strong agricultural sector and local food supply is very important and should not be sacrificed if opportunities exist in urban areas and northern climates.  The proposed Provincial Planning Statement should be reviewed with a long-term priority of a stable food chain and intensified urban areas.\n",

It also may result in creating barriers and restricting the future ability of livestock operators to expand or build new livestock barns and manure storage facilities, while having to meet the Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) setback to new residential uses\/severances.  While the need for new housing opportunities is recognized and supported, this may be more appropriately achieved through the Province\u2019s proposed policies for expansions to Settlement Areas.  The Township of Augusta would respectfully request that the Province give consideration to reducing the proposed policy for new residential lot severances, currently proposed at (3) three on a farmed lot, within the prime agricultural area.\n5.\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policies regarding planning for employment?\nFurther guidance on permitted uses in employment areas is requested.  The Township of Augusta has a large Industrial District and the new provincial policies will result in creating some non-conforming uses in this area, or certain uses may need to be redesignated to an alternate Official Plan designation.\n6.\tAre there any other barriers to, or opportunities for, accelerating development and construction (e.g., federal regulations, infrastructure planning and approvals, private\/public partnerships for servicing, provincial permitting, urban design guidelines, technical standards, zoning, etc.)?\nThe Township of Augusta is pleased by opportunities for new housing, however, a shortage of qualified building inspectors and building officials is an ongoing challenge for municipalities.  Provincial assistance\/funding is requested for the training of new building inspectors and building officials to ensure timely oversight in implementing Ontario Building Code standards for new construction.\n",

I urge you to retain all PPS and Growth Plan policies that are designed to curb sprawl and protect farmland and natural areas.\n",

        "comment":"Thank You Doug Ford for realizing that there is a serious housing problem with both supply and affordability, Supply is only one of the reasons that housing has become un-affordable for our next generation, but it is something that can be addressed and is being addressed with this Bill.\nWith respect to BILL 97 (Specifically speaking to: Rural land severance\u2019s)\nIt is time that the Ontario government stepped in to make many of our rural townships and municipalities allow in limited numbers, rural land severance\u2019s.\nWe have a small farm in rural Oro-Medonte (100+ Acres) and would very much like to sever off 4 small lots for our 4 children and eventually their families but currently there is no way for this to be done. Many who are opposed to this bill speak of Urban sprawl and breaking farms up into small building lots and destroying our farmland which is ridiculous since they are proposing only 3 building lots. By passing this bill it will allow our next generation to continue to live in the community and on this farm; our farm and even make it possible to hang onto the farm for their children.\nTo say this will threaten farmland and therefore future food production is ridiculous. (3 Building Lots..) ?? When the OFA spoke for its 38,000 rural Farm Families, this was not the voice of my farming family.\nIt is very Na\u00efve to think that the severing of 3 building lots is destroying farmland and food production. What is very clear is that it will give small to medium sized farmers like myself options to preserve what little farmland we have and make it more affordable for the next generation of Farmers. Yes, some farmers will sell a lot or 2 which will also allow them to perhaps hang onto their farm while providing a building lot to welcome another young family to a rural farming community although sometimes I feel like this is not what the rural municipalities want.\nPlease listen to voices of the small and medium sized farmers as well for whom this Bill could have a profound impact on their families, future and livelihood because it is hard to believe that with a 100 acres of farm land that I am still unable to provide my children with even a small building lot.\nPlease make this work for the middle class rural farming families and open up land severances.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"RE: The Provincial Planning Statement 2023 and Residential Lot Creation in Prime Agricultural Areas\nWe are hardworking Ontario public servants who presently live in Oxford County with our two young children. We are employed as a public educator and as legal counsel for the Ministry of the Attorney General.\nWe are middle-class Ontarians who have been affected by the current housing crisis in Ontario. Our annual incomes combined do not go far enough for us to purchase an existing home nor afford a plot of land to build a house for our young children to grow up in. Our children are growing, our house is not large enough, and we cannot afford to move to a property better suited for our family.\nWe were born and raised in farming families and grew up on tobacco\/ginseng farms in Norfolk County. Our parents are in their mid- to late-sixties and own about 80 acres of farmland in a prime agricultural area in Norfolk County. At present, Norfolk County\u2019s Official Plan and Zoning By-law does not permit lot severances on prime agricultural land, except for residential surplus dwelling severances. While we see neighbouring counties like Oxford and Brant County enabling farmers to sever lots from their farms, Norfolk County has one of the strictest policies regarding severances.\nWhen our parents heard about Bill-97 and your proposed Provincial Planning Statement 2023, they were very happy and willing to provide us with a parcel of their farmland to build a home. They know we need a larger home, and they want to see their grandchildren grow up near them on the farm. Their intent is to engage in succession planning\u2014not to profit by selling lots of farmland to persons outside the family.\nWhile farmers clearly expressed their distaste on s. 4.3.3 of the proposed Provincial Planning Statement 2023 which would permit the creation of three new residential lots on existing prime agricultural land, this provision should be amended rather than eliminated. Perhaps permitting three severances for new residential homes on an existing farm was too much.\nThis issue was canvassed by Bobbi Ann Brady, the Member for Haldimand Norfolk, during Question Period on May 30, 2023. With respect to Bill 97 and the Provincial Planning Statement, Brady stated: \u201chow do we go from zero (0) severances to three (3) severances per farm? . . . Farmers see the value in one succession planning lot but three?\u201d\nIn our respectful opinion, s. 4.3.3 should be amended to allow for \u201cone new residential lot\u201d to be created after January 1, 2023, from an existing parcel of prime agricultural land. The rest of the provision should remain in the language as currently proposed.\nAllowing a single severance would bolster your commitment to addressing the housing crisis in Ontario, while also conferring parents the ability to engage in succession planning by providing us with a parcel of farmland to build a home and raise our family. The purpose of a single severance is certainly to keep us and our children on, and around, the farmland we grew up on.\nPermitting one severance will clearly lead to the loss of some farmland. However, there needs to be a balance between farmers\u2019 property rights and the protection of prime agricultural land. The goal should not, and never be, to allow free reign for developers to overdevelop farmland. While farmers should not simply be able to sever parcels of their farmland to profit, what farmers do need is the capacity to sever a parcel of land from their farm for their own families.\n",

        "comment":"Hello, we are property owners of an 8.6 acre parcel of land in Fenwick. We are currently navigating a zoning issue with the Town of Pelham after we recently learned that the zoning for our property had changed without any notification or consultation with us. An environmental protection one (EP1) restriction was placed on 90% of the property and we are now prohibited from any type of development on the land.  We have also learned that our property has now been designated as a significant woodland. This is due to a recent zoning\/planning overhaul undertaken by the Region of Niagara and the Town of Pelham.\nWe feel that these very restrictive changes are a situation of disguised expropriation by the Region of Niagara and Town of Pelham. These changes have affected many home and property owners and at no time were we personally notified of the changes, therefore preventing us from voicing our thoughts.\nThrough speaking with an environmental consultant we have learned that our property is located within the Greenbelt Plan area but is not part of the Provincial Natural Heritage System. The property is designated as Protected Countryside, and the policies under section 3.2.2 of the Greenbelt Plan (2017) apply.\u00a0 These provincial policies permit some disturbance to woodlands as long as there is no negative impact.\nHowever, the property also falls under policy section 3.1.9.6 of the New Niagara Regional Official Plan (2022). These Regional policies prohibit any disturbance to Significant Woodlands.\u00a0 However, the Region is required to implement the Greenbelt Plan natural heritage policies, so our question is: will municipalities have the ability to implement more restrictive policies than the province once the proposed Provincial Policy Statement has been approved?\nOur concern is; if this is the case, the implications for us as landowners would be much more restrictive compared to others across the province.\nAs we understand it, the updated natural heritage policies that the province is proposing do still allow development within a significant woodland, provided there is no negative impact to the feature or its functions which an environmental impact study would have to demonstrate.  This means that the Region of Niagara will have in place more restrictive policies for development within natural features than the province does, which clearly can impact property value and\/or developability for landowners who have owned wooded residential lots prior to the Regional changes.\nThank you for your consideration.\n",

        "comment":"RE: Agricultural Lot Severances, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023, section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments.\nComments regarding section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nI am concerned about proposed s.4.3.3 which permits the severance of three residential lots from parcels in prime agricultural areas. This poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. As it currently reads, this policy could apply to any parcel of agricultural land, regardless of its size or whether it was previously severed before January 2023. Given that there are 48,346 farms4 and as many as 170,000 farmland properties in Ontario5, the province could see anywhere from 145,038 to 510,000 lots severed from agricultural properties. Therefore, if each lot is approximately 1-acre in size, this policy alone would be responsible for removing anywhere from 1.25% to 4.3% of Ontario\u2019s finite agricultural land base.\nThe use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays6. While I appreciate that proposed s.4.3.1 states \u201cPlanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach,\u201d this policy does not provide the strength needed to require agricultural systems, and appears to be in contradiction to the permissions of s.4.3.3. When you factor in s.4.3.2.5, which permits up to two additional dwellings in prime agricultural areas, this could result in as many as 1.5 million dwellings on newly severed lots in agricultural areas. This will lead to significant farmland fragmentation, which is contradictory to the purpose of an agricultural system, and will cause significant disruptions to surrounding agricultural operations.\nMoving to rural areas often means embracing the realities of agricultural living, such as noise, dust, odors, and farm equipment on the roads. Unfortunately, this leads to land-use compatibility conflicts that are difficult to mitigate once residential units are developed in agricultural areas. This poses significant challenges for farmers, especially when Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) is not properly followed during development approvals. This is concerning given that Bill 23 prevents third-party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal, making it difficult for nearby farmers to address MDS concerns. Additionally, constructing residential units up to the MDS line will limit any future growth of the agricultural operation, threatening the future viability of animal agriculture in Ontario.\nFurthermore, additional residential units on prime agricultural areas will result in an increase in water usage from underground aquifers. Three additional lots, including three additional residential units would put a significant strain on the water usage and increase the likelihood of water source issues for both the residents and the agricultural operation. Agriculture uses significant amounts of water to irrigate crops and provide water to livestock. Although a large percentage of water is returned to the source, often it has been changed and carrying soil and dissolved compounds7. With less water available in the aquifer, any contaminants will be more concentrated. Therefore, permitting three lot severances in prime agricultural areas will have significant implications for water availability and safety.\nBy permitting lot severances, the province will be impacting the financial accessibility of farmland for the next generation of farmers, making farming less financially viable. Each farm property will likely increase in price relative to the value of three vacant lots in the respective region. Ontario experienced a 19.4% increase in property values in 20228, making it unattainable or financially unfeasible for many young farmers to buy land. The proposed severance policies will incentivize developers, who can outbid young farmers, to purchase farmland or provide cash incentives for farmers to sever lots, contributing to the increase in farmland prices. This will result in the next generation experiencing a fragmented agricultural system and keeping ownership of farmland out of their reach. This is concerning because if the next generation of farmers cannot afford to farm, and experience it as increasingly difficult to farm, the province will not have a viable agricultural sector for much longer.\nI have noticed that the new proposed PPS 2023 states in policy 4.3.1.2, \u201cAs part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d However, permitting lot severances for residential use contradicts lands being designated for the long-term protection for agriculture.\nI believe that the proposed s. 4.3.2.5, which would allow two additional units on existing farm properties, could be significant in providing housing opportunities for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. Similarly, the proposed s. 2.2.1.b.2 allows more land for housing by converting existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use. Given these other proposed policies permitting additional housing and the significant concerns over the proposed lot creation policies, I question why there is a need to permit such a significant allowance for severances.\nFurthermore, permitting these severances is in contradiction to proposed s. 2.2.1.c, \u201cpromoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation.\u201d S.4.3.3 will not promote efficiency in these areas and will detract from the intentions to support intensification.\nI believe that municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising between non-farming residents and the agricultural community. However, proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being more restrictive, which could be vital for preventing these types of conflicts. For rural communities whose economies and culture are intricately associated with agriculture, s.4.3.3.2 will prevent municipalities from protecting a key component of their communities and is contradictory to the content on page 3 that states the PPS 2023 recognizes the diversity of Ontario and that local context is important. S.4.3.3.2 restricts rural municipalities from ensuring the local context of their agricultural system is protected from farmland fragmentation.\nI, therefore, urge the province to consider these concerns and remove s.4.3.3 in its entirety so that the proposed changes do not harm the province\u2019s agricultural lands and the farmers who depend on them. The province should require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping and allow municipalities to implement additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and prevent conflicts with non-farming residents.\nThank you for considering our submission, and I look forward to the province\u2019s response.\nSincerely,\nKatrina Davis, CPT\ndavis.kmarie85@gmail.com\nReferences:\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

They know every square inch of their land and would never use fertile land to build or sever a lot. Allowing lots will help to keep the family farms alive and moving forward. Severing a lot will allow one generation to retire but remain close to help the next generation strive. Government has no business interfering with decisions made on or for or by the family farmer. It has been proven time and time again that Government is not always right nor do they know what is best for everyone. Allowing farmers to sever will benefit everyone.\n",

        "comment":"Many rural farm owners do support the farm residential lot proposal included in the new planning statement.\n According to the Ontario census  on agriculture 2021, 2016 and 2011. Ontario has experienced a net gain in cropped farm area. Canada has also experienced an overall net gain in cropped land area. Farm productivity per unit of land continues to increase and can be attributed to plant breeding livestock genetics and advanced cultural practices such as irrigation precision farming etc. Gene editing technology is the next game changer in agriculture productivity reducing time required to introduce new higher yielding and disease resistant varieties.\nThe productivity of greenhouse grown fruit and vegetables can have a yield potential 20 times higher per unit area using less water per acre than that of outdoor grown crops. Greenhouse area since 2016 has increased by 40 percent with forecasted future increases projected to continue at a greater pace.\nAny food security concerns being floated in the press are very misleading and very simply fear based misinformation.\nGeneral farm organizations did not conduct proper consultations with their membership on this very important planning statement to be able to say their members are united in opposition to the PPS.\nIn a joint statement to the provincial government released May 18 2023 they  claimed to have all farm groups uniting with them. This was a misleading statement as only a nine commodity groups that were all livestock based signed on to the joint statement. This represents less than 29 percent of the total 31 thirty commodity organizations that belong to the OFA. There are also 51 county federations of Agriculture groups across Ontario and only 30 of the local federations supported the joint statement on May 18. It is important to note farmers are now actively productive agricultural crops in agricultural areas with 80 percent of the rural population are not farmers. The land continues to be farmers without any any producers having to idle land due to nearby residential development.\nMost farmers were unaware of Bill 97 and the PPS released on April 6 2023 and furthermore when a private members introduced by an independent MPP bill 62  was voted down in March by the Ontario MPPs and failed to pass, farm land owners who were in favour of lot severances believe that  a failed Bill 62 meant that the Ontario government was going to pass Bill 97 and the PPS on June 4 and there was no need to comment on the PPS.\nWe believe the PPS contains very good policy proposals to help Ontario address the housing crisis by building 1.5 million homes by 2031 and many of us in Rural Ontario are prepared to do a small part in helping achieve the governments goal.\nIt is also very important to keep in mind lot severance policy would be completely voluntary and not mandatory on behalf of the rural community.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"Ontario government NOT being \"short-sighted\" as claimed by FNU.  NFU argues against Bill 97, Proposed Provincial Planning Statement.  They argue that this Bill will:\n             \"Fragment and permanently remove farmland from protected agricultural use\" - Yes, it will remove the farmland from protected agricultural use however, I would disagree in many cases it wouldl maintain the majority of the land as agricultural.  Regarding the land being fragmented, we own farmland which has been in our family for generations.  We rent to a local farmer as the last generation of family members that live on the land do not farm.  We are finding that due to the changes in agricultural technology, the machines are having difficulty getting to some of our road front land therefore already \"fragmenting\" the farming.  A severed lot in this area would provide for the next generation to grow up on the land and still preserve the majority of agricultural land for farming.  Strategically placing the severed lots would reduce and even eliminate the fragmenting.\n             \"Limit farm business growth\" - this would depend on the area.  In Southern Ontario, there are more people that own farmland than farm.  The initial and ongoing cost of farming is very expensive, that is why many farmers need to rent land and equipment.  Farmers would be unable to purchase the farmland and homes.  Allowing the land to be severed, ensures the land will be rented out and maintained as farmland for generations to come.\n             \"Inflating farmland prices\" - that is Ontario.  No land is cheap.  The farmland will always remain inflated and most farmers would likely be unable to purchase it.  Buy not allowing land to be severed, the NFU is actually pushing farmland owners to sell to developers.   Children cannot afford to buy the land and home off their parents but if land is severed they could build and maintain the land that they have appreciated for years.  Most farmland in our area is being bought by people that do not live in the area and do not care about the area or it is being sold to developers.  No choice when you can't sever the land.\n              \"Creating conflict with non-farmers in residential areas...\" When land on an individual's farm is to be severed, it does not become a residential area.  Only when the land owner has no choice but to sell to developers does this happen.\n              \"Significant burden to municipal and provincial services\" Again, if landowners can sever their farmland, it does not become residential.  Services are paid for by the landowner as most are on a cistern and septic system.  As well, there are no sidewalks or fire hydrants that would need to be maintained or installed.\nIndividuals living on farmland want to keep it that way.  That is why they live there and want to let the next generation enjoy the beautiful land.  If unable to sever the land, Ontario will be losing not only agricultural land to developers but also a valuable resource of the next generation moving from the area and out of the province.  There are many financial incentives that are being introduced by other provinces to move there and the cost of living is less expensive.  Now that people can work virtually, they can still work for a company in a specific city within Ontario but are no longer required to live there.  As a result, less money is being spent on taxes, food, and everyday living expenses.  Families with \"roots\" in certain areas will no longer exist.\n",

Our popular farm store and strawberry U-pick operation is just on the edge Strathroy. This 150 acre farm, which is in two parcels, belonged to my grandparents. In the 80s, my dad took over this former tobacco growing operation and eventually grew it into a very successful berry farm, that is well known in our area for exceptional quality produce.\nI am very involved with the farming operations. My dad has been actively teaching me his growing methods - but that has proven difficult as I live 20 minutes from the farm with my husband and 4 children. Unfortunately, under our current municipal bylaws - farming is just a dream for my family as we are unable to build a home on the farm.\nWe hope to make the transition to farming and raise our children in the way I was raised. Why does this have to be \u2018just a dream\u2019 in most municipalities? How does this government expect to continue to grow food on our prime agricultural land without allowing the next generation a place to live on the farm?\nI fear this is the case for many farming families in Ontario. As our \u2018boomers\u2019 age, their children cannot afford to purchase the land at current market value. So, even if the family can come to an agreement in regards to transition - many are unable to build second home on the property. What will happen to all this land throughout our province and country? A very a scary thought in regards to our food production!\nOur family has big and exciting plans for growth and we are counting on these proposed changes to move forward.

The 'balancing' of the various components of the PPS has lead to the housing crisis, prolonging expensive approval process and OLT disputes.  It has also heightened special interest expectations without justification.  Features created due to poor drainage or previous land uses or man made features are not considered 'natural' and this would be highlighted as permitted for development.  The Conservation Authorities have now attempted to expand flood hazards with inaccurate modeling and no public processes to retain influence in adjacent lands...this is inappropriate. Agricultural severances should be permitted where there is no impact on MDS, are infill or are for severance of an existing home...there is no impacts to MDS as the dwelling exists. The issue of compensation for loss lands is an options where significant features are lost or reduce efficiency of land for development.

        "comment":"We find the proposed policies adapted from both A Place to Grow and the Provincial Policy Statement to create a new planning instrument wholly objectionable and of very serious concern, for the following summarized reasons:\n(1)  This plan removes protections of the rural landscape of Ontario. The natural, rural environment must be truly protected from over-development -- and not with phony protection words which do not really stop over-development and in fact, directly and greatly encourage it! In the merger of the 2 original documents, specific wording protecting rural landscapes has been removed, along with the urgently needed requirement for comprehensive and bonafide environmental reviews of proposed expansions of settlement areas.\n(2) We stand with multiple Ontario farming organizations in saying that prime agricultural land is NOT the place for allowing multiple severances for multiple dwellings on multiple lots! This is common sense, and it is shameful that the current provincial government is more than willing to give this treasure away to rampant development.\n(3)  We strongly object to the following costs being shifted onto local level of governance in Ontario:\n       * Watershed studies\n       * Wetland identification\n       * Indigenous Consultation\nWe believe that these requirements are universally important and need to be enshrined at the provincial level, because downloading them to townships and other local governments can create a patchwork of inconsistent policies and unfair practices from region to region across the province.  This must be avoided at all costs.\nAnd significantly, this proposal does not plan for providing any funding to municipalities to engage in the above consultations and studies. This  demonstrates that the province does not really care about seeing those activities continue, with the required funding. \"They\" just want it off the plate!\n(4) The proposal promotes the growth of inefficient, low-density housing instead of working and truly encouraging affordable housing -- the most important housing goal of our times, here in Ontario-- is ignored and dropped by this plan. Affordable housing means rental or ownership which is not worth more than 30% of personal income -- within a wide range of housing options. This plan moves the province backwards in this area of policy. The new proposal of housing which costs 80% of going market values is not even close to what is realistically required by low income citizens.\n(5) No true consideration\/assessment\/analysis of the impact of climate change on the range of developments proposed. This cannot be ignored and swept under the rug, hoping that no one notices. It IS clearly noticed and we cannot believe that this government is not MUCH more concerned and taking the global environmental CRISIS seriously. This is all too clear from the tone and content of this plan. It is a shameful embarrassment -- other countries' governments are much more active and honest in taking steps to decrease unnecessary development at this time, and the Ontario government is taking steps in the opposite direction.\n(6) We object to the removal of the habitat of species at risk from the definition of natural heritage features and areas! What gives?? We care a lot about the survival of those species, and really resent that this current government clearly does not. This point, among others, demonstrates the aforementioned lack of true concern for the natural environment and heritage, and the government's priority instead, for unbridled, over-development in the Greater Golden Horseshoe and by extension, to all other areas of the province.\nFor all these reasons, we fully object to this proposal and hope that receiving our comments, and the similar comments of many others across the province will give the government ample pause for thought and concern to wake up and protect the land, species, environment, bio-sphere, and people who reside here and who care deeply about our home here in Ontario. Please respond to our concerns!\n",

        "comment":"I, along with many others I am sure, urge you to find a way to make tiny homes legal in all municipalities. With house prices out of reach for many people, this would be a way to put home ownership back within their reach. If these tiny houses were to be allowed and could be as off-grid as people prefer, not only would it be better for the environment but it would attract more people to that municipality. The same rules for maintenance etc would be applicable, so there should be few concerns for neighbouring homeowners with regards to appearances. And since these would not be comparable to a traditional home, neighborhood comparables would not apply and therefore not affect the traditional home's valuation. Just lowering the minimum home size does not accomplish what a tiny house can. These days even the smallest houses are still way overpriced, including ADUs, which only serve those who already have a home. What tiny house enthusiasts are asking for is a stand alone home with an affordable price and a bit of a yard to call their own. Building more high rises and condos does nothing to accomplish that. Even more 4 season trailer parks would be step in the right direction, but communities\/neighbourhoods of minimalist homes are the true goal. Conversations to address the concerns municipalities have around them should be frequent and involve people from communities that have made it work. Let's make this a viable option for home ownership!\n",

Steve Clark\nMinister of Municipal Affairs and Housing\nMPP, Leeds-Grenville-Thousand Islands & Rideau Lakes\nMinistry of Municipal Affairs and Housing\n777 Bay Street, 17th Floor\nToronto, Ontario M7A 2J3\ngrowthplanning@ontario.ca\nRe: Review of Proposed Policies Adapted from a Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to Form a New Provincial Planning Policy Instrument (ERO number: 019-6813; comment period ends August 4, 2023)\nDear Minister Clark and Ministry Staff:\nIn taking the opportunity to respond to the proposed new Provincial Policy Statement (released for consultation on April 6, 2023, the Rural Ontario Municipal Association (ROMA) would like to begin by commending you and your Ministry for your thoughtful review of our December 22, 2022 submission and embedding the spirit behind many of our recommendations in the draft now in the last few weeks of the review period. We have included a chart summarizing the major issues raised in our original submission, echoing sentiments expressed in the original Opportunities for Rural Ontario in a Post-COVID World,  as well as our Attainable Housing Task Force report. For your ease of access, we have summarized them further in this cover note.\nWhile there are a handful of remaining concerns, there are many more areas where the Province\u2019s policy work will pay great dividends in rural Ontario and across the Province as a whole. As you know, we regard these two considerations as inseparable and are delighted to see the degree to which you have taken this perspective to heart. Let\u2019s begin there\u2026.\nRecognition of the diversity of Ontario\u2019s communities and the importance of providing local flexibility in how municipalities and other stakeholders make decisions and achieve their potential within the bounds of provincial priorities and shared goals.\nROMA underscored the importance of this issue on the very first page of its Opportunities paper and we believe this sentiment should be the foundation of provincial policy-making going forward:\n\u201cAn Inclusive Model of Innovation and Resilience: None of these developments will be leveraged effectively as long as provincial and federal governments view the province\u2019s landscape in a way that is increasingly outdated and ineffective. The prevailing use of a \u201chub and spoke\u201d model, with an urban area as the hub and nearby towns, villages, hamlets, and rural areas as spokes, suggests that the spokes are only germane to strategic decisions to the degree that they support the urban centre rather than the province as a whole. In this paper, Opportunities for Rural Ontario in a Post-COVID World, ROMA advocates for an alternative model --- the \u201cnetwork\u201d model ---- that sees the interconnections of all communities --- whether rural or urban --- as a source of innovative service delivery options (proactively accessing the on-the-ground experience of municipal governments and community agencies) and as a wellspring of resilience (by deliberate integration of domestic supply chains) and cross-community collaborations.\u201d  [Underlining added]\nFrom the Opportunity report, the diversity of rural communities is noted as part of section 8. Growth on Our Own Terms, and in Appendix B where the \u201ceconomic and social diversity of nonmetro areas is noted as part of the challenge of defining \u201cRural Ontario\u201d.\nThis theme is reflected in multiple places in the draft Provincial Policy Statement, including:\nPreamble \u2013 Geographic Scale of Policies: \u201cWhile this Policy Statement is to be read as a whole, not all policies will be applicable to every site, feature, or area. This Policy Statement applies at a range of geographic scales.\u201d [Underlining added]\nPreamble \u2013 Vision: \u201cOntario is a vast province with a diversity of urban, rural and northern communities, that is distinguished by different populations, economic activity, pace of growth and physical and natural conditions.\u201d\nChapter 2 2.3: Settlement area boundary expansions and pursuit of opportunities for new settlement areas where that makes sense.\nIntroducing two new concepts into land use planning (complete communities and strategic growth areas). These two concepts, defined for greater clarity, make provincial expectations clear and link discussions and decisions about land use planning to the broader health, growth, and well-being of our communities. In earlier reports, ROMA expressed its support for this line of thinking in two ways:\nIn the Opportunities Paper: Appendix D: Factors Affecting Community Well-being, and\nIn the ROMA\u2019s December 2022, submission on the Provincial Policy Statement, where ROMA asked the Province to allow for the possibility of growth centres in both urban and rural areas:\nRecommendation 4.1.ROMA notes that \u201curban growth centres\u201d are not currently included in the Provincial Policy Statement\u2018s definition of \u201carea of settlement (see section 3.1 of this submission). However, ROMA would have no objection to the use of the term \u201cgrowth centre\u201d as an example of a settlement area. It is assumed that a municipal council would be required to designate an area of settlement as a growth centre and that such a designation would be one of a number of terms that would be acceptable for settlement area boundary expansion. This approach would keep open the possibility of growth centres in settlement areas in Rural Ontario.\nRecommendation 13.2: ROMA requests careful consideration of the definition of fast-growing municipalities and broadening the scope of major provincial infrastructure investments to include highways and roads, and \u201cpassenger transportation\u201d generally, not just \u201ctransit.\u201d\nROMA notes the following references in the draft Provincial Policy Statement and sees them as the Ministry\u2019s sincere and substantial effort to respond to our recommendations:\nComplete Communities:\nClarity regarding the achievement of \u201ccomplete communities\u201d (Chapter 2 2.1)\nA much clearer definition of housing options and the financial tools with which they might be brought to market (Chapter 2 2.2)\nInclusion of a wide range of uses in complete communities, including but not limited to public service facilities (Definitions)\nDirect reference to Service Managers to address the full range of housing options including housing affordability needs (Chapter 2.2 1)\nROMA sees this newly-embedded concept as being integral to the work we are now doing on ways to Improve Access to Services, one of the five themes set out in the Opportunities for Rural Ontario in a Post-COVID World paper. As the Ministry clearly appreciates, housing and access to services are deeply connected.  A new Provincial Policy Statement will make that connection abundantly clear.\nStrategic Growth Areas:\nAcknowledgment that there are --- and will continue to be --- areas outside of fast-growing, large cities that are already experiencing growth, and that municipalities should take a strategic approach to accommodate or encouraging this growth. The definition of \u201cstrategic growth areas\u201d and the delineation of how municipalities should utilize these areas to achieve shared goals (Chapter 2.4).\nDefinition of \u2018strategic growth areas\u2019 (Definitions) means \u201csettlement areas, nodes, corridors and other areas that have been identified by municipalities to be the focus for accommodating intensification and higher-density mixed uses in a more compact built form.\u201d [underlining added]\nROMA notes that the strategic growth area concept is explicitly linked to prioritization for infrastructure investments as well as to public service facilities (Chapter 3 3.1). Indeed, public service facilities are mentioned 29 times in the draft Statement. From ROMA\u2019s perspective, these services are key to our local efforts to improve services \u201ccloser to home\u201d and achieve complete communities.\nClarity regarding the definition of settlement areas. The Ministry has clarified settlement area definitions for both urban areas and rural areas, based on criteria consistent with land use planning (concentration of development, mix of land uses, and designation in an official plan for development over the long term.) (see Definitions).\nIn ROMA\u2019s August 2022 Attainable Housing Task Force report, we recommended exactly this sort of clarity:\nROMA Recommendations 3. A and B\nAmend the definition of \u201carea of settlement\u201d in the Planning Act \u2013 Interpretation to read: \u201carea of settlement\u201d means an area of land designated in an official plan for (delete urban)  higher density and a broader mix of uses, including towns, villages, hamlets, rural clusters, rural settlement areas, rural service centres, urban areas, urban policy areas, urban systems, or future urban use areas, or as otherwise prescribed by regulation; (\u201czone de peuplement\u201d) vi\nAmend 1.1.3. 8 (d) of the Provincial Policy Statement to read \u201cthe new or expanding settlement area is in compliance with the minimum distance separation formulae as interpreted by the municipality. However, where a settlement area expansion has been justified and there are no suitable alternatives that meet minimum distance separation formulae, the expansion can still be considered if impacts on agricultural operations are mitigated to the extent feasible.\u201d, and further to\nAmend 1.1.3.9 d) to read \u201cthe settlement area to which lands would be added is appropriately serviced and there is sufficient reserve infrastructure capacity to service the lands. Expansions to settlement areas under private servicing are only permitted subject to conformity with Section 1.6.\nExpediting local planning deliberations by removing unnecessary, time-consuming barriers. ROMA appreciates the Ministry\u2019s efforts to reimagine the Provincial Policy Statement as reflected in the April 6 draft:\nEliminating the need for a comprehensive review every time a municipal council wishes to make adjustments to settlement area boundaries to accommodate growth.\nBringing clarity to how additional development potential to the projected needs established in the official plan is addressed (e.g. at the time of the next update). [underlining added].\nDefining regional market area (Definitions) including the municipality\u2019s right to use a smaller area, if so defined in an official plan.\nROMA\u2019s December 2022 submission on the Provincial Policy Statement drew attention to these barriers by suggesting that the Provincial Policy Statement:\nPermit development of residential, commercial, and industrial properties outside of settlement areas without requiring a comprehensive review. The Statement acknowledges that \u201cOntario\u2019s settlement areas vary significantly in terms of size, density, population, economic activity, diversity and intensity of land uses, service levels, and types of infrastructure available\u201d and that \u201cit is in the interest of all communities to use land and resources wisely\u2026\u201d (Section 1.1.3) However subsequent sections of the Statement are prescriptive on how best to address development pressures, including:\nA strong emphasis on intensification and redevelopment within built-up areas, including provincial targets \u201crepresenting the minimum target for affected areas\u201d (those with targets established through provincial plans).\nFocusing new development in designated growth areas (which may not exist in Rural Ontario) and linked to intensification and redevelopment targets.\nAn expectation of \u201ctimely provision of the infrastructure and public service facilities required to meet current and projected needs\u201d.\nIdentification of a settlement area or expansion of a settlement area boundary \u201conly at the time of a comprehensive review\u201d and only when certain other conditions have been met. From a Rural Ontario perspective, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause (1.1.3.9) does not address the most challenging aspects of the Statement (intensification and redevelopment targets and servicing capacity). Preservation of prime agricultural areas, referenced in multiple sections of the Statement, is in the interest of Rural Ontario municipalities and ROMA fully supports the inclusion of related references in the Provincial Policy Statement.  [Underlining added]\nRecommendation 13 A of ROMA\u2019s Attainable Housing Task Force requested that\nThe Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing work with planning authorities in Rural Ontario to review and update the land inventory municipalities are required to maintain. The objective of this collaboration is to ensure that land inventories maintained under the Planning Act reflect any development constraints and\/or mitigation measures if applicable, and further to\nProvide upper-tier municipalities with flexibility to work with lower-tier municipalities on how 15-year plans for land and unit supply (required in the Provincial Policy Statement 1.4.1) are reflected across lower-tier municipalities within a regional market area. It is expected that lower-tier municipalities will be actively engaged in the formulation of new approaches to ensuring sufficient lands for a mix of housing options and densities. It is also expected that these discussions will include ways in which municipal plans would use either primary or secondary settlement areas to address local housing needs.  [Underlining added]\nROMA hereby reiterates its position with respect to municipal consents on prime agricultural land by bringing forward the Attainable Housing Task Force\u2019s Recommendation 8 C:\nContinue to permit residential consents on parcels outside prime agricultural areas as defined by the Provincial Policy Statement 2.3 Agriculture provided that the parcel itself is not considered prime agricultural land, and further that\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs works with municipalities in Rural Ontario to develop criteria with which to assess the agricultural value of land parcels with soil Classes 4 through 7. The intent of the criteria is to enable municipalities to bring clarity to consent approvals for parcels of these classes by considering other factors such as the potential for the parcel to be viable as a stand-alone or part of a larger farm operation.\nA parcel for which consent to division is granted would be required to meet municipal criteria set out in an Official Plan or Zoning bylaw (examples: lot size for a residential the lot, the size of the remaining parcel, ability to be serviced) and meets other applicable policies in the municipal Official Plan (ex. setbacks from sensitive areas, water bodies, agricultural uses). [Underlining was included in the original submission].\nRemaining Concerns:\nROMA has four remaining concerns about the draft Provincial Policy Statement, to which we would invite you to direct your attention in the remaining weeks of the consultation period:\nRetention of the term \u201crural character\u201d with no accompanying definition (2.5 1 a). As we observed in our original submission, this vague reference with no definition or signal as to who defines it locally, can be problematic when new development proposals are under consideration. ROMA had suggested that municipalities define or describe \u201crural character\u201d in their official plans. If the Ministry has decided against this course of action, it may be better to remove the term \u201crural character\u201d altogether and rely on the Section A 2.5 reference to \u201cplanning authorities shall give consideration to locally appropriate rural characteristics, the scale of development and the provision of appropriate service levels.\u201d\nROMA Recommendation 4 (Attainable Housing Task Force report):\nAmend the Provincial Policy Statement 1.1.4.1 (a) to delete the phrase \u201cbuilding upon rural character\u201d and retain \u201cto leverage rural amenities and assets\u201d.\nAn alternative to Solution A above would be:\nAmend the Provincial Policy Statement 1.1.4.1 (a) to read \u201cbuilding upon rural character, as defined by the planning authority through their Official Plan, and leveraging rural amenities and assets\u201d and further to  Amend 1.1.4.3 to read \u201c\u2026 In incorporating a definition of \u201crural character in their Official Plan, planning authorities shall give consideration to rural character associated with different settlement areas, and reflect this character, as well as broader rural characteristics, scale of development, and the provision of appropriate service levels.\u201d vii\nThis solution is similar in approach to that used to address Employment areas (see 1.3.2.2 in the Provincial Policy Statement).  [Underlining added]\nRestricted municipal access to the full range of methods for the provision of water and sewer services (3.6 1 a).\nROMA appreciates and strongly supports the inclusion of feasibility considerations in Chapter 3.6: \u201cWhere municipal sewage services and municipal water services are not available, planned or feasible, private communal sewage services and private communal water services are the preferred form of servicing for multi-unit\/lot development to support protection of the environment and minimize potential risks to human health and safety.\u201d [underlining added].\nROMA is perplexed that the Ministry would provide an expedited path to approval for these types of systems for private developers that is not also available to municipalities. There is ample evidence across rural Ontario that communal services could be a cost-effective solution for affordable housing, especially purpose-built rentals. ROMA strongly encourages the Ministry to work with the Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks to allow municipalities to use this servicing option if they so choose and to include the words \u201cprivate or municipal\u201d in this section of the Statement.\nIn the same spirit, ROMA continues to seek an amendment to the current Provincial Policy Statement Section 1.6 to provide more flexibility to expand partial services where there are no negative impacts or land use compatibility issues. Restricting the use of the partial services approach to only \u201cfailed\u201d services (current PPS 1.6.6.5 and proposed 3.6. 5) or for \u201cinfilling and minor rounding out of existing development on partial services\u2026\u201d (proposed 3.6 5) is unnecessarily restrictive and may result in unfulfilled opportunities for increasing housing supply, especially for attainable housing and purpose-built rentals. [underlining added]\nRecommendation 5 from the ROMA Affordable Housing Task Force report suggested:\nDelete the first sentence in the Provincial Policy Statement 1.6.6.2: \u201cMunicipal sewage services and municipal water services are the preferred form of servicing for settlement areas to support protection of the environment and minimize potential risks to human health and safety,\u201d\nAn alternative to Solution A above would be:\nAmend the Provincial Policy Statement Section 1.6 to provide more flexibility to expand partial services for attainable housing and purpose-built rentals into rural lands. This would include statements that acknowledge the role of communal and on-site private servicing options where there are no negative impacts or land use compatibility issues. This approach would increase reserve infrastructure capacity or support the provision of attainable housing and purpose-built rentals. The following amendments are provided as examples: [Preceding underlining added; note that the reference does not restrict the use of communal services to private servicing options.\nAmend the Provincial Policy Statement 1.6.6.1 (e) to read: \u201cwhere financially and technically feasible, conform to the servicing hierarchy outlined through policies 1.6.62, 1.6.6.3, 1.6.6.4 and 1.6.6.5. For clarity, planning authorities have the authority to consider the use of conventional servicing options set out through these policies or new technologies, systems, and methods that have been demonstrated to meet the specified conditions present in a settlement area or rural area. For further clarity, the preceding includes the use of combinations of conventional and\/or new technologies to meet servicing needs. This may include a municipal sewage or water service in combination with private services, provided that the specified conditions are met., and further to [Preceding underlining included in the original submission]\nAmend the Provincial Policy Statement 1.6.6.2 to read: \u201cMunicipal sewage services and municipal water services are the preferred form of servicing for settlement areas to support the protection of the environment and minimize potential risks to human health and safety, provided that both the capital costs and the business case for the ongoing operation of these systems is financially sustainable. Within settlement areas with existing municipal sewage services and municipal water services, intensification and redevelopment shall be promoted wherever feasible to optimize the use of the services.\u201d, and further to [Preceding underlining included in the original submission]\nAmend the Provincial Policy Statement 1.6.6.5 to delete the word \u201conly\u201d in the introduction (Partial services shall only be permitted in the following circumstances:) and to add c) \u201cwhere they can be demonstrated to be the most efficient, long-term solution to addressing the need for attainable housing and purpose-built rental housing, capitalizing on existing services (ex. wells) or new technologies (ex. biofilters) and will not negatively impact the environmental health of the area.\u201d  [Preceding underlining included in the original submission]\nAmend the Provincial Policy Statement, last sentence in 1.6.6.5 to delete the word \u201conly\u201d (\u201cIn accordance with subsection (a), the extension of partial services into rural areas is only permitted to address failed individual on-site sewage and individual on-site water services for existing development\u201d; only permitted to address failed systems\u2026) and further to [Preceding underlining included in the original submission]\nAmend the Provincial Policy Statement 1.6.6.5, to add to the final paragraph: \u201cor to introduce new technologies or systems that can extend the life or expand the capacity of an existing working system that will support additional housing, especially attainable housing and\/or purpose-built rentals.\u201d [Preceding underlining included in the original submission]\nNo action on updating algorithms used to calculate reserve capacity for municipal sewer and water services. In our original submission, ROMA had requested that the Ministry work with the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks to update their algorithm for calculating reserve capacity, reflecting actual operating experience and that MECP would provide assurance that uncommitted reserve capacity estimates so generated would be acceptable for ECA licensing purposes.  It is possible that the Ministry wishes to deal with this matter off-line\/outside of the Provincial Policy Statement and if so, ROMA would be pleased to provide expertise from the municipal ranks to address this matter. Left untouched, these considerations will unnecessarily restrict municipalities\u2019 ability to bring additional housing supply to the market and undermine all the Ministry\u2019s good work in the Provincial Policy Statement review.\nROMA\u2019s Recommendation 6 from the Attainable Housing Task Force report:\nThe Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks update the algorithm (method of calculation) used to calculate reserve capacity in sewage and water treatment plants. In using an indirect estimate of flow rates (the number of households or residential connections), the Ministry should adjust the formula to take into account the significant reductions in water use (and therefore sewage produced) as a result of increasingly efficient fixtures and appliances.\nThe Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks provide latitude to municipalities to make calculations using an updated algorithm that takes into account their actual experience in the operation of their water and sewer systems. This is particularly important to the calculation of average daily flow rates per capita and understanding actual system usage by the current population and households.\nBeyond the use of estimating the extent of conventional development that can be supported by the uncommitted reserve hydraulic capacity, municipalities in Rural Ontario have significant potential to add housing units through secondary suites, which would effectively lower the average daily flow rates per capita while providing a practical way to respond to the need for purpose-built rentals.\nFurther, municipalities anticipate assurance from the Ministry that by improving the accuracy of the algorithm, the uncommitted reserve capacity estimates so generated will be accepted for the purposes of Environmental Compliance Approval (ECA) licensing. [Underlining added]\nToo narrow a focus on just the education system (school capacity) for housing supply need signals.\nIn the spirit of complete communities, ROMA recommends the integration of information from other service providers (in addition to school boards), such as healthcare organizations, social housing service managers, employment centres, food banks, and passenger transportation providers. Information from these organizations would provide a much better understanding of what will be required to \u201cround out\u201d or \u201ccomplete\u201d communities.\nROMA offered a specific recommendation (13 B) on this matter in its Attainable Housing Task Force Report, which is entirely consistent with the \u201ccomplete communities\u201d concept now articulated in the draft Provincial Policy Statement:\nB. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing works with planning authorities to identify and analyze non-traditional data sources to better understand\/ \u201dtriangulate\u201d the current housing situation in rural areas and get a sense of dynamics\/direction of change in drivers affecting the housing market in Rural Ontario (examples: recent population shifts, population and employment forecasts, school closures, hospital closures, capital investment in education and healthcare services, changing use of food banks, wait lists for social housing).

        "comment":"To whom it may concern,\nI am writing this email to ask that Tiny Home subdivisions and communities become part of the government's strategy in addressing the housing shortage in Ontario. To that end, anything that can be done to streamline the regulatory process and reduce the corresponding development costs to keep tiny homes affordable for first time home buyers and downsizing retirees would be greatly appreciated.\nTiny homes can be built in as little as 8 to 10 weeks, compared to the typical 6 to 12 months for a traditional single detached home. This shortened timeframe can help the government meet its new home construction targets, and can also ease the lack of supply pressure that is continuing to drive up home prices.\nTiny homes are more environmentally friendly and sustainable. They use less energy to build and maintain, thereby reducing our collective carbon footprint.\nTiny homes can help more people get out of the high cost rental trap, thereby fueling a resurgence in first time buyers being able to buy.\nTiny homes allow people to live close to the earth, instead of in high rise cubicles. This has emotional and health benefits that are only now beginning to be understood.\nTiny homes can be an important part of the housing solution. But for this to happen, we need government support for this fledgling industry.\nPlease give this matter your serious consideration as you draft new legislation related to housing in Ontario.\nThank-you,\nJohn Zwart\nOwner\/Partner\nWhiteRock Tiny Home Solutions Inc.\nPhone: 519-496-5607\nEmail: hello@tinyhomesolutions.ca\n",

Additionally, by creating more opportunities for development, severing land can help to increase property values and create new jobs, which can contribute to the overall economic growth of a region.\n",

I'm concerned that there is not sufficient direction for municipalities to support housing options for our more vulnerable populations and the affordability crisis we are facing.  It is less about increasing supply and more about ensuring housing as a Human Right and less as a commodity for investment.  Where are the policies aimed at addressing renovictions, inflation of our housing prices by investors. I realize these are not land-use planning issues but require attention.  Perhaps at minimum incorporating a policy to require municipalities to have a policy acknowledging housing as a human right within their OPs would be  start.\n",

I would like to propose an amendment to farmlands where a residence has previously been severed through a process called Surplus Farm Dwelling Severance.\nSurplus farm dwelling severances are an excellent tool for freeing up equity tied in a farm to help farmers lower the cost of land while expanding operations.\nOne stipulation I would like to see modified is the part of the policy on surplus severances that states that \"New residential dwellings shall be prohibited on the remnant parcel of farmland created by the severance;\"\nAs of today, essentially once the surplus residence is severed, the owner (and any future owners) of the retained farm lands are prohibited from building a new residence down the road.  Although a farm residence may be surplus at a specific point in time.  There are reasons in the future a new residence may want to be constructed on the retained farmlands.\nI believe the current process is prohibiting growth within our farming communities and restricting farm families as they grow and diversify.  No one knows what the future holds, but to prevent growth and restrict building because of something that was completed in the past is counter productive.\nI would like to see the policy amended to allow 1 new residential unit to be built on retained farmlands when a surplus residence severance has already occurred in the past. And to remove that restriction on new surplus severances.\nRegards\n",

Our land, communities and resources are being used to fund Ford's friends.  So many things have become unaffordable for ordinary Canadians.  And now apparently new houses for rich investors trumps our ability to feed ourselves.  Farmland is a very limited resource in Canada and much of it already sits under big cities like Hamilton and Toronto.  This proposal makes it impossible for small rural communities to plan a future in line with community goals. Once our farmland is paved over that's it. Moving north is moving into marginal lands and plant hardiness zones that are ill suited to growing food.\nI've talked to a lot of people about this and many of us are scared for the future, scared for our communities and scared for future generations.

Well managed, smaller units can also provide a solution to homelessness, or at least decent shelter for those who simply need a place to sleep, and could solve many problems in this area for communities.\nThere are many, many who are ready, willing and able to move into a THOW, if only there were more legal spaces on organised land to park.\nGood luck with this proposed policy change!\n(I would encourage municipal, provincial and federal housing officials to attend the Tiny Home Show in Ancaster at the end of this month.

Keeping an eye on the property 24\/7 is integral to the job. In the 90s my parents severed an acre, built a house, and raised our family to live and work on the farm. Now I am grown up, but I am unable to do so. Because of severance rules I have to live in Barrie and drive an hour to the farm I grew up on. The opportunity is not there and it is soul crushing. We need you to help us sever (even an acre) and allow for us to build a house so we too can raise our family and take over the operation. The rules are outdated and do not reflect the current situation our generation of farmers is up against. It is already difficult enough to be a farmer with the price of everything, don't make this part any harder than it needs to be. Thanks in advance for your consideration.\n",

        "comment":"I believe that the propsal too loosly allows for land, which has once been protected, to be used for building and other purposes. Laws regarding natural habitats, farm land, forrested areas and otherwise untouched land should, as much as possoble, remain that way. Urban and suburban areas should be built up with the utmost respect for the natural environment. Land previously developed upon, but no longer in use, should be reclaimed and built upon first for the aformentioned housing and business purposes, before agricultural, forest, protected or farm land is destroyed. The natural environment must always be protected first and foremost. Building on smaller lots, building up rather than out, should be preferential. Wildlife should be a major consideration when making any new developments, ensuring its protection and the protection of all natural habitats. Oil and gas industries should be phased out rather than protected, and no new land should be allotted for its use, no habitat or natural or protected areas destroyed for its advancement. Focus should be on renewable and regenerative energy sources which prioritize the environment. Farm land, fresh air, wild places  are necessary and integral to the survival of all species on the planet, including humans, and this must be kept in mind at all times while making policies and changes to the environment in which we all live. Adaptive changes being made to cities, towns and living places which take into account the increasing heat and changes in the planet currently taking place are exciting notions which could have a place here and be adopted in the near future. Urban and suburban areas are much hotter than forested areas and tree lined streets are much more pleasant to be on. Lets make room in policy for such changes which would help everyone and the planet! What else can we do to make these areas more livable and better for the environment? What can we do to keep things cooler, which will not add to the problem? More natural spaces, more trees, more protection for animals. Natural resources such as fresh water need protecting. We cannot live without them. I understand the need for affordable housing,  but I question whether these policies are addressing that, or are they favoring industry and \"progress\" over the environment?\n",

        "comment":"RE: Provincial Agricultural System, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"Re: Comments on Natural Heritage Policies \u2013 ERO 019-6813\nReview of Proposed Policies Adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a New Provincial Planning Policy Instrument\nOn behalf of the City of Toronto, I am pleased to submit supplementary staff comments regarding ERO 019-6813. The comments below focus exclusively on the natural heritage policies released on June 16, 2023, and are submitted in addition to the City of Toronto\u2019s comments on ERO 019-6813, dated June 26, 2023, submitted previously.\nThe draft natural heritage policies presented in the proposed Provincial Planning Statement closely match that of the Provincial Policy Statement, although changes were made to definitions in the proposed Provincial Planning Statement and the Growth Plan\u2019s natural heritage policies were eliminated.\nCOMMENTS\nAs previously stated in the City\u2019s June 26, 2023 comments, the proposed Provincial Planning Statement introduces policy changes that are likely to have negative impacts on the natural heritage systems. The removal of infill development as an explicit priority over settlement area expansions will lead to a loss in permeable lands, natural spaces and productive agricultural lands. The removal of key environmental themes (e.g., biodiversity) from the vision statement is concerning, as land use change and habitat loss are major drivers of biodiversity loss and species decline.\nChange To the Proposed Definition of Natural Heritage Feature and Area\nThe proposed Provincial Planning Statement removed reference to \u201chabitat of threatened species and endangered species\u201d from the definition of natural heritage feature and area. This proposed change will remove key criterion such as 1) identifying what areas receive policy protection from development and site alteration; and 2) identifying elements of the natural heritage system. The habitat of threatened and endangered species has long been a key consideration for identifying Environmentally Significant Areas and natural areas where site development would not be permitted in Toronto. Land use planning is an important tool for the protection of the region\u2019s most vulnerable species and key habitat.\nRemoving \u201chabitat of threatened species and endangered species\u201d from the definition of natural heritage feature and areas would limit a municipality's ability to protect key habitats as an element of the natural heritage system.\nRecommendation\n\u2022 Reintroduce habitat of endangered species and threatened species into the definition of Natural heritage features and areas.\nChange to the Proposed Definition of Significant Wetlands\nIn alignment with recent changes to the Ontario Wetlands Evaluation System (OWES), the proposed Provincial Planning Statement has removed reference to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s role in identifying wetlands as significant. This change was considered in the Environmental Registry posting 019-6160, with a decision posted on December 22, 2022. City Planning continues to have concerns related to the removal of Provincial oversight of identification or re-evaluation of Provincially Significant Wetlands. This change in oversight, alongside the changes in wetland criteria in OWES, are expected to decrease the level of protection for some significant wetlands across the province where re-designation occurs.\nRecommendation\n\u2022 Develop and implement, in collaboration with municipal partners, a public reporting tool to track the status of Significant Wetlands in Ontario, including any re-evaluations.\nLoss of Growth Plan\u2019s Natural Heritage Policies\nThe Growth Plan\u2019s Natural Heritage System (NHS) policies included an important regional consideration and enhanced protection for the NHS within the rapidly urbanizing context of the Greater Golden Horseshoe. This includes requirements for new development and site alteration to: demonstrate that connectivity along the system will be maintained; avoid removal of natural features; limit the disturbed area and impervious surfaces within developable areas in the NHS; and require space within the developable area be returned to natural self-sustaining vegetation. In practice, these policies elevate protection for the Greater Golden Horseshoe\u2019s NHS beyond the Province-wide policies in the proposed Provincial Planning Statement.\nWhile these Growth Plan policies did not apply within the City of Toronto, Toronto is functionally connected to the Growth Plan\u2019s NHS as a downstream community. The proposed deletion of the Growth Plan\u2019s NHS policies will impact land use patterns upstream from Toronto, which may influence the City's overall ecological health and resilience. Within this rapidly urbanizing region, it is vital to maintain policies that promote natural connectivity and limit the conversion of land from pervious to urban and impervious.\nRecommendation\n\u2022 Request the Province introduce the Growth Plan\u2019s natural heritage system policies into the proposed Provincial Planning Statement to apply to development within any municipally identified natural heritage system.\nCONCLUSION\nThe City of Toronto supports effective regional planning that prioritizes intensification over urban expansion. A focus on increasing density coupled with adequate protection for the region\u2019s natural heritage system is vital to maintaining the long-term livability of the region. The downstream impacts of increased urbanization and loss of natural connectivity will be felt in Toronto through increased vulnerability to extreme weather, a decline in biodiversity and a decrease in ecological functioning.\nCity Planning staff always welcome the opportunity to work with provincial staff to effectively implement the provincial policy-led planning system, drawing on each of our strengths to protect essential ecological features and create sustainable, healthy, complete communities.\nThank you for the opportunity to provide these comments. If you would like to discuss these policies further please contact either Kerri Voumvakis at kerri.voumvakis@toronto.ca or Jane Welsh at jane.welsh@toronto.ca.\nRegards,\nGregg Lintern, MCIP, RPP\nChief Planner and Executive Director\nCity Planning Division\n",

The definition of \u201cNatural Features and Areas\u201d no longer includes \u201chabitat of\nendangered species and threatened species.\u201d\n\u201cNatural Features and Areas\u201d are directed to be protected for the long term however other\nprovincial legislation applies to protect the habitats of these species, and includes\npermitting processes where impact to habitat may be permitted subject to conditions. As\nsuch, requiring that habitat of endangered species and threatened species be protected for\nthe long term under the Provincial Planning Statement creates a potential conflict with the\nother legislation.\n\u201cNatural Heritage Features and Areas\u201d are also listed as a component of natural heritage\nsystems, which Bruce County and local Municipalities are required to identify. The Plan the\nBruce: Natural Legacy project which is setting out to a identify natural heritage system for\nthe County has identified endangered and threatened species mapping as a category that\ncould not be effectively mapped, given species may be included\/removed from the list,\npermits may be obtained to permit habitat removal, and habitat may include things like old\nbank barns.\nHabitats that occur in natural areas may derive policy protections as significant wetlands,\nsignificant coastal wetlands, other coastal wetlands, fish habitat, significant woodlands and\nsignificant valleylands, significant wildlife habitat, and significant areas of natural and\nscientific interest, which are important for their environmental and social values as a legacy\nof the natural landscapes of an area.\nOverall the revised definition of natural heritage features and areas enables the natural\nheritage system to be more fully mapped in accordance with provincial direction, and\nhabitat of endangered and threatened species will continue to be addressed through\nprovincial legislation, with referral of proponents to the province when such habitats are\nidentified through the planning process.\n2. The definition of \u2018significant\u2019 is revised, in relation to wetlands, coastal wetlands,\nand areas of natural and scientific interest, to remove reference to the role of\nthe Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) in determining\nsignificance.\nThe revised definition includes these as an area identified as provincially significant using\nevaluation criteria and procedures established by the Province, as amended from time to\ntime. This change reflects a decision by the province in December 2022 to change the\nOntario Wetland Evaluation System Manual to remove a ministry role in the identification\nand approval of wetland boundaries (see ERO Posting 019-6160) and sets up the possibility\nfor revisions to the process and responsibility for identifying and delineating areas of natural\nand scientific interest.\nBruce County submitted comments with respect to the ERO posting 019-6160 that identified\nconcerns with the removal of the provincial Ministry\u2019s role in the determination of\nprovincially significant resources.\nThose changes remove MNRF from the administrative function, without indicating a clear\nreplacement to support municipalities. It appears that the intent is for municipalities to\nassume this role. Bruce County and its local Municipalities do not have the resources or\ncapacity to assume this role. Further, distributing this role across 400+ municipalities will be\nneither efficient nor yield consistent stewardship of provincially-significant wetlands, let\nalone areas of natural and scientific interest.\nBruce County recommends that the province consider the impacts to features and the\ncapacity for administration of any further changes to natural heritage policies.\nAgriculture:\nThe original ERO posting indicated a policy to require municipalities to permit 3 lots to be\nsevered from any farm lot existing as of January 1, 2023, provided MDS was maintained. At\nthe time the posting was extended, the province indicated that the intent of this policy was\nto facilitate housing for next-generation farmers and for farm workers, and that the\ngovernment would not be moving forward with this policy and was extending the comment\nperiod to hear other ideas.\nThe updated Planning Statement posted on June 16th continues to include the originally\nproposed agricultural consent policies.\nBruce County recommends that the province consider the feedback and engage on revised\npolicies before putting them into effect in a new Provincial Planning Statement.\nSummary\nBruce County Council and staff appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the\ngovernment\u2019s efforts to address the need for housing in Ontario through the proposed 2023\nProvincial Planning Statement. We appreciate the overall alignment on natural heritage\npolicy between the current Provincial Policy Statement in the updated Provincial Planning\nStatement posted June 16, 2023.\nWe encourage the province to work with groups such as AMO and the Warden\u2019s Caucuses, as\nwell as rural and small urban communities to engage in meaningful dialogue on the proposed\nchanges and their implications for municipalities across Ontario.\n",

Now that I am grown up, with kids of my own, I do not have the same opportunity that he did. I have to live far away, commute every day, but more importantly my kids are missing out on the farm upbringing that I had. We need severance rules that recognize and help farming families. If I was allowed to sever even an acre off our farm it would barely put a dent in the operation but what we'd get back in return is being able to work, live and raise our kids on the farm which is SO important to all of us.

        "comment":"On behalf of Agrivoltaics Canada, Canada\u2019s industry group dedicated to the promotion and education of agrivoltaics which lie at the intersection of agriculture and renewable energy, we write to express our strong support for the inclusion of agrivoltaics in Section 4.3 of the proposed Provincial Planning Statement (PPS, 2023) under the Ontario Planning Act. We firmly believe that agrivoltaics, the co-development of land for agriculture and solar power, aligns seamlessly with the key objectives of On-tario's PPS and holds immense potential for enhancing sustainable land use, rural economic prosperity, biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation and adaptation.\nThe proposed PPS (2023) seeks to provide direction on matters of provincial interest related to land use planning and development, as well as protect provincial interests, including resources, public health and safety, and the quality of the natural and built environment. Section 4.3 specifically ad-dresses On Farm Diversified Uses, which we believe should explicitly include agrivoltaics, given the numerous benefits it can provide in terms of economic prosperity, biodiversity conservation, and cli-mate change mitigation and adaptation.\nAgrivoltaics presents an innovative solution to address the global challenges of food security, renewa-ble energy generation, and water conservation simultaneously. By integrating agriculture and photo-voltaic solar energy generation on the same land, this practice offers numerous synergistic benefits that directly contribute to the objectives set forth by the proposed PPS.\n1. Economic Prosperity:\nOntario's farmers are facing significant challenges, with farm debt reaching all-time highs in 2020. It is crucial for farm operators to diversify their income streams and improve the productivity of their land. Agrivoltaics offers a unique opportunity to achieve these goals. By combining traditional crop cultiva-tion with the simultaneous production of electricity, farmers can enhance their land utilization, gener-ate additional revenue, and mitigate the economic risks associated with uncertainty and fluctuating commodity prices. The integration of agrivoltaics within Section 4.3 of the proposed PPS aligns with the objective of fostering a strong, internationally competitive economy.\n2. Land Productivity Improvement:\nAgrivoltaics allows for the continued cultivation of traditional crops while harnessing solar energy, thus maximizing the productivity of agricultural land. By strategically siting solar panels above crops, farmers can optimize land use, increase crop yields, and simultaneously generate clean electricity. This dual-use approach enhances food production and renewable energy generation, enabling farmers to adapt to evolving environmental stresses, market demands while also contributing to the province's rising energy needs. By including agrivoltaics in the PPS, Ontario recognizes the importance of sustainable land use practices that unlock the potential for enhanced agricultural productivity.  We want to em-phasize that to qualify as agrivoltaics, solar systems must be designed to support and enhance agricul-tural production and not replace it as was done under the FIT program.  We do no support displacing agricultural activity with solar.\n3. Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation\nBy providing shade, these systems can reduce water evaporation and help crops withstand extreme heat events, which are projected to become more frequent and intense due to climate change. This aligns well with the PPS's emphasis on promoting development and land use patterns that contribute to environmental sustainability and resilience, and that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate. Increased biodiversity creates natural carbon sinks for CO2.\n4. Job Creation in Rural Economies:\nThe integration of agrivoltaics will spur job creation and economic growth in rural areas. The develop-ment of agrivoltaic enhanced farms will require skilled labor for design, installation, and maintenance, providing both temporary and permanent employment opportunities. Additionally, increased invest-ments in the renewable energy sector will attract progressive, forward-thinking companies to Ontario, further strengthening local and regional economies. By explicitly incorporating agrivoltaics into Section 4.3, the PPS promotes the expansion of rural job markets and revitalization of communities.  Increas-ing the on-farm production of energy could also support farmers in economically producing additional farm inputs such as nitrogen-based nutrients and supply energy for some equipment.  The future of farm work is slowly evolving towards automation, battery powered autonomous equipment is starting to make inroads, enabling farms to displace diesel use for farm equipment supports agricultural decar-bonization goals.\n5. Reinforcement of Local Electricity Distribution Systems:\nAgrivoltaic systems, with their distributed solar generation, reinforce local electricity distribution sys-tems by reducing strain on centralized power grids. By generating electricity closer to the point of con-sumption, agrivoltaics mitigates transmission losses and voltage fluctuations. This decentralized ap-proach enhances grid resilience, improves power reliability, and contributes to a more sustainable and efficient electricity infrastructure. By embracing agrivoltaics in the PPS, Ontario demonstrates its com-mitment to a clean and robust energy future.\nTo ensure the successful integration of agrivoltaics into Ontario's agricultural landscape, we propose the following recommendations for Ontario to undertake in addition to inclusion of agrivoltaics in Sec-tion 4.3 of the proposed Provincial Planning Statement (2023):\n1.\tExplicitly recognize agrivoltaics as an On Farm Diversified Use and include a definition of agri-voltaics to clarify its scope and function.  Permit agrivoltaics to cover crop fields and not only ancillary use areas.\n2.\tDevelop and implement guidelines and best practices for agrivoltaic system design, installa-tion, and management to ensure a balance between agricultural production and renewable energy generation, optimizing land utilization and productivity.\n3.\tSupport and encourage research and development in agrivoltaic technologies and practices, fostering innovation and collaboration among government agencies, academic institutions, and private entities to drive continuous improvement and knowledge-sharing.\n4.\tEstablish support mechanisms, such as streamlined permitting processes, financial incentives, and technical assistance, to encourage farmers and rural communities to adopt agrivoltaic sys-tems, enhancing economic opportunities and farm resilience.\n5.\tPromote public awareness and education on the benefits of agrivoltaics for sustainable land use, food security, and renewable energy generation, emphasizing the positive impact on local economies and job creation in rural communities.\n6.\tMonitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of agrivoltaic systems, allowing for the refinement of policies, guidelines, and support mechanisms as needed, to ensure con-tinuous improvement and optimal outcomes.\nIncorporating these recommendations into the Provincial Planning Statement (2023) will demonstrate a commitment to forward-thinking, sustainable land use practices that simultaneously address the pressing challenges of food security, renewable energy generation, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Agrivoltaics has the potential to transform the agricultural landscape, strengthen the economy, create jobs in rural communities, and contribute to a more resilient and sustainable future for Ontario farmers and primary agricultural producers.\nWe appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the proposed Provincial Planning Statement (2023) and trust that our recommendations will be given due consideration. By including agrivoltaics in Section 4.3, the Provincial Planning Statement will promote sustainable and innovative land use practices that benefit the environment, the economy, and the well-being of Ontario's communities.\n",

Housing can be done using the current PPS and Growth Plan which require mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets. Doing so would prevent urban sprawl and protect farmland - much of it prime agricultural land - on which we all depend for our food.\nIn addition, doing so would protect natural areas and conservation areas - lands crucial to buffering the effects of climate change. We are in a climate crisis.

She has 3 kids who all love it here and we've been trying to find a way to do it. We can build. We could sever (if it were built 20 years ago) but we can't sever first which is just ridiculous. There has to be a way to let farmers help their kids with an acre vs. selling to developers. All we're trying to do is keep the farm in our family and make it easier for the next generation.

        "comment":"Recently, my husband and I have been looking into the possibility of buying property to build a new home. We are looking to start our family, are we are quickly outgrowing our small ranch. More space is a must as we look to growing our family. We have been house hunting for well over a year now, and nothing has been within our price range that suits our needs. This is what brought us to the idea of building, but unfortunately residential building lots in our area are selling well outside of our price range.\nWe have talked about our plans with my in-laws, and they graciously offer to sever part of their property in order for us to build on. They are willing to work with us on a price that suits our budget. My mother-in-law has also offered to retire in order to help us raise our children. My husband and I are both shift workers, and having our family immediately next door would be instrumental in helping us raise our children.\nMy mother-in-law began looking into severing their property and was told this would not be possible due to the land being zoned as agricultural. The woman she spoke with mentioned that this Act was being reviewed, and that potentially it would become possible for them to sever their property to family only if it was passed. Obviously, I was disappointed to read as of late that this proposal was placed on hold, and feel myself losing hope that this option will become a reality.\nAside from the benefit of raising our family, this would allow us to keep this property within our family. Once my in-laws are ready to downsize from their home, it is their hope their other daughter and son will move into the property, and we will remain in our new build. My in-laws are already second generations owners of their home and surrounding acreage. I am aware that we are one couple proposing our plans, but I would imagine there are other families in a similar situation to ours. The \"agricultural land\" on their property is currently unused and vacant, and has been that way for as long as my husband and I can remember. My hope is that this Act will be amended to allow for families to sever their property, for the purpose of future generations to build and continue to grow on the property.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing today asking that the provincial government continue to fight for the ability to sever more \u201cagricultural\u201d deemed land throughout the province.\nI understand the value of farmland and the quality of soil we have in Ontario. I\u2019m not suggesting that we squeeze a home on every inch of available farm land. However, if a farmer or agricultural land owner owns a property they wish to sever, in this free country in which we live, how can he be denied the right to do so?\nI\u2019d like to share some of my personal story and why this proposed policy by the Ford Government is important to me. My wife and I bought our house just before the pandemic in November 2019. Since then we have gotten married, are getting ready to have children, and will be looking to up size.\nMy parents own a home on a large country lot just down the road from us that would be perfect to build a second home on for my wife and I. If we could sever a piece of their property (a portion that\u2019s not capable of being farmed, but still classified as agricultural land and therefore can\u2019t severed) we could potentially live on the same property as my parents. This would allow my mother to retire and become a full time, on site baby sitter for our children.\nAll the utilities, underground pipes, and other similar connections would be effortless, as everything is already set up at the road in that area.\nThis property is also my childhood home, so being able to build a home and raise a family on the same ground I grew up on would mean the world to me.\nUnfortunately, because of this current policy preventing severances, my wife and I may never be able to live on the same property as my parents.\nI\u2019m asking for the government to at least consider special circumstances like mine, and possibly consider agricultural severances on a case by case basis, rather than making a blanket policy that prevents any sort of agricultural land, (even non-farmable land), incapable of ever being severed.\nThank you for your time.\n",

        "comment":"Re: ERO 019-6813 - Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and\nProvincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nThe Perth County Federation of Agriculture (PCFA) represents the unique farming interests of Perth County farmers. After 75 years, we are proud to represent over 1,800 farming families in Perth County. PCFA believes the protection of prime agricultural land for agricultural use is of paramount importance.\nAgriculture is the main economic driver in Perth County with 1.2 billion in farm cash receipts in 2021. The top 3 products we produce are hogs, dairy and grains and oilseeds but we also have diverse production of many other agricultural products. Perth County has many innovative and ambitious producers and we are well positioned to rise to the challenge of the province\u2019s agri-food strategy, Grow Ontario.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to express our concerns with the proposed Provincial\nPlanning Statement. We appreciate the reconsideration of the lot creation policies originally\nproposed within the statement but must again emphasize our position against creation of lot severances on farm and rural properties and ask that it be changed in the proposed PPS. We also must address the inconsistent, vague, and destabilizing policies that remain.\nAgricultural System Mapping and Agricultural Land Protections\nPCFA believes that farming to produce food, fibre, fuel, flowers, and nursery stock is the best use for farmland. Ontario\u2019s limited supply of farmland is a scarce resource, making up less than five percent of all the land in the province. It\u2019s vital that Ontario has a strong, viable and sustainable supply of food products grown, harvested, and processed right here at home. Ontario\u2019s shrinking agricultural land base is alarming. The current rate of loss is measured at 319 acres per day in our province, according to the 2021 Census of Agriculture. These losses are not sustainable. Therefore, any proposals looking at increasing housing supply must be done with consideration to the needs and support of the agricultural community.\nPCFA endorses the 2020 Provincial Policy Statement (PPS 2020)\u2019s Agriculture policies [Section\n2.3] that require municipalities protect their prime agricultural areas for their long-term agricultural use. We further support the flexibility afforded to farmers to engage in on-farm value adding of primary farm products, as well as agriculture-related, on-farm diversified, and agri-tourism uses. Although the PPS 2020 defines prime agricultural land as Canada Land Inventory (CLI) Class 1- 3 soils plus specialty crop areas, the PCFA believes that prime agricultural lands should be defined as Class 1 to 4 soils plus specialty crop lands. Class 5-6 soils that are part of an ongoing agricultural operation deserve protection too. These soils can support agricultural activities such as grazing livestock or growing crops for biofuels, and their productivity can be improved through activities such as tile drainage, stone picking, and the addition of lime. Where Class 1-4 soils are not present in a county or region, the best agricultural lands in that county or region should be recognized and protected for their agricultural use.\nPCFA is a strong supporter of the preservation of Prime Farmland classes 1, 2, 3 & 4 plus specialty crop lands across rural Ontario. We believe strongly in the PPS 2020 Agriculture policies that governs farmland and rural areas protecting the right to farm and the Agriculture System in Ontario. In addition to this, PCFA believes strongly that the fragmentation of farmland in the rural area is counterproductive for the agricultural business structure in Ontario\u2019s rural areas.\nPCFA is against the removal of the requirement to use the provincially mapped agricultural system as it would allow for agricultural fragmentation, inconsistent classification of agricultural lands and specialty crop areas and disconnect in agricultural land mapping and classifications across municipal boundaries.\nSettlement Area Boundary Expansions\nPCFA is strongly against the proposed changes to settlement area boundary expansion policies.\nSpecifically, changes in functional policy language have removed both the requirement to justify\nneed and to conduct a comprehensive review, as such could result in uncertainty and ambiguity\nfor the process, expectations, and requirements for these expansions. PCFA believes that these\nchanges could lead to inconsistent implementation across municipalities, agricultural land\nfragmentation, and inconsistent protections and considerations for agricultural land across\nmunicipal boundaries.\nPCFA supports fixed, permanent urban boundaries to limit the loss of agricultural land, thereby\nfocusing future urban growth within existing urban boundaries. This means urban growth primarily through redevelopment of vacant and underused lands, and higher density development.\nWe further believe that in urban areas, higher density development should be mandated\nprovincewide to take full advantage of existing infrastructure. PCFA supports urban\nintensification\/densification as one way to protect agricultural land and create complete\ncommunities.\nPCFA believes that urban areas should only be allowed to expand onto abutting agricultural lands only after exhausting redevelopment of underused or vacant areas within their existing urban boundaries. This would include the rehabilitation and redevelopment of both \u201cgreyfield\u201d and \u201cbrownfield\u201d sites. Lastly, urban expansion onto abutting agricultural land must be directed onto lower class agricultural land adjacent to the existing urban boundaries.\nPCFA does not support scattered or strip development within prime agricultural areas.This form of development not only limits the ability of new and existing agricultural operations to function but fails to contribute financially to municipalities.\nPCFA wants to see PPS policies in Section 1.1.3.8 remain as is. Keeping these policies intact (and holding municipalities and MMAH accountable to following these policies) is critical for meeting joint goals of balancing farmland protection with urban development. Further, OFA wants to see Agricultural Impact Assessment (AIA) policies from APTG incorporated directly into the proposed PPS policies on settlement area boundary expansions (APTG Policy 2.2.8.3 h). Specifically referencing AIAs as the current policy outlines:\n\u201cWhere the need for a settlement area boundary expansion has been justified in\naccordance with policy 2.2.8.2, the feasibility of the proposed expansion will be\ndetermined and the most appropriate location for the proposed expansion will be\nidentified based on the comprehensive application of all of the policies in this\nPlan, including the following: ... h) any adverse impacts on the agri-food network,\nincluding agricultural operations, from expanding settlement areas would be\navoided, or if avoidance is not possible, minimized and mitigated as determined\nthrough an agricultural impact assessment;\u201d (APTG Policy 2.2.8.3 h).\nAs Ontario becomes more urbanized, councils and staff may not apply an agricultural lens to their plan-, policy-, and decision-making. This is critical as we need to plan for 'farm-friendly' urban development that promotes compatibility at the urban-agricultural interface. For example, parcel size, configuration, building setbacks, road patterns, institutional locations, drainage patterns and location of municipal servicing will all have implications for agriculture.\nPCFA firmly believes in the widespread use of AIAs, as it ensures that agricultural uses continue, and normal farm practices are protected. AIAs identify opportunities to increase compatibility between agricultural and non-agricultural uses by looking for ways to avoid, minimize, then mitigate adverse impacts on agricultural operations and the Agricultural System.\nLot Creation and Additional Residential Units (ARU)\nPCFA is optimistic about the reconsideration of the proposed lot severance policies and look forward to seeing this changed in the PPS.\nWhile PCFA does not support further lot creation and severances, we do support additional\nresidential units on existing farm parcels, and in rural hubs, hamlets, and communities to support our agricultural system. PCFA would like to establish our support for additional dwelling units subordinate to the principal dwelling on an agricultural parcel but do not support the establishment of additional lot severances on these parcels.\nIn our previous submissions to the government regarding the PPS 2020, we have commented\nthat the PPS 2020 does not go far enough in protecting our finite agricultural lands. We have\nrecommended strengthening of the PPS 2020 in order to require fixed urban settlement\nboundaries and policies requiring mandatory intensification within the existing built urban areas.\nWhile PCFA is supportive of additional residential units, we do feel there needs to be further\nspecificity in the policy. Our concerns include a lack of criteria for ARUs, insufficient consideration for onsite infrastructure and servicing, inconsistency between policies on provincial guidance, a lack of consideration for the distinctiveness of municipalities, and the exclusion of specificity surrounding whether these policies apply to both farm and rural lots.\nPCFA believes that there should be additional consideration of a set of criteria for ARUs as well as clarification on the extent of this policy. There is a distinct lack of inclusion for the type, size, scale, and location of these proposed ARUs that needs to be addressed as well as the clarification on whether this policy is exclusive to farm lots or includes rural lots as well.\nFurther, we are concerned that inconsistencies between policies on permitted uses in agricultural lands could lead to the misinterpretation or unpredictable development and approval of ARUs. Specifically, under section 4.3.2 Permitted Uses, 4.3.2.4 (principal dwellings) states that the policy must be in accordance with provincial guidelines, however, 4.3.2.5, does not include this provision. PCFA believes that this exclusion in conjunction with the lack of criteria for ARUs could result in development that does not align with our position that farming to produce food, fibre, fuel,flowers, and nursery stock is the best use for farmland.\nAdditionally, we must highlight the distinctiveness of municipalities across Ontario, both in their\nlandscape as well as their governance ability and priorities. No two municipalities are alike,\ntherefore flexibility within the PPS for municipalities to be more restrictive to meet their goals should be included.\nPCFA sees that opportunities to build more rural housing should be concentrated within, and\ndirected to, rural settlements and settlement areas as identified in APTG Policy and PPS (2020)\nPolicies 1.1 \u201cManaging and Directing Land Use to Achieve Efficient and Resilient Development\nand Land Use Patterns,\u201d 1.1.3 \u201cSettlement Areas,\u201d 1.1.4 \u201cRural Areas in Municipalities.\u201d Density\nand intensification targets should be analyzed and identified in accordance with APTG\nmethodology and appropriately applied to rural settlements and settlement areas.\nWithin rural lands, PCFA recommends that agricultural uses, agriculture-related uses, on-farm\ndiversified uses, and normal farm practices should be protected and given higher priority as\npermitted uses under PPS (2020) Policy 1.1.5.2 and throughout Policy 1.1.5 \u201cRural Lands in\nMunicipalities.\u201d\nWe acknowledge the servicing capacity limits many rural communities in Ontario face, such as that with private water and wastewater services. However, rural communities also need additional housing. There are opportunities within existing smaller villages, hamlets, and towns to increase density on parcels of land in the settlement area that are adequate for servicing and more efficiently contribute to the rural tax base. This would serve to eliminate the need for lot severances on agricultural lands while providing increased housing options across Ontario.\nEmployment Lands\nIn Bill 97, PCFA is concerned about the alterations to the definition and policies for Employment Lands proposed in the Planning Act amendment in Schedule 6 of Bill 97. We would like to maintain that the resulting impacts of reduced protections for Employment Lands could result in increased pressure to utilize agricultural lands such as Prime Agricultural Lands and Specialty Crop Areas for employment uses in the future as well as put agricultural processing operations at risk.\nMunicipal Flexibility\nPCFA believes that the PPS should be used as a baseline and remove the provisions that limit the flexibility of municipalities. As we have highlighted, municipalities vary across the province and it is PCFA\u2019s belief that municipalities should be allowed to be more restrictive within the local policy so long as it is in accordance with provincial policy.\nAgricultural Impact Assessment\nWhile we are very happy to see that Agricultural Impact Assessment (AIA) is included in the\ndefinitions, we do believe that an AIA must (not should) be completed under section 2.3 Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions. We are pleased to see the\nrequirement for \u201cavoiding, or where avoidance is not possible, minimized and mitigated as\ndetermined through an agricultural impact assessment...\u201d in section 4.3.5 Non-Agricultural Uses\nin Prime Agricultural Areas. We are also very pleased to see the application of 4.3.5.2 applied to\nMineral Aggregate Extraction in Prime Agricultural Areas under 4.5.4.1.a. Avoiding impacts to\nagricultural areas from mineral extraction is an important protection of Ontario\u2019s limited agricultural lands.\nPCFA is very pleased to see the requirement for an AIA or equivalent analysis for mineral extraction in prime agricultural areas, yet we remain concerned there are circumstances in which \u201ccomplete rehabilitation to an agricultural condition is not required....\u201d As established in 4.5.4.2. It is our belief that an application to extract minerals in prime agricultural areas that cannot be rehabilitated to an agricultural condition should not be approved on the basis that it does not meet the conditions of that application.\nNatural Heritage & Water\nPCFA believes that the Provincial Planning Statements should not remove the words \u201call municipal\u201d from section 4.2.1(e)(1). We believe that this section should remain \u201cImplementing necessary restrictions on development and site alteration to: 1. Protect all municipal drinking water supplies and designated vulnerable areas; \u2026\u201d\nPCFA believes that the definition of \u201cWetlands\u201d, as it currently exists in the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 should remain.\nWetlands: means lands that are seasonally or permanently covered by shallow water, as well as lands where the water table is close to or at the surface. In either case the presence of abundant water has caused the formation of hydric soils and has favoured the dominance of either hydrophytic plants or water tolerant plants. The four major types of wetlands are swamps, marshes, bogs and fens.\nPeriodically soaked or wetlands being used for agricultural purposes which no longer exhibit wetland characteristics are not considered to be wetlands for the purposes of this definition.\nWe look forward to reviewing the proposed natural heritage policies when they are released.\nWe are concerned that combining A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 would diminish the protections and support for agricultural lands and community and therefore open the floodgates for a rash of developments that run counter to our overarching philosophy of farmland preservation which is paramount to OFA\u2019s mission of \u201cFarms and Food Forever.\u201d\nPCFA appreciates the opportunity to provide our feedback and agricultural perspectives on the proposed Provincial Planning Statement. We look forward to working with the provincial government and our municipal counterparts to protect Ontario\u2019s farmlands as well as sustain Ontario\u2019s housing supply and communities.\nSincerely,\nPerth County Federation of Agriculture\n",

Ontarians want affordable and sustainable housing on lands already approved, within city boundaries. Thanks for listening to Ontarians!\n",

        "comment":"We live on a small 25 acre hobby farm. We had a vision to use the farm in the raising up of our children  (some of them born here) alongside our full time job in construction.  We provided them with the wholesome upbringing that included raising sheep and chickens, ducks, geese, pigs, and lately a few cows. They helped the neighbour milk goats as well. They learned to work and earn money from our small farm. They understood that much of the food we ate was a result of both hard work and Dad and Mom\u2019s investment in the farm. They sold lambs at the local action, and eggs to various friends and family members. Our oldest child bought their first car with egg money!\nAs our children are getting older, they are realizing that\u2026..even with their full-time jobs\u2026\u2026they may never be able to buy a house near us, or if they were able, it wouldn\u2019t be a hobby farm where they could give their children the same upbringing as they had.\nWe understand to some degree the concerns that have been brought forward by farmers. But we also see that they could be shooting themselves in the foot in that\u2026\u2026.WHO WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO TAKE OVER FOR THEM???? Hmmm\u2026..will the taxpayer have to foot some of that? If their children (or even potential farm hand) are not able to realize home ownership near the farm\u2026..will they stay?\nFarming needs to be affordable and attractive to the next generation and being able to sever off a small lot(s) makes that attractive affordablily more viable to the farm owner and to the buyer.\nWhat this new proposal could mean to our family is that\n~Some of our children would be able to own a house of the own \u201con\u201d the farm which they grew up on.\n~They could provide the structure for a hardworking, sustainable upbringing to their children.\n~We ourselves would be able to stay here through retirement\n~We would be able to live close to our grandchildren and being able to help teach industrious life skills.\n~We would have grown children close by to help us as we age.\nIt would mean that our family living in close proximity to eachother wouldn\u2019t be an unheard of, unattainable luxury.\nIt would mean that the strength and energy we have put into this farm and into this community as a family would continue in to the next generation.\nWe don\u2019t believe our situation is unique.\nPlease consider this proposal for approval. We wish you wisdom in your decision.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to proposed changes to the Provincial Policy Statement, 2022 (PPS) and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Growth Plan). These changes would accelerate urban sprawl and the ongoing loss of farmland and natural areas in Ontario.\nA shortage of land is not the cause of Ontario\u2019s housing shortage, as noted by the Housing Affordability Task Force in 2022:\n\"Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (p. 10)\"\nIt is time to listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets.\nThere is simply no need for proposed policy changes which would:\n- Eliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to rein in urban sprawl;\n- Allow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n- Force municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n- Exempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n- Remove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and\n- Weaken and eliminate policies intended to address climate change.\nOntario is losing farmland at the shocking rate of 319 acres per day. The proposed new policies will make matters much worse and spell disaster for the lands and waters that sustain us.\nSprawl development will not solve current housing needs, as your government pretends. I urge you to retain all PPS and Growth Plan policies that are designed to curb sprawl and protect farmland and natural areas.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Steve Clark and the conservatives,\nWhen my husband and I took over his family farm in 1989 we severed two acres and built a new house to raise our family. We've lived and worked on the farm since then, raising our three children and teaching them the rules and responsibilities that come with running a farm. They're all grown up now, and it's now their turn to follow in the same foot steps as us but they are unable to. We can't afford to build a house for them and they can't do it on their own without severing so instead they are stuck trying to find basement apartments in places that are 45min + away from the farm. They're unable to live and work on the farms they're taking over and now their families are left without the same opportunity ours had. Please do what you can to help them. They need it. For our farms, our farmers, and the future generation not just this one but the one that's coming.\nBless you.\n",

        "comment":"Ontario\u2019s proposed Provincial Planning Statement (PPS) touches on several aspects of rural housing.  The comments and assessment which follows relates to the idea of rural densification and how the PPS addresses this or could be improved to better respond to this objective.\nRural densification is not much different than its city counterpart, urban intensification which is covered in the PPS.  The term \u201cintensification\u201d is defined in the PPS as:\nIntensification: means the development of a property, site or area at a higher density than currently exists through:\na) redevelopment, including the reuse of brownfield sites;\nb) the development of vacant and\/or underutilized lots within previously developed areas;\nc) infill development; and\nd) the expansion or conversion of existing buildings.\nUnderpinning this definition is the idea that areas that have already been developed can be developed further by leveraging underutilized spaces within the existing municipal footprint.  The logic is simple, leverage existing infrastructure and public service facilities.  This can lead to faster expansion of housing by not linking housing to the need to build significant new infrastructure\/facilities (i.e. networks to transport utilities, roads) which takes time and additional public funds.  It can also prove more cost effective for municipalities and builders by saving the associated time and costs of these elements in unserviced areas.  Builders further advance the intensification objective by maximizing the number of housing units (i.e. density) within a particular space available for development.  Invariably this is achieved most economically by building multi-unit spaces upward, either in the form of apartments or condominiums.\nJust like urban municipalities, intensification as described in the PPS definition is possible in rural municipalities that have an urban footprint and associated infrastructure.  However, these municipalities tend to have a limited designated urban\/serviced area and the cost and lead time to add infrastructure (e.g. water and wastewater management capacity) can be long and prohibitive given the limited tax base the rural municipality can draw from.  Moreover, housing in rural municipalities is invariably low-rise in nature, both in keeping with the historic character of these communities and the limited scope of public infrastructure when compared with large urban municipalities.\nYet Ontario is filled with hundreds of rural municipalities that are housing almost two million Ontarians.  Like any municipality, these communities need ongoing growth to: thrive, offer economic opportunities, and support public service facilities.  This is coloured by the fact that their demographic age profile tends to be older than urban areas which can undermine their growth rate (e.g. higher ratio of retirees).  This is then exacerbated where there is limited housing supply for new residents who may want to come to the municipality, as well as housing options for young people who grew up there and want to stay.\nAt the same time, rural municipalities benefit from the ongoing expansion of high-speed internet which is key infrastructure underpinning their development and is neutral on where expansion occurs in a rural municipality.  This recent enhancement to rural life reflects the public policy position that rural living is an important part of the fabric of Ontario and a contributor to the province\u2019s development and broader socio-economic needs and goals.  With this understanding, and the belief that rural densification can offer an avenue to pursue these objectives, to what extent does the PPS reflect this?  This is explained in greater detail below.  The brief chart which follows expands on the concept of rural densification and how it can contribute to future housing solutions.\nRURAL DENSIFICATION: development on non-agricultural rural lands that seeks to maximize the amount of housing on those lands while relying on existing public service facilities and acceptable forms of water and waste management\n- Responds to the need for housing in rural communities (particularly in terms of rental units)\n- Provides a rural equivalent to urban intensification to respond to housing gaps quickly and efficiently\n- Prioritizes housing development of non-agricultural rural lands that optimizes the number of dwellings on these lands.\n- Prioritizes developments that promote right size higher density new housing, such as small\/micro\/tiny homes, that require less energy to operate and build, while reducing construction and operating waste\n- Smaller homes lend themselves to factory-built options which can: 1. lower costs, 2. provide high quality new homes built to CSA\/Ontario Building Code standards, 3. speed up deployment of new homes via smaller size and standardized manufacturing processes, while 4. reducing inspection burden on rural municipalities by having preapproved dwellings that do not require municipal oversight through the building process of each home added to their community\n- Provides a more affordable path to a home through a smaller home footprint that can be delivered in the form of home ownership or rental housing.\n- Smaller in situ local footprint is environmentally oriented by removing the distance associated with delivering public waste and water services.  This in turn lowers costs of developments and speeds up deployment of housing.  This approach reflects an eco-system management approach by using and keeping (treated) water on site.\n- Is a more efficient and effective way of servicing new homes outside existing public services in that municipality.  Specifically, communal servicing has its costs borne by the private sector and uses mature technology that can be deployed quickly and scaled up, as necessary.\n- Relies on existing public service facilities (including roads) and extends their use by growing the rural community, without the need to expand public infrastructure (particularly water and sewage).\n- Housing can be deployed quickly and efficiently, allowing rural municipalities to respond to economic opportunities and social pressures (e.g. immigrant influx) in real time\n- Allows for phased development that reduces risks to builders and municipalities\n- Protects agricultural lands while providing a means for rural communities to thrive and contribute to Ontario\u2019s growth\n- In line with, and builds on, the elements of the draft Provincial Planning Statement.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the government\u2019s proposed planning ideas guiding future development. The following comments can be used to answer the 5 questions that you have posed. I\u2019m taking the general perspective here (based on recent past public engagement sessions such as the Bill 23 review) that this is more of a performative exercise in soliciting opinion rather than one of legitimate substance, i.e., the lowest rung on the Arnstein\u2019s Ladder of Citizen Participation, 1969.\nLet me begin by stating my credentials in reviewing and implementing planning policy of the provincial government. I have been involved with municipal planning in ON for the past 5 decades \u2013 in roles as a planning student, as a municipal planning bureaucrat, as a researcher and planning educator. In essence, the current iteration of provincial planning direction is to give an \u2018appearance\u2019 of providing land use guidance against a backdrop of MZO or MMAH ministerial exemption exception clauses when good public policy gets in the way of potential development. The fixation of the current government\u2019s obsession to the province as a \u2018place to grow\u2019 above all else is heard loud and clear in the proposed document.\nMy comments here will be illustrative in extent as I do not want to waste my time and energy in explaining things when a final \u2018political planning\u2019 predetermined outcome may have already been set. With the governments\u2019 current \u2018housing crisis\u2019 mantra, it has fixated on the trickle-down economics notion that if you provide more housing (supply) that demand will be met, and prices of housing will become more attainable\/affordable. This is a fiction, especially within a fast-growing urban conurbation such as Toronto; evidence to this is found in the academic literature. The Province is faced with many challenges besides building more houses \u2013 many health care, social and environmental issues are evident that have associations to land use planning.\nWith the above being stated, I will now outline comments concerning proposals of the draft PPS that I find most outrageous:\nA \u2013 obvious to see that a scientific co-ordinated basis for planning has now been replaced with one where the 444 municipalities in the Province can make decisions giving \u2018should\u2019 or \u2018encouragement\u2019 considerations of the Provincial prescriptions of the new PPS. Regional co-ordination planning bodies (regional planning, conservation authority planning) to guide collaborative servicing, natural heritage and watershed protection have now been largely done away with. In addition, land use planning municipal decision-making monitoring by the Province is largely absent as it now may be deemed to be unnecessary bureaucratic \u2018red tape\u2019 and a needless monitoring expense (as advanced already by the ON Auditor General).\nB \u2013 a development \u2018anywhere any-type\u2019 approach to planning has been adopted to assist speculative development interests. In reading through the policy only a few targeted prescriptions for minimum levels of density have been retained in large and fast-growing GTA municipalities. Settlement boundaries may be expanded without comprehensive review, non-standardized projection methodologies for land need for residential\/non-residential development can be used, and development can occur in many more places in rural locales (where development expectations are set simply by local market-demand developers\u2019 marketing dreams).\nC \u2013 a general prescription to municipally-plan into the future without a maximum end date does not make sense, i.e., proposed PPS permits municipalities to plan beyond a minimum of 25 years. Differing planning horizons for adjacent municipalities will make co-ordination of servicing, land protection for natural\/ag land areas difficult to accomplish.\nD \u2013 a part-positive comment to make now. It is fortunate to see that the Province has already identified the error (in the press at least) in suggesting the permission of more residential severances across agricultural areas of the Province is a mistake. The ag lands should be protected for food and agri-business production now and into the long term.  Nebulous policy such as \u2018promotion of an ag systems approach\u2019 to planning will not assist in protecting ag lands. In addition, the cumulative impacts of ag land removal through additional rural sprawl are not adequately considered.\nE \u2013 additional policy is required in the PPS to give direction to municipalities to the protection of endangered species habitat, and also to plan for the negative impacts of climate change (not simply change, but measures to adapt to and mitigate impacts). Addition policy is required to protect natural areas as well as to provide for new urban development.\nF \u2013 the indigenous peoples 'duty to consult' responsibility down-delegation to municipalities for planning is not appropriate. There is unclear guidance in the draft PPS as to what this entails, especially in light of the new streamlined development application review requirements set out in other legislation by the current government.\nIn conclusion, while there is merit in creating planning guidance that avoids repetition and potential confusion between differing planning guidance documents (the current PPS and the GGH Growth Plan), the new PPS proposal does not do the job and is not appropriate to guide development in the remote\/rural\/urban parts of this diverse provincial landscape. The draft document overall appears to have been put there quickly with many ill-conceived notions. I would suggest the government either abandon this exercise or begin anew with all potentially impacted stakeholders involved in the review and discussion.\nIf interested in reading further background as to how I have formulated my observations, I would direct your attention to the following organizational links.

        "comment":"PROVINCIAL POLICY STATEMENT 2020 REVIEW\nCOMMENTS\n\u2022\tThe 2020 PPS was short on enforcement provisions and as a result, while the 2020 PPS imposed several obligations on municipalities, they failed to meet those obligation and there was no enforcement mechanism of those provisions.  As an example, Section 1.4.3 of the 2020 PPS stated that \u201cPlanning authorities shall provide for an appropriate range and mix of housing options and densities to meet projected market-based and affordable housing needs of current and future residents of the regional market area by:  a) establishing and implementing minimum targets for the provision of housing which is affordable to low and moderate income households and which aligns with applicable housing and homelessness plans...\u201d  No municipalities did this, and there were no consequences for that failure.  The 2023 Proposed PPS is also lacking any enforcement provisions and hence will likewise be toothless in regard to enforcement.\n\u2022\tSection 1.4.3 of the 2020 PPS has been removed.  In fact, the obligations of municipalities to set and meet targets for affordable or attainable housing is totally missing from the 2023 Proposed PPS.  This is a major gap in the new document and needs to be rectified by reintroducing the majority of the 2020 PPS section dealing with a range and mix of housing.\n\u2022\tThe 2023 Proposed PPS contains no definition of affordable or attainable housing and in fact those terms have been removed from the document entirely.  This must be fixed as the PPS is the perfect document to create a general definition that can be modified by local municipalities as they need.  In fact, it should be an obligation of each planning jurisdiction to generate its own version of the PPS definition that fits its area, and to yearly review that definition for accuracy and effectiveness while it revies local municipal performance in meeting targets set annually.\n\u2022\tSchedule A being a list of large and fast-growing municipalities is missing several fast-growing municipalities in Ontario.  For instance, the Town of The Blue Mountains was listed by CMHC in 2022 as the second fastest growing municipality on Canada, yet it is not on the Schedule A list!  What other municipalities were missed?  TBM has consistently lodged over 450 new home builds a year over the past number of years over a base of 7,500.  However, none of those were in the affordable range.  Council\u2019s attempt to force developers to pay attention to the attainable or starter home portion of the housing market was frustrated by a lack of support from Provincial planning statements!\n\u2022\tIn the Preamble, the proposed document states that \u201cThe policies of this Policy Statement may be complemented by provincial plans or by locally-generated policies regarding matters of municipal interest\u2026\u201d   Locally-generated policies and plans must complement the PPS or there will be an inconsistent application of the PPS across the province.  The word \u201cmay\u201d should be replaced by \u201cmust\u201d.\n\u2022\tIn the Preamble, the proposed document states that \u201cOfficial plans should coordinate cross-boundary matters to complement the actions of other planning authorities and promote mutually beneficial solutions\u2026\u201d.    Again, in order to ensure that the PPS is consistently applied across the province and in particular, across regions, OP\u2019s of palling authorities should be forced to coordinate across municipal boundaries, or at a minimum, municipalities be forced to publicly advise why this should or cannot be the case.\n\u2022\tIn the Preamble, the proposed document states that \u201cZoning and development permit by-laws should be forward-looking and facilitate opportunities for an appropriate range and mix of housing options for all Ontarians..\u201d  Part of the reason why the province and many municipalities are facing an affordable housing crisis is that municipalities in Ontario failed to implement zoning and development permit by-laws that were not forward looking in regard to a range and mix of housing.  This should be a firm obligation of municipalities and hence the wording of this section should make this forward-looking stance to be mandatory.  Further, as in the 2020 PPS, municipalities should be obligated to annually set targets for affordability and measure their success in achieving those targets.\n\u2022\tIn the Vision section of the Preamble, it is good to see that the province has identified the need for a full range of housing.  However, this theme is not recognized anywhere else in the document.  It would seem appropriate for a major theme to be reflected a number of times in the document body but it is not.\n",

        "comment":"My primary concern with the proposed changes to the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) was  the provision for 3 new\/additional severances on existing agriculture zoned land. I understand the provincial government will no longer be moving ahead with this change to the PPS.  Ontario is losing prime agricultural land at a alarming rate of 319 acres a day and policy is needed to slow this rate down rather than accelerate it.  Thus the key objective of the PPS must be the protection of prime farm land, whether agriculture or rural zoned  for long-term agriculture use.\nI am concerned about other proposed changes to the PPS, and request consideration of the following points related to these concerns.\n1. Current provisions for additional residential units on farms is adequate, farm succession is never meant to be dealt with through land severance, but rather by economic policies.  There are only so many times that a farm can be severed.  These severances will see the eventual demise of the livestock industry in much of the province.\n2. I am firmly opposed to the proposed expansions of settlement area boundaries.  Should settlement boundary expansion be seen as necessary, justification should be provided with a municipal comprehensive review and an Agricultural Impact Assessment.\n3.  Intensification targets for urban areas should remain, in fact I would rather see them strengthened.  Farmland protection happens within urban boundaries.\n4.  The PPS should serve as the provincial standard from which local official plans are developed.  Local official plans should be able to be more restrictive than the PPS, but not less.\n6.  The Agriculture System Mapping requirement should remain in the PPS and used for local planning purposes.\n7.  Lack of Municipal control\nProductive farmland in Ontario is a scarce resource comprising less than five percent of the Ontario land mass.  It can remain a productive economic asset as long as it remains in agriculture.  Once it is developed, it is lost to agriculture forever.\nI recognize the critical need for housing but believe there is sufficient land within current municipal boundaries to build the 1.5 million homes the government wants built. And homes on acre lots certainly do not address a housing shortage.  No one can afford those lots, me included.\nI look forward to your response to my letter and policy that increases housing and at the same time affords strong protection to Ontario's prime agriculture land.\n",

Any such action would ignore the province\u2019s Duty to Consult and violates the spirit of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee (TRC) and its 94 Calls to Action.\nOur history and culture have been transmitted orally since time immemorial. The erasure of our civilizations began as soon as the first European reached our shores. As our peoples were forced to assimilate and punished for speaking our own languages, much of our culture was in danger of fading away and being forgotten. Often our ancestors died from disease or neglect caused by assimilation before their stories could be passed down, and many of their graves and communities lie unknown and await rediscovery. Any cultural and archaeological evidence of our past should have increased protection and importance, not less.\nAs noted in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s (TRC) final report, \u201cfor over a century, the central goals of Canada\u2019s Aboriginal policy were to eliminate Aboriginal governments; ignore Aboriginal rights; terminate the Treaties; and, through a process of assimilation, cause Aboriginal peoples to cease to exist as distinct legal, social, cultural, religious, and racial entities in Canada.\u201d The TRC report goes on to state that cultural genocide is perpetuated in part by the disruption of families in order \u201cto prevent the transmission of cultural values and identity from one generation to the next.\u201d We were pleased to see the start of efforts to right these historic wrongs through the TRC and its 94 Calls to Action, but Ontario\u2019s plan to ignore the importance of Indigenous cultural heritage feels like step backwards.\nWe at MSIFN have been making every effort to meet with representatives of the government, and had felt we were making progress in educating them on their Duty to Consult. We acknowledge that Section 4.6.5 of the proposed Provincial Policy Statement continues to require engagement with Indigenous communities, but we feel that this government must make a much greater effort to do so. The act of consultation implies a mutual respect and understanding between us. The act of deliberately ignoring the significance and intrinsic value of our cultural legacy does the opposite.\nIt is hard to believe that this government could place a higher value for a parking lot over Indigenous heritage, but the removal of cultural and archaeological considerations from the definition of the term \u201csignificant\u201d sends a clear message on how little we are valued. I truly hope that was not the intent, and that the language from the 2020 version that includes cultural heritage and archeology resources in the definition of significant will be included in the new Provincial Policy Statement.\nOntario\u2019s Indigenous communities have a deep understanding of the many harms caused by the lack of housing \u2013 we live with that reality every day. We agree that more housing is desperately needed. But we also believe that an MZO or regulation change should not trump our Treaty Rights. As well, we believe that there should be a moral duty to honour the past in addition to the constitutional requirement for consultation.\nAs Chief and on behalf of my people, I call upon Premier Ford to recognize the significance of cultural history and increase the protection of Indigenous heritage in Ontario\u2019s land use planning policies. MSIFN urges the government to reverse this proposed change to the Provincial Policy Statement \u2013 and that should only be the start.\n",

Eventually, he rented the land to a local farmer and she still farms it.  The property is just under 100 acres but approximately 82 acres are rented out.  My husband died in 2016 and I live on the property with my daughter and her family.  None of us are farmers.  My son-in-law is an electrician with a good-paying job.

You have to have millions of dollars for land, equipment, fertilizer, etc.  Most farmers are land-poor.  I would like nothing more than to sever a lot for my family to someday build their own house on my property, however, this opportunity has been withheld from me up to now.  The farming industry is rightfully concerned about the loss of farmland, however, farmland is lost every day to huge land developments.  Just take a drive through Binbrook or Caledonia and see where the farmland is going.  Most of these houses probably START at $750,000.  My children can't afford one of these houses.  If I were able to sever three lots from my property and could build on those lots, I have many friends and relatives who are desperately poor and must rely on relatives or friends to subsidize their housing needs.  You are right to push for more housing. Ontario has millions of \"working poor\".  As long as the housing developers keep building these three-story mansions that nobody can afford the situation will never change.  I am a senior citizen and many of my personal friends cannot afford an apartment or senior's accommodations.  The waiting list in my area for geared-to-income housing is 8 years.  Some of my friends probably won't live that long.\n",

These lots are already serviced with a named road, town water, and electricity.  With an average lot size of 350 x 200 each in this case, if allowed severance there is the potential of another four lots 175 x 200 or eight lots 85 x 200 for single family residences. Average lot width on this street is 85 feet.\nHowever, these four zoned Agricultural lots are presently not able to be severed due to the existing Official Planning requirement to have a minimum of nineteen hectares to be allowed by an updated Official Plan to sever.\nThere is always an exception to every rule, and this is an area of definite exception. This is just one example that truly exists, and many additional exceptions could exist as well.\nSimply, updated provisions added to the current Official Plan to allow property zoned Agriculture not directly connected to Agricultural land or Agricultural operations and located on an existing residential service street be exempted from the 19-hectare ruling, zoning change from agricultural to residential or any other current restrictive guidelines.\n",

        "comment":"As a youth living in Ontario, I am very concerned about the future of this province. We are currently in climate, housing, and food crises. We need to act now to densify cities to protect farmlands and greenspace so that we can have affordable housing, local food, and natural spaces for generations to come. We are at a pivotal point in history right now - we have the opportunity to solve all three of these problems and launch Ontario into a healthy, livable future. Or we can do nothing and create a future of food insecurity, climate disasters, and unaffordable housing.\nThe choice seems obvious. Yet the Ontario government's recent Bills 23 and 97 and the PPS changes, which claim to be helping the housing crisis, are just sending us in the opposite direction. They are encouraging urban sprawl to occur on a large scale all across Ontario, which will destroy farmland and green spaces only to build unaffordable housing with unaffordable (and emission-heavy) commutes.\nThe Region of Waterloo\u2019s Official Plan plans to accommodate 125,000 homes by 2031, in comparison to the 70,000 homes that the suggested provincial changes would build in that time, and it does all this while respecting the Countryside Line and building forward into a greener future. It focuses on intensifying city cores rather than building suburbs out into farmland. This plan supports the community by:\nProtecting the farmlands that feed us and the wetlands that keep us safe from environmental disasters\nSupporting low-income housing.\nBuilding 15-minute walkable communities that allow citizens to use active and public transport to get to jobs and amenities, instead of driving and paying the high gas prices.\nSaving tax money.\nThis plan thinks far into the future and works to solve several important issues, including the housing, climate, gas\/transportation, and food crises.\nFurthermore, there is no need to cut into the Greenbelt for new development because there is land available that has already been zoned for development.\nIn Waterloo Region, developers are sitting on land for 19,000 homes that have been fully approved and are ready for housing, but no construction has begun.\nIn the GTA and Hamilton area, there are 86,500 acres currently zoned for development and available for use.\nInstead of forcing municipalities like the Region of Waterloo to give away precious farmland for new development, we encourage you to mandate developers to use up land that they already have.\nThere is no need to cut farmland lots into three pieces - Ontario clearly has enough development space already. It is time we focus instead on intensifying cities rather than sprawling out unnecessarily into farmland.\nSo please, for the sake of my future and the future of all young Ontarians, consider focusing on housing solutions that will actually fix the problem instead of exacerbating several issues. Otherwise, the future of Ontario is looking very scary indeed.\n",

For more than 25 years we have gone to court to protect wilderness and wildlife, challenge industrial projects, and keep harmful chemicals out of the air, water, and ecosystems we all depend on. We represent community groups, non-profits, Indigenous communities and individual Canadians in the frontlines of the fight for environmental justice. This submission is made on behalf of Ecojustice and not on behalf of any client organization.\nWe agree with the submissions of the Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA) as well as the coalition comments submitted by Ontario Nature to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, which are broadly consistent with these comments. In particular, we agree that the underlying premise of these changes is false and that the proposed changes needlessly accelerate urban sprawl without providing housing benefits.\nIn addition to those comments, we would like to highlight a few additional points:\n\u2022\tUnlimited planning horizons are extremely problematic and should not be permitted (proposed Policy 2.1.1) longer planning horizons are too speculative to be useful as a planning tool and lead to inflated and unrealistic projections for growth. Municipalities are then forced to service that growth at huge expense. Planning horizons need to be constrained and should be no longer than 10 years.\n\u2022\tThe changes will promote disorderly and poorly phased development on the fringes of urban areas as well as \u201cleapfrog\u201d developments in un-serviced or poorly serviced areas inaccessible by transit.\n\u2022\tThe changes allow expensive and inappropriate servicing plans in order to facilitate leapfrog developments (proposed Policy 2.1.2(b)) This will be hugely expensive and potentially financially catastrophic for municipal taxpayers, will result in not enough funds being allocated to maintaining and upgrading existing services in built-up areas and will have resulting pollution and water quality impacts.\n\u2022\tThe type of housing that will be promoted by these changes will be the most expensive, least affordable and accessible housing possible and with the most negative social and environmental impacts.\n\u2022\tThere is a loss of focus on transit-supportive development and built forms that will result in new areas that will never be transit-supportive and are dysfunctional in the long-term as a result. Forecasted population growth will never be possible to accommodate with vehicles alone. This will come with significant public health and climate costs from pollution and inactivity. The changes dealing with active transportation and transit appear to be inconsistent and poorly conceived. Transit needs to be provided outside of strategic growth areas and accessible to all residents in an equitable manner.\n\u2022\tInadequate separation of uses will occur through reliance exclusively on MECP for the regulation of this issue under proposed policy 3.5.\n\u2022\tExpansion of private sewage services (proposed Policy 3.6) is a huge mistake that will have catastrophic water quality impacts.\n\u2022\tThe loss of key growth plan policies around ensuring assimilative capacity for sewage and water services (Policy 3.2.6.2(c) and 3.2.6.3) and stormwater management (Policy 3.2.7) will have long-term adverse health and environmental consequences.\n\u2022\tThere is no justification for removing climate from the stormwater management provisions given that heavy rainfall events are key to stormwater management planning.\n\u2022\tWatershed planning was previously the purview of conservation authorities, the policy that merely encourages municipalities to undertake watershed planning further undermines the integration of watershed planning in Ontario. Watershed planning needs to be mandatory.\n\u2022\tWe are concerned about an undefined reference to \u201cintegrated waste management\u201d this provision needs to be defined and should exclude incineration.\nThese changes overall undermine good planning and will harm future generations for years to come. They are catastrophic changes to Ontario\u2019s planning system that will have un-measurable adverse impacts on human health, climate and the environment.\nIn late June the ERO posting was amended to include the natural heritage provisions.  We are pleased to see that these provisions are largely unchanged from the 2020 PPS.  We reiterate that important natural heritage provisions from the Growth Plan which are not reflected in the PPS will result in an impoverished assessment of the impacts of development on surface water and aquatic systems.  We also object to the removal of the requirement to evaluate the impacts of a changing climate within the natural heritage policies.\n",

The question has validity in the Amherstburg context for the following reasons:\n1)\tCosts associated with legacy infrastructure is demonstrated through many annual budget cycles to be considerable;\n2)\tHow much growth can be sustained on existing and planned infrastructure bearing in mind that the Town is currently undergoing an Official Plan Update and recognizing that all vacant designated residential lands in the Town\u2019s settlement area have draft plans;\n3)\tAmherstburg has considerable lands that are Prime Agricultural Lands abutting our existing settlement area boundaries.  How much of these lands should be considered for addition to our settlement area boundary to satisfy development pressures?\nIn order to maintain Amherstburg\u2019s high quality of living it would be very desirable to have provincial planning policies that will protect our community from growing beyond our means.  The Town is striving to identify what the maximum sustainable population for the 25-year planning period is as part of an Official Plan Update that is currently underway.\nAmherstburg is part of a regional gateway with connections by road, railroad and sea for finished goods, partially finished goods and commodities being imported and exported to and from Canada with much of this associated with the automotive and agricultural sectors.  While an international gateway is provincially acknowledged in the Niagara Region, the international gateway in the Windsor-Essex Region has not been acknowledge as of yet in planning policy.\n",

I own 16 acres of land zoned for agriculture. It is within an estate settlement area totally surrounded by small one and two-acre residential lots. The county, however, does not identify it as a settlement area and refuses to entertain any discussion to allow a simple severance application of ten lots all fronting on existing roads.\nI have a friend whose parents live on a hundred-acre productive farm that has a small 1 - 2 acre parcel that was used to extract gravel more than 60 years ago. It is non-productive farmland but is zoned agriculture and cannot be severed for a residential lot. The newly created lot would front on a seldom-used gravel road.\nI have yet to speak to anyone, including the local planning authorities, that does not agree that both examples should  be allowed to be used as rural estate lots.\nPlease give planning authorities a mandate to use common sense to permit lands that, despite their agricultural zoning, should be rezoned for rural residential uses.\n",

In the Proposal Summary Section it is mentioned that the policy is to be \"... housing-supportive is integral to the implementation of the Housing Supply Action Plan and meeting the target to construct 1.5 million NEW homes by 2031\"\nIn the past home owners severed their property the maximum three times for various reasons, but times have changed and we must permit additional severances . Many rural properties have the space that could be severed an additional time to allow for the building for future residents in our community.\nOften we only make exceptions for the large developers and forget about local residents who make up our community and need to change their housing needs due to aging and mobility, but are restricted by old rules and policies. Forward thinking is required to assist our members of our communities.\nThe proposal mentions that Flexibility on the part of municipalities (should include ALL levels of Government)  to allow more residential development in the rural areas but this can't be done without the flexibility. The by-laws also require updating to allow for more Entrance Permits i.e. should allow for more that just 8 entrances within a kilometre as is the current rules are restrictive from moving forward .\nWe must also consider the aging community who are not allowed to severe their property to build a home for their new needs and are forced to move away from their friends and family due to the current regulations. Given the importance of a place to grow not only for new residents but for residents that want to remain in their rural community on the land they purchased and wish to develop to not only help themselves but help others.\nRural property within a 10 kilometre distance from a Village, town, city etc. should be allowed to severe an additional time as these communities are growing at alarming rates. Exceptions to do this are noted for agricultural use or protected area. This allowance would allow for growth of the area and assist in reducing the housing crisis.\nIt is imperative the the local government be more flexible and not just look at a satellite view of the property but visit the property owner on site to assist in making a logical decision to allow for a severance\/variance.\nThis submission is being completed by Rural property owners who are seniors like many others, who would like the ability to sever their property and stay within their current property\/community and not to be forced out due to current antiquated plans.\nThe new planning proposal would allow for  the \"ripple affect\" to take place which would mean an increase in  residents, increase in  employment opportunities, increase in  infrastructure, and last but not least an increase in REVENUE for the County,  Municipality and Province.\n",

However, are there a few options that the Ontario Government has not considered.  Since it is imperative that low-income housing become available to those who cannot afford the extremely high cost of rent and of owning a home, what options may the Government and others consider?  I am a senior citizen.  Many of my friends are forced to live alone in large older homes that need upgrades and repair.  Who on a fixed income can afford this extra financial burden?  There may be space in the home for an apartment in the basement or attic.  No senior citizen wants to become a landlord.  This is a problem that is currently not being addressed.  I have been in the position of landlord and I sold houses rather than deal with the problems - non payment of rent, damage to property, disagreements with neighbours, etc.  A tenant that doesn't pay their rent and damages the property can set the owner back thousands of dollars in a year.  Currently, no one is steering the boat.\nI live in the country and often see farms go up for sale.  The farmers in this area rightly purchase the property for the land.  However, there may be a farmhouse that could be used but sits empty.  Why?  What farmer wants to be a landlord?\nMunicipalities probably have older Motels that are not fully occupied.  Could these be purchased by the government and rented to low-income singles.  What do we need for accommodation?  Heat, hydro and water.  Some in my area try to live in mobile homes or small houses, this generally is not allowed in my area.  Why?  If there is vacant city land, could the government or city place small houses on these properties and designate them for the homeless.  I am so old, I was raised in a wartime house.  We didn't even have a bathtub or shower.  Heat was provided by an oil furnace in the livingroom.  We had no built-in kitchen cabinets.  Guess what.  I didn't know I was poor and I had a great life.  At least I did not have to live on the street, in Canada, in the COLD. My suggestion is that officials at the Provincial and Municipal level need to start thinking outside of the box!!\n",

Often municipal drains are located adjacent to the roadway causing the potential that each additional entrance to service newly created lots would require an engineer\u2019s report under Section 78 of the Drainage Act.\nIt is well known that there is a provincial shortage of drainage engineers that author reports under the Drainage Act and there already exists a problem to have drainage reports completed within a reasonable amount of time to often deal with failing infrastructure. To add this additional workload on top of an already heavy workload for the limited number of drainage engineers across the Province will create significant delays to completing other necessary projects.\nIn addition, the creation of additional residential lots on formerly agricultural lands may result in significant constraints on the ability to complete typical drain maintenance activities, as indicated within the Engineer\u2019s report, involving work near proposed new residences, removal and spreading the accumulated sediment, etc. With new On-Site and Excess Soil Management regulation (O. Reg. 406\/19), the challenges with dealing with additional trucking to deal with the excess soil are becoming increasingly costly to the landowners that pay into the drainage works.\nThe Drainage Superintendents Association of Ontario is not in support of the proposed creation of additional agricultural lot severances for the reasons outlined above.\nDrainage Superintendents Association of Ontario\n",

That is not the case for prime agricultural land.\nThe province plays the most important role in making sure we still have agricultural land devoted to farming 50 years from now.

        "comment":"We need to stop expanding the boundaries of cities and focus on intensification instead!\nThe things that people want in a big detached home can be fulfilled within the city boundaries with smart planning, which includes larger balconies for private outdoor time, condos that have rooftop gardens and larger park spaces on the property for community gardening and leisure, and legislating condo\/townhome builders to use soundproofing methods between units to cut the noise.\nWhen we sprawl, not only does that cost the city more in road and utility maintenance, but it makes it far less likely that people will use public transit as it takes longer to get into the city center where events are happening. If we are truly concerned with cost savings, lowering emissions, and a thriving local economy, we need to build within the existing boundaries.\nSprawl does not solve the affordability crisis, as the homes are often too big and too far from public transit. I say this as someone who uses public transit regularly - getting in and out of the suburbs is very time consuming. If we want to deal with the problem of traffic on city and provincial roads, we need to stop making cars such a central part of our lives.\nDetached home developments use far more materials to build and are way less efficient for heating and cooling than townhomes and condos, which make them more expensive there too.\nSprawl permanently ruins land, especially when it is established woodlots that are being destroyed. While you can plant new trees, it takes a lot longer to develop the plant and animal diversity that is a part of established wooded areas.\nFarmland should also be preserved, as we cannot keep intensifying how much we grow on one area of land. Crop rotation and resting fields will need to be a part of our future farming plans, and this will require us to preserve arable land from development.\nWe need to stop prioritizing the profits of land developers and the desires of people to consume more land and more materials - sustainable development must happen within the city limits or not at all.\nThank you for your time!\n-Meagan\n",

        "comment":"Hello,\nI bring this comment\/concern forward regarding the housing crisis in Ontario for people with developmental disabilities and the discriminatory barriers in the PPS 2020\/ and proposed PPS 2023 that contribute to the housing crisis.\nDiscrimination in PPS:\nSection 3.1.5 a) states: Development shall not be permitted to locate in hazardous lands and hazardous sites where the use is: a) an institutional use including hospitals, long-term care homes, retirement homes, pre-schools, school nurseries, day cares and schools; b) an essential emergency service such as that provided by fire, police and ambulance stations and electrical substations; or c) uses associated with the disposal, manufacture, treatment or storage of hazardous substances.\nPPS definition of Institutional Use:  for the purposes of policy 3.1.5, means land uses where there is a threat to the safe evacuation of vulnerable populations such as older persons, persons with disabilities, and those who are sick or young, during an emergency as a result of flooding, failure of floodproofing measures or protection works, or erosion.\nI\u2019d like to refute the use of the term \u201cinstitutional use\u201d for group homes, housing 1-7 people.\nThe last institution for people with developmental disabilities was shut down in\nOntario in 2009 so that people could live equally within their communities.\nThe OHRC states: Opposition to housing for people with disabilities is a\nviolation of people\u2019s rights to be free from discrimination in housing \u2013 which means it is against the\nlaw. \u201cEvery person has a right to equal treatment with respect to the occupancy of accommodation without\ndiscrimination because of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex,\nsexual orientation, age, marital status, family status, disability or the receipt of public assistance.\u201d \u2013\nOntario Human Rights Code, s.2(1)\nThe OLT defines supportive and group home housing with or without support workers as residential use.\nThere are numerous cases that have been taken to both the Ontario Land Tribunal and the Ontario\nHuman Rights Tribunal that involved denied group home living to people with disabilities. In all of these\ncases, municipalities and zoning bylaws were struck down in favour of providing access to housing for\npeople with disabilities.\nSince The OLT and OHRC both define group home living as residential use, not institutional use, the PPS is in violation and therefore against the law.\nDiscrimination in housing:\nDiscriminatory opposition in housing may often take on systemic or institutional forms. Systemic or\ninstitutional discrimination includes municipal bylaws, policies or practices that create or perpetuate a\nposition of relative disadvantage for people identified by Code grounds. These may appear neutral on\nthe surface, and may have been well-meaning, but nevertheless have an exclusionary impact based\non Code-protected grounds. The key here is not to just consider intent \u2013 it is equally important to think\nabout the impact municipal decisions have.\nI appreciate the amendments to generate appropriate housing supply specifically to address homelessness and facilitate development of a full range housing options and adorability levels to meet local needs.\nOntario has an estimated 26 year long waitlist for housing for people with developmental disabilities.\nI request to remove persons with developmental disabilities from the definition of institutional use.\nI also request to clearly define group homes and homes for special needs for all residential use.\nI have submitted to amend Essa's Township's bylaw to include group homes for all residential zoning. Essa is in support of the amendment. Unfortunately, NVCA denied the requested based on the PPS 2020. I am attaching my letter in response to NVCA.\n",

        "comment":"Your document is too long and its lack of transparency, and your egregious lack of notification to the public should not have been allowed at all. The document obviously favours development over all other considerations. Development is a short-term idea which will harm Ontario's agriculture, will harm Ontario's small communities, and will encourage the rampant destruction of the environment in this province. In municipalities such as Russell, where big developers have taken an interest, the infrastructure cannot absorb more people, and it definitely cannot afford to lose more land to development. The reason farmland is so precious is that developers and municipal councils have destroyed what existed. The solution then for farmers is to tear down their forests and fill in their wetlands, which they have carte blanche to do. As a result it is hotter, windier, uglier, noisier and there is more erosion, more pollution, more deaths of wild animals, more loss of birds, more damage to groundwater and surface water. Building houses is not the solution. Even if there were enough homes, where will these people find a doctor? Where will they go to an emergency room? What will be the broken down condition of the roads they travel on? Where is the commuter trains or other public transit they will need? There must be consideration of all aspects of life--not just lip service. Who benefits? A few people who are already too rich.\n",

        "comment":"July 31, 2023\nMinistry of Municipal Affairs & Housing\nProvincial Land Use Plans Branch\n777 Bay Street, 13th floor.\nToronto, ON M7A 2J3\nRE: ERO: 019-6813: Feedback on proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nThe Kingston Frontenac Home Builders Association is the voice of the residential construction industry in Greater Kingston and the Surrounding Area. We represent members including builders, developers, professional renovators, trade contractors, and many others within the residential construction sector. The Kingston Frontenac Home Builders Association is proudly coordinating our public policy response with regard to the proposed new provincial planning policy instrument with the Ontario Home Builders\u2019 Association and other chapters within our network.\nAs we know, Ontario needs 1.5 million new homes over the next decade to restore housing attainability. We need the right mix of housing types, formats, and locations to ensure that Ontarians at all stages of life can find a place they can call home. The current provincial planning ecosystem places some limits on how fast our province can achieve the social and economic imperative of dramatically increasing new housing supply and variety. That is why we are encouraged by the proposals that have been put forth to update how Ontario plans for growth.\nWe support the policy direction of the new Provincial Planning Statement (PPS) and the rescinding of A Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Growth Plan). The duplication of policy from the former PPS and Growth Plan led to excessive delay and study requirements of municipalities, builders, and developers in the Greater Golden Horseshoe. While some of the policies of the Growth Plan were helpful in promoting transit-supportive densities in strategic areas, many of the policies of this plan unnecessarily restricted the supply of housing and land available for development and construction that was required to meet its growth targets.\nIt is important to note from the outset that the proposed PPS structure of requiring large\/fast-growing municipalities to be subject to growth-management-related policies is appropriate and needed. The differentiation of a policy set for these municipalities is effective in providing one Planning Statement that can be applied province-wide without placing unnecessary or onerous requirements on smaller or slower-growing municipalities.\nBuilding the Needed Volume and Variety of Housing Options\nThe new PPS will be effective in generating new housing supply in high-growth municipalities and surrounding rural areas. The proposed policies will be effective in creating appropriate housing opportunities in these settings. In particular, the policies that require minimum densities in major transit station areas and other strategic growth areas will ensure that opportunities for higher-density housing forms can be realized in areas that benefit from existing or planned transit.\nIn addition, the permission of additional housing in rural areas can release a significant supply of housing in regions peripheral to urban areas that complement the more compact and urban forms of housing that will be based in urban centres.\nTo ensure that large\/faster-growing municipalities plan for their share of growth, we strongly believe that the province should continue to prepare forecasted minimum population and housing targets for these municipalities (similar to those required in the Growth Plan, and subsequently in the province\u2019s minimum housing targets to 2031) and require that these municipalities demonstrate in their official plans how these targets will be met with the timeframes of the PPS.\nThe PPS should also clarify how minimum intensification targets apply across the entire municipality, and that intensification is encouraged through the settlement area boundary. This is essential to provide policy support for gentle-density forms of intensification in existing areas that would otherwise be prevented by anti-growth special interests.\nLastly, it is important to provide clarity as to what constitutes affordable and attainable housing \u2013 changes to the Development Charges Act should be reflected in the new PPS in this regard. In addition, the PPS should clarify that additional residential units are encouraged in all single, semi-detached, and townhomes (similar to the permissions under the Planning Act) and that these units can provide a supply of purpose-built attainable rental housing.\nMaking More Land Available for Homes & Employment\nWe strongly support the broadening of opportunities to make areas available for new home construction, particularly the new tools and options provided to municipalities to accommodate growth. Subsequently, we welcome the change for municipalities to have to plan to a minimum 25-year horizon; given that most new communities will take 25 years to be substantially built, this timeline is appropriate as a planning horizon.\nFurthermore, we are encouraged by the requirement to maintain a 15-year residential land supply and maintain land with servicing capacity for a 3-year supply of residential units. We believe this policy would be more effective if it clarified that the supply of land and units is to be maintained for a market-based supply of units and be specific to unit type. It is as equally important to forecast for, and provide the right composition of housing, as well as an overall quantity of housing.\nThe provision for a simplified settlement area boundary expansion process is a very positive policy change that should allow municipalities to both create new settlement areas and extend existing ones without the need for brand-new expansions.\nWe strongly support the definition of employment areas in the PPS (which reflects that contained in the Helping Homebuyers, Protecting Tenants Act) and the focus on these areas for a concentration of more intensive industrial and manufacturing type uses. Clarification should be provided that other uses (including commercial, institutional, and residential uses) may be permitted on employment lands and lands designated for employment that do not meet the PPS definition of \u201cEmployment Area\u201d, subject to appropriate separation required for sensitive uses. The province should prepare an update to the D-series guidelines to update the separation requirements for sensitive uses in keeping with the updated definition from the PPS. Overall, this is a significantly positive change that will help ensure that Ontario strikes the right balance between housing, employment areas, and municipal flexibility.\nWe propose further changes with the PPS to permit some municipal infrastructure outside of settlement areas to support smart growth planning. Currently, municipalities continue to preclude any urban infrastructure from being placed outside of settlement areas. This requires stormwater ponds and municipal pipes being placed in urban designated lands, which results in a loss of net developable land, a reduction in land supply adjacent to town centers, and the inefficient use of existing infrastructure. We also recommend that direction be provided through the PPS to permit urban infrastructure being placed in non-urban designated areas if the lands are owned by the same property owner. This will support making more land available for homes and allow a more efficient use of settlement area lands.\nProviding Infrastructure to Support New Housing\nFloodplain mapping and associated modelling in urban areas should be prepared to account for proposed growth, including stormwater management facilities and flood mitigation work in these areas. It is not appropriate to assume a no-mitigation approach to floodplain modelling in an urbanizing area. This approach should be incorporated into the policies of the new PPS and in related guidance material from the province.\nPolicies supporting the location of trails and other passive recreation activities within hydro and gas corridors should be added to the PPS. Moreover, when trails and\/or recreational opportunities can be provided in these corridors, such areas should be eligible for parkland contribution under the Planning Act.\nAdditionally, the policies of the PPS should provide direction to utility providers to integrate their planning with the growth planning of municipalities, and to account for these plans in their future service planning. Moreover, utilities should be strongly encouraged to ensure that sufficient service is available in accordance with planning to support designated growth and the delivery of housing. Where required, the province should consider legislative and policy changes to ensure that both utilities and regulators provide sufficient services for both existing and future housing to achieve municipal growth plans.\nWe strongly support the policy direction to require school boards to integrate planning for schools and growth \u2013 the policies should specifically speak to the minimization of school sites when co-located with parks and should encourage the provision of schools in mixed-use formats, including within multi-storey residential buildings.\nWe further support the use of alternative servicing solutions to enable development in areas where typical full municipal servicing solutions are not viable. The province should prepare guidance material regarding the minimum densities and size of developments appropriate for different servicing solutions.\nBalancing Housing with Natural Resources\nTo minimize potential conflicts with agricultural uses and existing or new residential areas, municipalities should designate rural lands abutting residential areas and settlement area boundaries.\nThe proposed environmental protection policies should be provided in the context of a Housing First policy goal and objectives which should be added to the PPS in settlement area boundaries. An urban lens should be provided for environmental protection in settlement areas, generally directing that preservation of features should have the object of maintaining green infrastructure in urban areas to preserve natural functions and the protection of provincially significant features. Such policies would support the provision of housing through the efficient use of land is essential and a priority over other competing policy objectives.\nIn all areas, the policies related to the natural environment, and environmental protection should allow a net benefit approach through the development process. Such policies should facilitate logical settlement patterns by allowing feature removal or relocation with off-setting opportunities for on- and off-site compensation on a 1:1 basis.\nThe environmental policies could encourage the preservation of non-provincially significant features if it is clarified that such features should be treated as social elements that offer passive recreational opportunities to residents and that they would form part of the parkland dedication requirements under the Planning Act.\nNatural Heritage Policies\nThe implementation of the natural heritage policies has created ongoing challenges both in terms of the timely delivery of communities and homes and in the ability to create more positive and sustainable outcomes for nature.\nGiven the diverse municipal interpretations of the provincial natural heritage policies, the conservation of the most important natural heritage features and functions has often become caught in polarized, lengthy, and expensive arguments about the ecological importance (or lack thereof) of the smallest and isolated patches of nature. In many cases, for example, natural heritage protections are being applied by municipalities to features that are small, disturbed, young on the landscape, and sometimes human-created. The created features that have been defined as significant, for instance, include:\n\u2022\tyoung plantations.\n\u2022\thedgerows;\n\u2022\twetland areas in ditches;\n\u2022\tbacked up drainage systems;\n\u2022\tnaturalizing golf course ponds;\n\u2022\tclosed aggregate extraction ponds; and\n\u2022\tnaturalized farm ponds.\nThis overly cautious approach has created inefficiencies in the development of \u201ccomplete communities\u201d, which may take different shapes and forms appropriate to their contexts to meet the diverse needs of their populations (PPS definition). Our recommended changes to the natural heritage policies will introduce much-needed flexibility, that will also generate more nature-positive outcomes, more quickly. We understand that viable and functioning natural heritage systems are important to the integrity of the environment and to the well-being of citizens who live near and interact with them.\nIn addition, we will continue to work with the province and municipalities to achieve natural heritage outcomes that are practical, viable, and sustainable, whether they occur in settlement areas, rural areas, or agricultural areas. We will continue to offer ideas and solutions that will lead to increased and appropriately targeted investments in our natural heritage systems.\nIn the following, we propose minor, but important modifications to the natural heritage policies to enable our industry to create healthier communities more efficiently and effectively. At the same time, our industry will continue to accelerate the establishment of natural heritage systems that will thrive in areas where communities are developing. We will continue to work with our municipal partners to create communities that enable citizens to interact with nature in respectful and sustainable ways.\nTo achieve these ambitious and positive outcomes, Ontario needs a degree of smart flexibility in the natural heritage policies and their implementation.\nSmart flexibility will best be achieved through the two following distinct, but related changes:\n1)\tShift from the no negative impact test to a no net negative impact test for natural heritage features and associated functions; and\n2)\tFormally adopt an ecological offsetting approach to allow for the selective removal of generally smaller and degraded natural heritage areas with limited functions. The removed features would be replaced, achieving a net ecological gain (i.e., nature-positive outcomes).\nIn the following, additional comments are provided regarding these two proposed changes. Then, specific suggested wording changes are proposed for the PPS natural heritage policies and for a few associated definitions. Some final thoughts are also offered, regarding key next steps to ensure that background materials and guidelines are updated and can support the policy changes.\nNet Negative Impact Test\nThe current test under the PPS related to natural heritage features and functions (excluding fish habitat) is the no negative impact test. That test specifies, that a \u201c\u2026 negative impact is degradation that threatens the health and integrity of the natural features or ecological functions\u201d. Health and integrity are not defined terms, in the PPS.\nRequirements to achieve no negative impact on any aspect of natural heritage features or functions have proven to be challenging and impractical. It is likely that any development or site alteration activity will have some, often minor or immeasurable impact on one or more aspects of natural heritage features or functions.\nThe definition of \u201cfunctions\u201d further complicates the use of the no negative impact test. The PPS defines ecological function as follows \u201c\u2026 means the natural processes, products or services that living and non-living environments provide or perform within or between species, ecosystems and landscapes. These may include biological, physical, and socio-economic interactions.\u201d The complexity of the term ecological function includes undefined biological, physical, and socio-economic interactions.\nThe implementation of a slightly modified test, a no net negative impact test, will allow for minor adjustments to natural heritage features and associated functions. This approach would encourage, not discourage, more innovative forms of mitigation, with simpler impact assessment considerations and with net positive outcomes for nature.\nWhere a development or site alteration could impact larger and more overtly important natural heritage features and associated functions, the no net negative impact test would involve a special form of compensatory mitigation, commonly referred to as offsetting.\nEcological & Biodiversity Offsetting\nThe province\u2019s release of the Discussion Paper, Conserving Ontario\u2019s Natural Heritage, presents an important, forward-looking approach that could significantly improve the use of, and outcomes associated with, natural heritage policies in Ontario.\nEcological biodiversity (also known as biodiversity offsetting) is an impact assessment tool used globally in over 100 countries. These offset programs allow for the compensation of impacts to the natural environment in ways that restore or improve the quality and\/or quantity of the impacted natural heritage features. Unlike a no net negative impact test, which minimizes and neutralizes impacts, offsetting programs require achieving net positive or nature positive outcomes. This approach could be used when predicted impacts surpass what might be considered to be the most minor immeasurable predicted impacts addressed above.\nProposed Natural Heritage Policy Modifications\nThe following are a few specific wording changes to the natural heritage policies and the definitions, that will support our suggested no net negative impact test and the recommended offsetting approach. The numbering system used in this section follows the numbering of sections in the June 16, 2023, version of the proposed PPS.\nRecommended Specific NHS Policy Wording Modifications\nExisting Wording\tProposed Revised Wording\nPPS section 4.1.4\nAdd the word net (underlined below)\nDevelopment and site alteration shall not be permitted in: \u2026\n\u2026 unless it has been demonstrated that there will be no negative impacts on the natural features or their ecological functions\u2026\tDevelopment and site alteration shall not be permitted in: \u2026\n\u2026 unless it has been demonstrated that there will be no net negative impacts on the natural features or their ecological functions\u2026\nPPS section 8\nAdd the word net (underlined below)\nDevelopment and site alteration shall not be permitted on adjacent lands to the natural heritage features and areas identified in policies 4.1.4, 4.1.5, and 4.1.6 unless the ecological function of the adjacent lands has been evaluated and it has been demonstrated that there will be no negative impacts on the natural features or on their ecological functions.\tDevelopment and site alteration shall not be permitted on adjacent lands to the natural heritage features and areas identified in policies 4.1.4, 4.1.5, and 4.1.6 unless the ecological function of the adjacent lands has been evaluated and it has been demonstrated that there will be no net negative impacts on the natural features or on their ecological functions.\nRecommended Definition Modifications\nThe following are suggested changes that will match with other recommendations contained within this material.\na)\tAreas of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSIs)\nOne general comment we offer is related to the ongoing inclusion of Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSIs) within the natural heritage policies. We understand that this program was important at the time (e.g., 1980s), to determine local, regional, and provincial levels of importance for earth and life science ANSIs. The definition of ANSI refers to \u201c\u2026 natural landscapes or features that have been identified as having life science or earth science values related to protection, scientific study or education\u201d. We suggest the relevance of defining the significance of ANSIs related to protection, scientific study, or education, be carefully reviewed. Whether these aspects are appropriate for the definition of natural heritage significance is an important question the province should consider. Furthermore, whether the program is current and if the information is updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis. This may be a moment when the identification, ranking, and conservation of some or all of these features, needs a more discerning review for relevance. We also understand that in many cases, ANSIs will be located within and overlap with other natural heritage features.\nb)\tEcological Function\nThis definition of ecological function is broad, and it is not clear what is being referred to as, \u201c\u2026 biological, physical, and socio-economic interactions\u2026\u201d. We recognize that the 2010 Natural Heritage Reference Manual (created to support the 2005 PPS), will require substantial revisions. One area where additional information and guidance could be improved is related to the definition and measurement of ecological functions.\nc)\tNatural Heritage System\nIn the definition of natural heritage system, reference is made to, \u201c\u2026The Province has a recommended approach for identifying natural heritage systems, but municipal approaches that achieve or exceed the same objective may also be used.\u201d Industry experience has demonstrated that some municipalities have moved thresholds for the determination of significance to a very low level, attaching significance to small, disturbance origin, and non-native plant-dominated communities. This appears to move well past municipalities treating provincial policies as minimum standards. Broad municipal approaches that are not rooted in an understanding of the different landscape characteristics across municipalities, can lead to inappropriate designations of significance. Any guidance to municipal approaches needs to ensure that:\n\u2022\tThresholds for significance are appropriate, based on science, and are adjusted to match varying landscapes and sensitivity; and\n\u2022\tMunicipal policies and mapping comply with PPS section 4.1 3, that states, \u201cNatural heritage systems shall be identified in Ecoregions 6E & 7E1, recognizing that natural heritage systems will vary in size and form in settlement areas, rural areas, and prime agricultural areas.\u201d\nd)\tNegative Impacts\nThe negative impacts definition needs to be adjusted to reflect any changes required, should the province choose to adopt the proposed change to a no net negative impact test for some or all-natural heritage features and functions. A definition would also need to be incorporated for net negative impacts.\nOn Supporting Materials\nThe primary reference related to the natural heritage policies is the Natural Heritage Reference Manual (2010), which is now dated, and was specific to the 2005 PPS. Since its publication 13 years ago, much has been learned about natural heritage in southern Ontario. New and important technical information, references, and scientific literature have been produced since 2010. The manual requires updating that would better explain the determination of significance, current landscape ecological practices, and the most current best practices related to Impact Assessment including the use of offsetting. Substantial updates to the appendices of the manual are strongly recommended.\nOther manuals and references that would benefit from a critical review and updates include:\n\u2022\tSignificant Wildlife Technical Guide (MNR 2000)\n\u2022\tReferences for Regionally and Locally Significant Plant Species (e.g., Cuddy, 1991; Riley, 1989; Varga et al, 2000; Oldham, 1993).\nWe encourage all provincial Ministries to work collaboratively on updating these critical documents to help best protect and preserve our province\u2019s natural spaces in a smart and thoughtful manner.\nConclusion\nWe thank the Ministry for the opportunity to comment on these proposals. We look forward to continuing to engage with the Ministry in order to ensure these proposals are aligned with the goals of improving housing attainability for current and future Ontarians.\n",

        "comment":"We have farmed 100 acres in the Township of Blandford \u2013 Blenheim, County of Oxford for over 45 years.  We have seen many changes to the rural landscape during that time.  We support updating the Provincial Policy Statement in regards Agricultural land use and limited non-farm development.  We believe there are opportunities could add to the supply of housing and address the shortage that we are currently experiencing.   Growth in rural Ontario has been stagnant due to outdated and overly restrictive land use policies.  We feel there are three areas that could allow for expanded residential housing opportunities without upsetting the balance between agricultural and residential development.\n1.\tPermitting the Severance of Existing Surplus dwellings from an agricultural parcel.\nThere are numerous farm parcels with a surplus dwelling that could be severed to add to the available supply of homes.  Often these surplus dwellings sit empty as the farm owner has no desire to be a landlord. These are dwellings that already exist. Allowing a severance and an opportunity for a family to purchase a property outside of the urban areas can be accomplished without conflict.\n2.\tPermitting new Lot creation in areas surrounded by existing residential development.\nWithin our Township of Blandford - Blenheim, we have rural clusters of residential development adjoining farmland.  This is common in most rural municipalities.  In these situations, allowing the creation of new lots adjacent to an existing cluster could be done without further restricting any neighbouring agricultural operations.\n3.\tPermitting residential development on undersized or non-productive agricultural parcels.\nThroughout rural Ontario, there are parcels of land that are too small to be viable for agriculture yet would be ideal to construct a dwelling.  Establishing a new framework to evaluate these types of parcels based on their individual characteristics could also provide opportunities for managed residential growth in rural Ontario.\nWe support well thought out development in rural Ontario in addition to those urban areas designated for growth.  Opening up opportunities for Ontarians to purchase a home and raise a family outside of an urban area or for a retiring farmer to pass down an existing agricultural operation and remain in the community, are good for the province.\n",

        "comment":"This letter addresses the proposed changes to the Provincial Policy Statement from the perspective of the County of Dufferin. The County of Dufferin supports increasing the supply of housing to accommodate the growing population, bolster economic growth, and improve housing affordability. We are however alarmed at several of the key changes which lack foresight, understanding of their long-term effects, and have irreversible negative consequences to rural prosperity.\nThe following are three themes related to the proposed changes, why these changes are problematic, and our recommendations:\nProtect Prime Agriculture Land\nAgricultural lands are integral to the future of a successful and prosperous Ontario. Increasing the housing supply cannot come at the expense of lost farmland. This land produces and supplies food, fibre, and fuel, among other things. Any proposals to increase housing must be done in careful consideration of the protection of agricultural lands.\nWe are encouraged to hear that rural lot creation policies included in the Draft PPS are to be clarified. Further we look forward to confirmation that the proposal to require municipalities to allow the creation of 3 additional lots to be eliminated. This proposal would result in significant and irreversible loss of agricultural land across Dufferin County and all of Ontario. The total agricultural land loss that could potentially result from the implementation of the proposed changes to the PPS would have a significant impact on the agricultural industry. Less than five per cent of Ontario\u2019s land base is prime agricultural lands (OMAFRA, 2016). According to Ontario Farmland Trust, Ontario is already losing 319 acres of farmland every day, as it is transitioned to other uses.\nDufferin County supports the proposal to recognize \u201cadditional residential units\u201d (ARUs) as a permitted use in rural areas, including on a farm. This change is positive, as those units will serve to address and support the needs of farm families and operations with limited impacts on agriculture\/agricultural operations. However, allowing for the severance of such units from a farm is not appropriate or supported, as it may inadvertently lead to additional residential lot creation and associated negative impacts on agriculture. An exception would be when an existing principal farm dwelling that is determined to be surplus to the farm operation in accordance with proposed policy 4.3.3.1 b.\nThe County of Dufferin supports PPS 2020 agriculture policies governing farmland and rural areas protecting the right to farm and the agricultural system in Ontario and supports the position of the OFA that those policies remain in place, particularly the lot creation policies.\nWe do understand the intent to support farmers, their families and agricultural workers by providing housing options that would let children taking over the farm or retiring parents live close by to assist with succession planning. To this end we would recommend the following:\n\u2022\tPolicies that promote additional residential units (ARUs) subordinate to the principle dwelling on agricultural parcels.\nRestrict Boundary Expansions\nThe current PPS 2020 requires that settlement boundary expansions are almost exclusively conducted as part of the Municipal Comprehensive Review (MCR) process. While the proposed PPS 2023 would require \u201cStrategic Growth Areas\u201d to be identified by municipalities, it would also allow landowners to apply to have their land included within a settlement area boundary without any real criteria or consideration of best possible use for that land (as is done through the MCR process).\nEvaluating the merits of individual boundary expansion requests in isolation will challenge staff and Council\u2019s ability to ensure decisions support fully planned and complete communities for future generations. This includes ensuring infrastructure will be in place to support higher density developments which will help keep housing prices down.\nThese policies will lead to significant urban sprawl, especially of low-density housing which over the long term drives up costs per capita of both hard and soft services for all levels of government. Low-density suburbs would have a limited impact on housing supply while doing nothing to limit the increase of prices. These policies will create an undebatable legacy of high costs for services in Ontario and continue to threaten further unnecessary loss of farmland.\nIn addition, there is already a significant supply of undeveloped land within existing settlement boundaries across Ontario. If developers have limited choices on what land to develop, it would naturally lead them to focus on developing these lands and other areas within existing settlement boundaries.\nIf these policies must stay, we would recommend the following additions:\n\u2022\tNew lands brought into a settlement boundary can only permit high density housing. This would avoid issues of low-density unaffordability for residents and governments while still giving Developers options for boundary expansions.\n\u2022\tRequire the removal of land from settlement boundaries that goes undeveloped for a period of time. In essence it would encourage landowners holding onto land to \u201cmove it or lose it\u201d, therefore keeping land prices competitive.\nIncentivize Intensification Targets\nThe proposed PPS 2023 supports intensification in principle, but without targets it is ineffective and will lead to urban sprawl. The challenge with intensification targets has often been that municipalities do not play an active role in deciding what land developers\u2019 want to redevelop within settlement boundaries. As such Municipalities\u2019 ability to achieve greater intensification is limited without additional tools.\nTo achieve intensification, we recommend:\n\u2022\tIntroduce a charge similar to the previous park-land dedication cash-in-lieu payment to be levies on developments which do not meet high density targets. Municipalities would then be required to redistribute those funds to developers\u2019 whose redevelopments surpass intensification targets within core settlement areas.\nSummary\nThe County of Dufferin strongly agrees with the Housing Affordability Task Force statement \u201cthat shortage of land isn\u2019t the cause of the problem\u201d. Enacting the PPS 2023 as-is would weaken the systematic approach to land use planning in Ontario and create a legacy of harmful long term and irreversible impacts on land, agriculture, and financial sustainability.\nWe have provided recommendations that would create a better balance while still working to achieve goals to create more housing for all Ontarians. In summary those recommendations are:\n1.\tPolicies that promote additional residential units (ARUs) subordinate to the principle dwelling on agricultural parcels.\n2.\tRequire new lands brought into a settlement boundary be for high-density developments.\n3.\tRequire the removal of lands from settlement boundaries that go undeveloped after a reasonable amount of time.\n4.\tRequire low density developments to fund high density and redevelopments in core settlement areas.\nFurther, Dufferin County requests that the Province release a revised draft following the close of this initial commenting period and that municipalities be provided an opportunity for additional consultation and review. Given the importance of the PPS to planning for complete and sustainable communities, protecting our farmland and natural resources, we believe it is important to that we work together to get this right.\nSincerely,\nWarden Wade Mills (Mayor, Town of Shelburne)\nCouncillor John Creelman (Mayor, Town of Mono)\nCouncillor Guy Gardhouse (Mayor, Township of East Garafraxa)\nCouncillor Chris Gerrits (Mayor, Township of Amaranth)\nCouncillor Janet Horner (Mayor, Township of Mulmur)\nCouncillor Lisa Post (Mayor, Town of Orangeville)\nCouncillor Steve Soloman (Mayor, Town of Grand Valley)\nCouncillor Darren White (Mayor, Township of Melancthon)\n",

        "comment":"Growth and Density Targets\nThe Statement proposes that municipalities will no longer be required to plan specific population and employment targets. However, the omission of the Growth Plan\u2019s policies on growth targets could bring several challenges as municipalities require guidance and parameters on setting density targets. The Statement states that density targets are \u201cencouraged\u201d under Policy 2.3.5, however, lack of stricter policies, including minimum targets, could lead to insufficient densities being established. In addition, lack of adequate policies for boundary expansion could subsequently lead to urban sprawl. On the contrary, promoting redevelopment, infill development, and densification could foster more sustainable growth.  Municipalities should be required to incorporate these targets in their official plans and apply them across the entire municipality.\nThe proposed policies for complete communities, which lacks mandated intensification targets or redevelopment requirements, could have unintended consequences that would not be in line with intent of those policies if left to municipalities to implement. Municipal decision markers are elected officials, and often side with their constituents rather than what may be best for the future of the municipalities (NIMBYs). Additionally, the ability to expand settlement areas could lead to low-density development in newly expanded areas rather than encouraging infill projects.\nHousing Provisions\nThe Statement would also benefit from further clarification on municipal obligations concerning affordable housing.  The involvement of other levels of government regarding affordable housing provision is essential to meet current and future targets. Developers cannot be expected to bear the full weight of a societal issue such as affordable housing, as it is not sustainable.  Government support is needed by way of offsets (funding, parking rate relief, development charge and parkland fees waived, etc.) and other invested stakeholders, such as banks could also play a role by way of reduced interests rates for land loans, construction loans, and for first-time buyers.\nIn addition, the proposed Statement aims to permit and facilitate conversion of existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use within previously developed areas. This is seen favorably as it would contribute to an increase in the number of residential units.  The Statement also proposes to require municipalities to provide a range and mix of housing options and an expanded definition to include multi-unit types. Further clarity is required as there is no definition of multi-unit types and what this would entail.\nLand Availability\nWe support opportunities to create new residential areas and welcome the requirement for municipalities to plan for a minimum 25-year period. We also encourage the requirement to maintain a 15-year supply of residential land and ensure that municipal servicing capacity can accommodate new residential development for a 3-year period.\nGrowth planning should be integrated with utility providers to ensure adequate servicing for future growth. Additionally, we support the use of alternative servicing solutions to facilitate development in areas where conventional full municipal servicing options are not feasible.\nRural Development\nThe Statement proposes greater permissions for rural development that would allow for an increase in the supply of housing. However, this poses concerns with lot creation in prime agricultural areas. This is demonstrated in a less rigorous process for identifying new settlement areas and for settlement area boundary expansion, which will not require proof that there are no reasonable alternatives to avoid development in prime agricultural areas. Concerns regarding sprawl and the municipalities\u2019 ability to control it also arise. As such, this policy should be revised to ensure the possibility of providing more housing supply with no negative effects for agricultural land. Agricultural land is incredibly important sustaining food supply for an increasing population.\nMunicipalities should consider designating lands adjacent to residential areas and settlement boundaries as rural to minimize conflicts and provide appropriate transition to secure prime agricultural land.\nEmployment Areas\nThe proposed Statement would encourage industrial, manufacturing and small warehousing uses without adverse effects to be located outside of employment areas adjacent to sensitive land uses in strategic growth areas and other mixed-use areas where frequent transit service is available. This could provide job opportunities for people living in the area provided that there are no adverse effects to the community. This policy would contribute to the creation of mixed used areas with a healthy balance of employment and housing.\nNatural Heritage\nChanges to natural heritage policies are required to introduce flexibility, leading to faster and positive outcomes. Such changes could include switching from the no negative impact test to a no net negative impact test for natural heritage features and adopting an offsetting approach for the removal of degraded natural heritage areas with limited functions. Finally, the definitions of ecological function, natural heritage system and negative impacts should be revised and updated.\nConclusion\nWe thank the Minister for the opportunity to provide comments on the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement. We are committed to building better communities and helping the province achieve its housing goals. We look forward to continuing to engage with the Ministry and providing valuable feedback to build a better Ontario.\n",

        "comment":"I would like to express my strong opposition to the proposed replacement of the Provincial Policy Statement and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe with the new Provincial Planning Statement. The changes proposed will encourage urban sprawl and a further loss to our most valuable farmland and the natural areas that all urban residents flocked to during Covid.\nResearch has shown that there is no shortage of land already designated for urban growth with enough currently designated to meet our housing needs until at least 2050!\nI support the government\u2019s objective of addressing the housing supply shortage, but policies must secure a reliable food supply by preserving farmland and ensuring the right to farm. The proposed PPS lot severance polices permitting 3 severances and up to 12 homes on every rural property is of significant concern. Policies must increase the supply of homes without destroying valuable farmland and natural areas.\nAll classes of agricultural lands must be protected by focusing growth within existing settlement areas to minimize farmland loss and land use conflicts. I strongly encourage the reintroduction of higher density targets from the Growth Plan across municipalities to maximize existing urban boundaries and promote responsible development. Stronger language is needed to enforce protective policies to discourage land speculation and to prevent farmers from being priced out of purchasing farmland by speculators.\nMunicipalities should not be allowed to expand settlement areas without a comprehensive review of associated infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas.\nRemoving the requirement for municipalities to plan according to specific population and employment targets for a horizon year eliminates an essential aspect of coordinated growth planning. This requirement should be reinstated and clearly stated.\nLands subject to Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders should not be exempted from complying with provincial policies and official plans.\nWatershed planning should be an essential component of all future planning. Municipalities should be mandated to complete watershed plans prior to expanding urban boundaries.\nSpecialty crop lands such as tender fruit, grape and Holland Marsh should not be open to aggregate operations.\nThe new Provincial Planning Statement weakens and eliminates policies that address climate change (intensification, transit supported development). Policies that address climate change are essential and should be clearly mandated.\n",

One sign for \u201ctowns and singles\u201d even had the audacity to advertise the development as \u201cCountryside living \u201c. Ironic, considering that by the time the concrete is poured and a sprawling subdivision built, there will be no countryside left.\nStatistics show the amount of agricultural land lost each day in Ontario continues to increase. Once paved over, it is likely lost forever. Simultaneously , the global population continues to increase and extreme weather events continue to negatively impact food production yields. We must create a provincial plan that is evidence-based and ensures both people and the ecosystem within which we are a part, are protected.\nWhile I commend the Ontario government for offering targeted financial support to farmers (such as to beekeepers and grape growers financially impacted by extreme drought and heat the last two years) and creating a new conservation area in Prince Edward County, such achievements should not be considered a license to remove farming communities or develop over wildlife habitats in other parts of the province.\nIt is a dangerous gamble to think, \u201cOh, there\u2019s plenty of forests, wetlands, meadows, and agricultural land left in Ontario. We\u2019ll be fine!\u201d One look at the Globe & Mail\u2019s Canadian wildfires map shows, starkly, how quickly land can be lost.\nProtect the Greenbelt.\nBuild housing and commercial developments within existing urban boundaries.\nBuild in and up. Still today, in 2023, new shovels are digging up fields of corn for \u201csingles and towns\u201d, with not a single apartment building or co-op high rise, in an area without public transit or nearby employment opportunities.

We will lose significant resources as a direct result of these changes.\nThe proposal is to change the definition of cultural heritage resources so that only \"protected\" cultural heritage resources will be conserved. These would be properties that are listed or designated under the Ontario Heritage Act ( please note due to recent changes in the OHA it is now more difficult for municipalities to retain properties in the listed category).\nThe current PPS indicates that \"significant built heritage resources and significant cultural heritage landscapes shall be conserved.\" The Definition of Significant, with regard to cultural heritage resources, includes the direction that \"While some significant resources may already be identified and mentioned by official sources, the significance of others can only be determined after evaluation.\" This left the door open to identify significant resources at such time as when a development project comes forward. This provision covered the possibility that significant resources could be uncovered and conserved as part of a careful development process. Under the current proposed provisions these resources could be demolished with no regard for their potential significance.\nDoes the Provincial government have any evidence that housing developments have been held up in any critical way by heritage conservation efforts?

There are, however, several proposed changes that we feel require addressing.\nVision Statement\nThe removal of  \u201cBiodiversity,\u201d from the document\u2019s vision statement may send the wrong message; namely that conservation and preservation of biodiversity is not a priority.\n2.1 Planning for People and Homes\nThe New Provincial Planning Statement includes a provision that states, \u201cWhere the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing has made a zoning order, the resulting development potential shall be in addition to projected needs over the planning horizon established in the official plan.\u201d This policy may inadvertently result in more land being set aside by municipalities than is necessary, furthering the existing issue of urban sprawl across the natural and rural landscape.\n2.3 Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions\nThe elimination of Municipal Comprehensive Review requirements for development projects will likely have serious implications for Ontario\u2019s biodiversity, especially in southern parts of the province. We strongly advise against this free-reigning approach to boundary expansion.\n4.2 Water\nThe elimination of the following requirements with respect to water: \u201cc) evaluating and preparing for the impacts of a changing climate to water resource systems at the watershed level.\u201d Although the PPS does make reference to climate change in other sections, other than with stormwater management, it does not explicitly require municipalities to prepare for the impacts of our changing climate on water. It is clear to the OFAH that omitting such a requirement would be a mistake.\n7 Definitions\nThe replacement of references to \u201cOntario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u201d with \u201cthe Province\u201d within the new definitions of \u201csignificant\u201d wetlands, coastal wetlands, areas of natural and scientific interest and woodlands is of concern. With the MNRF no longer set criteria by which areas of ecological importance are evaluated, the OFAH is concerned that whichever provincial entity is now tasked with creating eligibility criteria for significant ecological features will do so from a less informed perspective than the MNRF, thereby threatening Ontario\u2019s ecological health and compromising the integrity of the planning system, as a whole.\nWe hope the provincial government will consider our comments and suggestions in the interest of a sustainable and abundant future for Ontario.

        "comment":"Re: Review of proposed policies adapted from \"A Place to Grow\" and \"Provincial Policy Statement\" to form a new provincial-planning policy instrument (ERO # 019-6813).\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to proposed policies from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing regarding an \u201cintegrated, province-wide, land-use, policy-planning document\u201d that was developed to achieve provincial housing objectives. The proposed \u201cProvincial Planning Statement\u201d (which takes information from the \u201cProvincial Policy Statement\u201d and \u201cA Place To Grow\u201d) would accelerate urban sprawl and the ongoing loss of farmland and natural areas throughout Ontario \u2013 particularly in the \u201cGreenbelt\u201d area of the province.\nA lack of land is not the cause of Ontario\u2019s housing shortage, as noted by the Housing Affordability Task Force in 2022 (p. 10): \u201cLand is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture.\u201d\nIt is time to listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-term, affordable housing targets. The following proposed policy changes are NOT acceptable:\n\u2022\teliminating mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to reduce urban sprawl;\n\u2022\tallowing municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time, without a comprehensive review of infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n\u2022\tforcing municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n\u2022\texempting lands that are the subject of \u201cMinister\u2019s Zoning Orders\u201d from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n\u2022\tremoving the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and,\n\u2022\tweakening and eliminating policies intended to address climate change.\nOntario is losing farmland at a rate of approximately 319 acres per day. In addition, many wildlife species in the province have been very negatively affected by habitat losses \u2013 including those created by urban sprawl. The proposed new policies will make matters much worse and will be detrimental for the lands and waterbodies that sustain both human and animal populations.\nUnchecked urban development will not solve current housing needs, as your government suggests. I urge you to retain all \u201cProvincial Policy Statement\u201d and \u201cA Place To Grow\u201d policies that have been designed to curb sprawl, and to protect farmland and natural areas.\n",

Additionally, rural municipalities which have limited fiscal resources, will be shouldered with additional infrastructure burdens to support this low-density growth in agricultural areas.\nAnother threat to Ontario\u2019s agriculture is the loosening of rules relating to settlement area boundary expansions (SABEs). The Provincial Planning Statement sets out criteria which must be considered by a planning authority for a SABE but does not include considering the loss of prime agricultural land.

These severances would be of benefit not only to us, but also, to meet the need for additional housing, to our county in additional taxes, and, to our farmers who would have access to a much needed local labour force.\nOur second point is:  Our lots are adjacent to a small village.  The Proposal states that \"Municipalities would be allowed to create new Settlement Areas and would not be required to demonstrate the need for expansion.\"  Expanding the small village would, again, allow for much needed additional housing, to our county in additional taxes, and, provide our farmers with access to a much needed local labour force.\nThere have been many hundreds of acres of productive farm land taken out of production by the Nature Conservancy of Canada; letting the land \"go back to nature\".

        "comment":"RE: Provincial Agricultural System, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\nBonnie Littley\nRouge Duffins Greenspace Coalition\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"Today, we write with great enthusiasm and unwavering support for the inclusion of agrivoltaics in Section 4.3 of the proposed Provincial Planning Statement (PPS, 2023) under the Ontario Planning Act.\nThe Provincial Planning Statement (PPS) is a powerful catalyst for the growth and development of Ontario, ensuring resource protection, promoting economic prosperity, and enhancing the quality of life for Ontario's residents. We firmly believe that agrivoltaics, a progressive method of co-developing land for both solar photovoltaic power and agriculture, seamlessly aligns with the key objectives of the PPS.\nAgrivoltaics is not just a concept; it is a transformative solution that tackles multiple challenges simultaneously, offering synergistic benefits that go beyond conventional practices. By integrating agriculture and photovoltaic solar energy generation on the same land, agrivoltaics embraces food security, renewable energy generation, and irrigation water conservation, all in one innovative approach.\nAs we look ahead to a future where sustainable land use and development are paramount, agrivoltaics deserves a prominent place within the PPS. The benefits it brings are undeniable, and we'd like to highlight some of the key advantages:\n1. Economic Prosperity:\nOntario's farmers face significant challenges in the current economic landscape, with farm debt at an all-time high and many lacking succession plans. Agrivoltaics offers a beacon of hope by diversifying farm income and maximizing land utilization through the co-location of food production, energy generation, and irrigation water conservation. This critical advantage enables farmers to adapt to economic uncertainties, fostering a thriving and resilient agricultural sector.\nMoreover, agrivoltaics can significantly contribute to Ontario's energy security and economic prosperity. By providing clean, affordable energy, Ontario can enhance its renewable energy self-reliance and attract forward-thinking companies eager to be part of a post-carbon fuel economy. Solar farms driven by agrivoltaics will boost local and regional economies by creating both temporary and permanent jobs while making substantial contributions to the tax base. The integration of agrivoltaics into the PPS aligns perfectly with the objective of fostering a strong and internationally competitive economy.\n2. Biodiversity Conservation:\nPreserving the rural landscape and its associated biodiversity is of utmost importance for the well-being of our communities and the environment. Agrivoltaics allows for the continued use of land for agricultural activities, safeguarding the essence of the countryside. The symbiotic relationship between food production, energy generation, and water conservation in agrivoltaic systems has proven benefits.\nSolar panels provide vital shade and artificial wind rows, minimizing soil erosion and water evaporation while protecting crops from heat stress, frost, and hail. Plants thriving underneath the panels optimize the efficiency of solar energy generation. Moreover, increased vegetation nurtures soil health and attracts wildlife, creating a harmonious environment for perching birds, songbirds, small mammals, and predators.\n3. Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation:\nThe urgency of addressing changing climate demands innovative solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience against extreme weather events. Agrivoltaics makes a powerful contribution by generating low-carbon renewable electricity and, through shade provision, reducing water evaporation during critical drought periods. This ecological adaptation helps crops withstand the increasingly intense heat waves projected due to changing climate.\nIn perfect alignment with the PPS's emphasis on environmental sustainability and resilience, agrivoltaics establishes natural carbon sinks through increased biodiversity, contributing to a greener and healthier future for Ontario.\nWe urge the inclusion of agrivoltaics into the guidelines for renewable energy systems in Section 4.3 of the proposed PPS or the creation of a dedicated category under On Farm Diversified Uses. By doing so, we not only acknowledge the potential of this sustainable land use practice but also spark further research, development, and innovation in this field. Ontario has the opportunity to become a trailblazer, inspiring other provinces and territories in Canada to follow suit and embrace agrivoltaics.\nOur recommendations are focused on clarity, collaboration, and continuous improvement:\n1.\tExplicitly recognize agrivoltaics as an On Farm Diversified Use, with a clear definition of its scope and function.\n2.\tDevelop guidelines and best practices for designing, installing, and managing agrivoltaic systems, ensuring a balance between agriculture and renewable energy.\n3.\tFoster research and development in agrivoltaic technologies, encouraging collaboration among government agencies, academic institutions, and private entities.\n4.\tEstablish support mechanisms, such as streamlined permitting processes, to encourage farmers and rural communities to adopt agrivoltaic systems.\n5.\tPromote public awareness and education on the benefits of agrivoltaics for sustainable land use, food security, and renewable energy generation.\n6.\tMonitor and evaluate agrivoltaic system implementation to refine policies, guidelines, and support mechanisms as needed.\nThe Provincial Planning Statement (2023) has the power to drive Ontario towards a more sustainable and prosperous future, addressing crucial challenges while ensuring the well-being of its residents and communities. Agrivoltaics holds the potential to transform the agricultural landscape, strengthen the economy, and secure a more resilient and sustainable future for Ontario.\nWe are deeply grateful for the opportunity to provide input on the proposed Provincial Planning Statement (2023) and trust that our recommendations will be met with the utmost consideration. Together, let's forge a path towards a greener, more prosperous, and sustainable Ontario.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for this opportunity to submit comments on this item.\nI live in Port Dover, Ontario and am concerned that the proposal shall be applied to allow for a major development on the border of Port Dover (Norfolk) proposed by Empire Developments.\nThe volume (40,000) of potential new residents and the enveloping plan that surrounds the Stelco plant and is close to the Imperial Oil Inc. refinery are my main concerns.\nInfrastructure at the development has been dealt with in the proposal by Empire.  But support infrastructure will be needed such as roads, parks, facilities, schools and transit in existing towns in Haldimand and Norfolk County have not been addressed.  This greatly affect the taxpayers of Norfolk County as we will not benefit from the tax base being created by the development but Norfolk County will have to deal with those residents needs and uses.  Existing infrastructure in Port Dover can not support the needs a 40,000 residential area would impose on it.  Without a plan to support Norfolk County in this project with funding to accommodate the needs of these new \"neighbours\"  it will cause great hardship on the Norfolk County taxpayer and a serious reduction in the quality of life for the residents of both Port Dover and the Empire Development.\nThank you,\n",

        "comment":"After reviewing the Provincial Policy Statement, The Planning Act, and the Growth Plan for Northern Ontario it appears that the issues around unorganized townships in Northern Ontario have not been adequately addressed.   The PPS does not adequately address the unorganized townships particularly in Northern Ontario.\nRecently Parcels in unorganized townships have been purchased for the express purpose of selling shares in the property. The use of an \u2018unorganized township\u2019 for these communes\/communities\/ medieval villages or land lease communities is used as a selling point to shareholders. Unorganized townships are portrayed as having few regulations. Every shareholder will own one unregistered land lease lot on the said Parcel which is owned by a corporation.  These communities are mostly \u2018off grid\u2019 and some are called medieval villages instead of land lease communities. These Parcels of land in unorganized townships are divided into \u2018lease lots\u2019 without ever having gone through the rigors,  requirements and approvals for subdivision under The Planning Act.  There is little to no properly planned infrastructure such as waste management, fire protection, road development, sewage, gray water solution and drinking water availability in these \u2018off grid\u2019 land lease communities. Safety of residents when roads are not maintained nor easily accessible on land lease lots that are not marked with numbers is a concern for both fire and ambulance services. Indeed fire services may not be available at all.\nThis shareholder structure appears to be seen as a way of going around The Planning Act and proper approvals for subdivision.  Suitability of the land for the proposed purpose does not take into account the size,  shape, or suitability of the land for housing or recreation. The number of land lease lots allowable seems to follow the pattern of as many as can be crammed  into the Parcel.  Vehicular access is questionable.  Adequate water supply and sewage disposal are items of concern.  As waterfront is an attraction for these land lease communities they are currently being built on water front parcels calling into question environmental degradation and the future protection of the watershed.  Protecting the watershed is of utmost importance to the residents already present on historical properly subdivided and approved lots who may have their water supply threatened by inadequate handling of sewage and gray water.\nThis practice of creating land lease communities is in contravention of Section   47(2.1) of the Planning Act which states that only one land lease community home per parcel is allowed.  It also appears to contravene sections of the PPS such as section 2.7 which states that town sites shall not be permitted. The PPS or the Planning Act does not state how these villages, or communes, or land lease communities, are to be prevented or regulated while more proliferate in the unorganized townships of Northern Ontario.\nThe PPS does not address the economic concerns with respect to patented mining claims in Northern Ontario in unorganized townships. Many historical mining patents have had Mining Rights and Surface Rights split and thus any Parcel with Surface Rights Only or with Surface and Mining Rights can theoretically become a target for a land lease community in an unorganized township. Surely there are hundreds of these parcels in unorganized townships in Northeastern and Northwestern Ontario.  There is a real estate trade in these parcels for recreational or permanent residential use.  Allowing one residence and one land lease lot per parcel adhering to regulations regarding water and sewage is not a problem and can contribute to a slow and controlled growth for Northern Ontario.  Encouraging development and expansion of existing communities however should be a priority in order to ensure infrastructure develops simultaneously with population growth.    The proliferation of land lease communities on old patent surface rights could present a difficulty and \u2018a headache\u2019 in dealing with multi lease lot owners in a land lease community for a mining or exploration company.  Should a mining or exploration company ever need to acquire surface rights for development multi lease lot owners presents multi problems. Negotiation with a single land owner to carry out exploration is relatively simple while having to approach eighty or more \u2018lease lot\u2019 holders on one old patent could present a deterrent to proceeding with an exploration program.    Future development in the mining industry by local, national, and international companies could be hampered.\nConsultation with Indigenous people has not been addressed in the preceding documents, particularly with respect to hunting and fishing. The land lease communities are already promoted to as havens for living off grid, hunting , fishing, and living off the land.\nThe PPS, The Planning Act, and the growth for Northern Ontario document should reflect the situation that exists. By not addressing the growing issue of lease lot communities in unorganized townships in Northern Ontario, proliferation of land lease communities is guaranteed.   The PPS needs to address the unorganized townships more diligently taking into account existing residents and Indigenous rights.\n",

I find that the proposed PPS 2023 substantially weakens the policies in the existing PPS 2020 with respect to cultural  heritage, and as such, it would undermine a vital part of Ontario's heritage protection regime. As proposed, the severely curbed policies in section 4.6 of PPS 2023 are not in alignment with the intent and spirit of the Planning Act, where conservation of features of heritage interest are a \"matter of provincial interest\". And these policies do nothing to further the goal of increasing affordable housing in the province.\nI am especially concerned that the proposed restriction of application of the provincial policy to the proposed definition of \"protected heritage property\" would  direct provincial and municipal planning authorities to conserve only currently formally designated property and archaeological sites, cutting out the vast majority of other cultural heritage resources that currently exist in the province, particularly the many  properties that are currently in the listed heritage inventory in Ontario.\nIn short, I urge you to adopt the recommendations contained in the comments of the ACO of Ontario with regard to the province's proposed Provincial Planning Statement, 2023.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to voice my support for the proposal to allow for the voluntary severing of up to three lots per farm parcel.\nThere are many good reasons why residential lot creation in agricultural areas does make sense. Allowing farmland severance on less productive areas of the farm will enhance rural economies and increase property tax base for small rural townships and counties. It will also help in a small way alleviate the housing crisis Ontario currently is facing. Agricultural productivity is increasing and farm land cropped area is increasing especially in Northern and eastern regions that are recording a slight increase in temperatures as a result of climate change. Farm operations are increasing in size and demanding a more skilled workforce that has a preferance to reside close to the farm operation without having to reside in the larger farmyards of todays farm units. Simply putting housing in the farm stead itself is not advisable as it becomes a health and safety issue for raising a family with small children. A severed parcel slightly away from the farm operation is a much more practical solution in todays modern farm.\nThere are many farmers in rural areas without livestock who welcome the opportunity to have their farm severed into two additional lots., I feel this is good planning for farm transition to the next generation as well as attracting the skilled labour todays farms need to operate. We have a housing shortage in this province and severing farm parcels is a way to ensure farmers have the ability to have the next generation farm and also have a skilled workforce find houses close to their workplace to keep the farm operational.\nAs a farmer, I strive to be respectful to our neighbours with regards to spraying, nutrient application, moving equipment, and other normal farm practices. Currently 80 percent of the rural population in my County are no longer farming due to farm consolidation and there are very few conflicts with non farmers, Fruit and vegetable growers often sell their produce to their neighbours through roadside stands to make extra income for their families.\nI also support the current and future use of Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) standards to regulate development in rural areas.\nAllowing lot severances enables our children and grandchildren to have the choice to farm and to invest in their house without connecting directly in the farm business. Severed residential lots will protect the future of the farm in the event of unexpected changes in our farm operation and that of our children\u2019s paths from uncontrollable circumstances.\nI respectfully ask that the government to continue with its proposal to allow for the severing of farmland parcels in recognition of the current and future value and importance of agriculture to the province. A voluntary farm lot severance policy will not be engaged in by all family farms however it will help many struggling family farms who may not have the benefit of supply management marketing systems continue to farm for many years to come in the future.\n",

        "comment":"The planned development for Nanticoke is not a good plan when you have the Townsend Community Development that was started a number of years ago and still has the capacity for the expansion that was being looked at down in Nanticoke. The concern that I honestly have is that the Government is very narrowly focused on what the developer wants and not what will happen later. Prior to retiring and moving down to this area I worked for a company where we had a Mfg. Plant that was built a long time before urban development in the Vaughn area. Years later developers purchased the property around our Mfg. Plant where we employed hundreds of great jobs. Once the developer started to build their houses and high rises around our plant we were forced to add special walls etc. which cost millions of dollars to the corporation. The same will happen here and then Stelco will be forced either out of the community losing allot of great local jobs or to spend allot of additional money to satisfy these the new development and concern about odour or sound or just the sight.\nThe Province should actually get Empire to invest in the Townsend Project and make it what it was intended to be.\nPlease learn not to make the same mistake twice and actually look at the where all the money goes!\n",

        "comment":"Our kids are facing a number of challenges trying to take over the farms that are passed down to the them - housing shouldnt be one of them. Without allowing for ANY severances, we are not giving our kids the chance to build houses and raise families on the farm. Theyre either stuck living with their parents (which no one needs) or forced to move and live elsewhere which if you're a farmer you know does not work. Farmers need to live on their farms. Period.\nBy allowing farms to sever you're giving them a chance at all that. The impact doesn't have to be huge. Severing a small parcel off of a large farm has very little effect on the operation but can make a huge change to someone who needs a place to live.\nDo the right thing. Allow for us to sever at least 1 property for the purpose of building. Not selling to developers, building for the next generartion of ontario farmers to live on.\nThx\n",

Integrating transit and development uses together on the same parcel of land within MTSAs also represents a better use of limited land resources while unlocking more land for housing. However, without stronger policy language, opportunities to realize these benefits remain a challenge.\nRevise policy 2.4.2.6 to read:\n\"All major transit station areas should be planned and designed to be transit-supportive and to achieve multimodal access to stations and connections to nearby major trip generators by providing, where feasible: a) connections to local and regional transit services to support transit service integration; b) connections to developments or integration of developments with transit stations and corridors; c) infrastructure that accommodates a range of mobility needs and supports active transportation, including sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and secure bicycle parking; and d) commuter pick-up\/drop-off areas.\"\n3.1.1 (b)\tLeveraging the capacity of development proponents, where appropriate, is already a fundamental component of ongoing efforts to modernize TTC\u2019s transportation system.

Otherwise, TTC requests that \u201cexisting\u201d corridors be defined and include \u201chigher order transit\u201d. In the interest of public safety, it is also recommended that \u201cnegative impacts\u201d and \u201cadverse effect\u201d as defined in the proposed PPS be used to determine whether permitting development in planned corridors could preclude the safe operation of transportation systems.\nRevise policy 3.3.3 to read:\n\"Planning authorities shall not permit development in existing or planned corridors that could preclude, cause any negative impacts, or cause any adverse effect on the use of the corridor for the purpose(s) for which it was identified.

To support the integration of transit infrastructure within developments as a means to increasing land available for housing, TTC suggests references to policies 3.3.2 and 3.3.6 be added to the definition.

Edwardsburgh Cardinal recognizes the need for more housing across Ontario and the Township is supportive of Ontario\u2019s goal to construct 1.5 million homes by 2031.\nCouncil would like to express our general support of the changes proposed in the draft Provincial Planning Statement. We recognize and applaud your efforts to increase our housing supply and make more lands available for development. We\u2019ve noted more flexibility to expand or create new settlement areas, and less restrictions for lot creation outside of settlement areas, including the agricultural area. Edwardsburgh Cardinal is aligned with this goal and is also working towards solutions to development barriers.\nWe understand this proposal aims to provide more flexibility in servicing options. Council has identified these policies as a significant barrier to growth within our rural and settlement areas. It has been noted in the past that partial servicing is not permitted, except to address a failed system; or for infilling or minor rounding out of development within settlement areas. We\u2019ve noted that these restrictions are still proposed in the new planning policy document:\n3.6.5 Partial services shall only be permitted in the following circumstances:\na) where they are necessary to address failed individual on-site sewage services and individual on-site water services in existing development; or\nb) within settlement areas, to allow for infilling and minor rounding out of existing development on partial services provided that site conditions are suitable for the long-term provision of such services with no negative impacts.\nWe understand the policy is in place to prevent overuse of municipal water where a private septic system is in place. We believe the opposite situation, while less common, should be considered separately in the policy statement. In circumstances where private water could be used in conjunction with municipal sewer, it should be permitted, provided sufficient water quantity and quality is available. Further to this, we ask for clarity by adding definitions for \u201cinfilling\u201d and \u201cminor rounding out\u201d within this context.\n3.6.6 In rural areas, where partial services have been provided to address failed services in accordance with policy 3.6.5 (a), infilling on existing lots of record may be permitted where this would represent a logical and financially viable connection to the existing partial service and provided that site conditions are suitable for the long-term provision of such services with no negative impacts.\nAs we work together to remove barriers to development, we anticipate more lots will be created in our rural areas. We\u2019ve noted that the current and proposed policies only allow partial servicing in the rural area for infilling on existing lots of record, and only where the partial services have been provided to address a failed service. The Township recommends that, where site conditions are suitable, partial services that are available to new and existing lots should be permitted, regardless of their origin.\nThank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed Provincial Planning Statement. We welcome any questions or further discussion on our comments outlined here.\nSincerely,\nMayor Tory Deschamps,\nOn behalf of the Council of the Township of Edwardsburgh Cardinal\n",

You continue to treat each community as identical entities.  Sorry but all farms are NOT equal. There are plots of farmland that are not accessible by large pieces of farm equipment, are wet, contain scrub brush, etc.   There is a way to preserve farm land at a slower pace yet allowing severances for the next generation.  For example:  In order to have ONE severance, the farm has to be owned for 10 years, in order to have TWO severances, the farm needs to be owned for 20 years.  They could also implement a policy that if the severed parcel of land is severed and sold within \u201cX\u201d number of years, there is capital gains taxes to be paid.  The government has allowed massive amounts of international investors to buy property in our Country for  \u201cinvestor\u201d gains thereby pushing home prices out of site for the next generation.   The government stole millions of acres of farmland for solar farms when windmills could have been used.  Does this make sense? There are massive issues with the health care system and the strain of the aging population.  Allowing severances for children can help keep the aging parents in their homes longer because their children would be there to help support, check in and take care of them.     In Norfolk County the community where we live, we have been denied a severance on multiple occasions only to be told that Norfolk County is deemed \u201cprime agricultural land\u201d and the government says, no severances on farmland.  Well I invite you, Doug Ford and Steve Clark to come and visit our \u201cvaluable\u201d farm land that consists of scrub brush, sumac, wetland, and acres where the new \u201clarge\u201d farm equipment cannot access.  Come visit us!!!  If we did not have jobs to support us we would be on social assistance as there is NO way we can survive off this \u201cprime agricultural land\u201d.  We live 400 metres from a hamlet, however, we still do not qualify according to the Ford government to sever an acre of farm land for our son.    My husband and I worked multiple jobs, sacrificed holidays and extras, didn\u2019t hold our hands out for social assistance, yet we are being dictated to as to what we can and cannot do with our \u201cOWN\u201d property that we have worked for and owned for 30 years.  The government continues to steal from the working class.  We are supposed to live in a Country that prides itself on democracy, however, it is looking more and more like dictatorship to us.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\n(your name \/ organization name)\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

The proposed 3 severances per farm parcel would be a major disaster in the making for the total agri-food system over time. Too much land would be lost in the province and the cost of land for farming would shoot upwards based on the new severance potential, making it impossible for farming without marketing the severances.\n",

It is not necessary to use the Greenbelt in order to address the housing crisis as there are many other options that could (and should!) be done first. By destroying these areas of the green belt, the environment and natural habitat of many plants and animals would be disturbed, which seems like an especially unfounded move when climate change is so abundantly obvious and causing so many issues already. Digging into and getting rid of protected spaces of land such as parts of the Greenbelt is only beneficial for those profiting off the proposed building\/infrastructure to be put there, which, how convenient, would be those like Doug Ford and his associates (i.e. the people already with an abundance of wealth and apparently less concern for the planet as it is often those in poverty that are left to deal with the brunt of the impacts).\nThe solution to the Canadian housing crisis does not reside in the proposals to building on the Greenbelt. This looks like a ill-disguised plan for those in power to make more money with no guarantee for Canadians that it will result in what is promised. So much viable housing is simply unoccupied because of the unreasonable costs, that is where focus should be to address a large part of the issue rather than these proposals.\n",

The plan does not take into consideration the Ontario Endangered Species Act, Environmental Protection Act or the federal Migratory Bird Act. 1.5 million new homes in an area that is already over developed is simply reckless and short sighted.

This will lead to further deterioration of the environment, loss of natural habitat, decreased species diversity, loss of farmland and greater congestion and loss of quality of life. The mismanagement of our watersheds with overdevelopment will leaded to greater environment disasters such as flooding as well as water supplies for drinking water which will naturally be attributed to climate change the scape goat for all that ails us as apposed to the real reason mismanagement of our watersheds by over development and overpopulation.

        "comment":"Choice and Consequence.\nOnce again, I must state my deep disagreement with the proposed policy direction and associated legislation put forward since the introduction of Bill 23 in the fall of 2022. I do not see evidence that these policies are good for Ontario nor capable of accomplishing the outcomes the supporting politicians broadcast.\nThe Government of Ontario, along with most Ontarians, is correct that Ontario requires more housing. The fact that there is a crisis now is a demonstration of political short-sightedness over many years.\nPolicies often focus on one goal (e.g. 1.5 million homes) without considering the systems affected by that goal. Housing is part of a much larger system of interactions, dependencies, and influences.\nTo concentrate only on the number of houses and providing \u201cchoice\u201d at the expense of how \u201cchoice\u201d skews the system of shelter, affordability, food production, transportation, water (waste and fresh), etc. is not good for Ontario\u2019s future. Whose choice? What resources are used to provide the choice? All these are part of an interdependent system, such that when one part is changed the whole system must adjust.\nRecent extreme weather events have shown that humans have depended on the rest of the system to adjust to human interventions, especially over the past 200 years. This policy continues that assumption.\nThe proposed changes to planning and housing will have consequences because humans guiding these policy changes are expecting the natural world to be resilient. Climate scientists are warning that we can no longer assume that there will be ongoing resilience to our actions.\nChoice must be limited. What is \u201caffordable\u201d housing? Certainly 80% of the market value is not affordable to those working for minimum wage. Governments cannot back away from building affordable housing. Truly affordable housing is a benefit to all Ontarians in reduced health care and policing expenses.\nPlanners have learned from the 1970\u2019s experiments that building affordable housing in communities must be done differently.  Housing policy-makers need to consult widely with those in the systems that will be affected if housing built is to be truly affordable for the most vulnerable.\nIndeed, the poorest and most vulnerable are not provided with any choice in the proposed plans, while the wealthy will have choice to use three times (or more) the materials, labour and resources to house 2 to six people on land taken out of the Greenbelt or land encroaching on fertile food-producing flood-mitigating(wetland) areas.\nIf truly affordable housing were to receive the same investment as each of those large, detached houses Ontario could be housing many of the most vulnerable in 15 minute walkable communities. But nothing in these policies addresses housing for the most vulnerable.\nIndeed, plans to reduce the green space required where intensification of housing is projected will create strains on the criminal justice system, the health-care system, etc. Green spaces are required for human health. Science is clear and the studies are numerous.\nWe are hosting a family who has fled from Ukraine. As we drive them to their various appointments, they are amazed at the size of the houses. \u201cWhy do people build such big places?\u201d They never expected to live anywhere other than in their apartment. Most of the people immigrating to Ontario will be people who are very accustomed to living in smaller housing units and more densely populated areas. Where are the plans to provide this kind of choice?\nThe Ukrainian family we are hosting had no need for a driver\u2019s license. They used the bus and train. Our Ukrainian family cannot afford any housing, rental or otherwise until they have well-paying jobs for a few years. The current housing policy will make transportation more expensive because unless transit is in the area where houses are being built before occupants arrive, those occupants will be forced (no choice) into obtaining personal transportation for work and necessities of home life. Once having invested in personal transportation, studies show a reduced use of public transit. That would be okay in a 15-minute walkable community, but not in the newly added areas for development in the Greenbelt and other locations outside of the long-standing urban boundaries. Choice? Yes, but only for the wealthy in the policy as it currently stands.\nOntario needs to invest much more in public transit, before expanding urban boundaries, and require, by updates to the building code, that all housing built will be at least net zero, if not net negative in carbon emissions including the building and ongoing operation of the units. So far, no policy since the fall of 2022 has shown a plan for long-term housing supply sustainability. Again, the wealthy will be okay, but the vulnerable and less wealthy will have no choice, and current property owners through property tax assessments will end up paying more.\nThis proposal is not a plan nor direction for Ontario\u2019s future that I can endorse.\n",

        "comment":"The Ontario Association of Cemetery and Funeral Professionals (OACFP) is the province\u2019s leading bereavement sector professional association, consisting of cemeteries, crematoria, funeral homes, and transfer services.  Collectively, our members care for over 85,000 Ontario families every year at their time of loss and greatest need and are stewards of thousands of acres of cemetery green space across the province.\nBackground\nOACFP is concerned by the difficulties in establishing new cemetery locations across the province and particularly in the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area (GTHA). Existing cemeteries with available grave spaces within urban boundaries are reaching the end of their life cycle as active burial grounds.  At the same time, the population and the number of deaths continue to grow. Unlike in other parts of the world, Ontario cemeteries have the added unique and legal responsibility to exist and be maintained in perpetuity.\nThis necessitates urgent attention to ensure suitable new land is available for use. Cemeteries are not just places of burial.  They are of cultural importance, contributing to the establishment of complete communities within our province and also serve as important green spaces that are protected indefinitely after their \u201cactive\u201d phase, providing a perpetual benefit to the communities within which they exist.\nUnfortunately, unlike older, superseded versions of the Provincial Policy Statement (PPS), the current PPS, and subsequently the lower tier Official Plans, restrict the creation of new cemeteries to areas well outside of established settlement areas.\nThe OACFP believes it is crucial for the government to prioritize the creation of viable burial spaces to ensure that the needs of our communities are met both now and in the future. By addressing these challenges, we can ensure that grieving families can continue to have access to dignified and culturally appropriate burial options in the future, fostering a sense of belonging, continuity and remembrance within our society while harmoniously balancing the preservation of our natural environment.\nWe welcome the current consultation by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MMHA) as it seeks to integrate a province-wide land use policy document and we are encouraged that now will be the time that this government recognizes the vital role and function of cemetery space within Ontario communities.  Cemeteries should be recognized by the Province as a matter of \u2018public interest\u2019 and an essential public service that serves the public beyond individual municipal borders. They are not only a land use that is part of \u2018complete communities\u2019 but as an urgent, critical, and continuing necessity for current and future populations.\nIssues\n1.\tPopulation Growth and Mortality Rates \u2013 Ontario\u2019s population is projected to increase by 38% to over 20 million by 2046. Furthermore, our population is aging and by 2031, all baby boomers will be 65 or older.  Deaths are expected to increase rapidly and will exceed 170,000 annually by 2046. The rise in both population and deaths increases the demand for cemetery services but the lack of suitable cemetery lands and their inclusion in land use planning will negatively affect the communities we serve at their greatest time of need.\n2.\tReligious and Cultural Needs \u2013 Although cremation may reduce the impact on land use, given that Ontario has the most culturally diverse population in Canada, the OACFP emphasizes that cremation is not a viable option for numerous faith-based and traditionalist groups, further underscoring the need for accessible cemetery spaces.\n3.\tPerpetual Obligation \u2013 Cemetery lots in Ontario are sold in perpetuity, and cannot be replenished, reused or resold once utilized.\n4.\tRestrictive Policies, Zoning and Finite Land \u2013 Cemetery space is required within every community across the province; however, the current PPS restricts cemetery use (As-of-Right) to lands designated as Rural only (versus Agricultural or other white belt lands), often well outside the urban boundary.  Such lands are typically unsuitable for agriculture due to factors such as quarries, escarpments, or forested areas, all of which make the lands similarly unsuitable for cemetery development.\nMaintaining the current restrictions will force communities to bury their loved ones well outside of the city limits once existing cemeteries are depleted.  This challenge is currently being experienced by our members within the GTHA but, if left unaddressed, will become a more widespread Provincial issue as other population centres grow, and their existing cemeteries reach capacity.\n5.\tLack of Provincial or Regional Service Areas \u2013 Cemetery land development depends upon individual municipal development plans.  The issue being if one municipal area has limited area for cemetery development lands and a neighbouring municipal area chooses not to recognize that need as it falls outside their geographic area it is Ontario families that are caught in the middle with no place to bury their families.\n6.\tCosts \u2013 White belt or other developable lands within and surrounding urban areas typically have high associated land costs.  Cemeteries often do not have the financial resources to compete with other land developers\/uses, making it economically challenging to acquire lands within designated white belt areas. When coupled with the uncertainty created by the policy challenges noted above, this creates significant financial risk for any of our members who may consider establishing a new cemetery in proximity to an existing urban centre.\n7.\tOther Barriers - Another challenge identified is the reluctance of municipalities to allow non-tax-paying, fully serviced land uses within urban boundaries. As cemeteries in Ontario are exempt from paying property tax, this presents another hurdle in finding suitable locations for new cemeteries.\nProposed Policy Direction\n1.\tThe Province should recognize that the service areas of cemeteries cross geo-political jurisdictions, and should not be restricted by municipal or regional boundaries. Jurisdictional boundaries are often restrictive of cemetery development due to insufficient land inventory set aside for this land use within local plans, and\/or the absence of any\/adequate direction for cemetery uses within these planning instruments.\n2.\tDefinitions and terminology for cemeteries and all associated death care uses should be in conformity with the Funeral, Burial and Cremation Services Act, 2002 (FBCSA) and carry direct reference to the Act.  Cemeteries should be defined to include any and all subsidiary and associated uses, without limitations using the phrases \u2018such as\u2019 or \u2018including, but not limited to\u2019. All upper-, lower- and single-tier municipalities should be required to incorporate these definitions verbatim in their Official Plans and Zoning By-laws.\n3.\tThe Province should recognize cemeteries as a provincially-permitted infrastructure and\/or open space land use irrespective of the underlying land use designations, to eliminate the need for ad-hoc \u2018amendments\u2019 to local Official Plans and Zoning By-laws.\n4.\tThe Province should specifically recognize the 100-year planning horizon for cemeteries and other death care-related land uses, which is significantly longer than the provincially- mandated 25- to 30-year land use planning horizon as required for Official Plans.\n5.\tThe Province should recognize that cemetery uses have a development life-cycle longer than most other forms of development, and that cemetery lands are purchased\/acquired\/consumed (pre-need) much earlier than when the actual interments (at-need) take place.\n6.\tUpper-, lower-, and single-tier municipalities, as applicable, should be directed by the Province to conduct Land Needs Analysis studies and develop long-term Strategic Land Use Plans on the existing availability and adequate future provision of death care land uses based on growth and mortality projections, inclusive of all forms of death care services.\n7.\tThe Province should encourage the expansion of existing cemeteries and the establishment of new cemeteries for maximum yield on the land through the efficient use of the invested infrastructure and intensification of existing cemetery lands.\n8.\tCemeteries are a permanent land use, and occupied in perpetuity i.e., there is no \u2018redevelopment\u2019 potential except for future intensification of the cemetery itself.\n9.\tThe Province should create a process of accelerated approvals for cemetery development, either through modified MZO or another form of Provincial development approval.\n10.\tEven fully-occupied (non-active) cemeteries are maintained as required by the FBCSA, contributing much-needed privately-owned, publicly accessible, perpetual open space.\n11.\tThe Province should recognize cemeteries as part of the municipal inventory of passive open space and, therefore, also account for cemetery lands as a unique form of \u2018open space\u2019 when addressing the utilization of payments-in-lieu towards the creation of public open space, as well as include cemeteries in land inventory calculations for open space.  However, it should be noted in any such unique \u2018open space\u2019 designation that cemeteries are ultimately private lands whose primary function is to serve interment rights holders.\n12.\tCemeteries should be protected as an important cultural, historical and heritage asset and encouraged as new cemeteries and expansions to existing cemeteries would contribute to future heritage and cultural assets.\nThe OACFP appreciates the opportunity to bring these important issues to your attention for consideration in developing and refining the new provincial land planning policies that may affect the bereavement sector.\n",

        "comment":"After reviewing the Provincial Policy Statement, The Planning Act, and the Growth Plan for Northern Ontario it appears that the issues around unorganized townships in Northern Ontario have not been adequately addressed.   The PPS does not adequately address the unorganized townships particularly in Northeastern Ontario.\nRecently Parcels in unorganized townships have been purchased for the express purpose of selling shares in the property. The use of an \u2018unorganized township\u2019 for these communes\/communities\/medieval villages or land lease communities is used as a selling point to shareholders. Unorganized townships are portrayed as having few regulations. Every shareholder will own one unregistered land lease lot on the said Parcel which is owned by a corporation.  These communities are mostly \u2018off grid\u2019 and some are called medieval villages instead of land lease communities. These Parcels of land in unorganized townships are divided into \u2018lease lots\u2019 without ever having gone through the rigors, requirements and approvals for subdivision under The Planning Act.  This shareholder structure appears to be seen as a way of going around The Planning Act and proper approvals for subdivision.\nThere is little to no properly planned infrastructure such as waste management, fire protection, road development, sewage, gray water solution and drinking water availability in these \u2018off grid\u2019 land lease communities. Safety of residents when roads are not maintained or easily accessible on land lease lots that are not marked with numbers is a concern for both fire and ambulance services. Fire services may not be available at all.\nThis practice of creating land lease communities is in contravention of Section 47(2.1) of the Planning Act which states that only one land lease community home per parcel is allowed.  It also appears to contravene sections of the PPS such as section 2.7 which states that town sites shall not be permitted. The PPS or the Planning Act does not state how these villages, or communes, or land lease communities, are to be prevented or regulated while more pop up unannounced in the unorganized townships of Northeastern Ontario.\nThe PPS, The Planning Act, and the growth for Northern Ontario document should reflect the situation that exists. By not addressing the growing issue of lease lot communities in unorganized townships in Northern Ontario, proliferation of land lease communities is guaranteed.   The PPS needs to address the unorganized townships more diligently taking into account existing residents, Indigenous rights and the adverse effects on the environment.  Wording should be included clearly stating that lease lot communities remain illegal and existing enforcement procedures require updating to be effective.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong opposition to proposed changes to the Provincial Policy Statement, 2022 (PPS) and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Growth Plan). These changes would accelerate urban sprawl and the ongoing loss of farmland and natural areas in Ontario.\nA shortage of land is not the cause of Ontario\u2019s housing shortage, as noted by the Housing Affordability Task Force in 2022:\n\"Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (p. 10)\"\nIt is time to listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets.\nThere is simply no need for proposed policy changes which would:\n- Eliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to rein in urban sprawl;\n- Allow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n- Force municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n- Exempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n- Remove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and\n- Weaken and eliminate policies intended to address climate change.\nOntario is losing farmland at the shocking rate of 319 acres per day. The proposed new policies will make matters much worse and spell disaster for the lands and waters that sustain us.\nSprawl development will not solve current housing needs, as your government pretends. I urge you to retain all PPS and Growth Plan policies that are designed to curb sprawl and protect farmland and natural areas.\n",

        "comment":"It is critical to protect the farmland and the industry of this province. Allowing housing to encroach on industry is often its death knell. Stelco and Esso are heavy industries in my area of Haldimand County. They are the biggest industries, employers, and taxpayers.\nUnder the Haldimand County Official Plan, these industries are granted a 3 km setback from housing development, a plan approved by the province and in compliance with the Provincial Policy Statement. Industry needs stability, so maintain the current regulations of protection.\nThe 3 km setback is not just required for existing emissions, but occasional upsets and expansion.\nBoth Stelco and Esso have declared their objection to allowing a housing proposal by Empire Homes to proceed. In fact, Esso has increased the buffer zone around their oil refinery by buying out another house and demolishing it, giving them a clear 2 km to the next nearest house east of the refinery. Industry located there over 40 years ago to be away from residential areas. Need I mention the Bhopal, India industrial disaster at a Union Carbide plant where there were no setbacks?\nEmpire Homes is on record as wanting to reduce the buffer zone or setback from industry to 300\nmetres and to 500 metres from wind turbines. There needs to be a 2 km setback from wind turbines and a 3 km setback from industry.\nThere is no need for anymore significant housing in Haldimand County. There are many serviced lots not being built on in the existing urban areas plus more development land within them.\nSome roads are already stretched to the max at times.

I personally have emails to planning staff where I have to chase them down for weeks even months before I get answers to easy questions in order for us to submit the complete application.  I would be happy to provide you with examples.  Further, Municipal staff make useless requests.  We are being forced to complete a traffic study for a small condo development that fronts onto a cres. in a small town.  We have been advised that 4 units will not even make a blip on the Traffic Impacts study.   Yet the entire cres. can have up to 3 units per lot.  This just drives the cost of housing up.  Noise study for redevelopments on busy streets....\n2) Allow rural residential lots to be created when the meet the criteria (non prime agricultural lands, outside the natural areas, unable to be a viable farming operation, expand settlement areas that can safely house - yes this means we will need support for septic systems and wells.\n3) zone the areas around the transit stations so it is one less process to go through for approvals\n4) streamline site plan standards across the province.  ie. Why is there 3 different sizes for parking spaces for Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge?\n5) HST on housing ... 13% on a million dollar home is $130,000 this money is put onto the mortgage which the banks charge interest on and cost double $230,000 (or more) to the end user.  Why not make the tax portion a flat rate for the end user (1%) the bank still gets paid and this will decrease the cost to the end user making home more affordable.  I am sure the banks will still make record profits\n6) mandate Cities to provide the infrastructure to get services to the development areas.

        "comment":"Beef Farmers of Ontario (BFO) appreciates the opportunity to comment on ERO 019-6813 Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning instrument. BFO represents the 19,000 beef farmers in Ontario by advocating in the areas of sustainability, animal health and care, environment, food safety, and domestic and export market development.\nA key priority for BFO and our members is the preservation of Ontario\u2019s agricultural land base. We strongly believe the best way to protect Ontario\u2019s agricultural lands is through sound provincial land use policy that sees agricultural lands, including marginal lands used for livestock grazing and carbon sequestration, protected as the highest and best use of Ontario\u2019s arable land.\nOntario\u2019s beef sector contributes $2.69 billion to Ontario\u2019s GDP on an annual basis and sustains more than 61,000 jobs through primary production, processing and retail. Ontario\u2019s beef farmers also provide important ecological goods and services, especially through the management of grasslands, that protect and enhance Ontario\u2019s environment. This includes sequestering carbon in the soil, providing habitat for wildlife and species at risk, oxygen production, water and nutrient cycling, and maintaining and improving soil health. The ability to provide these ecological goods and services on lands managed with cattle is threatened by competing land uses.\nWe thank the government for taking the time to meet with BFO and our industry partners to discuss our concerns regarding proposed changes outlined in the PPS. BFO is very pleased with the government\u2019s commitment to continue engaging with the agriculture sector regarding alternatives for supporting multi-generational farm families without the use of additional severances in prime agricultural areas.\nThe provincial government\u2019s plan to address Ontario\u2019s housing crisis is ambitious and necessary, and we continue to support the province\u2019s efforts to address this issue. We also strongly believe achieving the government\u2019s housing goals must be balanced with the need to protect our agricultural land base and we remain concerned with aspects of the proposed PPS as it relates to this point.\nOur comments to the discussion questions below will focus on the proposed changes that relate to or impact agricultural lands and beef farmers.\n1)\tWhat are your thoughts on the policies that have been included from the PPS and A Place to Grow in the proposed policy document, including the proposed approach to implementation?\nWe acknowledge and strongly support the following statement as outlined in the proposed PPS Vision statement: Housing must be built in the right places so that Ontario\u2019s vibrant agricultural sector and sensitive areas will continue to form part of the Province\u2019s economic prosperity and overall identity. Growth and development will be focused within urban and rural settlements that will, in turn, support and protect the long-term viability of rural areas, local food production and the agri-food network. This component of the proposed PPS Vision statement recognizes that a balanced approach to land use planning is critical, and building more housing and maintaining our agricultural lands go hand in hand.\nIn addition, with the release of the Grow Ontario agri-food strategy, we recognize this strategy as the gameplan to address future food production challenges with targeted investments to drive growth and support Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. The Grow Ontario strategy includes a significant goal to increase the consumption and production of food grown and prepared in Ontario by 30 percent by 2032. When examining a number of the changes within the proposed PPS it must be noted that achieving the above goal will be significantly challenged by the further loss of agricultural lands, increased conflicts between non-farm neighbours and farmers performing normal farm practices, and the increasing price of farmland. Further, the proposed PPS will impact not only Ontario\u2019s farmers, but also the general public, as Ontario\u2019s farmland is gradually paved over, we weaken our ability to produce food locally and, ultimately, negatively affect our food security.\nWe believe the proposed PPS should be the minimum standard for agricultural land protection in Ontario and allow for municipalities to expand upon agricultural land protections where they see fit.\nMinimum Distance Separation\nBFO is pleased to see the Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) formula will be maintained in the proposed PPS. MDS serves as an important tool to prevent land use conflicts and to minimize nuisance complaints related to normal farming practices between farming operations and surrounding residential land uses. By ensuring a minimum distance between livestock operations and residential land uses, MDS is also a critical tool to prevent potential water quality issues and biosecurity concerns. For these reasons, we firmly believe MDS needs to be maintained in Ontario.\nThat said, we have outlined concerns below in regards to section 2.3.4 Settlement Area and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions, which does not recognize the importance and value of the MDS policy.\nLot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nAgain, we are very pleased with the government\u2019s commitment to further engage with the agriculture sector regarding alternatives for supporting multi-generational farm families without the use of additional severances in prime agricultural areas.\nAllowing lot creations in prime agricultural areas would be a fundamental shift from the current Provincial Policy Statement and would create a multitude of unintended policy consequences. Some of these unintended consequences include the constraining of livestock farmers\u2019 ability to establish new operations and\/or grow their operations (barns, manure storage, etc.); would drive a reduction in investment into the livestock sector, which will create stagnation in the sector resulting in fewer and fewer farmers, negatively affecting the backbone of our rural communities; exacerbate the already unsustainable loss of Ontario\u2019s agricultural lands; risk inflating farmland prices; increase infrastructure service demands on municipalities; create water quantity and quality concerns as a result of increased residences in agricultural areas; create increased fragmentation of our agricultural land base; and lead to more farmland being purchased for investment and speculative purposes, making farming even more unattainable for the next generation.\nWe firmly believe the current restrictions on lot severances in prime agricultural areas, as outlined in the Provincial Policy Statement, should be maintained. We do not support policies that will increase residential lot creation in agricultural areas.\nPermitted Uses\nSection 4.3.2 would allow up to two additional residential units (ARU), in addition to the principal dwelling, in prime agricultural areas provided that any additional residential units are within, attached to, or in close proximity to the principal dwelling; complies with the minimum distance separation formulae; is compatible with, and would not hinder, surrounding agricultural operations; and appropriate sewage and water services will be provided.\nWe support this change and believe it will provide farm families with the opportunity to add residential units to their property for family members or farm workers. However, we believe much more clarity is needed within in this section.  We recommend the inclusion of specifics for type, size, scale, and location of proposed ARUs. Furthermore, in section 4.3.2.4, it states that a principal dwelling associated with an agricultural operation may be permitted in prime agricultural areas as an agricultural use, in accordance with provincial guidance. We recommend provincial guidance material also be provided for ARUs in prime agricultural areas to ensure the creation of ARUs on prime agricultural land is applied consistently across the province. We are also concerned with the proposed change in section 4.3.2.5 that would allow for severing of ARUs in prime agricultural areas. As stated, we do not support policies that will increase residential lot creation in agricultural areas.\nWe recommend a government and industry working group be established to develop the needed clarity and criteria for ARUs in prime agricultural areas to ensure they are practical, consistent, and compatible with existing agricultural operations.\nSettlement Areas and Settlement Boundary Expansion\nSection 2.3.1 states \u201c[s]ettlement areas shall be the focus of growth and development. Within settlement areas, growth should be focused in, where applicable, strategic growth areas, including major transit station areas\u201d. BFO supports this section and we firmly believe that in order to balance our province\u2019s need to build more housing while preserving our agricultural lands for future generations, the province must be focused on creating complete communities and densifying existing urban and rural settlement areas where municipal services are present.\nBFO is very concerned with section 2.3.4, which states:\nIn identifying a new settlement area or allowing a settlement area boundary expansion, planning authorities should consider the following:\na.\tthat there is sufficient capacity in existing or planned infrastructure and public service facilities;\nb.\tthe applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas;\nc.\tthe new or expanded settlement area complies with the minimum distance separation formulae;\nd.\timpacts on agricultural lands and operations which are adjacent or close to the settlement area are avoided, or where avoidance is not possible, minimized and mitigated to the extent feasible as determined through an agricultural impact assessment or equivalent analysis, based on provincial guidance; and\ne.\tthe new or expanded settlement area provides for the phased progression of urban development.\nBFO supports fixed permanent urban boundaries to limit the loss of agricultural lands and focusing growth within existing urban boundaries. We believe higher density development should be mandated province-wide to take advantage of existing infrastructure and to protect agricultural land.\nThe change in language to provide municipalities with a simplified and flexible approach to expand settlement boundaries by removing the need for a comprehensive review and stating municipalities \u201cshould consider\u201d things like compliance with MDS or ensuring impacts to agricultural lands are avoided or minimized through an Agricultural Impact Assessment, we view as short-sighted. We  believe this will lead to inconsistent implementation across municipalities leading to further loss of agricultural lands and varying levels of protection for agricultural lands across municipalities.\nWe recommend the proposed PPS maintain the requirement for planning authorities to demonstrate whether creating a new settlement area or expanding an urban boundary will impact agricultural lands and farm operations, complies with MDS, and whether there are reasonable housing alternatives within existing urban boundaries.\nIn addition, the proposed change in 2.3.4 fails to recognize the importance of the MDS policy, and, for the reasons outlined above, the MDS policy cannot simply be taken as a light suggestion for new settlement areas or boundary expansions. In addition, we strongly believe Agricultural Impact Assessments (AIA) must be completed when examining a new settlement area or settlement area boundary expansion.\nBuilding housing on agricultural lands should be a last resort and only after development of underused or vacant areas within existing urbanized areas has been completed.\nGeneral Policies for Agriculture\nThe proposed PPS outlines the following general policies for agriculture in section 4.3.1:\n1.\tPlanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach, based on provincial guidance, to maintain and enhance a geographically continuous agricultural land base and support and foster the long-term economic prosperity and productive capacity of the agri-food network.\nWe believe the agricultural system approach, which is supported by Agricultural Impact Assessments, provincial Agricultural Land Base Mapping and Agricultural System Portal, is a valuable planning tool that looks at the entire agriculture network and we have supported the use of the agricultural system approach as it has been implemented within the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH), and we have previously requested and continue to request the use of this approach be required by municipalities throughout Ontario.\nThe proposal to eliminate the requirement to use the provincially-mapped Agricultural System, and require municipalities to designate specialty crop areas and prime agricultural areas is a concern. We believe this will create a patchwork of agricultural land mapping and remove a tool that allows for \u2018big picture\u2019 agriculture land use planning. We recommend maintaining the use of the provincially mapped agricultural system to reduce agricultural land fragmentation and to protect farmland.\n2.\tAs part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\nBFO supports this provision continuing to be included in the province\u2019s land use planning policy, but, as our comments highlight, other policy changes in the proposed PPS do not support the above provision and will not protect prime agricultural areas.\n3.\tSpecialty crop areas shall be given the highest priority for protection, followed by Canada Land Inventory Class 1, 2, and 3 lands, and any associated Class 4 through 7 lands within the prime agricultural area, in this order of priority.\nThe continued prioritization of agricultural soils within prime agricultural areas is concerning for the beef sector. Agricultural soil types serve different purposes and have various capabilities, but are all important for maintaining a healthy and vibrant agricultural sector. We have long advocated that soil types classified as 4 through 6 be equally protected and included in the definition of Prime Agricultural Lands. Class 4-6 soils are suitable for grazing livestock on pasture and hay production, and for providing ecological goods and services, such as sequestering carbon in the soil and providing habitat for wildlife.\nRural Housing and Lands\nIt is very important to remember that not all agricultural land in Ontario is zoned as prime agricultural land, and there are many farms and agricultural lands that municipalities have zoned as rural land. We cannot forget about these farms and their value when discussing the preservation of agricultural lands.\nLand use planning in Ontario must balance opportunities for growth and building housing with the need to preserve our agricultural lands. Focusing growth on urban and rural settlement areas will help balance this need while supporting local economies, reducing farmland loss and reducing potential land use conflicts. We know rural communities also need more housing, and there are opportunities within existing rural hamlets and towns to increase density and where adequate servicing exists or can be expanded upon to more efficiently expand the rural tax base for municipalities. Density and intensification targets should be analyzed and applied to rural settlements and settlement areas.\nThe proposed change to add multi-lot residential development as a permitted use on rural lands within section 2.6.1 is extremely concerning and we believe unrestricted growth in rural areas will have negative consequences, especially for agricultural lands. This includes removing productive farmland and natural heritage features, increasing conflict between non-farming residents and farming operations, increasing demand for services in less dense areas, and the overall character of rural landscapes. BFO does not support this proposed change.\nThe current 2020 Provincial Planning Statement in section 1.1.5.2 allows residential development, including lot creation, that is locally appropriate, as a permitted use on rural lands. Lot creation on rural lands is already a controversial topic and has meant agricultural land zoned as rural land has been severed for residential development or purchased for the purpose of removing the land from agricultural production altogether. We strongly believe the government should examine setting a maximum size for lot creation on rural lands to ensure large pieces of productive agricultural land is not removed from production.\nBFO recommends agricultural uses, agricultural-related uses, on-farm diversified uses and normal farm practices should be protected and given higher priority as permitted uses within section 2.6.\nNatural Heritage\nWe would like to indicate our support for section 4.1.9 that states nothing in section 4.1 is intended to limit the ability of agricultural uses. We encourage the government to strengthen section 4.1.9 by stating that, in addition to \u201cagricultural uses\u201d, nothing in section 4.1 is intended to limit \u201cnormal farm practices\u201d, as it is defined within the proposed PPS.\n2)\tWhat are your thoughts on the proposed policies regarding conservation of agriculture, aggregates, natural and cultural heritage?\nUnder Ontario\u2019s current provincial land use planning policies and plans, the province is currently losing agricultural land at an unstainable rate. Agriculture Census data from 2016 to 2021 shows Ontario lost 582,392 acres of farmland, totaling over 1.5 million acres of farmland lost between 2006 to 2021. Further, between 2016-2021, over 290,000 acres of tame and native grasslands were lost in Ontario. BFO has long advocated for improvements in land use planning policies to better protect agricultural lands in Ontario.\nStatements within the proposed PPS policies to focus growth within urban and rural settlement areas and maintaining MDS are important to conserve agricultural land. Now, as our above comments highlight, we have serious concerns that a number of proposed changes will do very little to conserve agricultural lands or support agricultural operations for the long-term. In fact, a number of the proposed changes, as they relate to agricultural lands, would be harmful to the future of livestock agriculture in Ontario and would fundamentally weaken Ontario\u2019s agriculture sector and its ability to produce local food.\nSection 2.9 Energy Conservation, Air Quality and Climate Change states that municipalities must plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and prepare for the impacts of a changing climate. As noted above, agricultural lands, especially hay and pasture lands, do not simply serve as land to produce food, but provide ecological goods and services through sequestering carbon in the soil, mitigating floods, supporting biodiversity and wildlife, and other extremely important natural climate solutions that will help to reduce the impacts of climate change. Policies that will directly or indirectly reduce our agricultural land base not only negatively impact our food security, but increase GHG emissions and remove a tool we have to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nWe look forward to on-going dialogue with the government to help meet Ontario\u2019s housing goals while preserving our agricultural land and achieving the Grow Ontario agri-food strategy goals.\n",

These targets encouraged municipalities to concentrate housing, businesses and services in transit-served core areas.  Removing them encourages urban sprawl.\nI am greatly concerned, as well, that municipalities might be allowed to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of associated infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas.\nFor a property taxpayer like me that means more and more and more roads, sewers, water mains, sidewalks and bike lanes to maintain as our municipalities stretch further and further into the countryside. Especially since the provincial government is also cutting back development charges,  the only person left to pay for all this is me.\nIt's not fair.\nIt seems this government has no interest in being fair, but I expect, and I hope, that provincial staff will be thoughtful and just and ensure we have reasonable land use planning guidelines.\n",

        "comment":"Proposed changes will bring bulldozers to Ontario's heritage\nFirst, the statement about what heritage will be protected is way too narrow.  If left as proposed, i.e.\n\"2 (a) 4.6.1. Protected heritage property, which may contain built heritage resources or cultural heritage landscapes, shall be conserved\"\nthe only property that will be protected is what is already protected.  What is the point of stating a tautology?\nI much preferred the original wording of  2.6.1  \"Significant built heritage resources and significant cultural heritage landscapes  shall be conserved\"\n because it acknowledged, as your proposed statement does, that not every heritage resource would be protected, while also setting out a criterion for what would be conserved.\nThe proposed change is especially worrisome in the wake of Bill 23 which will eliminate protection of most listed properties.  For example, one rural municipality has 108 carefully researched and fully described properties on its Municipal Heritage Register of non-designated (listed) properties.  But council has informed the Municipal Heritage Committee that council  will designate, at most, two properties a year.  Your proposed statement would mean at least 104 of these properties would be wide open for demolition in 2025.\nThe cynic in me wonders why the statement doesn't just say, Ontario's cultural heritage is not valued, and can be destroyed at will.\nBut I live in hope that someone does recognize the environmental, cultural, job-creation and economic value of cultural heritage properties, districts and landscapes.\nIf you won't change the wording on 4.6.1. to   Significant built heritage resources and significant cultural heritage landscapes  shall be conserved\nThen please rewrite the definition of \"protected heritage property\" to be\n\u2022 property designated under Part IV or VI of the Ontario Heritage Act;\n\u2022 property subject to a notice of intention to designate in accordance with section 29(1.1) and subject to the limitations in section 29(1.2) of the Ontario Heritage Act;\n\u2022 property included in an area designated as a heritage conservation district under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act;\n\u2022 property subject to a by-law designating an area as a heritage conservation study area in accordance with section 40.1(1) of the Ontario Heritage Act;\n\u2022 non-designated property of cultural heritage value or interest recorded on the municipal register in accordance with section 27(3) of the Ontario Heritage Act;\n\u2022 property subject to a heritage conservation easement or covenant under Part II or IV of the Ontario Heritage Act;\n\u2022 property identified by a provincial ministry or a prescribed public body as a property having cultural heritage value or interest under Part III.1 of the Ontario Heritage Act and the heritage standards and guidelines;\n\u2022 property with known archaeological resources in accordance with Part VI of the Ontario Heritage Act;\n\u2022 property protected under federal heritage legislation; and\n\u2022 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nSecondly, the definition of adjacent lands is problematic.  Limited adjacency to contiguous properties if much too narrow.  It needs to be broadened to at least 60 metres from the subject property, and broader in specific circumstances, e.g. properties bordering canals like the Rideau or Trent.\n",

        "comment":"RE: Agricultural Lot Severances, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023, section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments.\nComments regarding section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nI am concerned about proposed s.4.3.3 which permits the severance of three residential lots from parcels in prime agricultural areas. This poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. As it currently reads, this policy could apply to any parcel of agricultural land, regardless of its size or whether it was previously severed before January 2023. Given that there are 48,346 farms4 and as many as 170,000 farmland properties in Ontario5, the province could see anywhere from 145,038 to 510,000 lots severed from agricultural properties. Therefore, if each lot is approximately 1-acre in size, this policy alone would be responsible for removing anywhere from 1.25% to 4.3% of Ontario\u2019s finite agricultural land base.\nThe use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays6. While I appreciate that proposed s.4.3.1 states \u201cPlanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach,\u201d this policy does not provide the strength needed to require agricultural systems, and appears to be in contradiction to the permissions of s.4.3.3. When you factor in s.4.3.2.5, which permits up to two additional dwellings in prime agricultural areas, this could result in as many as 1.5 million dwellings on newly severed lots in agricultural areas. This will lead to significant farmland fragmentation, which is contradictory to the purpose of an agricultural system, and will cause significant disruptions to surrounding agricultural operations.\nMoving to rural areas often means embracing the realities of agricultural living, such as noise, dust, odors, and farm equipment on the roads. Unfortunately, this leads to land-use compatibility conflicts that are difficult to mitigate once residential units are developed in agricultural areas. This poses significant challenges for farmers, especially when Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) is not properly followed during development approvals. This is concerning given that Bill 23 prevents third-party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal, making it difficult for nearby farmers to address MDS concerns. Additionally, constructing residential units up to the MDS line will limit any future growth of the agricultural operation, threatening the future viability of animal agriculture in Ontario.\nFurthermore, additional residential units on prime agricultural areas will result in an increase in water usage from underground aquifers. Three additional lots, including three additional residential units would put a significant strain on the water usage and increase the likelihood of water source issues for both the residents and the agricultural operation. Agriculture uses significant amounts of water to irrigate crops and provide water to livestock. Although a large percentage of water is returned to the source, often it has been changed and carrying soil and dissolved compounds7. With less water available in the aquifer, any contaminants will be more concentrated. Therefore, permitting three lot severances in prime agricultural areas will have significant implications for water availability and safety.\nBy permitting lot severances, the province will be impacting the financial accessibility of farmland for the next generation of farmers, making farming less financially viable. Each farm property will likely increase in price relative to the value of three vacant lots in the respective region. Ontario experienced a 19.4% increase in property values in 20228, making it unattainable or financially unfeasible for many young farmers to buy land. The proposed severance policies will incentivize developers, who can outbid young farmers, to purchase farmland or provide cash incentives for farmers to sever lots, contributing to the increase in farmland prices. This will result in the next generation experiencing a fragmented agricultural system and keeping ownership of farmland out of their reach. This is concerning because if the next generation of farmers cannot afford to farm, and experience it as increasingly difficult to farm, the province will not have a viable agricultural sector for much longer.\nI have noticed that the new proposed PPS 2023 states in policy 4.3.1.2, \u201cAs part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d However, permitting lot severances for residential use contradicts lands being designated for the long-term protection for agriculture.\nI believe that the proposed s. 4.3.2.5, which would allow two additional units on existing farm properties, could be significant in providing housing opportunities for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. Similarly, the proposed s. 2.2.1.b.2 allows more land for housing by converting existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use. Given these other proposed policies permitting additional housing and the significant concerns over the proposed lot creation policies, I question why there is a need to permit such a significant allowance for severances.\nFurthermore, permitting these severances is in contradiction to proposed s. 2.2.1.c, \u201cpromoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation.\u201d S.4.3.3 will not promote efficiency in these areas and will detract from the intentions to support intensification.\nI believe that municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising between non-farming residents and the agricultural community. However, proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being more restrictive, which could be vital for preventing these types of conflicts. For rural communities whose economies and culture are intricately associated with agriculture, s.4.3.3.2 will prevent municipalities from protecting a key component of their communities and is contradictory to the content on page 3 that states the PPS 2023 recognizes the diversity of Ontario and that local context is important. S.4.3.3.2 restricts rural municipalities from ensuring the local context of their agricultural system is protected from farmland fragmentation.\nI, therefore, urge the province to consider these concerns and remove s.4.3.3 in its entirety so that the proposed changes do not harm the province\u2019s agricultural lands and the farmers who depend on them. The province should require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping and allow municipalities to implement additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and prevent conflicts with non-farming residents.\nThank you for considering our submission, and I look forward to the province\u2019s response.\nSincerely,\na rural Ontario resident\nReferences:\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\n(Ishi tal )\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"August 3, 2023\nMinistry of Municipal Affairs & Housing\nProvincial Land Use Plans Branch\n777 Bay Street, 13th floor\nToronto, ON M7A 2J3\nRE: ERO: 019-6813: Feedback on proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nThe Niagara Home Builders\u2019 Association is the voice of the residential construction industry within the 12 Municipalities that comprise the Niagara Region. We represent members including builders, developers, professional renovators, trade contractors and many others within the residential construction sector. The Niagara Home Builders\u2019 Association is proudly coordinating our public policy response with regards to the proposed new provincial planning policy instrument with the Ontario Home Builders\u2019 Association and other chapters within our network.\nAs we know, Ontario needs 1.5 million new homes over the next decade to restore housing attainability. We need the right mix of housing types, formats and locations to ensure that Ontarians at all stages of life can find a place they can call home. The current provincial planning ecosystem places some limits on how fast our province can achieve the social and economic imperative of dramatically increasing new housing supply and variety. That is why we are encouraged by the proposals that have been put forth to update how Ontario plans for growth.\nWe support the policy direction of the new Provincial Planning Statement (PPS) and the rescinding of A Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Growth Plan). The duplication of policy from the former PPS and Growth Plan led to excessive delay and study requirements of municipalities, builders and developers in the Greater Golden Horseshoe. While some of the policies of the Growth Plan were helpful in promoting transit supportive densities in strategic areas, many of the policies of this plan unnecessarily restricted the supply of housing and land available for development and construction that was required to meet its growth targets.\nIt is important to note from the outset that the proposed PPS structure of requiring large\/fast-growing municipalities to be subject to growth-management related policies is appropriate and needed. The differentiation of a policy set for these municipalities is effective in providing one Planning Statement that can be applied province-wide without placing unnecessary or onerous requirements on smaller or slower growing municipalities.\nBuilding the Needed Volume and Variety of Housing Options\nThe new PPS will be effective in generating new housing supply in high growth municipalities and surrounding rural areas. The proposed policies will be effective in creating appropriate housing opportunities in these settings. In particular, the policies that require minimum densities in major transit station areas and other strategic growth areas will ensure that opportunities for higher-density housing forms can be realized in areas that benefit from existing or planned transit.\nIn addition, the permission of additional housing in rural areas can release a significant supply of housing in regions peripheral to urban areas that complement the more compact and urban forms of housing that will be based in urban centres.\nTo ensure that large\/faster growing municipalities plan for their share of growth, we strongly believe that the province should continue to prepare forecasted minimum population and housing targets for these municipalities (similar to those required in the Growth Plan, and subsequently in the province\u2019s minimum housing targets to 2031) and require that these municipalities demonstrate in their official plans how these targets will be met with the timeframes of the PPS.\nThe PPS should also clarify how minimum intensification targets apply across the entire municipality, and that intensification is encouraged through the settlement area boundary. This is essential to provide policy support for gentle-density forms of intensification in existing areas which would otherwise be prevented by anti-growth special interests.\nLastly, it is important to provide clarity as to what constitutes affordable and attainable housing \u2013 changes to the Development Charges Act should be reflected in the new PPS in this regard. In addition, the PPS should clarify that additional residential units are encouraged in all single, semi-detached and townhomes (similar to the permissions under the Planning Act) and that these units can provide a supply of purpose-built attainable rental housing.\nMaking More Land Available for Homes & Employment\nWe strongly support the broadening of opportunities to make areas available for new home construction, particularly the new tools and options provided to municipalities to accommodate growth. Subsequently, we welcome the change for municipalities to have to plan to a minimum 25-year horizon; given that most new communities will take 25 years to be substantially built, this timeline is appropriate as a planning horizon.\nFurthermore, we are encouraged by the requirement to maintain a 15-year residential land supply and maintain land with servicing capacity for a 3-year supply of residential units. We believe this policy would be more effective if it clarified that the supply of land and units is to be maintained for a market-based supply of units and be specific to unit type. It is as equally important to forecast for, and provide the right composition of housing, as well as an overall quantity of housing.\nThe provision for a simplified settlement area boundary expansion process is a very positive policy change that should allow municipalities to both create new settlement areas and extend existing ones without the need for brand-new expansions.\nWe strongly support the definition of employment areas in the PPS (which reflect that contained in the Helping Homebuyers, Protecting Tenants Act) and the focus on these areas for a concentration of more intensive industrial and manufacturing type uses. Clarification should be provided that other uses (including commercial, institutional, and residential uses) may be permitted on employment lands and lands designated for employment that do not meet the PPS definition of \u201cEmployment Area\u201d, subject to appropriate separation required for sensitive uses. The province should prepare an update to the D-series guidelines to update the separation requirements for sensitive uses in keeping with the updated definition from the PPS. Overall, this is a significantly positive change that will help ensure that Ontario strikes the right balance between housing, employment areas and municipal flexibility.\nWe propose further changes with the PPS to permit some municipal infrastructure outside of settlement areas to support smart growth planning. Currently, municipalities continue to preclude any urban infrastructure being placed outside of settlement areas. This requires storm water ponds and municipal pipes being placed in urban designated lands, which results in a loss of net developable land, a reduction in land supply adjacent to town centers and the inefficient use of existing infrastructure. We also recommend that direction be provided through the PPS to permit urban infrastructure being placed in non-urban designated areas if the lands are owned by the same property owner. This will support making more land available for homes and allow a more efficient use of settlement area lands.\nProviding Infrastructure to Support New Housing\nFloodplain mapping and associated modelling in urban areas should be prepared to account for proposed growth, including stormwater management facilities and flood mitigation work in these areas. It is not appropriate to assume a no-mitigation approach to flood plain modelling in an urbanizing area. This approach should be incorporated into the policies of the new PPS and in related guidance material from the province.\nPolicies supporting the location of trails and other passive recreation activities within hydro and gas corridors should added to the PPS. Moreover, when trails and\/or recreational opportunities can be provided in these corridors, such areas should be eligible for parkland contribution under the Planning Act.\nAdditionally, the policies of the PPS should provide direction to utility providers to integrate their planning with the growth planning of municipalities, and to account for these plans in their future service planning. Moreover, utilities should be strongly encouraged to ensure that sufficient service is available in accordance with planning to support designated growth and the delivery of housing. Where required, the province should consider legislative and policy changes to ensure that both utilities and regulators provide sufficient services for both existing and future housing to achieve municipal growth plans.\nWe strongly support the policy direction to require school boards to integrate planning for schools and growth \u2013 the policies should specifically speak to the minimization of school sites when co-located with parks and should encourage the provision of schools in mixed use formats, including within multi-storey residential buildings.\nWe further support the use of alternative servicing solutions to enable development in areas where typical full municipal servicing solutions are not viable. The province should prepare guidance material regarding the minimum densities and size of developments appropriate for different servicing solutions.\nBalancing Housing with Natural Resources\nTo minimize potential conflicts with agricultural uses and existing or new residential areas, municipalities should designate rural lands abutting residential areas and settlement area boundaries.\nThe proposed environmental protection policies should be provided in the context of a Housing First policy goal and objectives which should be added to the PPS in settlement area boundaries. An urban lens should be provided for environmental protection in settlement areas, generally directing that preservation of features should have the object of maintaining green infrastructure in urban areas to preserve natural functions and the protection of provincially significant features. Such policies would support the provision of housing through the efficient use of land is essential and a priority over other competing policy objectives.\nIn all areas, the policies related to the natural environment, and environmental protection should allow a net benefit approach through the development process. Such policies should facilitate logical settlement patterns by allowing feature removal or relocation with off-setting opportunities for on- and off-site compensation on a 1:1 basis.\nThe environmental policies could encourage the preservation of non-provincially significant features if it is clarified that such features should be treated as social elements that offer passive recreational opportunities to residents and that they would form part of the parkland dedication requirements under the Planning Act.\nNatural Heritage Policies\nThe implementation of the natural heritage policies has created ongoing challenges both in terms of the timely delivery of communities and homes, and in the ability to create more positive and sustainable outcomes for nature.\nGiven the diverse municipal interpretations of the provincial natural heritage policies, the conservation of the most important natural heritage features and functions has often become caught in polarized, lengthy, and expensive arguments about the ecological importance (or lack thereof) of the smallest and isolated patches of nature. In many cases, for example, natural heritage protections are being applied by municipalities to features that are small, disturbed, young on the landscape, and sometimes human created. The created features that have been defined as significant, for instance, include:\n\u2022\tyoung plantations;\n\u2022\thedgerows;\n\u2022\twetland areas in ditches;\n\u2022\tbacked up drainage systems;\n\u2022\tnaturalizing golf course ponds;\n\u2022\tclosed aggregate extraction ponds; and\n\u2022\tnaturalized farm ponds.\nThis overly cautious approach has created inefficiencies in the development of \u201ccomplete communities\u201d, which may take different shapes and forms appropriate to their contexts to meet the diverse needs of their populations (PPS definition). Our recommended changes to the natural heritage policies will introduce much-needed flexibility, that will also generate more nature positive outcomes, more quickly. We understand that viable and functioning natural heritage systems are important to the integrity of the environment, and to the well-being of citizens who live near and interact with them.\nIn addition, we will continue to work with the province and municipalities to achieve natural heritage outcomes that are practical, viable, and sustainable, whether they occur in settlement areas, rural areas, or agricultural areas. We will continue to offer ideas and solutions that will lead to increased and appropriately targeted investments in our natural heritage systems.\nIn the following, we propose minor, but important modifications to the natural heritage polices to enable our industry to create healthier communities more efficiently and effectively. At the same time, our industry will continue to accelerate the establishment of natural heritage systems that will thrive in areas where communities are developing. We will continue to work with our municipal partners to create communities that enable citizens to interact with nature in respectful and sustainable ways.\nTo achieve these ambitious and positive outcomes, Ontario needs a degree of smart flexibility in the natural heritage policies and their implementation.\nSmart flexibility will best be achieved through the two following distinct, but related changes:\n1)\tShift from the no negative impact test to a no net negative impact test for natural heritage features and associated functions; and\n2)\tFormally adopt an ecological offsetting approach to allow for the selective removal of generally smaller and degraded natural heritage areas with limited functions. The removed features would be replaced, achieving a net ecological gain (i.e., nature positive outcomes).\nIn the following, additional comments are provided regarding these two proposed changes. Then, specific suggested wording changes are proposed for the PPS natural heritage policies and for a few associated definitions. Some final thoughts are also offered, regarding key next steps to ensure that background materials and guidelines are updated and can support the policy changes.\nNet Negative Impact Test\nThe current test under the PPS related to natural heritage features and functions (excluding fish habitat) is the no negative impact test. That test specifies, that a \u201c\u2026 negative impact is: degradation that threatens the health and integrity of the natural features or ecological functions\u201d. Health and integrity are not defined terms, in the PPS.\nRequirements to achieve no negative impact on any aspect of natural heritage features or functions have proven to be challenging and impractical. It is likely that any development or site alteration activity will have some, often minor or immeasurable impact on one or more aspects of natural heritage features or functions.\nThe definition of \u201cfunctions\u201d further complicates the use of the no negative impact test. The PPS defines ecological function as follows \u201c\u2026 means the natural processes, products or services that living and non-living environments provide or perform within or between species, ecosystems and landscapes. These may include biological, physical, and socio-economic interactions.\u201d The complexity of the term ecological function includes undefined biological, physical, and socio-economic interactions.\nThe implementation of a slightly modified test, a no net negative impact test, will allow for minor adjustments to natural heritage features and associated functions. This approach would encourage, not discourage, more innovative forms of mitigation, with simpler impact assessment considerations and with net positive outcomes for nature.\nWhere a development or site alteration could impact larger and more overtly important natural heritage features and associated functions, the no net negative impact test would involve a special form of compensatory mitigation, commonly referred to as offsetting.\nEcological & Biodiversity Offsetting\nThe province\u2019s release of the Discussion Paper, Conserving Ontario\u2019s Natural Heritage, presents an important, forward-looking approach that could significantly improve the use of, and outcomes associated with, natural heritage policies in Ontario.\nEcological biodiversity (also known as biodiversity offsetting) is an impact assessment tool used globally in over 100 countries. These offset programs allow for the compensation of impacts to the natural environment in ways that restore or improve the quality and\/or quantity of the impacted natural heritage features. Unlike a no net negative impact test, which minimizes and neutralizes impacts, offsetting programs require achieving net positive or nature positive outcomes. This approach could be used when predicted impacts surpass what might be considered to be the most minor immeasurable predicted impacts addressed above.\nProposed Natural Heritage Policy Modifications\nThe following are a few specific wording changes to the natural heritage policies and the definitions, that will support our suggested no net negative impact test and the recommended offsetting approach. The numbering system used in this section follows the numbering of sections in the June 16, 2023, version of the proposed PPS.\nRecommended Specific NHS Policy Wording Modifications\nExisting Wording\tProposed Revised Wording\nPPS section 4.1.4\nAdd the word net (underlined below)\nDevelopment and site alteration shall not be permitted in: \u2026\n\u2026 unless it has been demonstrated that there will be no negative impacts on the natural features or their ecological functions\u2026\tDevelopment and site alteration shall not be permitted in: \u2026\n\u2026 unless it has been demonstrated that there will be no net negative impacts on the natural features or their ecological functions\u2026\nPPS section 8\nAdd the word net (underlined below)\nDevelopment and site alteration shall not be permitted on adjacent lands to the natural heritage features and areas identified in policies 4.1.4, 4.1.5, and 4.1.6 unless the ecological function of the adjacent lands has been evaluated and it has been demonstrated that there will be no negative impacts on the natural features or on their ecological functions.\tDevelopment and site alteration shall not be permitted on adjacent lands to the natural heritage features and areas identified in policies 4.1.4, 4.1.5, and 4.1.6 unless the ecological function of the adjacent lands has been evaluated and it has been demonstrated that there will be no net negative impacts on the natural features or on their ecological functions.\nRecommended Definition Modifications\nThe following are suggested changes that will match with other recommendations contained within this material.\na)\tAreas of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSIs)\nOne general comment we offer, is related to the ongoing inclusion of Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSIs) within the natural heritage policies. We understand that this program was important at the time (e.g., 1980s), to determine local, regional, and provincial levels of importance for earth and life science ANSIs. The definition of ANSI refers to \u201c\u2026 natural landscapes or features that have been identified as having life science or earth science values related to protection, scientific study or education\u201d. We suggest the relevance of defining significance of ANSIs related to protection, scientific study, or education, be carefully reviewed. Whether these aspects are appropriate for the definition of natural heritage significance is an important question the province should consider. Furthermore, whether the program is current and if the information is updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis. This may be a moment when the identification, ranking, and conservation of some or all of these features, needs a more discerning review for relevance. We also understand that in many cases, ANSIs will be located within and overlap with other natural heritage features.\nb)\tEcological Function\nThis definition of ecological function is broad, and it is not clear what is being referred to as, \u201c\u2026 biological, physical and socio-economic interactions\u2026\u201d. We recognize that the 2010 Natural Heritage Reference Manual (created to support the 2005 PPS), will require substantial revisions. One area where additional information and guidance could be improved is related to the definition and measurement of ecological functions.\nc)\tNatural Heritage System\nIn the definition of natural heritage system, reference is made to, \u201c\u2026The Province has a recommended approach for identifying natural heritage systems, but municipal approaches that achieve or exceed the same objective may also be used.\u201d Industry experience has demonstrated that some municipalities have moved thresholds for the determination of significance to a very low level, attaching significance to small, disturbance origin, and non-native plant dominated communities. This appears to move well past municipalities treating provincial policies as minimum standards. Broad municipal approaches that are not rooted in an understanding of the different landscape characteristics across municipalities, can lead to inappropriate designations of significance. Any guidance to municipal approaches needs to ensure that:\n\u2022\tThresholds for significance are appropriate, based on science, and are adjusted to match varying landscapes and sensitivity; and\n\u2022\tMunicipal policies and mapping comply with PPS section 4.1 3, that states, \u201cNatural heritage systems shall be identified in Ecoregions 6E & 7E1, recognizing that natural heritage systems will vary in size and form in settlement areas, rural areas, and prime agricultural areas.\u201d\nd)\tNegative Impacts\nThe negative impacts definition needs to be adjusted to reflect any changes required, should the province choose to adopt the proposed change to a no net negative impact test for some or all natural heritage features and functions. A definition would also need to be incorporated for net negative impacts.\nOn Supporting Materials\nThe primary reference related to the natural heritage policies is the Natural Heritage Reference Manual (2010), which is now dated, and was specific to the 2005 PPS. Since its publication 13 years ago, much has been learned about natural heritage in southern Ontario. New and important technical information, references, and scientific literature have been produced since 2010. The manual requires updating that would better explain the determination of significance, current landscape ecological practices, and the most current best practices related to Impact Assessment including the use of offsetting. Substantial updates to the appendices of the manual are strongly recommended.\nOther manuals and references that would benefit from a critical review and updates include:\n\u2022\tSignificant Wildlife Technical Guide (MNR 2000)\n\u2022\tReferences for Regionally and Locally Significant Plant Species (e.g., Cuddy, 1991; Riley, 1989; Varga et al, 2000; Oldham, 1993).\nWe encourage all provincial Ministries to work collaboratively on updating these critical documents to help best protect and preserve our province\u2019s natural spaces in a smart and thoughtful manner.\nConclusion\nWe thank the Ministry for the opportunity to comment on these proposals. We look forward to continuing to engage with the Ministry in order to ensure these proposals are aligned with the goals of improving housing attainability for current and future Ontarians.\nSincerely,\nChuck McShane \u2013 CEO\nNiagara Home Builders Association\n",

        "comment":"RE: Agricultural Lot Severances, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023, section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments.\nComments regarding section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nI am concerned about proposed s.4.3.3 which permits the severance of three residential lots from parcels in prime agricultural areas. This poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. As it currently reads, this policy could apply to any parcel of agricultural land, regardless of its size or whether it was previously severed before January 2023. Given that there are 48,346 farms4 and as many as 170,000 farmland properties in Ontario5, the province could see anywhere from 145,038 to 510,000 lots severed from agricultural properties. Therefore, if each lot is approximately 1-acre in size, this policy alone would be responsible for removing anywhere from 1.25% to 4.3% of Ontario\u2019s finite agricultural land base.\nThe use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays6. While I appreciate that proposed s.4.3.1 states \u201cPlanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach,\u201d this policy does not provide the strength needed to require agricultural systems, and appears to be in contradiction to the permissions of s.4.3.3. When you factor in s.4.3.2.5, which permits up to two additional dwellings in prime agricultural areas, this could result in as many as 1.5 million dwellings on newly severed lots in agricultural areas. This will lead to significant farmland fragmentation, which is contradictory to the purpose of an agricultural system, and will cause significant disruptions to surrounding agricultural operations.\nMoving to rural areas often means embracing the realities of agricultural living, such as noise, dust, odors, and farm equipment on the roads. Unfortunately, this leads to land-use compatibility conflicts that are difficult to mitigate once residential units are developed in agricultural areas. This poses significant challenges for farmers, especially when Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) is not properly followed during development approvals. This is concerning given that Bill 23 prevents third-party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal, making it difficult for nearby farmers to address MDS concerns. Additionally, constructing residential units up to the MDS line will limit any future growth of the agricultural operation, threatening the future viability of animal agriculture in Ontario.\nFurthermore, additional residential units on prime agricultural areas will result in an increase in water usage from underground aquifers. Three additional lots, including three additional residential units would put a significant strain on the water usage and increase the likelihood of water source issues for both the residents and the agricultural operation. Agriculture uses significant amounts of water to irrigate crops and provide water to livestock. Although a large percentage of water is returned to the source, often it has been changed and carrying soil and dissolved compounds7. With less water available in the aquifer, any contaminants will be more concentrated. Therefore, permitting three lot severances in prime agricultural areas will have significant implications for water availability and safety.\nBy permitting lot severances, the province will be impacting the financial accessibility of farmland for the next generation of farmers, making farming less financially viable. Each farm property will likely increase in price relative to the value of three vacant lots in the respective region. Ontario experienced a 19.4% increase in property values in 20228, making it unattainable or financially unfeasible for many young farmers to buy land. The proposed severance policies will incentivize developers, who can outbid young farmers, to purchase farmland or provide cash incentives for farmers to sever lots, contributing to the increase in farmland prices. This will result in the next generation experiencing a fragmented agricultural system and keeping ownership of farmland out of their reach. This is concerning because if the next generation of farmers cannot afford to farm, and experience it as increasingly difficult to farm, the province will not have a viable agricultural sector for much longer.\nI have noticed that the new proposed PPS 2023 states in policy 4.3.1.2, \u201cAs part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d However, permitting lot severances for residential use contradicts lands being designated for the long-term protection for agriculture.\nI believe that the proposed s. 4.3.2.5, which would allow two additional units on existing farm properties, could be significant in providing housing opportunities for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. Similarly, the proposed s. 2.2.1.b.2 allows more land for housing by converting existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use. Given these other proposed policies permitting additional housing and the significant concerns over the proposed lot creation policies, I question why there is a need to permit such a significant allowance for severances.\nFurthermore, permitting these severances is in contradiction to proposed s. 2.2.1.c, \u201cpromoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation.\u201d S.4.3.3 will not promote efficiency in these areas and will detract from the intentions to support intensification.\nI believe that municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising between non-farming residents and the agricultural community. However, proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being more restrictive, which could be vital for preventing these types of conflicts. For rural communities whose economies and culture are intricately associated with agriculture, s.4.3.3.2 will prevent municipalities from protecting a key component of their communities and is contradictory to the content on page 3 that states the PPS 2023 recognizes the diversity of Ontario and that local context is important. S.4.3.3.2 restricts rural municipalities from ensuring the local context of their agricultural system is protected from farmland fragmentation.\nI, therefore, urge the province to consider these concerns and remove s.4.3.3 in its entirety so that the proposed changes do not harm the province\u2019s agricultural lands and the farmers who depend on them. The province should require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping and allow municipalities to implement additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and prevent conflicts with non-farming residents.\nThank you for considering our submission, and I look forward to the province\u2019s response.\nSincerely,\nT.A.\nReferences:\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"Re: Proposed new Provincial plan\nI am in support of leniency in lot severances. For our beekeeping operation we only require a few acres to operate but in order to accomplish this we need to do some severances to financially restart our farm. Many farms in Northern Ontario are left to grow back to their natural growth due to the lack of people wanting to take up farming as a main source of income (needing large acreage) and due to the startup cost, but willing to do hobby farms (small scale operations, not needing large acreage). By allowing severances (creating smaller acreage farms) some would be young farmers would be more willing to start up farming with less of a startup cost as there is less acreage to purchase.\nThere is also a shortage of residential units in Ontario which these severances would help alleviate this shortage and create hobby farms in the process. At the time of this writing there were only 421 (houses\/land\/multi homes) listings for sale in the Sudbury area when normally the availability is in the 1500 range. Just a couple of years ago there were only in the area of 175 listings which drives up prices.\nFor many crops, Sudbury is too cold of a climate to operate. Some year\u2019s frost is not out of the ground until the month of June which leaves the ground temperature too low for seeds to germinate. This would mean the need for more greenhouses in place of open-air farming, which would also mean less need for larger acreage.\nIn our case we should be able to do severances to:\n\u2022\tfinancially support our operation\n\u2022\tcreate new residential lots with ability to hobby farm\n\u2022\twe should have more say in how we want to use our land\n\u2022\tincreases revenue for city without increasing demand on services in place\n\u2022\t increase the availability of land for would-be hobby farmers\n\u2022\twill not affect bordering farms\n\u2022\twould help keep farmland from going back to a natural state\n",

        "comment":"From the Town of Halton Hills Planning staff:\nThank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial policy instrument. Below please find the Town of Halton Hills\u2019 staff comments:\nSection 4.2.1, the following policy subsection has been removed: \u201cc) evaluating and preparing for the impacts of a changing climate to water resource systems at the watershed level.\u201d Town staff believe that references to the impacts of a changing climate should continue to be a part of this policy section in the finalized Provincial Planning Statement so that climate change is linked to the policies regarding the quantity and quality of our water supply. Evaluating and preparing for the impacts of climate change is critical in protecting water resources and ensuring safe drinking water in our watersheds.\nSection 4.2.1, the following policy subsection has been removed: \u201ci) ensuring storm water management practices minimize storm water volumes and contaminant loads and maintain or increase the extent of vegetative and pervious surfaces.\u201d\nIt is noted that Section 4.2.3 adds the following: \u201cMunicipalities are encouraged to undertake watershed planning to inform planning for sewage and water services and storm water management, including low impact development, and the protection, improvement or restoration of the quality and quantity of water.\u201d\nWith recent changes to the Consolidated Linear Infrastructure Environmental Compliance Approval process, the Province is downloading more responsibility to the municipalities by pushing more approval of Storm water Management infrastructure to local authorities. Without strong policies in the PPS to require the development community to address Storm water Management through their planning process, the municipalities would rely solely on local policies, bylaws and CLI ECA process.\nThe added section 4.2.3 would suggest municipalities are to be responsible for Subwatershed Studies that go beyond Secondary Plan boundaries, limiting the potential to use previously completed studies. This would result in increased costs for the municipality while providing added benefit for the development community. If the Province is going to move forward with the direction taken in 4.2.3, it is critical section 4.2.1 i) be included in section 4.2 of the new Provincial Planning Statement.\nNoted changes represent a much softer policy approach to Storm water Management. These changes \u2018encourage\u2019 LID practices, while removing the former reference to what exactly should be done. Town staff believe that the policy subsection noted above, which is being considered for removal, should be retained in the Provincial Planning Statement.\nSection 5.1 General Policies for Natural and Human-Made Hazards, \u201cdevelopment shall be directed away from areas of natural or human-made hazards where there is an unacceptable risk to public health or safety or of property damage\u201d. Town staff believe a definition of an unacceptable risk should be considered. It should also be clarified whether it would be up to the municipality to confirm if the risk is acceptable or unacceptable.\nSection 5.2. c) Hazardous sites: direction on who determines what is hazardous should be provided here, or in the definition of hazardous sites.\nSection 5.3 Human-made hazards: consideration should also be given for areas in close proximity to dams and other regional control facilities.\nFor the Natural Heritage System definition: it would be helpful to identify which \u2018recommended approach\u2019 is being referenced in the last sentence.\nFor the Negative impacts definition, sec. a): it would be helpful to identify which \u2018Provincial standards\u2019 are being referenced in the last sentence?\nFor the Wetlands definition: reference to Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry process and evaluation for identifying wetlands has been removed. In light of the removal from the definition of wetlands of the reference to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, the definition should clarify where the authority comes from to identify and designate wetlands moving forward.\nGeneral Comment: Growth Plan policies specifically required watershed planning to be undertaken to inform the identification and protection of water resource systems, growth management, and other land use and infrastructure planning decisions, and Subwatershed planning to inform large-scale and site-specific land use planning decisions.\nThe new PPS continues to encourage watershed planning but removes this requirement. The Town\u2019s Official Plan recognizes the importance of watershed and subwatershed planning to serve as a guide for improving water quality, reducing flood damage, and protecting natural resources. Subwatershed plans are required to be in place prior to the approval of Secondary Plans that implement an Urban Boundary Expansion as a way to inform all planning decisions. The removal of this requirement in the PPS could limit a municipality\u2019s ability to implement effective policies for subwatershed planning.\nIn addition, development applications must conform with the recommendations made in an approved watershed and subwatershed plan. As part of the Development Application Process, a Subwatershed Impact Study (SIS) may be required to look in detail at the site-specific conditions and mitigate any potential impacts to the watershed. Town staff is of the opinion that Watershed Planning should continue to be a requirement particularly in growing municipalities. Watershed Planning will ensure the protection, conservation and sustainable management of natural resources and guide appropriate land use policies within areas designated for growth. The Town encourages the finalization of the proposed Provincial Subwatershed Planning Guide prepared in January 2022 to serve as a guide to implement land use planning policies related to watershed and subwatershed planning in coordination with planning for water, wastewater and storm water servicing, water resources, drinking water source protection and climate change resilience.\nGeneral Comment: There is a policy in the Growth Plan that speaks to natural heritage features that are not identified:\n\u201c3.  Within the Natural Heritage System for the Growth Plan:\na)\tNew development or site alternation will demonstrate that:\niii. the removal of other natural features not identified as key natural heritage features and key hydrologic features is avoided, where possible. Such features should be incorporated into the planning and design of the proposed use wherever possible;\u201d\nStaff suggest adding a policy like the one above within the PPS to ensure that there is protection of natural heritage features that are not identified.\n",

        "comment":"The new policy proposed for the Provincial Planning  Statement requires additional detail in order to support natural heritage and water protection policies.  This document lacks sufficient technical information and specific implementation details. Development pressures and ambiguous, weakened municipal policy have intensified this past year under the pressure of Bill 23 and additional, pending policy. In turn, these changes have undermined development of local responsibility for natural heritage conservation.\nAn additional , troubling feature of this proposed policy involves the failure to recognize important natural features that are not included as \"significant\" including trees, shorelines and natural vegetation. There are reams of scientific research and publication reflecting the contributions of these and other features serving to mitigate climate change, reduce C02, protect water quality and prevent shoreline erosion, etc.\nThe Provincial government is now in a position to increase the quality and specificity of conservation tools, and to clarify current responsibilities shared by both municipal and provincial governments.\n",

We respectfully request that the Ministry take into consideration the comments provided in the attached memo, dated August 3, 2023, in reviewing and developing the new Provincial Planning Statement. A summary of our comments are as follows:\n- Land use compatibility policies are severely weakened in the proposed Provincial Planning Statement. We recommend maintaining the current PPS policies 1.2.6.2. a-c to address not only the impact on industry, but the impact on sensitive land uses (i.e. home owners), as well as prioritizing growth in areas that are not impacted by adverse effects. Land use compatibility is a critical matter to ensure the long-term function of industry and a reasonable quality of life for residents and other users of sensitive land uses.\n- The adverse effects on industry versus on residents is different, but this is not demonstrated in the proposed land use compatibility policies and should be considered as well. It is critical that the impact on residents and other sensitive land uses be considered when contemplating sensitive land uses adjacent or in proximity to rail facilities and operations.\n- Clarity is needed on what constitutes as avoidance and\/or prevention. While we recognize that the term \u201cavoidance\u201d is not defined in the current PPS or proposed Provincial Planning Statement; it is our opinion that the needs and alternatives test helps municipalities define avoidance and as such, is essential to include. In the absence of current PPS policy 1.2.6.2.a-b, avoidance cannot be defined. There is no clear distinction between \u201cavoid\/avoidance\u201d and \u201cprevent\u201d, as both terms are used in the proposed Provincial Planning Statement, and whether avoidance equates to prevention, or vice versa.\n- The Provincial Planning Statement should acknowledge that the industry is growing as well. It is important to take into consideration that we cannot predict how this growth will occur as it is customer specific and subject to market conditions. The rail industry is expected to continue experiencing growth. This growth cannot currently be predicted, including the expansion of operations for current rail yards and facilities. This is because the rail industry can not refuse cargo per statute and must be able to quickly respond to any new customers anywhere in the Province. The Proposed Provincial Planning Statement should speak to the importance of considering the rules and regulations under which these facilities operate as part of considering land use planning policies and community development.\nThe letter details our recommended policy language to address these and other concerns. Notably, we recommend that proposed policy 3.5.2 be revised to implement the current land use compatibility policies in the 2020 PPS, specifically the 4 tests under policy 1.2.6.2. If the Province has concerns regarding adding back the needs and alternatives test at a broader scale, we suggest a focused approach where the test applies, at the very least, to large and fast-growing municipalities.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023, section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments.\nComments regarding section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nI am concerned about proposed s.4.3.3 which permits the severance of three residential lots from parcels in prime agricultural areas. This poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. As it currently reads, this policy could apply to any parcel of agricultural land, regardless of its size or whether it was previously severed before January 2023. Given that there are 48,346 farms4 and as many as 170,000 farmland properties in Ontario5, the province could see anywhere from 145,038 to 510,000 lots severed from agricultural properties. Therefore, if each lot is approximately 1-acre in size, this policy alone would be responsible for removing anywhere from 1.25% to 4.3% of Ontario\u2019s finite agricultural land base.\nThe use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays6. While I appreciate that proposed s.4.3.1 states \u201cPlanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach,\u201d this policy does not provide the strength needed to require agricultural systems, and appears to be in contradiction to the permissions of s.4.3.3. When you factor in s.4.3.2.5, which permits up to two additional dwellings in prime agricultural areas, this could result in as many as 1.5 million dwellings on newly severed lots in agricultural areas. This will lead to significant farmland fragmentation, which is contradictory to the purpose of an agricultural system, and will cause significant disruptions to surrounding agricultural operations.\nMoving to rural areas often means embracing the realities of agricultural living, such as noise, dust, odors, and farm equipment on the roads. Unfortunately, this leads to land-use compatibility conflicts that are difficult to mitigate once residential units are developed in agricultural areas. This poses significant challenges for farmers, especially when Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) is not properly followed during development approvals. This is concerning given that Bill 23 prevents third-party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal, making it difficult for nearby farmers to address MDS concerns. Additionally, constructing residential units up to the MDS line will limit any future growth of the agricultural operation, threatening the future viability of animal agriculture in Ontario.\nFurthermore, additional residential units on prime agricultural areas will result in an increase in water usage from underground aquifers. Three additional lots, including three additional residential units would put a significant strain on the water usage and increase the likelihood of water source issues for both the residents and the agricultural operation. Agriculture uses significant amounts of water to irrigate crops and provide water to livestock. Although a large percentage of water is returned to the source, often it has been changed and carrying soil and dissolved compounds7. With less water available in the aquifer, any contaminants will be more concentrated. Therefore, permitting three lot severances in prime agricultural areas will have significant implications for water availability and safety.\nBy permitting lot severances, the province will be impacting the financial accessibility of farmland for the next generation of farmers, making farming less financially viable. Each farm property will likely increase in price relative to the value of three vacant lots in the respective region. Ontario experienced a 19.4% increase in property values in 20228, making it unattainable or financially unfeasible for many young farmers to buy land. The proposed severance policies will incentivize developers, who can outbid young farmers, to purchase farmland or provide cash incentives for farmers to sever lots, contributing to the increase in farmland prices. This will result in the next generation experiencing a fragmented agricultural system and keeping ownership of farmland out of their reach. This is concerning because if the next generation of farmers cannot afford to farm, and experience it as increasingly difficult to farm, the province will not have a viable agricultural sector for much longer.\nI have noticed that the new proposed PPS 2023 states in policy 4.3.1.2, \u201cAs part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d However, permitting lot severances for residential use contradicts lands being designated for the long-term protection for agriculture.\nI believe that the proposed s. 4.3.2.5, which would allow two additional units on existing farm properties, could be significant in providing housing opportunities for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. Similarly, the proposed s. 2.2.1.b.2 allows more land for housing by converting existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use. Given these other proposed policies permitting additional housing and the significant concerns over the proposed lot creation policies, I question why there is a need to permit such a significant allowance for severances.\nFurthermore, permitting these severances is in contradiction to proposed s. 2.2.1.c, \u201cpromoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation.\u201d S.4.3.3 will not promote efficiency in these areas and will detract from the intentions to support intensification.\nI believe that municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising between non-farming residents and the agricultural community. However, proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being more restrictive, which could be vital for preventing these types of conflicts. For rural communities whose economies and culture are intricately associated with agriculture, s.4.3.3.2 will prevent municipalities from protecting a key component of their communities and is contradictory to the content on page 3 that states the PPS 2023 recognizes the diversity of Ontario and that local context is important. S.4.3.3.2 restricts rural municipalities from ensuring the local context of their agricultural system is protected from farmland fragmentation.\nI, therefore, urge the province to consider these concerns and remove s.4.3.3 in its entirety so that the proposed changes do not harm the province\u2019s agricultural lands and the farmers who depend on them. The province should require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping and allow municipalities to implement additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and prevent conflicts with non-farming residents.\nThank you for considering our submission, and I look forward to the province\u2019s response.\nSincerely,\nTony T.\nReferences:\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"The protection of our environment and natural heritage is of utmost importance when considering all aspects of development in Ontario. Land Trusts are one of many organizations committed to land protection, primarily through the donation of land by conservation minded landowners.\nOften these lands contain a house which the landowner wishes to retain use of, or which is not within the Land Trusts' mandate to manage. Unfortunately in these situations it is often beyond the ability of the land trust to navigate the various planning elements required to facilitate a severance - elements which are presumably in place to prevent bad severance, not to prevent a severance for the purposes of conservation.\nSeveral individual official plans across Ontario provide some relief from this issue, smoothing the way for severances that are for the purposes of conservation. An example from the draft Peterborough County official plan and another from the Peel Regional Official Plan are below. The inclusion of language similar to this in the new provincial panning policy instrument would provide an Ontario-wide solution to the issue and allow more good conservation work to happen more quickly across the province.\nPeterborough County\nn) Notwithstanding any other policy of this Plan to the contrary, the creation of new lots or the assembly of land through lot additions for conservation purposes by a recognized non-profit organization may be permitted within the boundaries of key natural heritage features and key hydrologic features without the need for a Natural Heritage Evaluation. This exception recognizes the intent to protect the feature and its functions for the long term. Lots created for such purpose will be placed in a separate zoning category, recognizing the lands for a conservation use. For clarity, the zoning may permit passive recreational uses, as well as buildings and structures outside of key features and vegetation protection zones provided they are used for conservation education purposes.\nPeel\n7.4.9 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments:\n7.4.9.5 Support consents to enable the securement of lands for natural heritage conservation purposes by a public authority or by a non-government conservation organization, provided that:\na)  the consent will avoid fragmentation of the Greenlands System's natural heritage features and areas, where possible;\nb)  in the Prime Agricultural Area, the consent will not create a lot permitting an additional residential dwelling or other additional non-farm development beyond that which was permitted on the original lot to be severed prior to the consent;\nc)  the acquired and retained lots are in compliance with the local municipal official plan and zoning by-law; and\nd)  when deemed necessary, a restrictive covenant or conservation easement is placed on title of the land to be held for conservation purposes prohibiting development of the land for non-conservation uses in perpetuity.\n7.4.9.6  Encourage the local municipalities to include appropriate lot standards and provisions in their official plans and zoning by-laws to recognize and permit non-complying lots to be created as a result of an acquisition of land by a public authority or a non-government conservation organization for natural heritage conservation purposes.\n",

REQUIRING MUNCIPALITIES TO PROTECT SPECIALTY CROP AREAS IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS CLASS 4-7 FARMLAND ESSENTIAL FOR FARMING!!!!!!!!!!!!  This was FINALLY understood in the Provincially-Mapped Agricultural Systems Approach.  Removing this requirement places agriculture at risk in municipalities where the protection of agriculture is not valued.\nb.\n4.3.2.Permitted Uses\n1.\tOn-Farm Diversified Uses (OFDUs) should have more strict criteria, and should \u2018benefit from being on a farm\u2019.  The province\u2019s attempt with On-Farm Diversified Use allows businesses to be run on farms that DO NOT BENEFIT FROM BEING ON FARMS with disastrous results as follows:\n\u2022\tResults in more traffic on narrow rural roads which decreases safety for farmers on roads, interferes with timely access to crops (which is time-sensitive due to weather) \u2013 resulting in Loss of crops A VISCIOUS CIRCLE WHICH WILL RESULT IN FARMERS OUT OF BUSINESS AND ONTARIO NO LONGER ABLE TO PRODUCE ADEQUATE FOOD\n\u2022\tBusinessmen purchase farms that \u2018farmers who farm for a living\u2019 can no longer afford.  The \u2018real farmer\u2019 rents the land \u2013 creates \u2018farming income\u2019 for the owner\/businessman to qualify as a farmer \u2013 essentially allowing \u2018businessmen to create a farm on which to run a business!!\u201d  This is identified as a loophole in University of Guelph professor Dr. Wayne Caldwell\u2019s \u201cGuidelines on Permitted Uses as a Tool to Achieve Farmland Protection, Farm Diversification and Economic Benefits:  Assessing effectiveness and identifying best practices\u201d.\n\u2022\tBusinessmen who come out to the country to run their business off a farm are building \u2018agricultural buildings\u2019 in which to house these businesses prior to making application for On Farm Diversified Use \u2013 they get breaks on taxation, permits etc when the intent is not agricultural (in hindsight)\n\u2022\tBusinessmen running OFDU businesses on farms are not paying the same taxes and do not have the overhead of their competitors in commercial areas \u2013 puts these people out of business and does not make sense in terms of employment opportunities.\n\u2022\tThe government needs to reassess \u2018who is a farmer\u2019 ; the current $7,000 gross income (established in the 1970s) has not kept up with inflation (which now would equal approximately $58,000) and is too easy to achieve.  As a result, municipalities are not getting the same tax payments (as these \u2018farmers\u2019 are not actually farming for a living, but they get the same tax breaks as the farmer who does farm for a living).  Consequently, municipalities cannot maintain our roads and other infrastructure as they do not have sufficient money!\n\u2022\tResults in customers driving to the country for businesses that should be in urban or settlement areas \u2013 causing more emissions which affect climate \u2013 which then affect ability to grow crops \u2013 VISCIOUS CYCLE!!!  AND more cars on these roads, who meet the farmer at the top of a hill \u2013 farmer killed as no protection while on a tractor (THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY!!)  When we lose another farmer, we lose the farm production!!\n\u2022\tOFDUs need to be analyzed in terms of intent!  The province allows almost any \u2018business\u2019 to be an OFDU \u2013 not recognizing that a business NOT relating to AGRICULTURE will bring in more income than farming!  FARMING IS HARD WORK \u2013 LONG HOURS, LARGE EXPENSE FOR NO GUARANTEE OF GOOD CROPS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE!  When an OFDU is making money, why would a farmer continue to farm??  IT is ACTUALLY PULLS FARMERS AWAY FROM FARM INCOME GENERATION \u2013 TOO MANY RISKS COMPARED TO A NON-AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS!\n\u2022\tOFDUs should support the agriculture and\/or agri-tourism industry and BENEFIT FROM BEING ON A FARM!\n4.3.3  Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nMore residential lots should NOT be allowed in prime agricultural areas:\n\u2022\tPromoting an agricultural systems approach is not possible if houses are scattered in among farmland.  Farmers can no longer afford farms!  They have to rent land and consequently are consistently on our rural roads with large equipment (This is a MAJOR CHANGE since the days when farmers could make a living on their \u2018home farm\u2019).  These roads are narrow and not safe for additional residential traffic.  THE ABILITY TO FARM NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED AND MINIMUM SEPARATION DISTANCES BETWEEN LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS AND HOUSING IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE WIDER CONSIDERATIONS WHICH MUST BE IN PLACE FOR FARMERS TO CONTINUE TO FARM IN THESE PRIME AGRICULTURAL AREAS!\n\u2022\tThe current Agricultural Impact Assessment DOES NOT FULLY COVER ALL IMPACTS TO SURROUNDING AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS!!!!\n\u2022\tProtecting specialty crop areas (Class 1-3 land) is not sufficient, as classes 4-7 also required for farming.  There are many crops that can be harvested on Class 4-5, while Class 6-7 land is good for pasture.  All of this needs to be balanced.\n\u2022\tReference to the need for Agricultural Impact Assessment is NOT SUFFICIENT!  Analysis of minimum distance separation does NOT take into account the impact on road use, increased density where people are not familiar with cattle \u2013 go into fields and disturb cattle (and could be hurt!), ride ATVs and noise\/backfiring scares cattle and they run through fences, to name just a few!\n\u2022\tOur rural road currently has 62 residential homes in a 2.6 km stretch of the road.  There is still space for more as some farmers did not sever lots when this was allowed years ago.  HOWEVER, with the lack of farm income, this is TOO TEMPTING AS A MEANS FOR A FARMER TO PAY DOWN DEBT!!  We actively farm for a living and could benefit from the sale of lots off our farms \u2013 BUT THIS IS WRONG!  We cannot get the land back and this will become more of an issue in future years when our current agricultural land will not support crop growth due to the disappearnance of the carbon in the soil.  AND THIS GOVERNENT IS DOING NOTHING TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE FARMING (rotational, no-till crops for example \u2013 to stop erosion and enrich soil -  and with decreased fertilizers and weed spraying) \u2013 the farmer doing this gets the same price for his crops as those who do not, but this typically results in less crops and there is NO FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR FARMERS TO FARM IN THIS WAY TO SAVE THE LAND!\n\u2022\tThese additional houses also increase the risk of climate change to farm practices, due to greenhouse gas emissions with people driving out to the country and then having to drive into a town for all of their personal, shopping and business needs.  Houses should be congregated in settlement areas!!\n\u2022\tSpecifying that agriculture should be the \u2018principal use of the existing lot\u2019 is a MISTAKE.  This is taking up good farmland!  Lots should only be allowed on farms IF THEY ARE NATURALLY SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE FARM AND NOT BEING USED TO PRODUCE CROPS, GRAZE CATTLE ETC.  (Eg. A piece of property that is separated by a stream or wetland, and CANNOT BE ACCESSED FOR FARMING!  And \u2013 even under these conditions \u2013 NO MORE THAN ONE LOT \u2013 and ONLY IF CANNOT BE USED FOR AGRICULTURE!!\nPolicy Direction for Large and Fast-Growing Municipalities and Other Municipalities\nBalance housing with resources:\n1.\tRequire municipalities to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate and develop approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.\ni.\tPutting subdivisions outside of towns means driving is required for ALL excursions\nii.\tMany people want the downtown experience, yet municipalities are building OUT instead of UP.\niii.\tBuilding OUT means increased use of vehicles for transportation as residents cannot walk or take public transportation to town activities\/entertainment\niv.\tMore emphasis should be placed on 15-minute communities  - where jobs, retail and other amenities are within a 15-minute excursion of one\u2019s residence (preferably by walking or biking) \u2013 to reduce urban sprawl, cluster neighbourhoods (instead of lots spread out all over agricultural areas) \u2013 and ensure living, working and day-to-day needs such as groceries, drug stores and restaurants are all within this area\nv.\tThe impact of this on climate results in weather conditions which mean farmers LOSE money every year \u2013 insufficient rain for crops to grow; too much rain and crops rot in field, extreme winds which damage crops \u2013 every year the farmer has more debt because the money they spend on seed, fertilizers, etc is lost when those crops do not come to fruition!\n2.\t2.9 Energy Conservation, Air Quality and Climate Change\na.\tClimate change is a very small portion of this new PPS (Section 2.9.1 ONLY) to cover these 3 VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPTS!!   This is especially true, given that the A Place To Grow Document was very serious about saving energy, improving air quality and addressing climate change.\nb.\tMZOs have been executed in communities where people will work over an hour away \u2013 with no transit options \u2013 HUGE impact on greenhouse gas emissions with all of this driving!!  Transit should be available BEFORE houses are constructed!!\nc.\tThis very small section looks like a \u2018token offering\u2019 in the midst of a PPS that proposes taking more land from agriculture\nProposed Policies to Generate Housing Supply (including range and mix of housing options)\nGenerate An Appropriate Housing Supply\n1.\tIdentify fast-growing municipalities with specific direction to plan strategically for growth:\na.\tMZOs are mandating which communities should be \u2018fast-growing\u2019 without taking into account the lack of infrastructure which includes:\ni.\tInsufficient day care spots (we had over 800 children on a list for Day Care before the province mandated that 7000 houses would be built here)\nii.\tInability of current hospital to accommodate more people; our hospital is small and will not accommodate this growth, especially with vacant positions\niii.\tRegional Health Centre is almost an hour away and dealing with the same issues of expansion; built 10 years ago and already can\u2019t accommodate patient needs\niv.\tSchools not available where housing occurring (on the outskirts), yet older schools available in downtown area\nv.\tAGREE \u2013 with residential intensification (Section 2.2.1),  in downtown areas (where schools are also sitting empty!), ESPECIALLY in repurposing existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use;  ensure transit availability and PREVENT URBAN SPRAWL to decrease greenhouse gas emissions\n2.\tProvide a range of housing\na.\tThere is opportunity to put new housing in current \u2018downtown\u2019 area \u2013 where homes are run down \u2013 and schools are available; yet building all occurring on outskirts\nb.\tMajority of housing is single- family homes, all requiring vehicles to access (how does that take into account the aim in A Place To Grow to decrease greenhouse gas emissions?)\n3.\tProvide\/allow for more residential development in rural settlements and multi-lot residential development on rural lands defined in PPS as \u201clands which are located outside settlement areas and which are outside prime agricultural areas\u201d\na.\tWithout the implementation of the provincial mapping developed by OMAFRA, rural lands are in the middle of agricultural areas and this impacts farming practices\n4.\tRequire municipalities to permit more housing on farms, including residential lot creation\na.\tHUGE MISTAKE -  as this brings housing into the middle of farm areas which creates more problems for farmers \u2013 farms need to be enveloped in \u2018active farming communities\u2019 and bringing in more traffic and complaints will be the final straw for farmers already struggling \u2013 they will toss in the towel!\nProposed Policies on Conservation of Agriculture, Aggregates, Natural and Cultural Heritage Resources\nThis proposed PPS is DETRIMENTAL to ALL of these areas:\n\u2022\tMore land proposed to be taken from agriculture\no\tLot creation on farms is a problem, given the extent to which this was allowed back in the 1970-s.  Our road has 62 houses in 2.6 km \u2013 on a narrow road, with no sidewalks.  People walk on road \u2013 unsafe!  It\u2019s a farming community and farming is hampered by traffic; unsafe at top of hills where farm equipment is wide and cars travel too fast\n\u2022\tWetlands have NOT been protected under this current government \u2013 MZOs have reduced our wetlands, especially in the areas surrounding Toronto\nProposed Policies on Planning for Employment\n\u2022\tOur area\u2019s PRIME EMPLOYER IS AGRICULTURE, yet this PPS takes more land from agriculture to bring in housing for people FOR WHOM WE HAVE NO JOBS!!!  And this was dictated by a MZO \u2013 which shows no respect for our local Council or City employees decisions (or those citizens who elected them!!)\nOther Barriers\/Opportunities for accelerating development and construction\nPage 13 \u2013 notes \u201cHousing must be built in the right places so that Ontario\u2019s vibrant agricultural sector and sensitive areas will continue to form part of the Province\u2019s economic prosperity and overall identity.  Growth and development will be focused within urban and rural settlements that will, in turn, support and protect the long-term viability of rural areas, local food production and the agri-food network.\u201d\nThis sounds good \u2013 but is NOT THE REALITY and this PPS has too many loopholes for this to happen!\n\u2022\tTaking up 200 acres of prime farmland in a community that does not have jobs, schools, day care spaces or hospital beds to support 7000 new homes shows a lack of foresight which does NOT protect agriculture NOR protect the planet when residents will drive over an hour to jobs in larger cities\n\u2022\tAll of this driving, and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions will further drive climate change \u2013 AND NOT SUPPORT THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY of local food production and the agri-food network.\n\u2022\tSensitive areas have NOT been protected \u2013 wetlands have been forced into housing through MZOs with no foresight!\n\u2022\tHousing should be intensified in URBAN settlement areas \u2013 NOT RURAL for many reasons identified earlier!\n\u2022\tWe are at a CRITICAL JUNCTURE with climate change \u2013 farmers are NOT making a living on farms and the government is not supporting them with financial assistance to change farming practices to protect the land!\n\u2022\tAllowing ANYTHING on a farm, as an On-Farm Diversified Use screams \u201cYou cannot make a living farming\u201d \u2013 we should be providing assistance to farmers which will then help to reverse climate change AND encourage young people to get into the business.  It is currently VERY HARD WORK WITH DISCOURAGING RESULTS \u2013 this will not attract young farmers!\n\u2022\tPC government focus on constantly increasing production of food (as that\u2019s the only way farmers can make money \u2013 so everything has to be produced faster and in larger quantities, which means more pesticides and fertilizers) contradicts the need to protect the land and conserve the carbon in the soil \u2013 FARMING IS MORE THAN A BUSINESS!

This document (Farmland at Risk:  Why land-use planning needs improvements for a healthy agricultural future in the Greater Golden Horseshoe) was prepared by the OFA indicating the key to a robust agricultural industry is the protection of the land base on which to farm and carry out farm-related activities.  This was done at a time when our Ontario Government believed in \u201ctaking important steps to preserve farmland and environmentally significant areas in the GGH!  It followed the Greenbelt Plan (2005) designed to help preserve agriculture \u2013 WHY IS ALL OF THIS IMPORTANT RESEARCH BEING IGNORED????\n",

As a resident in a long established uptown neighbourhood, I have seen highrises spring up around me.  Ten years ago, I was a NIMBY and fought them vigorously.  But as the climate crisis worsens, as our population increases, and especially as costs of imported foods skyrocket (but locally produced food available at our local farmers market remains affordable),  I have changed my thinking.  Preserving farmland and preventing car-dependent suburbs, eliminating the need to commute for even basic necessities is far more important.\nThis is not the time to eliminate intensification and density requirements.\nJust because the Home Builders Association are wanting a piece of the action that highrise builders have been getting for decades is not a good reason to drop these requirements.  Dropping these requirements sends the message that urban sprawl and car dependent rural estates that eat up farmland are desirable.  They aren't.  They can't be when people are dying of heat exhaustion, or lining up for food banks because the only food they can buy is imported and unaffordable.\n",

        "comment":"Minister Clark,\nPlease consider this letter as the National Farmers Union \u2013 Ontario\u2019s (NFU-O) second submission to ERO 019-6813 (our first response was submitted on June 5th, 2023). We appreciate the ERO deadline extension and the opportunity for the accredited farm organizations and commodity groups to share with Hon. Lisa Thompson, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) on July 12th, 2023 our shared concerns regarding the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement.\nThe NFU-O is an accredited farm organization representing thousands of sustainable farmers in Ontario. Members work together to achieve agricultural policies that ensure dignity and income security for farmers while protecting and enhancing rural environments for future generations. We believe in the importance of a healthy, viable, and sustainable supply of food products grown, harvested, and processed right here at home. The NFU-O is confident that long-term food system security for the people of Ontario, Canada, and the world is a shared priority for the general public and our governments.\nWe applaud the government\u2019s promise to remove \u201cLot Creation and Lot Adjustments\u201d (4.3.4)\u2014allowing for the creation of up to three new severed residential lots per farm parcel\u2014from the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement (PPS). Abandoning this farmland severance proposal will help minimize the paving over of Ontario farmland, limit farmland speculation, avoid costly servicing and rural residential sprawl, and lessen conflicts between livestock farmers and non-farming rural residents. The NFU-O strongly recommends maintaining the current Lot Creation policies contained within the 2020 PPS.\nThe NFU-O has the following recommendations regarding the Proposed PPS:\n\u2022\tMaintain the requirement to demonstrate any need for Settlement Area Boundary Expansion;\n\u2022\tStrike a working group with the accredited farm organizations to create a consistent, practical, and fair Additional Residential Unit policy;\n\u2022\tMaintain the requirement for Provincially Mapped Agricultural Systems;\n\u2022\tBroaden the definition of what constitutes Prime Agricultural Lands; and\n\u2022\tDevelop a truly sustainable and affordable housing strategy and farmland protection strategy.\nSettlement Area Boundary Expansion\nThe evidence suggests that the Greater Golden Horseshoe\u2019s cumulative capacity inside existing urban boundaries is over two million units, far exceeding the provincial government\u2019s target of building 1.5 million homes by 2031 (Kevin Eby, 2023).  We question the need for settlement expansion when there is plenty of vacant and underused lands within Ontario\u2019s current urban and municipal boundaries to support higher density and affordable housing development.\nThe NFU-O recommends maintaining the requirement for planning authorities to demonstrate (PPS 2020, 1.1.3.8), and not just consider (as it is presented in the Proposed PPS, 2.3.4) whether creating new and\/or expanding current settlement areas will negatively impact prime agricultural areas, and whether there are reasonable alternatives within current urban boundaries through \u201cintensification, redevelopment, and designated growth areas.\u201d\nAdditional Residential Unit (ARU) Policy\nWe believe that allowing for additional residential units on existing farmland parcels serves to prevent the further subdivision of and development on agricultural lands while giving farmers more flexibility to provide housing for family and staff. However, there is a lack of clarity regarding the proposed ARU policy. The size, location, and quality standards of ARUs on farm plots, issues of shared laneways\/access, and assessing the impacts of ARUs on farmland and natural heritage features require greater consideration than is currently given in the Proposed PPS.\nThe NFU-O recommends that the Government strike a working group that includes representatives from the accredited farm organizations and commodity groups to ensure consistent and fair ARU criteria and to ensure ARU guidelines are practical and compatible with existing agricultural operations.\nProvincially Mapped Agricultural Systems\nWhile the Proposed PPS does promise an \u201cagricultural system approach,\u201d it has abandoned the A Place to Grow (2020), Section 4.2.6, requirement of municipalities to use the provincially mapped Agricultural System in order to designate and protect prime agricultural areas for long-term use.\nThe NFU-O recommends including and expanding a provincially-mapped Agricultural System within the Proposed PPS to ensure we still have farmland to produce farm products for future generations of Ontarians. This will ensure specialty crop and prime agricultural lands are consistently mapped across Ontario, and will support economic development and job creation across the whole agri-food value chain.\nPrime Agricultural Lands\nBy revising the PPS, the Ontario Government has the opportunity to expand the definition of prime agricultural lands beyond Canada Land Inventory (CLI) Class 1-3 soils, to include CLI Class 1-6 soils, plus specialty crop lands. Class 4-6 soils support a variety of important agricultural activities, including grazing livestock and grain crop production. These soils can also be improved over time through the use of regenerative farm practices. In many parts of the province, active farmland has been zoned as rural, not agricultural land, making it subject to development pressures and unrestricted growth. CLI Class 1-6 farmland deserves to be protected from unnecessary development.\nThe NFU-O recommends an expansion to the definition of prime agricultural lands in the Proposed PPS to include CLI Class 1-6 soils and for the government, using a provincially-mapped Agricultural System, to correctly identify and zone as \u201cagricultural\u201d all currently active farmland.\nSustainable and Affordable Housing Strategy\nVery little of the recently passed Bill 23 or the Proposed PPS actually address the crisis of affordable housing in the province. We agree with diverse Ontario constituents who are calling for the Government to finance the construction of subsidized housing stock within liveable, walkable communities. Co-operative and\/or subsidized public housing initiatives are urgently required within both our large urban centres and within existing rural municipalities and hamlets.\nWe do not need to create policies that support more sprawl housing on our finite agricultural land; what we do need are policies that support truly affordable housing in areas close to where Ontarians work, including farm workers and labourers that the agri-food industry depends upon.\nThe NFU-O recommends that the Ontario government directly fund the construction of subsidized public housing and incentivize co-operative housing initiatives within pre-existing urban and rural boundaries.\nWe also recommend that the Government sit down with all accredited farm organizations to discuss policies that will ensure farmland is owned by farmers and that farmland costs are within reach of the province\u2019s aspiring agriculturalists.\nConclusion\nFarmland protections in the current Provincial Policy Statement and A Place to Grow already work well to allow limited and controlled development in and surrounding Ontario\u2019s agricultural lands. We don\u2019t need to fix what isn\u2019t broken.\nNFU-O farm leaders would welcome working with the province to develop policies that will ensure farmland is permanently protected and is affordable for the next generation of farmers.\nSincerely,\nMax Hansgen, President\nNational Farmers Union \u2013 Ontario\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark\nI understand that you are interested in hearing from farmers in Ontario to gauge our reaction to Bill 97 and the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement.\nI am writing to voice my support for the proposal to allow for the voluntary severing of up three lots per farm parcel.\nThere are many good reasons why residential lot creation in agricultural areas does makes sense. Allowing farmland severance on less productive areas of the farm will enhance rural economies and increase property tax base for small rural townships and counties. It will also help in a small way alleviate the housing crisis Ontario currently is facing. Agricultural productivity is increasing, and farmland cropped area is increasing especially in Northern and eastern regions that are recording a slight increase in temperatures as a result of climate change. Farm operations are increasing in size and demanding a more skilled workforce that has a preference to reside close to the farm operation without having to reside in the larger farmyards of today's farm units. Simply putting housing in the farm stead, itself is not advisable as it becomes a health and safety issue for raising a family with small children. A severed parcel slightly away from the farm operation is a much more practical solution in today's modern farm.\nThere are many farmers in rural areas without livestock who welcome the opportunity to have their farm severed into two additional lots., I feel this is good planning for farm transition to the next generation as well as attracting the skilled labour today's farms need to operate. We have a housing shortage in this province and severing farm parcels is a way to ensure farmers have the ability to have the next generation farm and also have a skilled workforce find houses close to their workplace to keep the farm operational.\nAs a farmer, I strive to be respectful to our neighbours with regards to spraying, nutrient application, moving equipment, and other normal farm practices. Currently 80 percent of the rural population in my County are no longer farming due to farm consolidation and there are very few conflicts with non-farmers, Fruit and vegetable growers often sell their produce to their neighbours through roadside stands to make extra income for their families.\nI also support the current and future use of Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) standards to regulate development in rural areas.\nAllowing lot severances enables our children and grandchildren to have the choice to farm and to invest in their house without connecting directly in the farm business. Severed residential lots will protect the future of the farm in the event of unexpected changes in our farm operation and that of our children\u2019s paths from uncontrollable circumstances.\nI respectfully ask that the government to continue with its proposal to allow for the severing of farmland parcels in recognition of the current and future value and importance of agriculture to the province. A voluntary farm lot severance policy will not be engaged in by all family farms however it will help many struggling family farms who may not have the benefit of supply management marketing systems continue to farm for many years to come in the Province.\n",

        "comment":"The Atmospheric Fund\u2019s Response to\nOntario\u2019s Proposed Provincial Planning Statement\nOn April 6, 2023, the provincial government introduced Bill 97, the Helping Homebuyers, Protecting Tenants Act, 2023. Bill 97 proposes significant changes to the provincial planning framework and land use approvals systems. Combining elements from the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020, and the 2019 Growth Plan, Ontario\u2019s proposed provincial planning statement (PPS) commits to supporting the goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2031. As the PPS provides minimum standards for municipal planning, these policy changes have a direct impact on how cities and communities are developed across the province.\nTAF has significant concerns about the long-term energy and climate impacts of the new PPS. In the current PPS, Ontario directs development and land use patterns to prepare for the local and regional impacts of a changing climate. The Growth Plan also places sustainability and climate change as a key principle for guiding growth and development throughout its framework. The new PPS streamlines climate change policies by creating a separate section for them, weakening their role in growth management and planning.\nTAF recommends that the province maintain the policy direction in the 2020 PPS and the Growth Plan to ensure land use and development supports energy conservation and efficiency, improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and climate resilience.\nWe specifically suggest changing section 2.9 to maintain the original reference to \u201cland use and development patterns\u201d that \u201cencourage transit-supportive development,\u201d \u201cpromote design and orientation which maximizes energy efficiency and conservation,\u201d and \u201cintegrate green infrastructure\u201d.\nWe also recommend maintaining the language in section 3.1.1 that \u201cinfrastructure and public service facilities shall be provided in an efficient manner that prepares for the impacts of a changing climate.\u201d Equally, the reference to \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d in section 3.1.2 should remain, as this is an important policy tool in responding to a changing climate.\nSeveral municipalities have made robust recommendations to the provincial government on the PPS, including on climate change and energy policies. TAF supports the following municipal recommendations: \u2022 The City of Toronto recommends the province maintain the current Provincial Policy Statement and Growth Plan policies that explicitly support energy efficiency, increased vegetation, and improved air quality. \u2022 The City of Brampton recommends integrating climate change policies through the PPS 2023 that reflect the directions found in the PPS 2020 and Growth Plan, ensuring sustainable development patterns, requiring implementation of alternative and renewable energy systems, working to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while ensuring climate risks, vulnerabilities and opportunities for adaptation are assessed and implemented through local official plans.\n\u2022 The City of Hamilton recommends more robust climate change policies that include\ntargets to provide municipalities with the ability to require green infrastructure and low\nimpact development when reviewing Planning Act development applications. Specific\nreference should be made to the role of retrofitting existing buildings, including buildings\nof cultural heritage value, to achieve these goals.\n\u2022 The Town of Newmarket recommends the province maintain the policies from the\ncurrent PPS that direct development and land use patterns to promote transit supportive\ndevelopment, conserve biodiversity, and prepare for the regional and local impacts of a\nchanging climate. These policy directions are important to help deter the inefficient use\nof land and infrastructure and protect natural heritage features.\n\u2022 Peel Region recommends that climate change policies should be more fully integrated in\nthe PPS and required more directly in growth management and infrastructure planning.\nThis can be done by promoting efficient development and land use patterns and\nrequiring that municipalities facilitate the introduction of renewable and alternative\nenergy systems, including district energy, to support greenhouse gas emission reduction\nin planning decisions. Peel Region also requests that the province provide additional\nguidance to municipalities for conducting energy and emissions reduction planning and\nadaptation planning specific to land use planning.\n\u2022 York Region recommends that climate change adaptation, mitigation, vulnerabilities, and\nincreased resiliency should be integrated throughout the 2023 PPS, adequately\nreflecting their importance. The Region also argues that Public Health agencies should\nbe included in the list of government agencies working to help identify and address\nhealth hazards associated with climate change.\nOverall, greater consideration and integration of emissions-reductions policies must be\nincorporated into the provincial planning framework. Streamlining of provincial planning direction\nshould not be at the expense of community and climate resiliency. Effective planning policies\ncan protect and promote a healthy climate by improving air quality, supporting energy\nconservation and efficiency, promoting green infrastructure and transit supportive development,\nand reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ontario has a responsibility to demonstrate leadership\nin providing planning direction and should take the opportunity to support municipalities in\nmeeting both their housing and climate goals at the same time.\n",

        "comment":"RE: Provincial Agricultural System, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\n(your name \/ organization name)\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

(CLS) wishes to submit this supplementary letter in response to the Province\u2019s new draft Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) document. These comments are in respect to the lands located within the block of Twenty Road West, Upper James Street, Dickenson Road and Glancaster Road, within the City of Hamilton (Subject Lands). It is understood that the Province is reviewing and amending policies to replace the existing Provincial Policy Statement, and a Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe.\nIn addition to the previous letter that was submitted on May 29th, 2023, on behalf of the landowners, a few points of clarification pertaining to the noise policies have been included for consideration.\nNoise:\nUnder the current PPS policy new infill residential development and other sensitive land uses are permitted up to the 30 NEF. In addition to the 30 NEF, Transport Canada considers development potentially up to the 35 NEF, subject to specific conditions.   These policies are specifically mentioned within the guiding document, Aviation \u2013 Land Use in the Vicinity of Aerodromes \u2013 TP1247: Section 4.8, Table 2. The footnotes attached to Table 2 identify that if residential construction or development does proceed, the responsible authority shall be satisfied that: \u201c(1) appropriate acoustic insulation features have been considered in the building and (2) a noise impact assessment study has been completed and shows that this construction or development is not incompatible with aircraft noise\u201d.\nBased on these guidelines and existing surrounding developments, providing residential development within the vicinity of airport operations can be safely achieved. As such, and in accordance with Transport Canada policies, we are suggesting the new PPS include the following noise policies to allow for residential development up to the 35 NEF with the same conditions as contained within the above referenced Transport Canada guidelines.\nThe previous letter provided suggested policy changes to Section 3.4 of the PPS. After further time and deliberation, we are proposing enhancements to our original policy suggestions to clarify our position and allow for urban uses such as infill residential to be permitted in appropriate locations next to airport facilities. This is essential to enable housing to proceed in alignment with Provincial policies without compromising airport operations.  Please see the proposed amending language to Section 3.4 Airports, Rail and Marine Facilities below.\n\u201cSection 3.4 Airports, Rail and Marine Facilities\n2. Airports shall be protected from incompatible land uses and development by:\na) Regulating new residential development and other sensitive land uses in areas near airports above the 30 NEF\/NEP;\nb) considering redevelopment or infilling of sensitive uses, including residential uses, in areas above the 30 NEF\/NEP only if it has been demonstrated that there will be no negative impacts on the long-term function of the airport;\nc) discouraging land uses which may cause a potential aviation safety hazard; and,\nd) Considering infilling or redevelopment for residential and other sensitive uses above the 30 NEF\/NEP if the responsible authority is satisfied that:\ni)\ta noise impact assessment study has been completed that demonstrates that aircraft noise can be appropriately addressed;\nii)\tappropriate noise mitigation measures have been incorporated in the building design, and construction; and,\niii)\tthe developer will be required to inform all purchasers and prospective tenants of aircraft noise above the 25 NEF\/NEP.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nThis submission is intended to provide further information to the Ministry in consideration of the new proposed PPS planning document. It is the hope of the UWSLG that the above comments will assist in the Province\u2019s changes and implementation to the new PPS planning document. Should there be any questions or a need for further information, feel free to reach out to the below.\nSincerely,\nJohn Corbett\n__________________________________\nJohn B.

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023, section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments.\nComments regarding section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nI am concerned about proposed s.4.3.3 which permits the severance of three residential lots from parcels in prime agricultural areas. This poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. As it currently reads, this policy could apply to any parcel of agricultural land, regardless of its size or whether it was previously severed before January 2023. Given that there are 48,346 farms4 and as many as 170,000 farmland properties in Ontario5, the province could see anywhere from 145,038 to 510,000 lots severed from agricultural properties. Therefore, if each lot is approximately 1-acre in size, this policy alone would be responsible for removing anywhere from 1.25% to 4.3% of Ontario\u2019s finite agricultural land base.\nThe use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays6. While I appreciate that proposed s.4.3.1 states \u201cPlanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach,\u201d this policy does not provide the strength needed to require agricultural systems, and appears to be in contradiction to the permissions of s.4.3.3. When you factor in s.4.3.2.5, which permits up to two additional dwellings in prime agricultural areas, this could result in as many as 1.5 million dwellings on newly severed lots in agricultural areas. This will lead to significant farmland fragmentation, which is contradictory to the purpose of an agricultural system, and will cause significant disruptions to surrounding agricultural operations.\nMoving to rural areas often means embracing the realities of agricultural living, such as noise, dust, odors, and farm equipment on the roads. Unfortunately, this leads to land-use compatibility conflicts that are difficult to mitigate once residential units are developed in agricultural areas. This poses significant challenges for farmers, especially when Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) is not properly followed during development approvals. This is concerning given that Bill 23 prevents third-party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal, making it difficult for nearby farmers to address MDS concerns. Additionally, constructing residential units up to the MDS line will limit any future growth of the agricultural operation, threatening the future viability of animal agriculture in Ontario.\nFurthermore, additional residential units on prime agricultural areas will result in an increase in water usage from underground aquifers. Three additional lots, including three additional residential units would put a significant strain on the water usage and increase the likelihood of water source issues for both the residents and the agricultural operation. Agriculture uses significant amounts of water to irrigate crops and provide water to livestock. Although a large percentage of water is returned to the source, often it has been changed and carrying soil and dissolved compounds7. With less water available in the aquifer, any contaminants will be more concentrated. Therefore, permitting three lot severances in prime agricultural areas will have significant implications for water availability and safety.\nBy permitting lot severances, the province will be impacting the financial accessibility of farmland for the next generation of farmers, making farming less financially viable. Each farm property will likely increase in price relative to the value of three vacant lots in the respective region. Ontario experienced a 19.4% increase in property values in 20228, making it unattainable or financially unfeasible for many young farmers to buy land. The proposed severance policies will incentivize developers, who can outbid young farmers, to purchase farmland or provide cash incentives for farmers to sever lots, contributing to the increase in farmland prices. This will result in the next generation experiencing a fragmented agricultural system and keeping ownership of farmland out of their reach. This is concerning because if the next generation of farmers cannot afford to farm, and experience it as increasingly difficult to farm, the province will not have a viable agricultural sector for much longer.\nI have noticed that the new proposed PPS 2023 states in policy 4.3.1.2, \u201cAs part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d However, permitting lot severances for residential use contradicts lands being designated for the long-term protection for agriculture.\nI believe that the proposed s. 4.3.2.5, which would allow two additional units on existing farm properties, could be significant in providing housing opportunities for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. Similarly, the proposed s. 2.2.1.b.2 allows more land for housing by converting existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use. Given these other proposed policies permitting additional housing and the significant concerns over the proposed lot creation policies, I question why there is a need to permit such a significant allowance for severances.\nFurthermore, permitting these severances is in contradiction to proposed s. 2.2.1.c, \u201cpromoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation.\u201d S.4.3.3 will not promote efficiency in these areas and will detract from the intentions to support intensification.\nI believe that municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising between non-farming residents and the agricultural community. However, proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being more restrictive, which could be vital for preventing these types of conflicts. For rural communities whose economies and culture are intricately associated with agriculture, s.4.3.3.2 will prevent municipalities from protecting a key component of their communities and is contradictory to the content on page 3 that states the PPS 2023 recognizes the diversity of Ontario and that local context is important. S.4.3.3.2 restricts rural municipalities from ensuring the local context of their agricultural system is protected from farmland fragmentation.\nI, therefore, urge the province to consider these concerns and remove s.4.3.3 in its entirety so that the proposed changes do not harm the province\u2019s agricultural lands and the farmers who depend on them. The province should require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping and allow municipalities to implement additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and prevent conflicts with non-farming residents.\nThank you for considering our submission, and I look forward to the province\u2019s response.\nSincerely,\n(your name \/ organization name)\nReferences:\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"I oppose the new Provincial Planning Statement which replaces the provincial policy statement, and the growth plan for the greater Golden horseshoe growth plan.  In this time of climate emergency, the PPS does not address the needs of maximizing  farmland areas, natural areas, and environmentally sensitive areas. In addition the PPS financially overburdens munipalities  because it restricts development fees municipalities can collect from developers.\nThus the PPS negatively impacts Ontarions because:\n In this time of climate emergency, the PPS allows for excessive loss of farmland, natural areas, and environmentally sensitive areas.\nThe PPS encourages urban sprawl to spread into the vital farmland, natural areas and environmentally sensitive areas of Ontario\nThe   PPS falsely claims it creates enough new housing to meet needs in Ontario. In reality the PPS provides a for high-end housing and does not recognize that the missing middle as well as affordable housing are not provided for.\nIn the PPS there is an obstinate refusal to acknowledge that documented evidence shows Ontario currently has enough urban land  to build upon to satisfy the needs of our housing crisis . I clearly observe that the PPS, in effect, allows developers to profit from valuable Ontario lands. However, the PPS does not provide for the need to create affordable housing and to resolve the housing crisis in Ontario.\nSeveral major urban municipalities in Ontario have democratically developed and adopted official plans that provide for sustainable, affordable housing in communities which will meet our needs until 2051.  These plans support urban intensification while including liveable communities with thriving economies, public transit, plans for active transportation (walking and biking), green spaces,  a clean, healthy environment, and social equity. Yet the PPS has disallowed this well documented planning.\nIn addition, the PPS dramatically reduces the powers of conservation authorities to sustain healthy environmental habitats and to proactively regulate for climate emergencies\nThe Ontario government has not allowed adequate public consultation in its development of the PPS. Creating laws without allowing adequate public consultation disrepects our democratic rights. We have the right to seek a democratic resolution to critical issues confronting us.  This characteristic of democracy protects us all. It is apparent to me that as the Ontario government pursues its agenda\/goals, it  is willing to create as many obstacles as possible to healthy, democratic public consultation and input.\nListen to the voices of the people Ontario. There is a critical need for us all to come together to respond to the catastrophes of climate change.\nWith resolve\na voting Ontarion\n",

        "comment":"Regarding Land Use Planning,\nWhile we all understand the current need for housing, not enough is being done to preserve our agricultural and environmental heritage.\nAlthough it is heartening to see there is mention in the plan of protection of sensitive lands, however, definition and political will for implementation seem to be lacking as municipalities (such as Hamilton and Milton) are forced to include prime agricultural land for developers. The new policies force cookie cutter pro-sprawl policies on municipalities -witness what has happened in Hamilton and Milton, for example.\nMore than 75% of our food comes from below the border. As you may remember during the Covid crisis, even though we had contracts and even paid for vaccines, the U.S. government decided to stop shipments to Canada. In a food or political crisis, they could do the same with food. If we lose our farm land, we lose our ability to feed ourselves. Making us very vulnerable.\nIn an era of an increasing climate crisis, it is extremely short sighted to promote further urban expansion. Effects of these decisions will be felt very long term. We should be leaders in the field of preventing climate change, not causing further environmental erosion.\nAs well, in a time of growing world hunger it is unconscionable to be paving over food producing farm land. Development on farmland is irreversible. We in southern Ontario are lucky enough to live in an area blessed with some of the best farmland in Ontario, in Canada, and on the planet itself. This should never to be taken for granted. This is an amazing resource that should be treasured and protected at all costs. This land is the birthright of future generations -ours to protect.\nCurrent housing needs are not an excuse for sprawl planning. The 70s are over. Our plans for land use should be looking ahead to the 21st century.\nThank you.\nA concerned Ontario family\n",

The wording of \"shall\" in Section 4.1-1 is excellent, but then in 4.1-2 the word \"should\" is used.  In Section 4.2-3 the word \"encouraged\" is used.  I feel there is too much leeway for interpretation.\nI also think that there should be requirements for Municipalities\/Counties to pass a Site Alteration By-Law as most of the policies in the Natural Heritage section include the words \"Development and Site Alteration\".  There are by-laws for development but some Municipalities\/Counties use the excuse that they can't stop stream diversions, filling in wetlands or site alterations because they do not have a site alteration by-law, and they are continuously stalling to implement one.  I would like to see this as a requirement in the PPS.\nI would also like to see stronger guidance\/requirements for Municipalities\/Counties in regards to the evaluation criteria and procedures required to prove no negative impacts.  These reports are paid for by the Developers and in our experience have included many errors and overlooked facts.\nI see that \"Provincial and Federal requirements\" are still included but I question the removal of \"Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Foresty\" from the definition of \"Significant\" and it again refers to evaluation procedures.  In my experience these procedures are not followed by some Municipalities\/Counties.\nI would like the PPS to prevent the destruction of our natural environment.\nThank you\n",

        "comment":"RE: Intensification, Municipal Comprehensive Review, and Settlement Area Expansion, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas.

This submission will focus primarily on sections of the proposed PPS 2023 dealing with intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion.\nComments regarding proposed changes to intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion\nI have significant concerns regarding the proposed policy changes found in the PPS 2023 regarding intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion. These policies should ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. However, while the proposed PPS 2023 generally states support for intensification, it does not require targets for municipalities across Ontario and provides many permissions that would undermine attempts at intensification. Additionally, the intensification targets for many municipalities in the Growth Plan have been reduced or removed altogether, which will use up lands in municipal boundaries faster and lead to increased rates of urban boundary expansion. Without the requirement to complete municipal comprehensive reviews, this poses a significant threat to farmland. As noted below, reducing and eliminating density targets is contrary to encouraging complete communities found within the proposed PPS. This will lead to fragmented patterns of development, including when settlement boundary expansion occurs.\nI have noted concerns under s.2.3, Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions. The policy in s.2.3.2 now states that \u201cland use patterns within settlement areas should be based on densities and a mix of land uses\u201d. The province opted to change the language from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d, which weakens the policies that are meant to support intensification. Additionally, the language that states land use patterns should \u201cminimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, promote energy efficiency\u201d and \u201cprepare for the impacts of a changing climate\u201d has been removed.  This is concerning given the climate crisis we are facing and that agriculture relies on healthy and stable ecosystems to produce a consistent supply of quality local food. By removing this language, the province is undermining the future viability of the agricultural sector, the largest sector of the Ontario economy.\nRecommendation 1: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.2 that will require municipalities to adopt land use patterns that support density targets and also minimize negative environmental impacts.\nFurthermore, s.2.3.3 states that \u201cplanning authorities should support general intensification and redevelopment to support the achievement of complete communities, including by planning for a range and mix of housing options and prioritizing planning and investment in the necessary infrastructure and public service facilities.\u201d Once again, the use of \u201cshould\u201d is not strong enough to ensure the deliverables of complete communities. Furthermore, the policy no longer requires planning authorities to identify appropriate locations or take stock of suitable existing sites, eroding the possibility of efficient land use. While I encourage the use of complete communities in the planning framework, the removal of intensification targets will not only have sever impact to farmland but it will undermine the existing urban  planning framework to achieve complete communities.\nRecommendation 2: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.3 that will require municipalities to identify appropriate locations for intensification.\nThe policy on settlement area expansion has also been weakened, which will further threaten Ontario\u2019s prime agricultural land. A major concern is removing the requirement of a municipal comprehensive review that demonstrates the need for expansion. Additionally, the language in s.2.3.4 has been changed from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d which weaken the policy, making it possible for development to occur on prime agricultural lands. While proposed s.2.3.4.b states that applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas, this is a subsection under s.2.3.4 which states planning authorities \u201cshould\u201d consider this. Since the language does require planning authorities to consider this, there is the likelihood of it still occurring. This is also the case for s.2.3.4d regarding impacts on agricultural lands and operations that are adjacent or close to the settlement.\nRecommendation 3: The province should require municipal comprehensive reviews prior to settlement boundary expansion and require the planning authority to demonstrate the need. Furthermore, the province needs to adopt stronger language in s.2.3.4 that ensures the applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas and that prime agricultural areas are avoided to the greatest extent possible as determined through an agricultural impact assessment.\nI have also noted the removal of policies from s.2.6 Rural Lands in Municipalities, in particular, \u201cwhen directing development on rural lands, a planning authority shall apply the relevant policies of Section 1: Building Strong Healthy Communities, as well as the policies of Section 2: Wise Use and Management of Resources and Section 3: Protecting Public Health and Safety.\u201d I suggest that the removal of this policy will undermine the future resiliency of rural communities.\nRecommendation 4: The province should reinstate the policies pertaining to directing development on rural lands that require planning authorities to apply relevant policies that support strong and resilient communities as found in the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020.\nFinally, there is concern pertaining to the language in s.2.1.1 that states, \u201csufficient land shall be made available to accommodate an appropriate range and mix of land uses to meet projected needs for a time horizon of at least 25 years.\u201d As noted above, without improving language and goals pertaining to density targets, it will be increasingly difficult for municipalities to plan accurately for beyond 25 years. This will likely lead to further settlement area expansion to accommodate the likelihood of urban sprawl, which will reduce investments in agricultural operations surrounding urban boundaries.\nRecommendation 5: The province should maintain the current requirement for planning authorities to plan for up to 25 years in order to minimize unnecessary and premature settlement area expansion.\nIn conclusion, the proposed changes to intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion weaken policies that would ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. The use of weaker language and the removal of requirements will lead to increased rates of settlement boundary expansion and further threaten farmland and the agricultural sector. It is essential that the policies are strengthened to ensure efficient land use and protect Ontario\u2019s agricultural operations and communities.\nSincerely,\n(your name \/ organization name)\nReferences:\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"RE: Provincial Agricultural System, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\n(your name \/ organization name)\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"I would like to make a comment on farm residential lot severances. For health and safety reasons it is not advisable to put additional dwelling units into farm homesteads and yards next to the existing farm house. This environment  for health and safety reasons may not be ideal to raise a family with small children. Each year small children are involved in tragic farm accidents that could have been avoided had the child not been playing close to large machinery or farm buildings. A severed off lot in close proximity to the farm operation with out being in the yard is much more desired solution with the sheer size of today\u2019s farms. A dwelling that is severed from the farm is also advisable to avoid any problems due to structural changes of the farm due to unforeseen circumstances the future that would complicate the farm transition to the next generation. Sometimes future career paths may change and a severed house lot may save a lot of legal costs and issues that would arise as a result of any change.\nIn an effort to protect farmland by special interest groups and general farm organizations, the current restrictions on rural severances inadvertently may be creating  a greater loss of farmland then allowing one or two small building lots on farms.  Since there is no supply of one acre lots available to build a house in rural areas, some  buyers are purchasing 10, 20, and 50 acre parcels of land to use as the new building lot. In many cases a house is built in the centre of the field and trees are planted around the lands taking out substantially large acreages of land. If more one acre residential lots were available the loss of entire fields of farmland could be mitigated. There does not seem to be the same concern by the special interest groups in protecting farmland when nature groups that have purchased tens of thousands of acres of prime farmland and planted them into permanent forest cover across Ontario.\nWith slight increases in temperature due to climate change, cropped acreages of agricultural land are increasing in Ontario in Northern and eastern Ontario allowing new crops to be grown in those regions.Farm productivity per unit of farmland is also increasing yields every year and Canada is not at risk of food shortages.\nI encourage to Provincial government to consider allowing up to 3 residential lot severances per farm parcel of land keeping in mind it would be only voluntary for a farm owner to allow a severance on their farm.  Landowners strongly opposed to lot severances would not have to sever off a lot as it would not be mandatory for them to do so.\nSmall townships and rural counties will need and will benefit from additional property tax base  that will help keep existing property taxes in line with neighbouring municipalities to help support the development of municipal infrastructure such as water infrastructure and waste water  treatment for urban centres within the small municipalities.\nThank you\n",

        "comment":"I am strongly opposed to the proposed changes that the provincial government wants to make to the Provincial Policy Statement.  I believe that the weakening of provincial planning rules will result in increased sprawl that will threaten farms, forests, other natural areas, and freshwater sources.  The houses that developers will build in areas that are currently rural will not address the housing crisis because they will be unaffordable for most people and will not be accessible to public transit.  The resulting sprawl will not only add to traffic congestion and Increased emissions, but it will compromise the carbon sequestering and flood prevention that natural areas provide; the long-term food security for Ontario; and the availability of clean water.  There is no question that more housing is needed but research has shown that there is available land in urban areas that already have access to services that are easily accessible.  Recent communication from a spokesperson for the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark stated that \u201cProviding choice to people about the types of homes that are available is important to ensuring the overall livability of our province.\u201d  If the government is really concerned about the \u201coverall livability of our province\u201d, it will reconsider the planned changes to the Provincial Policy Statement so that affordability, access to services, food security, protection of natural areas and the environment are priorities when making policy decisions.\n",

        "comment":"While many of the policies proposed are reasonable there are also a number that are questionable in helping to create sustainable and affordable communities. below are a few points in particular that I take issue with.\n1. Generate an appropriate housing supply\nProvide flexibility for municipalities to allow for more residential development in rural settlements and multi-lot residential development on rural lands, including more servicing flexibility (e.g., leveraging capacity in the private sector servicing\n-  (non-agriculural) rural residential housing is rarely affordable for the average person. It is inaccessible to many and already requires a certain level of wealth (ie lots of time and money spent on car related expenses, ability to buy property). Excessive rural residences also contribute heavily to the fragmentation of farmland and natural areas, and takes away space for parks and outdoor recreation from those in urban areas, especially those who are also most in need of affordable housing. Providing that housing in urban areas would be much more efficient, affordable and practical. Rural settlement areas should be tightly controlled and allowing more of it is simply a bad idea.\nRequire municipalities to permit more housing on farms, including residential lot creation subject to criteria, additional residential units and housing for farm workers\n- Rural settlement areas should be tightly controlled and allowing more of it is simply a bad idea. As per the previous point, this would be a great way to lose farmland. carefully planned housing for farm workers is one thing, but allowing many severances will inevitable fragment farmland.\n2. Make land available for development\n- Hard to choose exactly what to pick out here, but this whole point is kind of out there. As per the housing affordability task force: \"Land\u202fis available, both inside the existing built-up areas and\u202fon undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture.\u201d (p.10)\nThere is plenty of existing land within urban boundaries available for development. Simply expanding them frivolously will create expensive unaffordable sprawl. A study by Neptis found similar results as far back as 2016.\n4. Balance housing with resources\nRequire municipalities to designate specialty crop areas and prime agricultural areas, eliminating the requirement to use the provincially-mapped Agricultural System\nRequire municipalities to protect specialty crop areas and maintain minimum separation distances between livestock operations and houses, and promote an agricultural systems approach to support the agri-food network\nRequire municipalities to facilitate access to aggregate resources close to market and to protect minerals, petroleum and mineral aggregate resources\nRequire municipalities to protect water resources and features and encourage watershed planning\n- all of these goals would be better achieved by the province taking responsibility and protecting exceptional farmland, especially class 1 farmland from development and sprawl. Farmland is incredibly important to the province as a whole and downloading decisions to municipalities on it is a poor idea. A provincial scale approach is needed to protect a provincial scale \"good\"\n- with respect to watershed planning, this is literally the job of the conservation authorities, but other legislation has severely inhibited their ability to perform this function. This goal would be better achieved by giving authority back to the CAs, instead of downloading yet another responsibility down to municipalities.\n",

I have no reasonable expectation of owning a house here. I occupy a rental apartment.  My parents own a farm and if allowed, would sever a lot for my use. This would be life changing.

        "comment":"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on ERO 019-6813 regarding the proposed Provincial Planning Statement. Bill 97 has already received royal assent. It seems wrong that it has while the comment period for some items is still open. This government has already made many drastic changes to land planning policy already and are now doing it again. Even prior to all these changes I heard about how challenging things were from municipal planners(workload with development applications) and after researching some comments from planners and Council members of various municipalities, it seems that this government is not listening carefully enough to what people and lower levels of government are saying. One Councillor I heard said developers  are thrilled among other things but then had to restrain himself. Some municipalities had significant concerns about the definition of employment in employment areas but I see the Province still went ahead. Even the Auditor General Report 2021 it states that the growth plan was done to avoid negative outcomes of sprawl by creating compact, walking, transit supportive cities which protects valuable farmland, natural heritage and improves pollution, health, traffic etc. Yes housing and housing affordability is an issue but it can be done by increasing density in the cities and rural settlement areas which then protect farmland and natural heritage  vital to many ecosystem services. Missing middle housing would be good in many areas which increase density and offers different housing options and perhaps could be built  quicker than other higher density buildings. Compact mixed use cities where people can walk and use transit to everything they need reduces emissions and is less costly in terms of transportation costs. Citizens benefit from lower transportation costs if the city is compact.\nClimate change is an existential threat to humans and biodiversity. There is not enough policy regarding this and by not enforcing density targets and allowing municipalities to enlarge whenever without conditions is wrong and does nothing to address climate change or farmland protection. I believe the current PPS and Growth plan are much better land use documents than what you have proposed. Once again, this government seems to be going backwards in terms of land use policies, the environment and farmland.\nNatural heritage should apply in settlement areas too.\n2.1.4 \"Avoiding development and land use patterns which may cause environmental or public health and safety concerns\" and \"promoting development patterns that conserve biodiversity\" as per the current provincial policy statement should remain. Public health and safety concerns are mentioned in 4.3.3.2. and 2.8.1.4 and 3.6.1b)3 but there are other areas and things than this can be an issue. For example, cemeteries have the same nutrients and pathogens of many of the drinking water threats listed for source water protection but are not included as a drinking water threat. They are also permanent so there should be more criteria for their establishment and should not be allowed in prime agricultural areas unless they are close to the urban centre in strategic growth areas and the proper hydrogeological studies are done.\nThere should be minimum targets for intensification and redevelopment within built up areas as otherwise there is no reason for municipalities to follow that. The preamble states this statement sets the policy foundation for regulating the development and use of land. \u201cShould\u201d and \u201cencourage\u201d or \u201cpromote\u201d is not regulating. It would be far better to say municipalities shall have sufficient lands and mix of uses for a complete community (and compact) for walking and using transit.\n2.4.1-all municipalities should be required to identify growth in strategic growth areas to achieve complete communities not just large and fast growing.  Same with major transit station areas.\nSettlement Areas and Expansions-I agree  that settlement area boundaries can be expanded whenever necessary as comprehensive reviews take a very long time. But they should still have to meet conditions as per current policy and not \u201cshould consider\u201d  There should be density targets for all municipalities and not just large and fast growing for all items not just settlement expansion lands.  There seems to be too many\u201d should \u201cand \u201cencourage\u201d language in this document with means nothing has to be done if municipalities don\u2019t want to. Is that  so no one can appeal decisions? If it is only a should than no one can say they are not following policy which means no one can say they do not conform to provincial policy. Leadership is required.   The Province should direct  municipalities to meet certain targets not let them decide.  This proposal may increase housing but at the expense of other things. This does not benefit the Province as a whole or Ontarians.  The current PPS and Growth Plan with  density targets are much better.  Farmland is a vital finite resource and this government needs to realize how important agriculture and farmland is for the long term needs of its residents and protect it. Supply chain issues during Covid, climate change , soil health,  pricing for fertilizer and fossil fuels all impact farmers.   For the 2016 Census of Agriculture the  loss of farmland in Ontario was  175 acres  per day and and in 2022 that number went up to 319 acres\/day. See link to OFA. In an article in Farmtario titled Senate study connects Canadians to soil health, Senator Rob Black, chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry states \u201cWe need at the federal level, to be always thinking of the sustainability of agriculture, and we can\u2019t do that if, as organizations in the province say, we\u2019re losing 319 acres a day. \u201c That article ended with a quote from him \u201dWe need to feed Canada and the world, and we\u2019re not going to be able to do that if we don\u2019t have the soil health and the capacity to do that.\u201d\n4.3.1.1. The proposed statement says planning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system. Some municipalities having both urban and rural areas do not have the expertise with agriculture. In my experience . many council members and even the planners are not very familiar with MDS or the importance of agriculture. The mapping of the agricultural land base has already been done by the Province(and they do have the expertise) and should remain as in the Growth plan 4.2.6.2. The municipality can then still refine it as per the Guidelines.\nIt will also be a huge mistake to allow the residential lots in prime agricultural areas as per 4.3.3.1a) . There is enough conflict between farmers and non farmers and this will introduce more. It will also limit farm operations for manure spreading and will destroy livestock farmers ability to expand due to MDS. It will cause more development pressure as well. I understand the Province has walked back from this.\nI agree with 4.3.2.5 that two additional units may be permitted subordinate to the principal dwelling but it should not be allowed to be severed from the lot as this leads to the same issues as mentioned above and residential lots. If It is severed then it is not subordinate.  If farmers build additional residences for hired help or family members and then they do not need them they should then have to rent them out which would help the housing crisis  or leave  them empty if they wish. They should not be allowed to be severed.  As they are residences associated with the farm MDS would not apply  for that specific farm*(but would be to other farms)  and there would be no setbacks for manure storage\/spreading etc and could not complain about farm issues-ie dust, noise etc.\n4.3.5 b) should be removed entirely. This is a loophole for developers and municipalities to intrude into prime ag areas and is not needed especially if municipalities can expand their settlement areas at any time. The focus of growth shall be to settlement areas both urban and rural. If municipalities  are to have enough lands for  mixed uses  in strategic growth areas there is no reason for this policy.\nMunicipalities should have to do watershed planning.\nIn the draft section 6.2.2. It says planning authorities\u201d shall\u201d undertake early engagement with indigenous communities and in 6.2.3 are\u201d encouraged\u201d to engage the public. It should be shall for both to be fair. Not having public participation in land planning decisions that will directly impact them makes them resentful especially if they are not included in early involvement as it appears decisions are made without consideration of the public and not transparent. But then again, it has been said before this government does not like the public involved in land use decisions. The public can comment of ERO's. but do you listen?\nI do agree with 4.6.1 that only \u201cprotected\u201d heritage properties shall be conserved.\nI do agree with 4.2\nExtraction in Prime Agricultural Areas- It should be a requirement to  rehabilitate to an agricultural condition.  If that is not possible, then these activities should not occur in prime agricultural areas.\nTransition: There are development applications in the works that have not been completed. All planning documents have been prepared with current planning policy. Those should be allowed to continue to completion.  To insist all decisions by a certain date follow this new policy is such a waste of people\u2019s time and money.\nThe vision for the current PPS is much better. The draft vision says it all. Housing only. Wise use and management of resources will be encouraged? Not leadership language and not what people of Ontario want.  All paragraphs  in the current PPS starting with strong, liveable and healthy communities on page 5 and up to and including strong communities, a clean and healthy environment,\u2026..on page 7 should remain.  To me,  through this draft policy statement that the environment, climate change, farmland, public safety, preventative approach are not priorities and this is just short term thinking for housing and developers. In the current PPS\u201d Taking action to conserve land and resources avoids the need for costly remedial measures to correct problems and supports economic and environmental principles.\u201d  and \u201cThe Province must ensure its resources are managed in a sustainable way to conserve biodiversity, protect essential ecological processes and public health and safety, provide for the production of food and fibre, minimize environmental and social impacts,, provide for recreational opportunities (e.g. fishing, hunting and hiking) and meet its long-term needs,\u201d These were statements Ontarians could live with and be proud of.  I think this draft goes against this.\nThank you\n",

I disagree with anything that allows municipalities more flexibility in developing rural properties.  In many rural areas of the province, we have monster houses being built with long driveways.  This is not appropriate use of our land, resources, and labour.  Let's focus on urban intensification.\n2. Under the Natural Heritage System, section 4.1(3), Ecoregion 5E should also include the identification of Natural Heritage Systems.  I would suggest even further that we should be considering the same provision for Ecoregion 1E to 7E.  I think we would have a better respect for the area that live\/work\/play.\n3. I don't understand Figure 7 and what the Natural Heritage Protection Line is.  It appears it's limited to Ecoregion 5E, but that does not seem correct with Section 4.1.\n4. Section 4.3.3: I disagree with allowing up to three (3) lots to be created on farmland, or prime agricultural land for that matter.  I do agree with intensifying housing units on agricultural lands, but I draw the lines as severances and lot creation.\nSome suggestions for consideration:\nA. Restrict the size of homes. Nobody needs anything greater than 3000 sq.ft., perhaps even 2500 sq.ft. This would save on building materials, labour, and build time.\nB. Create a maximum setback distance for homes and buildings.  This would create better land use and encourage the creation of ecological corridors.\nC. Give people a sense of love and belonging to the natural world. Historically we have not been so disconnected from the environment. But now we run the risk of losing the cultural connection to the earth, water, and sky. We're losing the earth due to urban expansion and sprawl, we're losing our cool clean water resources, and we're losing our sky by illuminating these new developments with light pollution. We are losing are connectedness.\nWith all due respect, listen to the people. We love farmland, we love the Greenbelt, we love healthy ecosystems, and we love Communities that can coexist with all of these.\n",

Once they are gone, they are gone forever.  Building subdivisions, i.e.Urban Sprawl ,  was an idea spawned in the post war world made possible by the automobile, and is frankly, the enemy. Intensification and densifaction within existing urban areas is the only way we should and can make room for more housing. Urban planners assure us we have more than enough land ready for development that there is no need to open up valuable agricultural and ecologically essential land to the ravages of developers and their bulldozers.   We need to make a cultural shift away from the \"Canadian Dream\" of owning a single house on a big lot to one that is common throughout Europe. Smaller homes, communal type settings, access to public services like parks as well as transportation.  Getting the job done also means getting the job right and it is essential that the government ensures it gets done correctly.\n",

These policies should not focus on lot severances in established residential areas as this would promote a tear-down culture and would change the landscape of these residential communities.\n\u2022\tMunicipalities should be required to review their site control plan requirements.  For a family wishing to do a simple addition on their home, the site control plan requirements are currently onerous, time intensive, and cost prohibitive.\n\u2022\tRegarding permitting more housing on farms, and residential lot creation on farms, the following comments are offered:\no\tThe recent Bill\/proposal to allow severance of lots on farm properties should not have been completely abandoned and the reasoning behind the decision to do so does not necessarily reflect the view of all members of the rural community.\nWhile three lots per farm may have been an aggressive approach, consideration should be given to allow for complete severance of one lot per farm.  Long term leasing options for an additional dwelling on a farm property should not be considered.  Leasing additional homes on a solely owned farm property creates challenges with succession, inheritance, or in the circumstance of divorce or partnership breakdown.\n2.\tComments on \u201cMake land available for development:\n\u2022\tDevelopment should be focused on brownfield lands before considering use of greenfield or agriculturally zoned lands.\n\u2022\tConsider opportunities for alternate development on brownfield properties such as construction of agricultural greenhouses.\n\u2022\tSettlement areas should not be permitted on prime agricultural land.\n3.\tComments on \u201cProvide infrastructure to support development\u201d\n\u2022\tConsider creation of a water transit service between Niagara, Hamilton, Toronto and Oshawa as an alternate commuting option between these locations.\n4.\tComments on \u201cBalance housing with resources\u201d\n\u2022\tSettlement areas should not be permitted on prime agricultural land.\n",

I believe that the weakening of provincial planning rules will result in increased sprawl that will threaten farms, forests, other natural areas, and freshwater sources.  The houses that developers will build in areas that are currently rural will not address the housing crisis because they will be unaffordable for most people and will not be accessible to public transit.  The resulting sprawl will not only add to traffic congestion and Increased emissions, but it will compromise the carbon sequestering and flood prevention that natural areas provide; the long-term food security for Ontario; and the availability of clean water.  There is no question that more housing is needed but research has shown that there is available land in urban areas that already have access to services that are easily accessible.

        "comment":"I understand that you are interested in hearing from farmers in Ontario to gauge our reaction to Bill 97 and the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement.\nI am writing to voice my support for the proposal to allow for the voluntary severing of up three lots per farm parcel.\nThere are many good reasons why residential lot creation in agricultural areas does makes sense. Allowing farmland severance on less productive areas of the farm will enhance rural economies and increase property tax base for small rural townships and counties. It will also help in a small way alleviate the housing crisis Ontario currently is facing. Agricultural productivity is increasing and farm land cropped area is increasing especially in Northern and eastern regions that are recording a slight increase in temperatures as a result of climate change. Farm operations are increasing in size and demanding a more skilled workforce that has a preferance to reside closed s to the farm operation without having to reside in the larger farmyards of todays farm units. Simply putting housing in the farm stead itself is not advisable as it becomes a possible health and safety issue for raising a family with small children. A severed parcel slightly away from the farm operation is a much more practical solution in todays modern farm. A young family may desire to have home ownership while they build up equity to buy the farm which may be owned by multiple family members. Skilled modern day farm employees who prefer to live near the farm may also strive to have home ownership while working on the farm.\nRoads and infrastructure already exist in rural areas and do not have to be built which lessens the demand on aggregate mining to build roads and sidewalks.\n Sevrvices such as waste management internet and I ground services already may exist on roads hence lowering the property taxes  for existing property owners.\nLarge farm equipment in use on  todays larger farms has made some small parcels of land non farmable.  This provides infilling opportunities for residential housing on lands no longer being used in agriculture.\nThere are many farmers in rural areas without livestock who welcome the opportunity to have their farm severed into two additional lots., I feel this is good planning for farm transition to the next generation as well as attracting the skilled labour todays farms need to operate. We have a housing shortage in this province and severing farm parcels is a way to ensure farmers have the ability to have the next generation farm and also have a skilled workforce find houses close to their workplace to keep the farm operational.\nRight to farm legislation addresses any concerns farmers may have with non farm folk living in rural areas. Currently 80 percent of the rural population in my County are no longer farming due to farm consolidation and there are very few conflicts with non farmers, Fruit and vegetable growers often sell their produce to their neighbours through roadside stands to make extra income for their families.\nI also support the current and future use of Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) standards to regulate development in rural areas.\nAllowing lot severances enables our children and grandchildren to have the choice to farm and to invest in their house without connecting directly in the farm business. Severed residential lots will protect the future of the farm in the event of unexpected changes in our farm operation and that of our children\u2019s paths from uncontrollable circumstances.\nI respectfully ask that the government to continue with its proposal to allow for the severing of farmland parcels in recognition of the current and future value and importance of agriculture to the province. A voluntary farm lot severance policy will not be engaged in by all family farms however it will help many struggling family farms who may not have the benefit of supply management marketing systems continue to farm for many years to come in the Province.\n",

        "comment":"Minister\u2019s Office, Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing\nCollege Park, 17th Floor\n777 Bay Street\nToronto, ON M7A 2J3\nAttention: Hon. Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing\nDear Minister Clark:\nRE: Forum Asset Management\u2019s comments on the Province of Ontario\u2019s proposed Provincial Planning Statement\nWe express our gratitude for the chance to provide feedback on the proposed Provincial Planning Statement (PPS) announced by the Province of Ontario on April 6, 2023. Forum Asset Management wishes to submit the following comments for your consideration and utilization.\nWe are pleased to observe policy initiatives within the PPS that aim to accelerate housing construction. Our remarks specifically focus on the provisions in the Housing section of the PPS concerning office space conversions, intensification, and student housing supply.\nForum Asset Management is an investor, developer, and asset manager operating across North America for over 25 years. We are the leading provider of Purpose-Built Student Accommodations (PBSA) with approximately 4,000 beds delivered and under construction. Forum Asset Management is also one of the largest owners and developers of student housing in Canada.\nStudent Housing Supply \u2013 A Two Birds One Stone Approach\nForum Asset Management offers our enthusiastic support for the proposed regulation, particularly its emphasis on student housing as a pivotal housing option. The policies outlined in the proposal demonstrate a proactive and well-rounded approach to addressing the housing needs of students across Ontario.\nBy identifying large\/fast-growing municipalities not only in the Greater Toronto Area, but across the Province, and providing specific directives for strategic growth planning, the proposed regulation recognizes the importance of accommodating the increasing student population. The establishment and achievement of minimum density targets for major transit station areas, strategic growth areas, and urban growth centres will facilitate better access to educational institutions and essential amenities, creating conducive living environments for students.\nMoreover, the encouragement to plan for transit-supportive greenfield density targets indicates a commitment to environmentally friendly and sustainable student housing solutions. By promoting the development of diverse housing options, including multi-unit types like laneway and garden suites, low and mid-rise apartments, and multi-generational housing, the proposal addresses the unique requirements of students and fosters inclusive and vibrant communities. While building more housing is the goal, a revisit to the type and size of the housing can help increase supply to a great extent.\nThe requirement for municipalities to implement intensification policies will ensure the efficient use of existing infrastructure, encouraging the development of student housing in areas with adequate amenities and services. This will contribute to reducing commute times and enhancing the overall student living experience. Moreover, adding Purpose-Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) units will address \"two birds with one stone\" as it will provide much needed student housing while freeing up other inventory in apartment buildings and low-rise communities that are gravely needed for families and other demographics.\nFurthermore, we propose that the unit size requirements for student housing be flexible and open to revision, allowing for the development of smaller, more affordable units that can better cater to the specific needs and budgets of students. An example of workable small-unit accommodation in Canada is what the University of British Columbia (UBC) offers. Called \u201cNano Suites\u201d (click here for a link), they include 140 square feet of fully furnished space with high-speed wireless internet, a convertible desk\/bed, a kitchenette, and a 3-piece bathroom.\nTo better serve the unique needs of students, policies regarding parking, parkland, amenity space, and other requirements in PBSA should be targeted specifically to cater to student demands rather than applying a uniform approach based solely on the number of units. Tailored policies can optimize land and resource utilization while accommodating students' distinctive transportation patterns, reducing the need for excessive parking spaces. Additionally, well-designed amenity spaces should be prioritized over quantity of outdoor space to enhance students' living experience, fostering a sense of community and supporting their academic pursuits. Incentives like DC rebates or exemptions and property tax payment abatements can play a role in encouraging the development of PBSA, but careful consideration must be given to ensure compliance with safety, quality, and zoning standards while promoting collaborative efforts among relevant stakeholders.\nUnlocking Housing Potential: Embracing Office Conversions for Stronger Communities, more attainable housing, and Student Accommodation\nOntario finds itself in the midst of a housing crisis, and within the PPS several policy tools have been introduced to address the urgent need for increased housing construction. We endorse the policy guidance aimed at fostering intensification and redevelopment of housing. Forum Asset Management recognizes the significance of coordinating land use planning with housing planning to ensure a comprehensive array of housing options for residents and students, including attainable housing solutions. We are heartened to see the explicit reference to intensity and redevelopment as effective means to augment Ontario's housing supply, thereby promoting higher density and optimal use of land and municipal services \u2013 a principle that Forum Asset Management has actively embraced in multiple development projects.\nIn particular, policy 2.2.b.2, which permits and facilitates \"all types of residential intensification, including the conversion of existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use,\" aligns with our commitment to support various forms of residential intensification, while exercising ever needed sustainable development practices in reusing existing infrastructure. However, we believe that this policy could further incentivize the kind of intensification required to meet the ambitious housing targets and alleviate the housing crisis effectively. A substantial amount of available space, currently locked in as vacant office premises due to increased work-from-home arrangements, presents an exceptional opportunity for housing development. Offices are typically located in dense urban areas with appropriate access to transit, jobs and everyday amenities, necessary pieces to support attainable and student housing arrangements. As office vacancies reach historic highs, the time is ripe to unlock these spaces and transform them into much-needed housing options for all the people of Ontario, including students seeking suitable accommodation.\nBy embracing office conversions for residential use, Ontario can tap into unused potential and bolster its housing supply to address the pressing needs of its citizens and student community faster than a typical approval and ground up construction process. We advocate for a bold and innovative approach that capitalizes on this unique opportunity to create stronger and more vibrant communities throughout the Province.\nWe also extend our support for the removal of Provincially Significant Employment Zones (PSEZ) and the Municipal Comprehensive Review (MCR). Though these tools have been valuable, their unintended consequences have hindered developers' timely delivery of much-needed housing in the Province.\nRecommendations\nIn light of the above items, we propose the following policy language to truly capture every type of residential intensification possible in Policy 2.2.b.2:\n\u201call types of residential intensification, including the conversion of existing commercial, office, and institutional buildings for residential use, development and introduction of new housing options, including student housing, within previously developed areas, and redevelopment which results in a net increase in residential units in accordance with policy 2.3.3;\u201d\nMoreover, we propose the following policy language to enable a more diverse housing type supply, in accordance to the needs and requirements of the market in Policy 2.2.c:\n\u201cpromoting densities through height and unit sizes for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation; and\u201d\nFacilitating and incentivizing the development of small unit sizes and student accommodation, as well as the conversion of vacant office space into different types of housing is a sustainable and quick way to make use of existing resources. Office to residential conversions is a wise policy option that creates less construction waste and represents a lesser burden on municipal servicing than sprawl.\nThank you,\nAly Damji \/ Dayna Gilbert\nManaging Partner, Real Estate \/ Managing Director, Real Estate Development\nCc: \tMr. Ryan Amato (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing)\nMs. Kirstin Jensen (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing)\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\n",

Stop stealing environmental spaces to use for inefficient housing.  We must change the way we live in order to preserve farmland, endangered species and environments.  Any changes that promote inefficient growth - single family dwellings, increase our carbon footprints.  You, clever government planners, know all of this.  Take a brave stand!  Listen to the ubiquitous calls of alarm.  Our ways of growth must be managed with a look to the frightening future to help us all.  We need to eat - don't have our farmlands used for anything except growing food.  We need to share - build houses for immigrants and lower income people that are accessible and affordable. We need to produce less carbon - organize housing closer to job locations.  Build more electric charging stations.  Give us our future back!  If you don't do something, who will? Listen to the calls of alarm instead of dismissing them. Please.\n",

        "comment":"I very strongly object to the numerous proposed changes to provincial planning policy and legislation that would remove environmental protections, discourage intensification and efficient development, and encourage urban sprawl. These changes will not address the need for affordable housing. They are very clearly designed only to benefit developers seeking to profit from the development of the greenbelt and other protected lands.\nThese actions to completely re-set the planning landscape in Ontario with minimal public or municipal input are short-sighted, ill-informed, and will have dire consequences for  Ontarians, Ontario communities, the natural environment and our farmland for generations to come.  In a time when the consequences of climate change are becoming clear, when food security is an issue throughout Ontario, and municipalities are searching for new revenue streams that will allow them to maintain infrastructure, these changes (proposed and some already implemented) will only exacerbate these problems.\nI urge you to repeal Bill 23, and retain all PPS and Growth Plan policies that are designed to curb sprawl and protect farmland and natural areas.\n",

        "comment":"Comments on ERO 019-6813: Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nThe stated reason for replacing the existing Provincial Policy Statement is to address the housing shortage in the Province, i.e. the construction of 1.5 million housing units over the next 10 years. In place of the Provincial Policy Statement the Province intends to introduce a new Provincial Planning Statement.\nThe existing Provincial Policy Statement is a comprehensive set of policies that guide the overall land planning process in the Province, aimed at achieving what is referred to as \u201cGood Planning.\u201d The proposed Provincial Planning Statement is a short-term response to the housing shortage, developed in crisis mode, without necessarily balancing the needs of today with the long-term need to have a livable, sustainable and prosperous Province (country and planet) today and into the future. Furthermore, new housing and associated infrastructure are costly to build, expected to last a very long time and very difficult to modify after construction; we need to do it right the first time. The current Provincial Policy Statement, together with associated provincial plans such as the Greenbelt Plan and the Greater Golden Horseshoe Plan is meant to guide the achievement of these goals \u2013 let\u2019s not replace it without considering the long-tern implications.\nThe aim of Good Planning is to determine the best use for land by considering and weighing the environmental, human and economic needs of society. This requires a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of the pros and cons of possible land uses with the fortitude to avoid options with short term benefits but long term disastrous consequences. This type of process does not seem to be reflected in the proposed changes to the current provincial planning framework. I, therefore, support the broad range of sectors that have offered their comments about:\n\u2022\tthe abolition of regional planning and restrictions to the mandate of conservation authorities;\n\u2022\tland conversion that will turn expanses of natural heritage and even areas of the Greenbelt into housing and expressways;\n\u2022\tsignificant reductions of agriculture land and indeed threats to the future of farming;\n\u2022\tautocratic amendments to municipal official plans that will create sprawl communities that will both exacerbate the climate crisis and increase the potential of municipal fiscal insolvency due to reduced development charges;\n\u2022\ta weak framework for attainable and affordable housing; and\n\u2022\tthe absence of any meaningful public and First Nations consultation on most land use planning initiatives over the last five years.\nI further support the withdrawal of the proposed policies until further analysis is done. This must include both the required reports of indicators on the performance of the current Provincial Policy Statement and extensive consultation.\nThe following are more specific comments on the proposed Provincial Planning Statement.\nPreface \u201cThis proposed Provincial Planning Statement takes policies from both A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe \u2026\u201d Not all policies currently in the Golden Horseshoe Plan would be captured in the proposed Provincial Planning Statement. They should be retained, not abandoned altogether by repealing the Golden Horseshoe Act as is proposed. This includes specifically items dealing with mineral aggregate resources.\n\u201c2.3.1.e Land use patterns within settlement areas \u2026 are freight supportive.\u201d This important requirement should be satisfied by means of bypass roads and other means, not by allowing large transport trucks to use existing urban roads.\n\u201c2.8.1.2 Industrial, manufacturing and small-scale warehousing uses that could be located adjacent to sensitive land uses without adverse effects \u2026\u201d The determination of whether or not adverse effects are likely must be made in advance, by unbiased experts using scientifically based methodologies.\n\u201c2.9.1 Planning authorities shall \u2026 promote green infrastructure \u2026\u201d This should include green spaces, tree planting and other means to reduce the urban heat island effect; cooling centres; etc.\n\u201c4.2.2 Development and site alteration shall be restricted in and near \u2026 sensitive groundwater features\n\u2026\u201d This is a laudable objective but the reality is that the proposed Provincial Planning Statement prioritizes industrial development over all other uses, even in protected groundwater areas \u2013 see for example the comments regarding mineral aggregate resources.\n4.3 Agriculture\n\u201c5.3.5.1 Planning authorities may only permit non-agricultural uses in prime agricultural areas for extraction of minerals, petroleum resources and mineral aggregate resources \u2026\u201d\nUnlike mineral and petroleum resources, mineral aggregate resources are very abundant and distributed throughout the Province. Mineral aggregate resources do not have to be treated like mineral and petroleum resources, extraction of which trumps all other land uses. Furthermore, the proponent-driven process which the Province has instituted, along with the erosion of the role of municipal authorities and potentially impacted citizens, leads to a patchwork of gravel mining operations, fragmentation of prime agricultural areas, degraded environmental conditions and other adverse impacts. This needs to stop and replaced with a regime that allows municipal authorities to:\n\u2022\testablish buffer zones to protect sensitive receptors;\n\u2022\testablish mandatory requirements that aggregate companies monitor and report on air quality and noise levels, prior to and post start-up of operations;\n\u2022\tset limits on the fraction of total land that can be mined at any time;\n\u2022\tset limits on the minimum fraction of mined land that is not rehabilitated at any time; and\n\u2022\testablish requirements that community facilities (e.g. public parks, playgrounds, community gardens, naturalized areas) be created by pit owners and donated to the municipality as part of the rehabilitation phase.\nThe requirement that lands mined for aggregate be rehabilitated and returned to agricultural use (see below) generates an unjustified belief that gravel mining is an interim land use without long-term consequences to the land\u2019s agricultural capacity and the Province\u2019s sustainability. The fact is that, as the Ontario Land Trust points out in a 2022 letter to North Dumfries Mayor Foxton: \u201c\u2026 removing huge quantities of rock and gravel results in permanent changes to hydrology and soils, and thus to the conditions which support particular crops and plant and animal life. Humans are simply unable to recover the agricultural and biodiversity values and the ecological functions that are lost when aggregate extraction proceeds. Rehabilitation must not be used to justify aggregate extraction in prime agricultural land and significant natural features.\u201d\n4.5 Mineral Aggregate Resources\n\u201c4.5.2.1 As much of the mineral aggregate resources \u2026 shall be made available \u2026 close to market \u2026\u201d\n\u201c4.5.2.4 Mineral aggregate resources shall be protected from development and activities that would preclude or hinder their expansion \u2026\u201d\nThese provisions reflect the complete lack of reciprocity between aggregate resources mining and alternative land uses such as agriculture and housing. This is unwarranted because of the abundant and widespread distribution of gravel across the Province. As mentioned earlier, this is not conducive to Good Planning. As a minimum, the Province\u2019s Land Compatibility Guidelines, which classify gravel pit operations as Class 3 industrial facilities should apply to gravel pit siting. The Guidelines recommend that such facilities be separated from sensitive receptor by a 1km buffer.\n\u201c4.5.3.1 Progressive rehabilitation shall be required to accommodate subsequent land uses, \u2026and to mitigate negative impacts to the extent possible \u2026\u201d\nThousands of former gravel pits are now classified as legacy pits and quarries, without being rehabilitated by their owners. This further highlights the nonreciprocal nature of the way aggregate operations are licensed and overseen, relative to other land uses. The Province needs to establish time limits on the validity of new licenses, require a security bond from proponents as a condition to approve new licenses, and strengthen enforcement efforts, including using the security bond to rehabilitate the mined areas should the operator abandon the site or leave it dormant.\n",

        "comment":"Submission to the Province of Ontario, Environmental Registry of Ontario\nThe Leaside Residents Association (LRA)\nRe: Proposed Provincial Planning Statement \u2013 ERO posting 019-6813\nLeaside is a residential and industrial\/business community in Toronto.  Over the past 110 years, the Leaside Business Park has been a major employer in the medium to heavy industry sectors. From the production of munitions in WW1, to auto production in the 1920\u2019s and 30\u2018s, to radar and optical instruments in WW2, and from adhesive and chemical production, cement and concrete making to hardwood flooring and electrical engineering, the Park has endured.\nThe juxtaposition of business park and residential communities has been of great public benefit. It is important to maintain highly skilled jobs that are also closer to home, reducing traffic, and the need for even more private vehicles pumping out more CO2. This plays to the environmental challenges we face.\nUp to now the Business Park has been protected though Official Plan policies and zoning bylaws, and Ontario Municipal Board decisions that have respected the Employment Lands boundaries and policies therein. However the Provincial proposal to consolidate two major planning documents in Ontario: A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (Growth Plan) , 2020 and the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 appears to endanger this.\nThe proposed merged documents will form the basis for the Province to achieve its housing objectives. Unfortunately, the document fails to set a foundation to achieve the Province\u2019s vision of a complete community that provides employment, community services, and all housing types to meet the current and future needs of Ontarians.\nWe recognize the need to expedite the planning processes, address housing\nshortages (especially affordable housing) and protect employment lands, however we have the following concerns about the proposed Provincial Planning Statement and its ability to achieve the vision of the plan. We have included some suggestions to aid in improving outcomes for the plan.\nKey Areas of Concern\n1. The Provincial Planning Statement does not define affordable housing, and does not bring forward targets for affordable or rental housing. Nor are there any new tools being considered for municipalities to require affordable or rental housing within development plans. The plan misses the mark on the core housing issue \u2013 which is affordability - not just supply.\nLRA recommends:\n\u2022\tthat targets be set for affordable and rental housing, and\n\u2022\tthat the Province should provide municipalities with tools to require affordable and rental housing.\n2. Municipal Comprehensive Reviews would no longer be required, creating open season on employment conversions, creating uncertainty for employers, and reducing future opportunities for Ontario businesses to grow within their markets.\nLRA recommends:\n\u2022\tthat the Municipal Comprehensive Review needs to remain and be improved with a focus on the protection of Ontario businesses located within employment and business districts using the same timeline as the 5-year Official Plan Review.\n3. Employment Area definition changes may result in loss of businesses and impair the\nfuture growth of those businesses. The Provincial Planning Statement is\nrecommending the removal of office, institutional and film production industries from\nEmployment Areas which is, in our opinion, short-sighted and will have negative\nconsequences for those businesses and for Ontario as a business location. We need to give businesses certainty of operations and opportunities to grow in Ontario.\nLRA recommends:\n\u2022\tthat the Employment Area definition should explicitly include clusters of office uses, film production, institutional uses, and stand-alone convenience retail and services to support businesses and their employees within Employment Areas.\n4. Employment targets and business locations are being sacrificed for housing at any cost, anywhere.\nLRA recommends:\n\u2022\tthat the Province needs stronger land use policy protections for all Employment Areas across the Province. The policies need to be strengthened to ensure that these lands support the economy and are viable over the long-term.\n\u2022\tthat when conversions of employment lands occur, municipalities\nshould be provided with the following:\n- conditional zoning that would enable municipalities to secure employment\nspace prior to or concurrent with residential developments that would replace\nlost jobs as result of the conversion\n- permit zoning conditions that would secure replacement employment space\nas part of redevelopments proposing to convert existing commercial and\ninstitutional space.\n\u2022\tthat the Province consider securing additional employment lands to meet employment targets of a growing population. You cannot afford housing without a job and not everyone will be working from home.\n5. The proposal eliminates the provincial mapped Agricultural System and permits\nadditional residential uses in agricultural areas.\nLRA recommends\n\u2022\tthat the environmental, climate change and local food production impacts need to be considered holistically for the Greater Golden Horseshoe before decisions on eliminating prime agriculture lands are made\n",

        "comment":"Minto generally agrees with the province\u2019s policy direction of the new Provincial Planning Statement which eliminates unnecessary duplication of policy from the former PPS and Growth Plan. Many of the policies of the former Growth Plan plan were restrictive in terms of meeting its own growth targets.\nRequiring large\/fast-growing municipalities to be subject to growth management-related policies as outlined in the draft PPS is a more practical and appropriate approach as one Planning Statement can be made applicable province-wide and at the same time not inhibit smaller or slower-growing municipalities.\nThe draft PPS states \u201cAt the time of each official plan update, sufficient land shall be made available to accommodate an appropriate range and mix of land uses to meet projected needs for a time horizon of at least 25 years, informed by provincial guidance. Planning for infrastructure, public service facilities, strategic growth areas and employment areas may extend beyond this time horizon of each official plan update, sufficient land shall be made available to accommodate an appropriate range and mix of land uses to meet projected needs for a time horizon of at least 25 years, informed by provincial guidance. Planning for infrastructure, public service facilities, strategic growth areas and employment areas may extend beyond this time horizon.\u201d\nWe believe that this planning horizon is appropriate and will make it easier to meet Ontario\u2019s housing needs. We also believe that the province should continue to prepare forecasted minimum population and housing targets for those larger and faster-growing municipalities as previously mandated in the Growth Plan toward the Province\u2019s minimum housing targets to 2031 and require that these municipalities demonstrate in their official plans how these targets will be met within the timeframes stipulated in the PPS. As Official Plans are typically reviewed every 5-10 years, Minto urges the province to make clear that the implementation of the proposed PPS 2023 will take immediate force as it relates to all municipal decisions, including zoning by-laws and permitting processes, even before a municipality\u2019s Official Plan has been updated.\nThe PPS should also be more specific about enhancing minimum intensification targets throughout the entirety of any municipality\u2019s settlement area boundary so that all areas with opportunities are supported for various and less intense infill development that may otherwise be opposed by local anti-growth sentiment.\nAffordable and attainable housing criteria must also be defined and the Development Charges Act revisions need to be reflected in the new PPS accordingly. Clarification is also required to the extent that additional residential units are to be encouraged and supported in various forms of housing including single, semi-detached and townhomes and that these units facilitate the provision of purpose-built affordable rental housing. Planning Act permissions are already reflective of this, and the PPS should be consistent with these.\nWe have concerns about what appears to be an omission of appeal rights for private applications as per Settlement Areas (Section 2.3). This omission could give municipal governments a tool to blunt desperately needed housing developments. As such, we are deeply concerned that any municipal council that is anti-growth could oppose any of these applications and builders would have no recourse. We believe this runs exactly opposite to the province\u2019s goal of getting more homes built faster, with local governments that oppose new housing having more tools to keep newcomers out. Therefore,\nMinto urges the government to include appeal rights for private applications on municipal decisions not to expand a settlement area or municipal failures to consider such an application in a reasonable time. Similarly, we are concerned about the lack of appeal rights on an application for an employment land conversion (Section 2.8). We are concerned that this could stunt growth and deny opportunities for homeownership. With changing patterns of office use and increased interest in mixed-use development, employment land conversion is an essential source of land for residential development. The province should ensure that it is supporting conversions that unlock badly needed residential development by ensuring that projects that align with provincial priorities can access the Ontario Land Tribunal if needed.\nFurther, we believe that Ontario and its aspiring homeowners would be well served by the province investing more resources into the OLT and\/or by further streamlining it, such as by screening appeals for merit and ensuring faster decisions. We also urge the province to communicate what actions it will take to enforce the Municipal Act and to ensure that municipalities act in ways consistent with helping the province achieve its homebuilding targets.\nSection 3.1(2) of the proposed PPS states that Planning and investments in infrastructure and public service facilities should be prioritized to support strategic growth areas as focal areas for growth and development. There must be fairness for aspiring homeowners who cannot afford to live in major hubs or who may wish to live in settings they deem more appropriate for their families and or other needs. We, therefore, urge the province to consider modifying this language in the PPS to ensure that infrastructure funding for greenfield subdivisions receives equitable attention, priority, and investment.\nDirection to utility providers must be provided to ensure their integration and coordination with municipalities from a planning perspective so that future service planning supports and facilitates forecasted growth and the delivery of housing. Legislative and policy changes need to be considered by the province to this effect. In addition, municipalities should be required to prepare master planning and be held accountable for infrastructure delivery mechanisms including mandated updates of Master Servicing and Transportation Plans, Capital Budgets, and Development Charge Background Studies and Development Charge By-laws to accommodate planned growth.\nWe strongly support the use of alternative servicing solutions to enable development in areas where typical full municipal servicing solutions are not viable.\nIn addition to forward planning infrastructure investment policies supporting planned growth, the following should also be considered:\n\u2022 Policies that encourage the provision of passive recreation activities including trail systems within gas\/hydro and other utility corridors where appropriate\n \u2022 Floodplain mapping and associated modelling in urban areas should be prepared to account for proposed growth, including stormwater management facilities and flood mitigation work in these areas. It is not appropriate to assume a no-mitigation approach to flood plain modelling in an urbanizing area. This approach should be incorporated into the policies of the new PPS and in related guidance material from the province.\n\u2022 We strongly support the policy direction to require school boards to integrate planning for schools and growth; the policies should specifically speak to the minimization of school sites sizes when collocated with parks and should strongly encourage the provision of schools in mixed use formats, including within multi-storey residential buildings.\nLastly, we believe that more clarity is needed in the language on Rural Land in Municipalities. To\nminimize potential conflicts with agricultural uses and existing or new residential areas, guidance should be given that generally encourages municipalities to designate lands rural abutting residential areas and settlement area boundaries. This can serve as a transitional area between urban and prime agricultural areas, providing uses that can serve both areas.\nThe proposed environmental protection policies should be provided in the context of a \u2018Housing First\u2019 policy goal and objective which should be added to the PPS for development within settlement areas. An urban lens should be provided for environmental protection in settlement areas, generally directing that the natural function of environmental features should be preserved through green infrastructure in urban areas. Such policies would support the provision of housing through the efficient use of land and is to ensure housing in settlement areas takes priority over other competing policy objectives.\nWe believe it is important to implement modifications to the natural heritage polices to enable our industry to create healthier communities more efficiently and effectively. Policy should look to shift from the no negative impacts test to a no net negative impact test for natural heritage features and associated functions. The formal adoption of an ecological offsetting approach to allow for the selective removal of generally smaller and degraded natural heritage areas with limited functions would allow for removed features to be replaced, achieving a net ecological gain (i.e., nature positive outcomes).\nIncluding general policies for implementation and interpretation of the PPS is critical to ensuring the policy direction of the province is met. As the Planning Act currently requires that all decisions be consistent with the PPS, the purpose of policy 6.1.7 and the province\u2019s direction to municipalities respecting updates to their official plans is unclear.\nWe thank you for the opportunity to provide our comments and trust you will consider the same in any new iteration of the Provincial Policy Statement.\n",

We note that Ontario implemented significant document revisions on 16 June 2023, however, this was done with less than fifty days within the comment period deadline of 4 Augst 2023.\nExecutive Summary\nCOO respectfully submits that the proposed actions of Ontario under ERO 019-6813 will give rise to serious harms with respect to the rights of First Nations peoples and communities, First Nations treaty rights, and that such actions towards First Nations funerary remains and related objects are not consistent with Ontario and Canada\u2019s legal obligations regarding the protection of the rights of First Nations.  The Crown\u2019s legal obligations are based upon domestic and international law.\nIn its current proposed form ERO 019-6813 offers no definition, direction, protection, or management with regard to the respectful and dignified treatment of First Nations remains, related funerary objects, sacred and cultural artifacts, and any other objects of cultural patrimony belonging to First Nations.  Simply put it is silent on all fronts \u2013 silent definitions with respect to First Nations, First Nations traditional, ancestral and treaty territory, and it fails to specify objectives, process, and enforcement in regard to the subject matter.\nIn Ontario, there is no positive law, regulation or enforcement mechanism that imposes a strict standard on land developers or provincial bodies to address the issue of First Nations funerary remains and related objects.  Ontario\u2019s response is a patchwork of policies and in this regard ERO 019-6813 continues the practice.  Much of the decision-making at the point of contact occurs at the discretion of the developer and the patchwork policies within the planning and permitting process leaves mandatory consideration with regard to the rights of COO\u2019s constituents.\nPPS 2023:  no protection, no enforcement, no mechanism for First Nations\nBy way of background, the updated 16 June Proposed Provincial Planning Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023), specifies the mission of the proposed review process.  The preface at page five reads in part:\nThe Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MMAH) is seeking input on proposed policies for an integrated province-wide land use planning policy document. This proposed Provincial Planning Statement takes policies from both A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 to support the achievement of housing objectives across Ontario.\nThe Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 is issued under the Planning Act and is the primary provincial land use planning policy document, applying across Ontario. A Place to Grow is a growth plan issued under the Places to Grow Act, 2005. The Province is now seeking input on a proposed Provincial Planning Statement that would replace the existing Provincial Policy Statement and A Place to Grow.\nPPS 2023 will have a direct impact on development planning and land use in the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH).  PPS 2023 is intended to streamline and quicken the pace of residential permitting and construction.  Likewise, it plays a pivotal role as precedent setting policy-making and will influence land use planning standards across Ontario pursuant to the Planning Act.  Moreover, the GGH covers a vast area of First Nations treaty territory.\nThe treatment of First Nations archaeological, burial, and sacred sites, including the protection of such sites is absent in PPS 2023.  First Nations are not defined or referenced and PPS 2023 does not define an indigenous community in Ontario.  After 16 June 2023, Ontario announced revisions in PPS 2023 and it is notable that the definitions were again silent.\nFor example, at page fifty PPS 2023 identifies twenty-nine key municipal and metropolitan areas within GGH that are the focus of development.  These designated large and fast-growing population centres are located on First Nations treaty territory (see Appendix 1 and 2).\nCOO concerns and objections to PPS 2023\nThe concerns and objections by COO to ERO 019-6813 and PPS 2023 are as follows:\n\u2022\tPPS 2023 omits reference to the following terms of reference:\n(a)\tFirst Nations, First Nations rights, First Nations treaty rights, First Nations funerary and or human remains, First Nations cultural and or spiritual artifacts;\n\u2022\tPPS 2023 does not reference reconciliation a basis for First Nations-Crown consultation.  Ontario courts have recognized reconciliation and it is appropriate when considering First Nations funerary remains and cultural objects in the course of Ontario\u2019s reform to land use and permitting on First Nations treaty lands.\n\u2022\tFirst Nations have a right to be defined in accordance with their traditional, ancestral, and treaty territory.  First Nations are not a mere plurality of \u201cindigenous communities\u201d.  First Nations have (a) treaty territory and (b) traditional as well as ancestral territory.  These latter categories of territory will include buried and or submerged remains and objects that fall within First Nations patrimony.  These categories recognize the territorial consequences European settlement had upon First Nations.  Examples of this occur within GGH in light of the traditional and ancestral territories that subsequently changed following the establishment of British North America and the events surrounding the American Revolutionary War.  Haudenosaunee and Annishnabe ancestral sites overlap within GGH.  Likewise specific First Nations communities were relocated to reserve lands and were forced to leave behind their patrimony within their ancestral territory.\nIn this respect, COO strongly opposes the terms of reference and implications contained in section 4.6 Cultural Heritage and Archeology.  Accordingly, section 4.6 ought to be revised to include the following:\n1.\tProtected heritage property, which may contain built heritage resources or cultural heritage landscapes, shall be conserved.  This includes First Nations protected sites within their ancestral and territorial boundaries as well as their treaty territory.\n2.\tPlanning Authorities shall not permit development and site alternation on lands containing archeological resources and or areas of archaeological potential unless the archaeological resources have been conserved.  This subsection requires the agreement of affected First Nations communities and applies to both traditional, ancestral, and treaty territory.\n\u2026\n5.\tPlanning authorities shall consult with First Nations communities throughout the development proposal and permitting process.  Agreement with the affected First Nations community is required to fulfil the goal of identifying, protecting and managing archaeological resources, built heritage resources and cultural heritage landscapes that are within the patrimony of the First Nations.  This includes permitting within traditional, ancestral, and treaty territory of the impacted First Nation.\n\u2022\tPPS 2023 makes no attempt to provide a process for the respectful and dignified treatment and return of First Nations funerary remains, related objects and sites, and artifacts.  This omission results in a failure by Ontario to empower First Nations and development stakeholders to pursue early resolution and a plan of action.  Likewise, the same objection is raised with respect to the lack of an enforcement mechanism to protect First Nations rights.\n\u2022\tCOO objects to PPS 2023 and a land development process that will cause irreparable harm to First Nations well being and First Nations identity via the destruction and harm to their ancestral and patrimonial linkages.  First Nations well being includes physical, mental, and spiritual well being in the context of respectful and dignified treatment of First Nations ancestors and related artifacts.\n\u2022\tAn example regarding the discretionary approach of PPS 2023 is in the last paragraph of preamble, starting at the very bottom of page:\nThe Province\u2019s rich cultural diversity is one of its distinctive and defining features. Indigenous communities have a unique relationship with the land and its resources, which continues to shape the history and economy of the Province today. Ontario recognizes the unique role Indigenous communities have in land use planning and development, and the contribution of Indigenous communities\u2019 perspectives and traditional knowledge to land use planning decisions. The Province recognizes the importance of consulting with Aboriginal communities on planning matters that may affect their section 35 Aboriginal or treaty rights. (emphasis added)\n\u2022\tCOO submits that the Crown\u2019s duty to consult is determined by the nature of the First Nations\u2019 right at issue.  Respectfully, the undignified treatment and removal of First Nations ancestors without any comprehensive consultation process is not merely a \u201cplanning matter\u201d but directly impacts the integrity, well-being, and identity of First Nations peoples.\n\u2022\tCOO asserts that consultation must be meaningful and comprehensive.  For example, PPS 2023 excludes First Nations perspectives and participation in the development assessment of a natural heritage system.  Defining permissible development within NHS does not include consideration First Nations treaty rights nor does it provide for consultation with respect to First Nations generally.  PPS 2023 reads at page forty-two:\nNatural heritage system: means a system made up of natural heritage features and areas, and linkages intended to provide connectivity (at the regional or site level) and support natural processes which are necessary to maintain biological and geological diversity, natural functions, viable populations of indigenous species, and ecosystems. These systems can include natural heritage features and areas, federal and provincial parks and conservation reserves, other natural heritage features, lands that have been restored or have the potential to be restored to a natural state, areas that support hydrologic functions, and working landscapes that enable ecological functions to continue. The Province has a recommended approach for identifying natural heritage systems, but municipal approaches that achieve or exceed the same objective may also be used.\nRecommendations:\nIn light of the seriousness with regard to PPS 2023 omissions, COO recommends the following:\n\u2022\tOntario must act upon the binding articles of United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), in particular articles 11, 12, and 31 and undertake reform legislation on repatriation with full and meaningful participation of Ontario First Nations.\nCOO recommends that this be carried out in a in a manner consistent with the recommendations of the UN Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP).  Specifically, Ontario must refer itself to the state obligations set forth in paragraphs 87 and 88 of EMRIP\u2019s 2020 publication, \u201cRepatriation of ceremonial objects, human remains and intangible cultural heritage under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u201d (UN. Human Rights Council. Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, A\/HRC\/45\/35 << https:\/\/digitallibrary.un.org\/record\/3876274?ln=en>&gt;).\nBy way of background, Canada adopted UNDRIP and subsequently enabled it to become part of federal law.  UNDRIP Articles 11, 12, and 31 read:\nArticle 11\n1. Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature.\n2. States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which may include restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.\nArticle 12\n1. Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practise, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites; the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains.\n2. States shall seek to enable the access and\/or repatriation of ceremonial objects and human remains in their possession through fair, transparent and effective mechanisms developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples concerned.\nArticle 31\n1. Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the 23 right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.\n2. In conjunction with indigenous peoples, States shall take effective measures to recognize and protect the exercise of these rights.\nOntario has the opportunity to become a venue for best practices surpassing both Mexico and the United States in the field of First Nations repatriation.  COO strongly encourages that Ontario take seriously and pay close attention to the state obligations described in EMRIP\u2019s findings with respect to recommendations state government responsibilities.\n\u2022\tWith respect to the Planning Act, COO recommends that Ontario implement mandatory First Nations inclusion and participation in the planning process.\nCOO notes that Ontario\u2019s current legal framework is a patchwork of general laws of application and policies that rely largely upon interpretative discretion.  COO recommends these changes to further Crown \u2013 First Nations reconciliation.\n\u2022\tSimilarly, COO recommends the use of mandatory language in the policy reform process and require direct participation by First Nations in the planning process at the municipal level.  COO advises that these recommendations also apply to the \u201cStandards and Guidelines for Consultant Archaelogists and the corresponding Technical Bulletin: Engaging Aboriginal Communities in Archaelogy in Partnership with First Nations\u201d.\nConclusion\nCOO urges Ontario to consider the long-term negative impact of PPS 2023.  Revenue cannot justify infringing and usurping First Nations rights, treaty rights, and First Nations well being.\nOntario and its related governing bodies will reap billions in property tax revenues and related development fees over the next two decades.  This unprecedented housing boom will occur on First Nations treatied territory.  The absence of funding by Ontario is not acceptable in light of the serious issues at stake.  Moreover, on 15 February 2023, Ontario announced that revenues in \u201c2022-23 are projects to be $196.4 billion\u201d, or $16.6 billion more than initially forecasted in 2022  (See: https:\/\/www.ontario.ca\/page\/2022-23-third-quarter-finances).\nCOO submits that it is not acceptable in 2023 to pursue fast track housing that will lead to irreparable harms on the well being of Ontario First Nations.  COO seeks timely clarification from Ontario with respect to its mandate and intention regarding meaningful consultation on PPS 2023 and ERO  019-6813.  COO demands that Ontario act honorably given the serious nature of the harms at issue.\nSincerely,\nThe Kee:Way First Nations Heritage and Burials Working Group and the Chiefs of Ontario\n",

Generate an Appropriate Housing Supply - We are located in a fast growing Municipality where thousands of new jobs will be opening starting in October and continuing over the next few years.  Housing will be number one in this area to house all of the new workers needed.  Allowing farmers to Sever Lots off their properties is key to making the availability of housing work.\n2.  Make Land Available for Development - We need to be looking at long term planning as a whole in Elgin County to make everything come together for the future growth that is about to explode in this area.\n3.  Provide Infrastructure to Support Development - Municipalities need to be planning for the future in the most economically way - starting with sharing Services and Staff.  Sharing large services such as Waste Water Management projects...planning now to accommodate future needs.  Planning road systems for the future increase in traffic flow.  Schools on various corners of the Municipality to look after all housing communities.\n4.  Balance housing with resources - Farmland in our area is mostly used for cash crop - corn\/soybeans\/wheat\/beans - with a few vegetable farms.  Cash crops on a whole are over produced in Canada and thousands of tonnes are exported around the would every year, as we don't consume enough here in Canada.  To use some farmland for housing to benefit the Community as a whole would be a positive for all.\n5.  Implementation - The availability of Lot Severances off of farms and increased housing community development needs to be implemented in Elgin County\/St Thomas\/Central Elgin immediately to accommodate the thousands of people moving into our area for Amazon and Volkswagen.  Working with Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry - but not using this system to put up road blocks to development.\nWe need to allow this process to move quickly - communication should be made directly with farmland tax payers - not just certain association with a few members that speak for the masses - it is time that the people who pay land taxes have a say in what their land will be used for.\nOur area is on the map today with one of the largest auto plants ever to be build in North America.  Let's be a progressive and welcoming community with future Industrial\/Commercial and Residential development.\nElgin we are open for Business!\nThank you\n",

The purpose of this letter is to provide a formal submission as part of the Province\u2019s commenting period in support of the proposed changes to the Settlement Area Boundary Expansion policies of the Proposed PPS.\nThe subject lands are located adjacent to the Bradford Settlement Area in the Town of Bradford West Gwillimbury (Figure 1). Parcel 1 is located at 3329 8th Line with a frontage of 303 metres along 8th Line with a total lot area of 20.8 hectares (51.4 acres), separated by two large parcels from the existing Settlement Area.  Parcel 2 is located at 2914 10th Sideroad with a frontage of 420 metres along 8th Line and 265 metres along 10th Sideroad with a total lot area of 33.8 hectares (83.6 acres). A small portion of the Parcel 2 along 8th Line, is currently located within the Bradford Settlement Area. The subject lands currently accommodate agricultural buildings.\nOn April 6, 2023, the province released Bill 97, the Helping Homeowners, Protecting Tenants Act. Aspart of this Bill, the province proposed a new Provincial Planning Statement (the \u201cProposed PPS\u201d) which will combine and consolidate the current PPS and Growth Plan into a singular provincial land use planning document. On June 16, 2023, an update to the Proposed PPS was released to include definitions and Natural Heritage Policies.\nThe Proposed PPS is intended to consolidate existing policies to assist large and growing municipalities by providing policies that improve and streamline the construction of new housing. The six themes that the Provincial government received feedback on include residential land supply, attainable housing supply and mix, growth management, environmental and natural resources, community infrastructure, and streamlined planning framework. The elements of the PPS and Growth Plan have been consolidated by the Province into the following five pillars indicated in the Proposed PPS:\n1. Generate an appropriate housing supply;\n2. Make land available for development;\n3. Provide infrastructure to support development;\n4. Balance housing with resources; and,\n5. Implementation.\nThe Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MMAH) is currently seeking input on the Proposed Provincial Policy Statement and intends to release the final set of policies for Fall 2023.  The Proposed PPS identifies policies for Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions. These policies include:\n2.3 Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions\n2.3.4 In identifying a new settlement area or allowing a settlement area boundary expansion, planning authorities should consider the following:\na) that there is sufficient capacity in existing or planned infrastructure and public service facilities;\nb) the applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas;\nc) the new or expanded settlement area complies with the minimum distance separation formulae;\nd) impacts on agricultural lands and operations which are adjacent or close to the settlement area are avoided, or where avoidance is not possible, minimized and mitigated to the extent feasible as determined through an agricultural impact assessment or equivalent analysis, based on provincial guidance; and\ne) the new or expanded settlement area provides for the phased progression of urban development\nWe support the above policy which provides flexibility for the appropriate expansion of new or existing settlement areas. It is our opinion proposed policy 2.3.4 captures the necessary requirements to ensure a coordinated and strategic expansion of new or existing settlement areas. The current in-effect Provincial Policy Statement (2020) requires a comprehensive review be undertaken and a criterion to be satisfied (Policy 1.1.3.8), which reduces the ability for available land to be used for development. The proposed policies provide greater flexibility for ensuring more land is available for development.\nThe subject lands are appropriate to be utilized for residential development, and the Proposed PPS policies allow for the greater flexibility to expand the Bradford Settlement Area to include these lands.\nIt is our opinion the greater flexibility for settlement area expansions (new or existing) in the Proposed PPS allows for appropriate land to be utilized for development sooner than if a comprehensive review is required. The Proposed PPS policies recognize the importance of availability of infrastructure, protection of specialty crop areas,  minimum distance separation, impacts to agricultural land and the phased progression of development which ensures the logical and appropriate expansion of settlement areas, without the need for a comprehensive review to be undertaken. We support the proposed Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions policies of the Proposed PPS.\nThank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Proposed PPS. If you have any questions regarding the above comments, please contact the undersigned.\n",

        "comment":"RE: Intensification, Municipal Comprehensive Review, and Settlement Area Expansion, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognizes the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector.  This submission will focus primarily on sections of the proposed PPS 2023 dealing with intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion.\nComments regarding proposed changes to intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion\nI have significant concerns regarding the proposed policy changes found in the PPS 2023 regarding intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion. These policies should ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. However, while the proposed PPS 2023 generally states support for intensification, it does not require targets for municipalities across Ontario and provides many permissions that would undermine attempts at intensification. Additionally, the intensification targets for many municipalities in the Growth Plan have been reduced or removed altogether, which will use up lands in municipal boundaries faster and lead to increased rates of urban boundary expansion. Without the requirement to complete municipal comprehensive reviews, this poses a significant threat to farmland. As noted below, reducing and eliminating density targets is contrary to encouraging complete communities found within the proposed PPS. This will lead to fragmented patterns of development, including when settlement boundary expansion occurs.\nI have noted concerns under s.2.3, Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions. The policy in s.2.3.2 now states that \u201cland use patterns within settlement areas should be based on densities and a mix of land uses\u201d. The province opted to change the language from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d, which weakens the policies that are meant to support intensification. Additionally, the language that states land use patterns should \u201cminimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, promote energy efficiency\u201d and \u201cprepare for the impacts of a changing climate\u201d has been removed.  This is concerning given the climate crisis we are facing and that agriculture relies on healthy and stable ecosystems to produce a consistent supply of quality local food. By removing this language, the province is undermining the future viability of the agricultural sector, the largest sector of the Ontario economy.\nRecommendation 1: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.2 that will require municipalities to adopt land use patterns that support density targets and also minimize negative environmental impacts.\nFurthermore, s.2.3.3 states that \u201cplanning authorities should support general intensification and redevelopment to support the achievement of complete communities, including by planning for a range and mix of housing options and prioritizing planning and investment in the necessary infrastructure and public service facilities.\u201d Once again, the use of \u201cshould\u201d is not strong enough to ensure the deliverables of complete communities. Furthermore, the policy no longer requires planning authorities to identify appropriate locations or take stock of suitable existing sites, eroding the possibility of efficient land use. While I encourage the use of complete communities in the planning framework, the removal of intensification targets will not only have sever impact to farmland but it will undermine the existing urban  planning framework to achieve complete communities.\nRecommendation 2: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.3 that will require municipalities to identify appropriate locations for intensification.\nThe policy on settlement area expansion has also been weakened, which will further threaten Ontario\u2019s prime agricultural land. A major concern is removing the requirement of a municipal comprehensive review that demonstrates the need for expansion. Additionally, the language in s.2.3.4 has been changed from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d which weaken the policy, making it possible for development to occur on prime agricultural lands. While proposed s.2.3.4.b states that applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas, this is a subsection under s.2.3.4 which states planning authorities \u201cshould\u201d consider this. Since the language does require planning authorities to consider this, there is the likelihood of it still occurring. This is also the case for s.2.3.4d regarding impacts on agricultural lands and operations that are adjacent or close to the settlement.\nRecommendation 3: The province should require municipal comprehensive reviews prior to settlement boundary expansion and require the planning authority to demonstrate the need. Furthermore, the province needs to adopt stronger language in s.2.3.4 that ensures the applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas and that prime agricultural areas are avoided to the greatest extent possible as determined through an agricultural impact assessment.\nI have also noted the removal of policies from s.2.6 Rural Lands in Municipalities, in particular, \u201cwhen directing development on rural lands, a planning authority shall apply the relevant policies of Section 1: Building Strong Healthy Communities, as well as the policies of Section 2: Wise Use and Management of Resources and Section 3: Protecting Public Health and Safety.\u201d I suggest that the removal of this policy will undermine the future resiliency of rural communities.\nRecommendation 4: The province should reinstate the policies pertaining to directing development on rural lands that require planning authorities to apply relevant policies that support strong and resilient communities as found in the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020.\nFinally, there is concern pertaining to the language in s.2.1.1 that states, \u201csufficient land shall be made available to accommodate an appropriate range and mix of land uses to meet projected needs for a time horizon of at least 25 years.\u201d As noted above, without improving language and goals pertaining to density targets, it will be increasingly difficult for municipalities to plan accurately for beyond 25 years. This will likely lead to further settlement area expansion to accommodate the likelihood of urban sprawl, which will reduce investments in agricultural operations surrounding urban boundaries.\nRecommendation 5: The province should maintain the current requirement for planning authorities to plan for up to 25 years in order to minimize unnecessary and premature settlement area expansion.\nIn conclusion, the proposed changes to intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion weaken policies that would ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. The use of weaker language and the removal of requirements will lead to increased rates of settlement boundary expansion and further threaten farmland and the agricultural sector. It is essential that the policies are strengthened to ensure efficient land use and protect Ontario\u2019s agricultural operations and communities.\nSincerely,\nG.F.\nReferences:\n[1].

        "comment":"We at Green Earth Village welcome the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed 2023 Provincial Planning Statement policies and look forward to working collaboratively to meet the Government of Ontario\u2019s goal of building 1.5 million homes by 2032.\nFollowing a series of land use and municipal governance changes, the Government of Ontario has recently published a proposal to create a single province-wide land use planning policy with policies adapted from the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 (PPS) and A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (A Place to Grow) 2019.\nMajor changes are required to regulate the complex process to secure the necessary permissions to build housing in Ontario and meet the million new home goal. Green Earth Village and our and partners are highly supportive of the intent of Bill 109, Bill 232, and Bill 97 to address these challenges, and make Ontario the premier place to invest and develop.\nNevertheless, there are some changes and additions that could be made that will unlock developments for families to live in sooner. All the following proposals revolve around time to market, which is key for homebuilder and for reaching the 1.5 million goal.\n1.\tMinister Zoning Orders (MZOs)\nGreen Earth Village supports the use of Minister Zoning Orders (MZO) to expedite development in Ontario. We support the proposed amendments to the Planning Act, introduced by the Helping Homebuyers, Protecting Tenants Act, 2023, most specifically to:\nExempt lands which are subject of Minister Zoning Orders from having to comply with provincial policies and official plans where other approvals have been applied for, similar to the current provisions regarding Community Infrastructure and Housing Accelerator Orders.\nWhile MZOs have traditionally been used by the provincial government in emergency situations, or to quickly advance a major initiative of provincial significance, the current iteration will not in itself empower the Province of Ontario to meet their target of building 1.5 million homes by 2032. In short there is room for MZO\u2019s to go further.\nWe support creating more provincial facilitators, allowing MZO\u2019s to override other planning documents, eliminating the overly prescriptive Growth Plan and restoring the right of appeal on an interim control by-law.\n2.\tLands Need Assessment\nThe Lands Needs Assessment provides a situational analysis of potential population scenarios for Ontario. However, the challenges associated with attempting to make projections related to economic activity and population dynamics over the kinds of timescales which the Lands Need Assessment attempts to cover are virtually insurmountable, and delay construction and building in Ontario, hampering our ability to achieve the 1.5 million goal.\nGreen Earth Village supports allowing a settlement boundary expansion without the need for a Municipal Comprehensive Review (MCR).\nThe Land Needs Assessment methodology previously became a 10-year exercise and needlessly delayed providing land for needed housing. With the proposed change, land can be brought online in a shorter time period \u2013 getting the Government of Ontario to their goal of building 1.5 million homes by 2023.\n3.\tWater and Sewer Services\nBringing on more housing supply necessitates water and sewer services. Green Earth Village strongly supported Schedule 10 of the Bill 23, the More Homes Built Faster Act, to fast track serving approvals in the York and Durham Region.\nGreen Earth Village supports the proposed provision in the Helping Homebuyers, Protecting Tenants Act to reduce duplication in planning for water, wastewater and stormwater infrastructure and encouraging municipalities to plan for the energy needs of growing communities \u2013 however, there needs to be more tenable interim servicing solutions and greater acceptance of those proposed solutions.\nWe encourage the Government of Ontario to consider something similar to Schedule 10 for the remainder of the Province, otherwise there will be a delay in bringing housing to market quickly.\nViable options include the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) allowing municipalities to permit interim servicing solutions to bridge gap while larger regional pipes get permitted, constructed, and commissioned. There are many proven technologies that could be employed on an interim basis. MECP working in tandem with MMAH would have to encourage or mandate their usage and would only be of benefit to reaching the 1.5 million goal.\n4.\tPrioritizing Sustainability\nThe Provincial Policy Statement should explicitly give priority to sustainable communities for planning approvals and servicing \u2013 ones that use significantly less energy, reduce water consumption, reduce waste, and produce a near zero carbon footprint.\nBy transforming our communities with zero-carbon green buildings, we can put Ontario on a path to a more sustainable future and incentivize builders to proactively work toward changes introduced in the 2025 and 2030 National Research Council\u2019s (NRC) Building Code in relation to energy standards.\nConclusion\nIn closing, we would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Provincial Planning Statement. Green Earth Village and our partners look forward to working with you and the Ontario government to achieve its housing targets under a province-wide land use planning policy document that safeguards both short and long-term economic growth, resilience, and sustainability across Ontario.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\nJoy Amyotte\nBSc in Agriculture and International Development\nStudent Foodbank Coordinator | University of Guelph\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"RE: Agricultural Lot Severances, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023).

With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas.

This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023, section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments.\nComments regarding section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nI am concerned about proposed s.4.3.3 which permits the severance of three residential lots from parcels in prime agricultural areas. This poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. As it currently reads, this policy could apply to any parcel of agricultural land, regardless of its size or whether it was previously severed before January 2023. Given that there are 48,346 farms4 and as many as 170,000 farmland properties in Ontario5, the province could see anywhere from 145,038 to 510,000 lots severed from agricultural properties. Therefore, if each lot is approximately 1-acre in size, this policy alone would be responsible for removing anywhere from 1.25% to 4.3% of Ontario\u2019s finite agricultural land base.\nThe use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays6. While I appreciate that proposed s.4.3.1 states \u201cPlanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach,\u201d this policy does not provide the strength needed to require agricultural systems, and appears to be in contradiction to the permissions of s.4.3.3. When you factor in s.4.3.2.5, which permits up to two additional dwellings in prime agricultural areas, this could result in as many as 1.5 million dwellings on newly severed lots in agricultural areas. This will lead to significant farmland fragmentation, which is contradictory to the purpose of an agricultural system, and will cause significant disruptions to surrounding agricultural operations.\nMoving to rural areas often means embracing the realities of agricultural living, such as noise, dust, odors, and farm equipment on the roads. Unfortunately, this leads to land-use compatibility conflicts that are difficult to mitigate once residential units are developed in agricultural areas. This poses significant challenges for farmers, especially when Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) is not properly followed during development approvals. This is concerning given that Bill 23 prevents third-party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal, making it difficult for nearby farmers to address MDS concerns. Additionally, constructing residential units up to the MDS line will limit any future growth of the agricultural operation, threatening the future viability of animal agriculture in Ontario.\nFurthermore, additional residential units on prime agricultural areas will result in an increase in water usage from underground aquifers. Three additional lots, including three additional residential units would put a significant strain on the water usage and increase the likelihood of water source issues for both the residents and the agricultural operation. Agriculture uses significant amounts of water to irrigate crops and provide water to livestock. Although a large percentage of water is returned to the source, often it has been changed and carrying soil and dissolved compounds7. With less water available in the aquifer, any contaminants will be more concentrated. Therefore, permitting three lot severances in prime agricultural areas will have significant implications for water availability and safety.\nBy permitting lot severances, the province will be impacting the financial accessibility of farmland for the next generation of farmers, making farming less financially viable. Each farm property will likely increase in price relative to the value of three vacant lots in the respective region. Ontario experienced a 19.4% increase in property values in 20228, making it unattainable or financially unfeasible for many young farmers to buy land. The proposed severance policies will incentivize developers, who can outbid young farmers, to purchase farmland or provide cash incentives for farmers to sever lots, contributing to the increase in farmland prices. This will result in the next generation experiencing a fragmented agricultural system and keeping ownership of farmland out of their reach. This is concerning because if the next generation of farmers cannot afford to farm, and experience it as increasingly difficult to farm, the province will not have a viable agricultural sector for much longer.\nI have noticed that the new proposed PPS 2023 states in policy 4.3.1.2, \u201cAs part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d However, permitting lot severances for residential use contradicts lands being designated for the long-term protection for agriculture.\nI believe that the proposed s. 4.3.2.5, which would allow two additional units on existing farm properties, could be significant in providing housing opportunities for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. Similarly, the proposed s. 2.2.1.b.2 allows more land for housing by converting existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use. Given these other proposed policies permitting additional housing and the significant concerns over the proposed lot creation policies, I question why there is a need to permit such a significant allowance for severances.\nFurthermore, permitting these severances is in contradiction to proposed s. 2.2.1.c, \u201cpromoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation.\u201d S.4.3.3 will not promote efficiency in these areas and will detract from the intentions to support intensification.\nI believe that municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising between non-farming residents and the agricultural community. However, proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being more restrictive, which could be vital for preventing these types of conflicts. For rural communities whose economies and culture are intricately associated with agriculture, s.4.3.3.2 will prevent municipalities from protecting a key component of their communities and is contradictory to the content on page 3 that states the PPS 2023 recognizes the diversity of Ontario and that local context is important. S.4.3.3.2 restricts rural municipalities from ensuring the local context of their agricultural system is protected from farmland fragmentation.\nI, therefore, urge the province to consider these concerns and remove s.4.3.3 in its entirety so that the proposed changes do not harm the province\u2019s agricultural lands and the farmers who depend on them. The province should require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping and allow municipalities to implement additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and prevent conflicts with non-farming residents.\nThank you for considering our submission, and I look forward to the province\u2019s response.\nSincerely,\nG.F.\n",

        "comment":"Suburban sprawl is an inefficient solution to the housing crisis. Though it may generate some short term economic development, it will ultimately stretch provincial financial resources more thin, as additional roads and highways will create a greater economic burden on the province and tax payers. The destruction of the Greenbelt by developers will also sterilize Ontario ecosystems, putting more species at risk of extinction and removing natural defences against the growing climate crisis. The continuation of suburban sprawl in this province will ultimately rob Ontario of one of its most precious resources; it\u2019s natural beauty. Our province must instead focus on creating more dense, mixed use, walkable communities, while also investing in public transit and bike infrastructure. Infrastructure projects that aim to remove cars and create spaces where people can more readily interact with one another are proven to be more economically efficient and protect our already threatened environment.\n",

These changes would accelerate urban sprawl and the ongoing loss of farmland and natural areas in Ontario.\nA shortage of land is not the cause of Ontario\u2019s housing shortage, as noted by the Housing Affordability Task Force in 2022:\n\"Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (p. 10)\"\nIt is time to listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets.\nThere is simply no need for proposed policy changes which would:\n- Eliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets that were designed to rein in urban sprawl;\n- Allow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time without a comprehensive review of infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland and natural areas;\n- Force municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas;\n- Exempt lands that are the subject of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) from complying with provincial policies and official plans;\n- Remove the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning; and\n- Weaken and eliminate policies intended to address climate change.\nOntario is losing farmland at the shocking rate of 319 acres per day. The proposed new policies will make matters much worse and spell disaster for the lands and waters that sustain us.\nSprawl development will not solve current housing needs, as your government pretends. I urge you to retain all PPS and Growth Plan policies that are designed to curb sprawl and protect farmland and natural areas.\nYours sincerely,\nCiji  Orr\nNew Tecumseth, Ontario, L9R 0B3, Canada\n",

I have reviewed the information, including the attached documents found at the website: https:\/\/ero.ontario.ca\/notice\/019-6813.\nMy responses to the 6 questions to consider are below.\nBut first, In preparation for this comment, I also reviewed the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario Constitution found at: chrome-extension:\/\/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj\/https:\/\/static.ontariopc.ca\/uploads\/2021\/04\/PC_Party_Constitution_Janua\u2026\nThe Principles outlined in this document that I feel are most directly applicable for this conversation are:\n2.1(b) We believe that government should serve the people and that progress requires a competitive economy, which, accepting its social responsibilities, allows every individual freedom of opportunity and initiative and the peaceful enjoyment of the fruits of his or her own labour.\n2.1 (e) We believe that economic freedom, entrepreneurial spirit and the right to private property are essential to economic prosperity and political freedom.\n2.1 (g) We believe that social justice entails equality of opportunity, including fair and equal treatment for all Ontarians and the provision of support to those in need.\n2.1 (h) We believe in and accept our responsibilities for the preservation of Ontario's heritage and cultural diversity and the conservation and renewal of our environment for present and future generations.\nAdditionally, I have reviewed information on the Ontario Land Tribunal at: https:\/\/www.pas.gov.on.ca\/Home\/Agency\/660\nI am a resident of rural Ontario who was raised in one of the areas experiencing significant growth, and currently reside in another that is experiencing significant growth. Both are in southwestern Ontario. Additionally, I have lived in cities that were and are expanding into the surrounding rural areas. As a result, I feel like I have some appreciation for both perspectives. Although, I most identify with and am sensitive to the rural Ontario perspective.\nThank you, in advance, for taking my response into consideration.\n1. What are your thoughts on the policies that have been included from the PPS and A Place to Grow in the proposed policy document, including the proposed approach to implementation?\nWhile I understand the need for increased housing with population growth, I feel that this approach is simplistic and shockingly overlooks the critical barrier the Ontario government has created in an individual's ability to purchase their own property: an environment where an individual or family to the ability to save a downpayment for a house. Without this crucial first step, the Ontario government is actually acting in opposition to the principles of its own constitution, namely:  the ability to enjoy the fruits of one's labour. Many well-earning professionals are restricted in their movement because they cannot afford to move. The FIRST step to supporting a Place to Grow should be to reinstate annual, legal rent increases limits to allow individuals starting out to enable them the capacity to purchase their own home in a fiscally responsible way.\nIt also creates hgue barriers for individuals in rural communities to enjoy the \"fruits of their labours\". Movement within rural communities has become difficult due to huge housing and land cost increases. Developers can buy this land, which drives up the cost of land for farmers. It is difficult for farmers to buy land and easier to sell to developers. This has forced individuals in rural communities to leave the province in search of affordable land. Is this the increased access to housing and land that this government seeks? Access to land for some by driving others from theirs.\nAs rural communities largely support the Conservative Party of Ontario, this shows a large unawareness and insensitivity to their challenges.\n2. What are your thoughts on the proposed policy direction for large and fast-growing municipalities and other municipalities?\nI feel that it downloads the responsibility for infrastructure to the fast-growing communities that have not had an income tax base to support such demands for infrastructure, thereby placing them in a difficult position to overlook the needs of the actual residents in their area and redirect the funds to support the development. This will not create the vital communities outlined in the document. Honestly, it demonstrates a significant lack of understanding of the challenges rural and semi-urban locations face.\n3. What are your thoughts regarding the proposed policies to generate housing supply, including an appropriate range and mix of housing options?\nThis is a good idea in theory and I support it, and the statement of maintaining the \"rural character\" or culture of the local area is critical, but, in my experience, this has not been the case and...I know this is a bold statement....with the Ontario Government being complicit.\nI have observed that often the development of land is created to suit the developer without consideration of the community. For example, I know that in my hometown community, a developer made a proposal to the county council. The council recommended changes so that it would be more sensitive to the community (i.e., spacing of houses, etc., which are actually specifically mentioned in your A Place to Grow document). However, the developer took this to the Ontario Land Tribunal who agreed to the development as the developer originally requested, not according to the requests of the local council (who this document requires to increase the infrastructure, not the government). The government seems to value the needs of those moving into the rural areas more than the people who actually live there.\nThis is a huge oversight and leaves rural areas at risk especially as they are experiencing rapid development (one location had a 15% population increase over one year). They need to be considered too.\nEveryone who I have spoken to in these communities, both my own and those in my home town, say they don't mind people moving in, but it needs to be done sensitively to the culture and layout of the community. This, to date, has not taken place and creates an experience of distrust.\n4. What are your thoughts on the proposed policies regarding the conservation of agriculture, aggregates, and natural and cultural heritage resources?\nHonestly, I believe that the plan is short-sighted, simplistic, and does not understand the issues related to the conservation of agriculture, or our resources. As well, it is quite broad which provides little protection in the future for farmland that has not been specifically designated. This is a serious problem.\nAccess to agriculture is more than just being respectful of sensitive crops or allowing sufficient space between development and such crops. The definition of speciality crops is very restrictive.\nThere are other barriers to agriculture that this document overlooks. As mentioned above, with increased costs of land due to development, then it becomes financially restrictive for farmers to buy land. When that happens, will that result in opening up the land for development? Why is the ability of farmers to enjoy the fruits of their labour secondary to developers?\nBy creeping into agricultural land for development, we reduce the ability to produce food within our own province. This will result in importing foods to meet the demand, and importing foods will likely result in increased food costs. This creates the potential for food insecurity for everyone.\nIf there ever is a drought due to climate change, different areas will keep their own food local for their own residents and will likely not export to other areas, such as the Ontario this policy is creating.\nBuilding on rural lands, and removing the plant and agricultural land increase the risk of said climate change. It takes at least 500 years to create even 5 cm of topsoil needed for farmland. It cannot just be re-created in our lifetime. Plants oxygenate the excess CO2 linked to the greenhouse effect and climate change. Mass expansion into rural areas will compound the risk of climate change. That, coupled with the risk of food insecurity, is putting Ontarians at risk.\nI STRONGLY oppose the agricultural component of this policy as it stands.\n5. What are your thoughts on the proposed policies regarding planning for employment?\nThis policy looks at sub-urban employment but there is little related to employment in rural areas with increased development, other than diversifying employment. Employment is as important in rural areas as it is un urban ones, and many people who move to rural areas commute impacting the culture and sense of community in a rural area.\nAs rural area residents primarily support the Conservative Party of Ontario, this is disrespectful of their challenges and needs.\n6. Are there any other barriers to, or opportunities for, accelerating development and construction (e.g., federal regulations, infrastructure planning and approvals, private\/public partnerships for servicing, provincial permitting, urban design guidelines, technical standards, zoning, etc.)?\nHousing development and land use:\nWhen I look at the members of the Ontario Land Tribunal, most are from urban areas and only two part-time members come from rural Ontario and those are within a 20-minute drive of each other.\nTo really be respectful of this plan, the government MUST step up and have committees representing each local area where growth occurs (similar to the health system) who have actual power (not symbolic) to advise and guide growth in this area. This needs to have significant contribution and input and oversight by individuals who have historically lived in these rural environments (not individuals who have moved there within the last 5 years).\nParks\/trails, etc.\nWhat safeguards are there for creating and protecting parks? My friends who work in urban planning state that a) they propose walkable communities but this often gets overridden due to cost issues, and b) it is cost prohibitive to purchase back land in urban centres for parks.\nSafeguards and representation:\nFor all of these principles, It simply isn't enough to say it in a document; there have to be guideline that are upheld by independent, transparent, and representative. As I've shared, the money, needs, and wants of the developers have seemed to take priority over all else. There need to absolutely be safeguards in place to uphold support the well-intentioned policies in this document, including the needs and parameters outlined by the municipality, especially related to preserving the local character.\nProvincial oversight committees should have representation from the geographic areas, and subcommittees for each geographical area who can consult with real impact on the needs or issues raised to the Ontario Land Tribunal. Again, I use the Ontario Health Regions as an example of this.  Again\nFinances\n While I applaud the policy to follow the guidance\/recommendations of municipalities and councils for rural areas for land use and development, there needs to be a) accountability at the provincial level to follow this when it is the issue of a developer versus the recommendation of the council, b) there needs to be financial support without ties to help develop any infrastructure needs. By downloading the financial obligations onto the community, you are placing poorer communities at a disadvantage.\nThank you, again, for the opportunity to comment. In conclusion, I support lot of policies in this document especially related to public transportation, park use, mix-housing options, and employment. I am impressed at the clauses to support rural character and follow the guidelines of municipal councils, especially related to housing spacing etc. However, I feel that many policies related to rural areas are vague which puts rural areas at risk if there are conflicts related to development. As well, I feel that the policies related to the protection of agriculture are insufficient, short-sighted, and creates real risk for climate change and food supply. Finally, I believe that not first addressing the ability of individuals to save for a downpayment for a home through re-establishing annual, legal rent increase limits actually promotes the disparity and creates inequality in access to housing which I feel undermines a key foundational concept of this document's creation.\n",

        "comment":"RE: Provincial Agricultural System, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\n(your name \/ organization name)\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"Peterborough County's municipal plan has been submitted to you and falls under this provincial plan.  I hope you will return that plan to be redone as there are major flaws in it.  25 years is a long time to live with a huge mistake and no way to change it.\n1)  The Douro Dummer plan is based on erroneous soil data....are the other municipalities correct?\n  2)  No severance are allowed on prime farm land....how is a family farm supposed to stay in the family?\n  3)  Douro Dummer's settlement areas are incorrectly surrounded in prime farm land so no growth allowed\n  4)  The growth allocated to Douro Dummer is so insignificant that the tax base will not be able to maintain the ever increasing tax burden.\nSince the provincial plan is allowing 3 severances on prime farmland  I am assuming you will address the fact that the Peterborough County plan calls for no severances on farms.  How is a family farm expected to remain in the family if they can't sever a lot for someone who is transitioning to take over the farm? This would be a tragedy for the family.\nDouro Dummer has been white washed with almost all prime agriculture, even around the towns so no severances can be made.  Douro Dummer is very rocky so this allocation is incorrect.  One such prime farm used to be a gravel pit.  Other soil maps done by Trent University students reveal the errors in the soil allocations.  Why did they not take the time to find proper soil allocations?  The whole plan is based on erroneous data.\nNot only the family farms will be lost but the settlement areas which they have erroneously encircled with prime farm land will not be able to grow.  These are death sentences for a township as with no growth the remaining residences will not be able to maintain the tax increases required to maintain the current infrastructure let alone any future increases.\nPlease do the right thing and return the Peterborough County plan to be redone correctly.\n",

        "comment":"Caivan commends MMAH and the Honourable Minister Steve Clark for taking a strong and progressive approach to modernizing planning instruments in the Province with a view to addressing the acute housing crisis in Ontario. The proposed Provincial Planning Statement includes updates that we believe will advance housing supply, improving the quality of life for current and future Ontarians.\nOur focus has been placed mostly on natural hazards policies; specifically the need for strong language around the need for modernization of floodplain policy to correspond with contemporary engineering approaches in balancing the pressures of urban development in and around rivers and streams. The latest PPS is an opportunity to provide municipalities, landowners and Conservation Authorities with an up-to-date policy directive that can benefit from the latest in science surrounding climate changes, hydrodynamic assessment and advances in software based modelling techniques and tools that are being utilized around the world in floodplain management.\nHazard lands are not all created equally and it remains imperative that policy maintain flexibility in order for science and sound engineering approaches to determine where and how site alteration can occur to and within hazard lands. This is more pressing a priority than ever as urban land needs to be harnessed to the fullest extent possible in addressing the need for transit oriented and efficiently serviced housing development across the province. This science first approach has already been adopted in the provincial approach to Brownfields and fire hazards, for instance where engineering approaches are utilized to manage and mitigate risk.\nIn the attached are our suggested addition\/modifications to sections 5 and 7 of the Natural Hazard policies Caivan and our team of experts recommends to modernize the PPS approach to a science first methodology.\n",

        "comment":"Overview\nThe Toronto Region Board of Trade (the Board), the chamber of commerce for Canada\u2019s largest regional economy representing 11,500 members, welcomes the opportunity to make a submission on the proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nThe Board\u2019s submission is rooted in its vision to make the Toronto region one of the most competitive and sought-after business regions in the world. A critical element of fulfilling the mission to be a catalyst for a vibrant, globally competitive region is ensuring there are necessary protections and supply of employment lands to meet the needs of businesses that want to locate and expand in the region.\nThe Government of Ontario\u2019s decision to revoke A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe pursuant to section 7(7) of the Places to Grow Act, 2005, includes changing the definition of employment. This change, along with the absence of many policies from the Growth Plan and PPS 2020 that protected employment lands, will have the unintended consequence of harming existing businesses and making it difficult for new businesses to locate by facilitating ad hoc employment land conversions for housing.\nBoard Submission\nThe Board understands that the proposed policy changes under Bill 97, PPS 2023, and last year\u2019s Bill 23 - the More Homes Built Faster Act of 2022 are intended to address the urgent challenge of building all types of housing more quickly across Ontario. An acute housing shortage and high prices threatens to undermine our ability to attract and retain talent and makes our region less competitive across North America and globally.\nThe Board, however, has significant concerns regarding the proposed policy changes because of the potential to damage the region\u2019s diversified economic base. While the urgency to build homes matters, land-use policies targeting a growth in housing stock must be balanced against the equally important need to ensure employment lands of sufficient size and types are available to create the foundation for a prosperous region.\nThe Board has and continues to advocate for the need to build all types of housing. But this cannot be done at the expense of businesses that may be forced to relocate elsewhere - even south of the border - because of conflicts that arise from the lack of a regional employment lands strategy.\nIt is worth noting that while residential land supply was one of the six key considerations to develop Bill 97 and the proposed PPS as it relates to employment land planning, the economic impact of employment lands does not appear to have been given equal weighting. It was loosely included under the need to maintain long-range population and employment forecasts. Not giving these productivity-generating zones their due weighting will threaten regional economic development and the prosperity of the province.\nThe Board therefore urges the province to consider the impact of the change in the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d in the Planning Act and other proposed changes. Specifically, the Board recommends the province:\n\u2022\tDelay the implementation of PPS 2023 until a thorough review is done to ensure the necessary safeguards are built in the PPS. This review should include respecting the call by various municipalities to delay the date PPS 2023 and Bill 97 come into effect to enable a thorough review of the unintended consequences of policy changes on employment lands.\n\u2022\tEnsure that a comprehensive review includes development of regional inventory of existing, available, and underutilized employment lands as the evidence base to develop criteria to protect employment lands.\n\u2022\tDevelop a regional industrial land strategy which includes standardized criteria and buffers, and guard rails against ad hoc conversions. This involves working closely with the province\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing Council, the federal industrial growth plan strategy, key business stakeholders such as the Board and Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, and municipalities.\n\u2022\tAct prudently with the use of Minister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZO), under Section 47 of the Planning Act. This is especially the case for municipal decisions on conversion requests that were made based on extensive reviews following the Growth Plan and existing PPS under the Municipal Comprehensive Review. Ad hoc decisions that overturn municipal planning decisions at this juncture, before a fully fleshed out regional industrial land strategy is developed, could harm the regional economy.\nWhy the province needs a regional industrial employment land strategy\nWith more than 8 million residents and 3.5 million jobs, the Toronto region is an economic powerhouse that generates nearly two-thirds of Ontario\u2019s GDP, and a quarter of Canada\u2019s. In a world where geopolitics are restructuring global supply chains, Ontario needs a strong regional strategy to inform employment land policies as they are a critical component of a diversified economy. Lands most vulnerable to conversion are often located close to transportation, talent, and markets. They are also home to significant numbers of jobs and economic productivity that contributes to the prosperity of the Toronto region.\nConsider, for example:\n\u2022\tThe Board\u2019s analysis shows that the Pearson Economic Zone, a multi-jurisdictional employment area in and around Toronto Pearson International Airport, contributes $53.4 billion to Ontario\u2019s economy with more than 400,000 jobs.\n\u2022\tThe Board\u2019s own analysis shows that there are almost 250,000 manufacturing jobs in Goods Production Districts and 90,000 manufacturing jobs in Services & Mixed-Use Districts across the Toronto region. These \u2018business districts\u2019 typologies developed by the Board are based on employment lands and other major concentrations of jobs. Goods Production Districts are key employment lands that prominently feature industrial operations.\nThese important employment regions could be at risk under the proposed policy changes. In the absence of a robust employment lands policy linked to provincial and federal ambitions for manufacturing and other land consumptive businesses such as auto, logistics, bio pharma, food and beverage manufacturing and aerospace, caution is recommended to prevent harms to the regional economy.\nComments on Specific Policy Changes\nAmong the many policy changes and impacts, five stand out as concerning for the Board:\nDefinition of employment: Bill 97 proposes a new definition of employment that removes institutional and commercial uses (i.e. retail and office and institutional) and limits it to manufacturing, research and development, warehousing and goods movement.\n\u2022\tComment: The Board\u2019s view is that the decision to remove institutional and commercial uses (i.e. retail and office) from the definition of employment is a major policy shift, the implications of which have not been fully considered.\no\tAn analysis by the City of Toronto has shown that the revised definition has the \u201cpotential to remove approximately 25% of the City's General Employment Areas (including office parks) and risk approximately 150,000 jobs currently located in these areas through future land use change.\u201d Such analysis will similarly impact employment lands in other parts of the region.\n\u2022\tThe province should consider the point raised by several municipalities in their submissions that commercial, office and institutional areas act as important buffers for heavier industrial and other uses that often create conflicts with residential development over traffic, noise, and other issues. Doing away with these buffers without a proper evidence base and consideration of its impact create problems for existing businesses, scare away new businesses, and hurt the economy.\nMunicipal Comprehensive Review (MCR): The proposed PPS does not require a Municipal Comprehensive review (MCR), the once-every-five-year strategic review when municipalities ensure their official plans to conform with the province\u2019s regional Growth Plan. Currently, this is the only window within which to bring a conversion request forward.\n\u2022\tComment: The MCR process by which municipalities update their Official Plans to conform with provincial regulations is an important opportunity for a considered and strategic approach to understand conversion requests and their impact on the region. A conversion request in one municipality has the potential to impact employment lands in a neighbouring municipality, and regional supply chains. This includes an opportunity as well to consider conversions in the context of other infrastructure investments, including transit. Doing away with this policy will result in conversion requests being considered and allowed in an ad hoc manner, without consideration of the cumulative impacts.\nMinister\u2019s Zoning Orders (MZOs) and Conversion requests: The province has always had the powers under Section 47 of the Planning Act to override municipal decisions on conversion requests and other land use decisions.\n\u2022\tComment: Municipalities have recently gone through a lengthy review process to bring their official plans in conformity with existing provincial land use policies under the MCR. For the most part they have been conservative in granting conversion requests based on several factors including their role in the economy, and proximity to conflicting land uses. In a post COVID world where hybrid and remote work is becoming normalized, there is growing interest in the future of suburban office parks and their potential to be used for housing. While some commercial, institutional and office lands have the potential to be turned into housing, especially those near rapid transit, it must be just one of the considerations. The impact of large-scale housing near employment lands must also be a key consideration.\n\u2022\tConsidering the proposed changes and concerns about its impact on employment lands, the Board suggests that the province act prudently and be selective on its use of MZOs to override municipal decisions on conversion requests, until a better understanding of its impact is developed through analysis and evidence.\nProvincially Significant Employment Zone Overlay:  The proposed PPS does not include the provincial overlay of Provincially Significant Employment Zones (PSEZ), a policy for large lots of land with high economic and strategic importance. These lands that contain, office, industrial, commercial, and institutional uses are often located near transportation infrastructure and\/or with high concentrations of employment that are also vulnerable to conversion to residential uses.\n\u2022\tComment: The Board is cognizant that the PSEZ is a one-size fits all designation that exacerbated conversion pressures by two different levels of employment lands \u2013 those that are provincially significant with greater protections and remaining municipal employment lands.\no\tIt is worth noting that the PSEZ framework was a stop gap measure developed to stem the loss of finite and important employment lands from conversion pressures. Further work to refine the policy and implement it in a more fulsome way was never undertaken by the province.\no\tThe development of a more robust PPS 2023, which could include a more refined delineation of different types of employment lands, is an opportunity to do the work needed to understand which lands need protection and where flexibility might be an option. Until that happens, the Board recommends that existing PSEZ protections be reflected in PPS 2023 like what has been done for language in the Growth Plan regarding the Greenbelt which has been included in PPS 2023.\nRegional Planning: The province has decided to revoke A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe pursuant to section 7(7) of the Places to Grow Act, 2005 and replace it with a new PPS that will guide land use planning in Ontario, ending how land use has been planned in Ontario for almost 20 years by municipalities.\n\u2022\tComment: Considering the decision to revoke the Growth Plan, there is an urgent need for the province to advance a comprehensive regional inventory of employment lands which includes both industrial and commercial lands. This inventory can be used to enable decisions on conversion requests and form the development of a regional economic development strategy that considers municipal, provincial, federal and business interests. Such an evidence base that is regional in nature alongside criteria needed to ensure buffers and transitory zones exist, can be the building block for a more nuanced industrial lands policy.\n-------\nThe Board appreciates the opportunity to comment on these proposed policy changes. We look forward to further opportunities to work with the province on developing an industrial lands strategy that enhances the competitiveness and productivity of this critical region.\n",

        "comment":"August 3, 2023\nThe Honorable Steve Clark\nMinister of Municipal Affairs and Housing\nCollege Park, 17th Floor, 77 Bay Street\nToronto ON M7A 2J3\nAttention Minister Clark:\nRe:\u201d ERO 019-6813 Repeal of Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and the Provincial Policy Statement and introduction of a New \u201cProvincial Planning Statements\u201d\nFurther to the submission which Environmental Defence made jointly with Ontario Nature and other organizations  on June 5th, these are the additional comments of Environmental Defence regarding the Minister\u2019s proposal to repeal the current Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, and to replace the current Provincial Policy Statement with a new document referred to as the \u201cProvincial Planning Statement\u201d.\nFirstly, Environmental Defence is making these further comments at the request of the Minister of Environment, Dave Piccini, following our conversation with him.   These submissions do not replace or resile in any way from our opposition to the proposal, as set out in our June 5th letter.\nAs indicated in our earlier submissions, eliminating the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe and replacing the Provincial Policy Statement with the \u201cProvincial Planning Statement\u201d posted on the registry would substantively change the types of development that are permitted and incentivized in Ontario in ways that cause far more destruction of Ontario\u2019s scarce remaining farmland and  wildlife habitats, discourage the development of communities that are walkable and cost-effective to service, and ultimately make it much harder to produce the number of lower-cost homes Ontarians need as quickly as they are needed.\nOf particular concern is that the proposed Planning Statement would remove incentives for landowners and municipalities to maximize the number of homes created and the number people housed for each unit of labour and serviced land invested, by:\n*Eliminating the mandate that at least 50 residents be housed on each hectare of farmland and wildlife habitat sacrificed for residential development. This comes after the government had already reduced the number of homes required from a previous 80 residents per hectare standard.\n*Eliminating the requirement that regions like Peel, York, Halton and Waterloo, where housing shortages \u2013 and constraints on construction capacity \u2013 are most acute, make use of their existing infrastructure and serviced land by upzoning them to accommodate at least 50% of their planned new households. The Ontario government has already reduced the mandate from 60%, but it would now be removed entirely.\n*Eliminating the Provincial Policy Statement requirement that municipalities seize all opportunities for efficient infill development, and improve the efficiency of existing development plans, before they are permitted to extend settlement boundaries into farms and forests.\n*Allowing land speculators to push through inefficient, on-demand piecemeal boundary expansions rather than requiring that they be coordinated as part of periodic reviews.\nWhile we are pleased that Minister Piccini committed (on Minister Clark\u2019s behalf) to remove another aspect of the proposed Planning Statement which would have promoted the conversion of farms to large residential lots by permitting severances of farmland, any new planning policy which the Minister ultimately adopts must also:\n*Maintain the prohibition (set out in the current PPS) on any extension of settlement area boundaries except where it is proven that it is not possible for the relevant municipality to meet housing need, while strengthening the language to make it clear that  political opposition to densification is not a relevant consideration in assessing what is possible.  Housing need should be assessed for housing types defined based on unit size (with all units in excess of 1000 square feet treated as interchangeable, regardless of whether they are single or semi-detached, townhomes, apartment units), and level of car traffic on the street where they are located.\n*Increase the minimum intensification rates for all Greater Golden Horseshoe municipalities to 70% while making it clear that minimum intensification rates do not alter the prohibition on extending settlement boundaries while it remains possible to accommodate required housing by adding more than 70% of new homes to existing neighborhoods.\n*Maintain minimum density targets for greenfield development, extending them to apply to unbuilt designated greenfield area that was added prior to 2022, and increasing them to no less than 100 residents per hectare (from 80 combined residents and jobs per hectare) across the entire designated greenfield area of each municipality, so that all new neighborhoods have sufficient density to support amenities and cost-effective, high quality public transit within walking distance of almost all residents\n*Maintain the prohibition on any settlement boundary expansions except as part of fixed-date Municipal Comprehensive Reviews conducted at least 5 years after any prior settlement boundary expansion took effect.\nAny new or altered planning regime for Ontario should also increase the share of Greater Golden Horseshoe population growth that the City of Toronto absorbs so that the City\u2019s share of the Greater Golden Horseshoe\u2019s overall population consistently increases (rather than decreases) over the planning period, and never drops below 40%.  The Growth Plan and\/or all other applicable planning documents should require, in addition to this increased population target itself, that Toronto plan to house more than 1,460,000 net new residents by 2051, and to reliably add at least 400,000 net new \u201cfamily-sized\u201d (1000sf) homes on low-car-traffic side-streets, including apartments, townhomes and garden suites.\nWe were encouraged by comments from Minister Piccini which suggested the fundamental purpose of eliminating the free-standing Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe was not to weaken density requirements or permit less transit-supportive forms of development, but rather to eliminate procedural duplication, and improve the ease with which developers and municipal governments interpret land use planning rules.  If this is indeed accurate, then Environmental Defence would strongly urge the Ontario government to maintain the substantive content of the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (with the improvements identified above and in our previous submissions) as a regionally specific Part of any new Provincial Policy Statement or Provincial Planning Statement.\nEnvironmental Defence - together with  housing advocates like More Neighbours Toronto and More Neighbours Hamilton, and Sustainable Mississauga -  have consistently reminded Minister Clark, Minister Piccini, Premier Ford, and the government more broadly, that Ontario is not faced with choice, or \u201cbalance\u201d between increasing housing supply and preventing environmentally destructive sprawl sprawl.  On the contrary, our current housing shortages are the \u201ccoming home to roost\u201d of many decades of sprawl land use planning that directed growth to low-density, car-dependent, sprawl developments of large and expensive houses, while making it difficult and unappealing to densify existing suburban neighborhoods.  This means that the policies Ontario must adopt to end housing shortages are precisely the same as those we must adopt to stop any sprawl and densify our suburban neighborhoods into places where most residents don\u2019t need a car.  Unfortunately the policies in the proposed Provincial Planning Statement would do the opposite.\nSincerely,\nTim Gray,\nExecutive Director\nEnvironmental Defence\nPhil Pothen, J.D., M.L.A.\nOntario Environment Program Manager\nEnvironmental Defence\n",

        "comment":"August 4, 2023\nThe Honourable Steve Clark\nMinister of Municipal Affairs and Housing\n17th Floor,\n777 Bay Street\nToronto, Ontario,\nM7A 2J3\nSent via email to: minister.mah@ontario.ca and PlanningConsultation@ontario.ca and submitted online through the Environmental Registry of Ontario\nDear Minister Clark,\nRe: ERO 019-6813 - Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nThe HCFA proudly represents our membership of over 2000 farm families in Huron County. Huron County is the most agricultural productive county in Ontario, and we strive to ensure that sustainable, vibrant, and profitable farms succeed in our area. The HCFA\u2019s mission includes the protection of farmland as it is a critical component for a sustainable future in agriculture.\nThe Huron County Federation of Agriculture welcomes the opportunity to comment on the proposed Provincial Policy Statement.  HCFA understands that the ministry continues to review emerging information regarding land use planning, however we were disappointed that this strategy did not focus on responsible land-use planning that prevents unnecessary farmland loss nor a strategy that supports communities reaching intensification targets.\nThe HCFA understands that the 3-lot severance portion of the original document is not being pursued. We are pleased with this update as this lot creation strategy would hinder the ability of sustainable agriculture in Ontario. The HCFA feels that the protection of Ontario\u2019s agricultural areas is a major concern.\nIn the Proposed Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) one concern is the removal of the requirement to use the provincially mapped agricultural system. The removal of this requirement would allow for inconsistent classification of agricultural lands between municipalities. The current provincially mapped agricultural system is necessary to maintain consistency between different regions of the province. The Canada Land Inventory (CLI) identifies Class 1 to 3 soils plus specialty crop areas as Prime Agricultural land.  All agricultural land deserves protection as different areas can support different types of agricultural activities.\nThe HCFA supports fixed permanent urban boundaries to limit the loss of agricultural land and future urban development should be concentrated within existing boundaries.  This will strengthen the urban areas as a center of activity. The loss of agricultural land needs to be justified and expansion of urban areas into agricultural lands should only occur after the use of underutilized areas within the existing urban limits.\nThe portions in the Proposed PPS that remove the ability of municipalities to vary from the provincial policy is very concerning. Municipalities in the province vary considerably with regards to size, terrain, lands use, climate, priorities, tax base, staffing and numerous other characteristics. The PPS should be used as a baseline. The removal of flexibility would force the municipalities to make decisions that are not appropriate for their area. Municipalities should be permitted to be more restrictive within the local policy provided it is in accordance with provincial policies.\nThe agriculture community currently uses Minimum Distance of Separation (MDS) calculations to reduce neighbouring land use complaints. The MDS has ensured that livestock buildings and manure storages are separated from other land use. The utilization of MDS ensures that there is minimal odour concerns.  We feel that the MDS should continue to be used and that future development take into consideration MDS and the setback requirements that are necessary.\nThe HCFA is a supporter of responsible development but certainly not projects that jeopardize the future of sustainable agriculture.\nSincerely,\nMurray Workman, President Huron County Federation of Agriculture\n",

The role of the Source Protection Committee is to protect the long-term supply of safe drinking water for residents and businesses in our region. While our mandate under the Clean Water Act is to protect sources of municipal drinking water through the Source Protection Plan, we are also concerned with the quality and quantity of water for areas serviced by private wells and septic systems.\nWe are concerned about the potential impacts of rural development on the long-term supply of drinking water for rural homes and farms. Increased development in rural and agricultural areas will generate increased demand on the aquifers that supply drinking water. Rural residents in certain communities have already shared water supply concerns for existing private wells.\nIt is well understood that septic systems can pose a threat to the quality of drinking water from private wells. Private sewage treatment requires ongoing maintenance which individual homeowners are not always aware of or financially able to perform. This can pose a risk to the quality of water in wells, especially for communities with greater density of development. Increased development on private sewage treatment systems should only be encouraged where it is clear that there is no risk to existing sources of drinking water.\nIt is of vital importance that we ensure that any increase in development on private services is supported by evidence that there will be no long-term negative impacts on water quality and quantity for existing rural land uses.\nResearch on groundwater recharge is required to determine if more housing is in fact possible in communities serviced by well water, without compromising the long-term viability of the water supply. Hydrogeological studies and water budget analyses should be completed prior to implementing policies that increase rural development on private services.\nOnce again, thank you for the opportunity to provide comments. We hope that you take our concerns into consideration in drafting the new proposed policy instrument.\nSincerely,\nChair Ray Beauregard,\nRaisin-South Nation Source Protection Committee\n",

        "comment":"August 4, 2023\nOntario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing\nRe: ERO 019-6813 - Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nPlease accept this submission in response to the proposed Provincial Planning Statement (PPS) on behalf of the Northumberland County Food Policy Council (NCFPC). Our Council has been operating since April 2011, together with over twenty community partners to develop the Northumberland County Food Charter. In the summer of 2013, the Food Charter was endorsed by all seven local municipal governments. On World Food Day (October 16, 2013), Northumberland County also endorsed the Food Charter. The primary goal of the Food Charter is for individuals, agencies and local governments to work together to build a vibrant, sustainable, food-secure community.\nBuilding on the Food Charter, a diverse group of local citizens founded the Northumberland County Food Policy Council, and created our Mission:  To bring individuals, agencies, and local government together to examine the operation of the local food system, stimulate and lead a dialogue on food, promote projects in the community, and provide policy ideas and recommendations that enhance a sustainable local food system.\nWe are in the process of updating our strategic plan, and currently, we have four focus areas:\n1.\tCommunity Gardens\n2.\tDecrease Food Waste\n3.\tIncentives for franchises\/institutions to purchase local foods\n4.\tLand Use Planning\nA strong local and regional food supply in Ontario is a critical component for economic development and prosperity in our rural and urban communities. Supporting a local food system also supports the health and well-being of Ontarians, and protects precious farmland, water sources, forests, wetlands and wildlife habitat. The proposed PPS plays a direct role in the development of a sustainable food system, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and the future health of Ontarians.\nIn order to prioritize local and regional food systems in a new province-wide planning policy instrument that combines the current PPS and A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (APTG), it is essential to retain and\/or incorporate the following core components:\n\u2022 Creating communities that are compact, comprehensive, environmentally friendly, and food secure;\n\u2022 Enhancing climate resilience through adaptation and mitigation strategies;\n\u2022 Engaging meaningfully with Indigenous communities;\n\u2022 Ensuring public health and safety;\n\u2022 Protecting the environment, and our diminishing agricultural land;\n\u2022 Supporting democratic input on a local and regional level through active citizen engagement.\nSustainable Local Food Systems\nA sustainable local food system delivers community food security and nutrition to ensure that economic, social, and environmental bases for future generations are not compromised. The way food is produced, distributed, processed, and sold within a region impacts food choices and nutrition related health outcomes. Communities that have access to a sustainable supply of healthy, and locally grown and processed food are less susceptible to external factors that can influence the cost, and the nutritional quality and\/or quantity of available foods.\nEnsuring community food security, a key outcome of sustainable food systems, requires that a variety of elements be addressed. Some of these elements are outlined below with respect to how the proposed PPS will negatively impact a sustainable food system in Ontario.\n\u2022 Availability means that a diverse food supply and adequate food infrastructure is in place. As per section 4.3.3 of the proposed PPS, residential lots will be created on prime agricultural land. This impacts Ontario\u2019s food system and the ability of the province to meet this demand. Ontario\u2019s agricultural lands are a finite and shrinking resource, making up less than five percent of all provincial land, and is currently being lost at a rate of 319 acres per day. Policies must be in place to encourage local farmers to grow local food. Instead, the proposed policy will make it difficult for farmers, as they will be competing with developers. However, recent media stories state that the PPS will remove the creation of residential lots on prime agricultural land. The Northumberland County Food Policy Council (NCFPC) supports this change.\n\u2022 Accessibility ensures that everyone has physical access to adequate and acceptable food. Evidence indicates that compact, complete communities facilitate economic growth, sufficient land use, opportunities for recreation, and access to food. The proposed policy will encourage sprawled development that will fragment and isolate farm communities, reducing access to food.\n\u2022 Affordability means everyone has adequate income to purchase foods that meet cultural and personal preferences. The proposed policy will remove measures that require developers to build diverse housing types that Ontarians can afford. Inflation, supply-chain disruption, and climate-related events in recent years have highlighted the urgent need for both affordable housing and the protection of farmlands. Reducing the availability of affordable housing will add to the growing problem of food insecurity: the inability to afford food due to inadequate or insecure income. The proportion of Ontarians living in food insecure households in 2021 was 19.2% or 2.8 million people.\n\u2022 Acceptability ensures that the food system meets cultural preferences and needs. To ensure a sustainable food system, the unique role and inherent rights of Indigenous peoples must be recognized, which includes access to traditional lands.\nClimate Change\nThe NCFPC recognizes the strong connection between food and climate change. As noted in Ontario Dietitians in Public Health (ODPH) Food Systems Workgroup response to Bill 23, \u201cfood is grown, harvested, and processed in our communities and the lands and waters that surround them \u2014 our continued [community] food security relies on us doing so in a sustainable manner. In the face of a rapidly changing climate and uncertain seasonal weather patterns, the disruption of complex wetland systems can have massive impacts on above- and below-ground waterways, and the production potential of adjacent agricultural lands. Further, disruptions to long food supply-chains, increased transportation expenses, crop failure in other parts of the world, and the need to limit our use of carbon-based fuels, require us to increase [community] food security by deepening our access to sustainably produced, [and] locally grown food.\u201d\nFrom a food systems perspective, to ensure community food security, climate change must be recognized across many aspects of land-use planning. Like the ODPH, Northumberland County Food Policy Council recommends that climate change mitigation and adaptation policies be integrated into agriculture and food policies, infrastructure and facilities, transportation, water, and stormwater management.\nHealth and Well-being of Ontarians\nPrevious iterations of the PPS and Growth Plans explicitly recognized the health and well-being of Ontarians, and how healthy communities and natural environments are interconnected. The merging of the PPS and APTG disintegrates the original intentions of these documents, and many essential, health-promoting components to support climate resiliency and a sustainable food system in Ontario. In consideration of a new provincial planning policy instrument, we urge the Province to consider the inclusion of the following policies as proposed by the Ontario Public Health Association:\n1. Prevent unsustainable urban expansion and fragmentation of agricultural lands.\n2. Integrate affordability targets for low- and moderate-income households to support equity and promote housing affordability for all.\n3. Strengthen policies that will help communities mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change.\n4. Mitigate exposure to incompatible land uses and harmful levels of pollution.\n5. Re-integrate health and well-being concepts in the Vision and in Chapter 2 \u201cBuilding Homes, Sustaining Strong and Competitive Communities\u201d, with the goal of creating healthy communities that enable people to thrive.\nSincerely,\nRuss Christianson, Chair\nNorthumberland County Food Policy Council\n",

Even if all the evidence that points to the destruction of the greenbelt causing provincial flooding of homes and cities, starvation of many from the loss of local farmland, and loss of biodiversity on a critical scale; all of which will absolutely have dire consequences for us not even in the distant future, but almost immediately (~2-10 years), let\u2019s acknowledge that development of the greenbelt was never about \u201caffordable housing\u201d when so much of Ontario is currently bulldozed dirt lots on the waiting list to be turned into housing, or is already housing that sits empty currently or is owned in stock by corporations both here and overseas.\nThe greenbelt development plan by our government is not to help our province, it is to further strengthen the divide that lies between the citizens of Ontario and a provincial government that has broken our trust by lying and walking back on their false promises.\nIn the end, even if those who don\u2019t care about the greenbelt are not swayed from an ecological or economic perspective, let us remember that this is land where many of us grew up, formed core memories, made new friends and became closer with family. From days on the lake that felt too short, to shopping at the every farmer\u2019s stand you see in the countryside and chatting with them about life, to catching butterflies and other critters as kids, to enjoying ice cream at the local ice cream shop after a long day of walking with your family, friends, or pets.

        "comment":"Premier, Cabinet, Ministers, MPPs and Staff,\nWe are writing on behalf of the 500+ members of Smart Growth Waterloo Region - a group focussed on ensuring thriving dynamic urban areas while protecting our countryside.  We have been active for over a decade helping to shape the Waterloo Region Official Plans, promote Light Rail Transit (LRT), and working with our municipalities on the needed sustainable local official plans.\nAfter helping to ensure our most recent very progressive Regional Official Plan had input from thousands of citizens and was strong endorsed by all our local governments, our membership has been horrified by the approach of this provincial government - overriding our sustainable plan for intensification and growing within our communities - affordably delivering more housing units than the province is seeking and instead having the province force thousands of acres of unnecessary urban sprawl destroying the local farms and groundwater areas we are so dependent on.\nThis housing is not where people want to live, it is not likely to be affordable and it is not likely to be supported by much public transit if any.  We cannot afford the infrastructure and the cuts to development charges is ensuring that our local municipalities can't afford it either.  This is not in the best public interest at all but seems to delight numerous billionaire developers and land speculators who have driven our farmland to prices unaffordable to most new and aspiring farmers.\nThe proposal to allow 3 severances per farm is absurd and while it will do little to provide affordable, desired housing it will devastate our countryside and our ability to grow food efficiently in the future.\nThe implications of this are staggering \u2013 not only for efficient farming, MDS regulations, and ensuring we can produce enough food to feed our population in the future but even for things like rural schools, infrastructure, highway entrances, the electrical grid, internet and telephony infrastructure, rural hospitals, etc.  It has never been anticipated to relocate hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of people scattered across the rural parts of the province in the most inefficient manner possible.\nIt has been broadly accepted that land for development is not the issue \u2013 there is no land shortage \u2013 there is decades of land supply already designated in municipalities across the province and developers have been sitting on massive inventories for years as there is no approval expiry and no incentive for them to move forward to meet the market needs - just outrageous profits by restricting supply.\nThe new definitions for the Agricultural System and the Natural Heritage System (NHS) are far too vague and troublesome - we need more protection not less in the midst of the climate crisis that is just starting to unfold.\nWe need a PPS that carefully guides growth and manages resources across Ontario - instead the new PPS focuses only on housing supply at the expense of most other considerations - in particular the need for climate change adaptation and future survival.\nThere is little that this current government is doing that is actually going to address our housing crisis, improve affordability, and provide our citizens with the sustainable, survivable future needed.\nWe urge the government to abandon these currently proposed policies and instead focus on the sustainable, complete communities with the missing middle, accessory units and intensification that will deliver the future that we need and far better address the current issues.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"It's my belief that one of the most impactful and well-received changes that could be made with the update to the PPS would be the blanket inclusion of \"Conservation Severances\" in Ontario.\nThe basis of these severances is simple; in cases where a property is intended to be severed such that a portion of it can be put into conservation land (whether sold or donated to a Park, Conservation Authority, or Land Trust), then the parameters surrounding minimum building lots and environmental assessments should be waived. Note that this should only be in cases where the entity applying for the severance - or that is the certified and agreed-upon recipient of the property post-severance - is a qualified land conservation organization, like the aforementioned Park, CA, or Land Trust.\nPeel Region has already implemented a system like this; the wording from their Official Plan is below:\n\"7.4.9 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments:\n7.4.9.5 Support consents to enable the securement of lands for natural heritage conservation purposes by a public authority or by a non-government conservation organization, provided that:\na)  the consent will avoid fragmentation of the Greenlands System's natural heritage features and areas, where possible;\nb)  in the Prime Agricultural Area, the consent will not create a lot permitting an additional residential dwelling or other additional non-farm development beyond that which was permitted on the original lot to be severed prior to the consent;\nc)  the acquired and retained lots are in compliance with the local municipal official plan and zoning by-law; and\nd)  when deemed necessary, a restrictive covenant or conservation easement is placed on title of the land to be held for conservation purposes prohibiting development of the land for non-conservation uses in perpetuity.\n7.4.9.6  Encourage the local municipalities to include appropriate lot standards and provisions in their official plans and zoning by-laws to recognize and permit non-complying lots to be created as a result of an acquisition of land by a public authority or a non-government conservation organization for natural heritage conservation purposes.\"\nAdditionally, the Kawartha Land Trust has been working to have a similar system implemented with a local municipality. Their proposed wording is:\n\"Notwithstanding any other policy of this Plan to the contrary, the creation of new lots or the assembly of land through lot additions for conservation purposes by a recognized non-profit organization may be permitted within the boundaries of key natural heritage features and key hydrologic features without the need for a Natural Heritage Evaluation. This exception recognizes the intent to protect the feature and its functions for the long term. Lots created for such purpose will be placed in a separate zoning category, recognizing the lands for a conservation use. For clarity, the zoning may permit passive recreational uses, as well as buildings and structures outside of key features and vegetation protection zones provided they are used for conservation education purposes.\"\nThe main advantage to a policy of this nature is that it would make conservation work much easier to accomplish. As a Land Trust employee myself, I can attest that there are several projects where somebody has a large property with developed and undeveloped sites whereby they wish to sever and conserve the undeveloped site, but because of severance restrictions are unable to. Across the Province, a lot of potential conservation land is lost because of this detail of the bureaucratic process. At a time when conservation land is of upmost importance in combatting the twin crises of Biodiversity Loss and Climate Change, every advantage that can be given to the people and organizations working to conserve natural spaces must be considered, as their work benefits all the people of Ontario. Conservation Severances would be an elegant and streamlined solution to this problem.\nThank you for your time in reading and considering this comment.\n",

And  further support the flexibility afforded to farmers to engage in on-farm value adding of primary farm products, as well as agriculture-related, on-farm diversified and agri-tourism uses. Although the PPS 2020 defines prime agricultural land as Canada Land Inventory (CLI) Class 1- 3 soils plus specialty crop areas, the OFA believes that prime agricultural lands should be defined as Class 1 to 4 soils plus specialty crop lands. Class 5-6 soils that are part of an ongoing agricultural operation deserve protection too. These soils can support agricultural activities such as grazing livestock or growing crops for biofuels, and their productivity can be improved through activities such as tile drainage, stone picking and the addition of lime. Where Class 1-4 soils are not present in a county or region, the best agricultural lands in that county or region should be recognized and protected for their agricultural use.\nI support the the OFA position  of the preservation of Prime Farmland classes 1, 2, 3 & 4 plus specialty crop lands across rural Ontario. We believe strongly in the PPS 2020 Agriculture policies that governs farmland and rural areas protecting the right to farm and the Agriculture System in Ontario. In addition to this, OFA believes strongly that lot creation and further fragmentation of farmland in the rural area is counterproductive for the agricultural business structure in Ontario\u2019s rural areas. However, OFA supports additional residential units on existing farm parcels (but not on a severed lot from the farm parcel), and in rural hubs, hamlets, and communities to support our agricultural system.\n",

In Waterloo Region we have a comprehensive and well thought out 30 year plan that has essentially been overruled by a higher level of government that does not live or work here.\nDeveloping greenbelt land is not sustainable. These lands are essential to all people and animals. We cannot continue to pave over the land that sustains us. Many reports have identified there is enough brownfield land for development to last us several decades. These lands are also typically already services with the infrastructure needed. It is clear by the land purchases by large developers in the Greenbelt that they were given forewarning by the Ontario government that these areas would be opened up for development even though Doug Ford promised not to. It's obvious that this government cares more about their well being than the ordinary citizens of this province.\nWith the lower of development fees it is now the taxpayer that will bear the cost of growth. What happened to \"growth pays for growth\"?\nWith typically single family home prices near $1M in Waterloo region how does building more of the same address the affordability crisis?\nThe Ontario government's anti-democratic methods need to stop.

Long term leasing options for an additional dwelling on a farm property should not be considered.  Leasing additional homes on a solely owned farm property creates challenges with succession, inheritance, or in the circumstance of divorce or partnership breakdown.\n\u2022\tDevelopment should be focused on brownfield lands before considering use of greenfield or agriculturally zoned lands.\n\u2022\tSettlement areas should not be permitted on prime agricultural land.\n",

        "comment":"The good news in this document is the note that municipal planners can go above and beyond this new policy, as it sets minimum standards.\nThus, for example, since municipalities are now in charge of watershed management, they can freely use 500 year storms as a determination of the flood risk, and plan accordingly.\nSince the definition of 'affordable housing' is now eliminated, municipalities can define 'affordable' at the old standard of 30% of income.  The Bill 23 definitions are not yet implemented, and even if the 80% of market definition is ultimately decided upon, municipalities can and should go above that minimum and set a better (i.e. more affordable) definition.  The suggestion in the proposal that municipalities must allow for the 'full range' of housing affordability needs clearly states that municipalities will not be hamstrung by Bill 23's redefinition of 'Affordable' to be 80% of market, nor the removal of the 30% of income definition in the proposal.  Indeed a full range of affordability may mean that new builds can and should include housing that is deeply affordable to the lowest income, most marginalized communities.\nThrough the encouragement in the PPS to protect the environment and reduce GHG emissions, municipalities can demand developers do better than the 'minimum' standards in the building code, and for example, build energy efficiency, stormwater management and electric vehicle charging station capacity in new buildings.  They can demand an end to sprawl, and through the PPS encouragement of density, can demand that developers build denser forms of housing as infill rather than sprawl.\nThough the proposed PPS gives permission to more easily urbanize farmland, municipalities are not forced to by this document.  So long as they maintain the new build required in the PPS, they are free to do that by intensification and dense infill, rather than expanding into farmland.  As the attached opinion suggests, paving over more farmland is not a wise use of limited resources, and threatens our limited food self-sufficiency.\nMuch of what the province has done more recently appears to provide restrictions on the abilities of municipal planners to do their jobs.  If there is widespread use of the 'attainable' and 'affordable' provisions of bill 23, this will certainly cause significant tax increases on existing property owners in Ontario, as developers will no longer have to pay for infrastructure.  This may be a blessing in disguise, as municipalities, faced with the inability to create new infrastructure, will have to find clever ways to utilize existing infrastructure, which lends itself to intensification, or building where there is already significant infrastructure in place.  This in turn fulfils other policy statements, particularly those requiring intensification and mitigating climate change related harms.\n",

How do we know they won't build huge, unaffordable single family dwellings with no shopping, necessary community services, schools, hospitals, parks, etc. nearby.  Will the development of the subdivisions the Ford government is planning require citizens to drive or will transportation be in place for those who cannot drive or do not own a car. Is there going to be a maximum price on these homes so they are more \"affordable\" than the ones in the GTA and surrounding areas?  Who is going to pay for the infrastructure? Is there any requirement for intensification of the area and for the homes to be energy efficient.\nTaking into account the dramatic and traumatic events across the country this summer due to climate change, how can it be beneficial to cut down forests, and disturb our natural environment?\nIn my humble opinion,  the Ford plans need to go back to the drawing board and there needs to be conversation and collaboration with the municipalities the plans are affecting.

        "comment":"The public understands the rationale for additional housing in Ontario, as they know Canada will be taking immigrants and they all know people having trouble finding a place to buy or rent.\nHowever, I object to the continued pressure by the provincial government to place additional responsibilities on municipalities without providing support for them. I live in central Ontario, east of Toronto, in an area of rural municipalities. All of the items in section 4, above, require expertise that municipalities do not have and are better provided by provincial ministries which are able to hire specialists to focus on these tasks. The extensive mapping requirements are unlikely to be well met by small and mid-sized municipalities which have trouble retaining employees skilled in these areas. To actually implement these requirements, municipalities will be forced to raise property taxes far above inflation to support these activities, making current owners less able to afford their properties. This will only result in more people without homes, living on the streets, which is already becoming a greater issue in rural areas. This policy statement only provides additional challenges and requirements for municipalities and is completely lacking in support by the province.\nWhile increasing the number of severances allowed on farm lots (proposed in Bill 97 and in 4.3.3 of the PPS) may increase the possible locations for houses to potentially be built, this is a terrible idea. Rural road are already littered with houses and more and more are being built all the time, prior to the implementation of either of these policies. These houses must have their own well and septic system but we all know that that groundwater is connected and having many houses in a small area on individual water and septic is not sustainable. Additionally, because they are in the country, they require residents to have a vehicle and heat sources brought in which is not sustainable. The majority of homes being built in the country currently seem like estates and are not modest or affordable or sustainable by any stretch of the imagination. They frequently provide a home for only one or two people who commute increasingly long distances for employment, since there is rarely much employment, aside from agriculture, in rural centres. The people who purchase these homes usually bring urban ideas about lawn care, garbage collection, and healthcare services, for example, to the rural area, placing additional pressure on our wildlife, municipalities, and public health. They don't want to smell the manure of a farm or hear rocks being crushed to gravel all day.\nFarmland is finite and in Ontario, a huge amount of prime farmland has already been turned into houses. Expanding subdivisions increase the distance food must travel to those who eat it and decrease the sustainability of communities. Increased housing in rural areas also increases human impact on natural communities, putting even more pressure on ecosystems already faced with climate change and other human-caused impacts.\nOne of the questions above asks about barriers to accelerating development and completely disregards the negative consequences of accelerated development. Hurried work is rarely well done and results in decision-making based on incomplete information and rushed consultation. Land-use planning is very complex because there are so many varied challenges due to the interactions of humans, transportation, resource extraction, watersheds, and natural heritage aspects. Speeding the process up will inevitably result in errors small and large. Additionally, constructing buildings is not simple since it also has many interacting trades. People spend a lot of time in their homes and want them to be safe and special. Rushing the process results in poor workmanship; for something that people expect to last decades and be a healthy space to exist, care, not speed, is what is important.\nIn closing, I want to urge the province to support municipalities make wise decisions regarding land-use planning, focus development in existing urban areas (not rural regions), with a careful measured process.\n",

        "comment":"RE: Provincial Agricultural System, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\nKiana\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"Further to City of Mississauga comments sent in May, 2023, the following comments and recommendations are provided on the proposed natural heritage policies:\nThe proposed changes to the natural heritage planning framework may have the effect of potentially weakening protections for natural heritage features, which will no longer be identified and protected for in Provincial planning instruments. Instead, it will be the responsibility of municipalities to identify natural heritage features based on evaluation criteria that will be established by the Province. Generally, changes can more easily be made to municipal planning policy, and there is more recourse for challenge than is the case with policies and mapping contained in provincial planning instruments.\nMunicipalities will need support for training and resources in order to fulfil the new responsibility of mapping natural heritage features. Currently, the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks, and Conservation Authorities provide technical environmental expertise related to the natural heritage system.\nAt a minimum, the proposed PPS, 2023 should ensure that strong protections be granted for natural heritage features when they are identified in accordance with provincial guidelines.\n",

        "comment":"August 4, 2023\nPlanning Consultation\nProvincial Planning Policy Branch\n777 Bay Street, 13th floor\nToronto, ON\nM5G 2E5\nRE: ERO 019-6813\nReview of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nhttps:\/\/ero.ontario.ca\/notice\/019-6813\nDear Minister,\nThe Shared Path Consultation Initiative (Shared Path) is a charitable organization that addresses the challenges and opportunities where land use change and Aboriginal and Treaty Rights intersect. Planning has the potential to impact Indigenous political and territorial claims. In response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s Calls to Action 47, 57, and 92, Shared Path provides resources for First Nation, M\u00e9tis, municipal, and provincial governments, as well as professionals in land use change to better engage in consultation and relationship-building.\nThe SPCI is sympathetic to the fracturing of issues that the Government of Ontario must face, as the lack of cohesion on the fiscal, economic, cultural, social, and political fronts is immense. We have concerns about the province\u2019s intensive focus on residential development - the need for more housing in Ontario is apparent, but cannot be siloed from other matters of importance. Single-issue solutions lend themselves to top-down visions and context-less implementations, and run the risk of impinging on Aboriginal, Treaty, and Inherent rights of the Indigenous peoples of Ontario.\nContext and Vision\nIn its haste to revise the PPS, the Greenbelt, and the Growth Plan, the provincial government has neglected the principles of \u201cfree, prior, and informed consent,\u201d regarding traditional territories, otherwise known as Ontario. (see United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 2016). The government has also forgotten to respect the Honour of the Crown in its duty to consult and accommodate the aforementioned rights (see: The Royal Proclamation, 1764; the Constitution Act, 1867; the Constitution Act, 1982; the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 1996; the Ipperwash Inquiry, 2007; the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 201; see jurisprudence: Calder, 1973; Sparrow, 1990; Delgamuukw, 1997; Haida, 2004; Taku River, 2004; Mikisew Cree, 2005; SON, 2017, etc.)\nDuty to Consult and Accommodate\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the legislative frameworks and policy tools that inform our consideration of the province\u2019s proposed implementation of a new policy planning instrument.\nThe United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has been accepted by the Canadian government (2016). The result is that the \u201cfree, prior, and informed consent\u201d of Indigenous peoples when actions are taken regarding the lands and resources traditional to their communities, is now part of Canadian jurisprudence.\nThe Constitution Act, 1982  contains two sections recognizing Indigenous rights:\nSection 25 in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that Aboriginal, treaty, or other rights or freedoms are not abrogated or derogated. It specifically mentions The Royal Proclamation, 1763. It, along with the implementing Treaty of Niagara, 1764 is one of the first planning policies on this continent and is grounded in a relationship with the Crown.\nSection 35 recognises and affirms the \u201cAboriginal peoples of Canada '' and their treaty rights as they exist now or as they may be acquired.\nOntario, as the Crown, has a legal obligation to consult with Aboriginal peoples where it contemplates decisions or actions that may adversely impact asserted or established Aboriginal or Treaty Rights (court cases: Haida, 2004; Taku River, 2004; Mikisew Cree, 2005) .\nThe Province of Ontario understands that inherent in the Crown\u2019s duty to consult is the obligation to ensure that the concerns of the impacted Aboriginal people are addressed (court cases: Sparrow, 1990, Delgamuukw, 1997).\nThis obligation now includes: formal notice, information, peer-review funding, and accommodation of the concerns raised during consultation.  Further, that cumulative effects are the proper subject of consultation, and that private interests risk delayed projects by a failure to consult (court case: SON, 2017).\nAfter the fact consultation on reports that are prepared without considering their concerns, and mitigation measures conceived of without their participation, will not discharge the Crown\u2019s duty to consult.\nEchoing Indigenous Peoples in Ontario\nFirst Nations have voiced their concerns about the province\u2019s recent amendments to planning legislation and policy.\nIn a comment submitted RE: ERO 019-6177, Saugeen Ojibway Nation (SON) expressed concerns about the provincial government\u2019s approach to the proposed PPS and the growth plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, reminding us that growth in the GGH and the GTA have real impacts on communities and lands to the north.\nIndigenous peoples are not simply stakeholders in the planning realm, but unique rights holders as defined through treaties, the Constitution Action 1982, and decades of case law. To that end, we support SON\u2019s view that a simple comment opportunity through the Environmental Registry of Ontario is not \u201cin form or substance\u201d adequate to explore the impacts amendments to land use policy and legislation will have on these rights.\nThrough our research and collaborations, we have heard from both First Nations and municipal representatives across southern Ontario that a formal process is sorely needed to guide adequate engagement and consultation practices with First Nations. SON expressed the same sentiment in their comments, requesting a \u201cprocess in which SON is directly engaged and consulted about what Ontario is seeking to do, and how it will impact and enable infringements on SON\u2019s rights,\u201d informed by cataloging cumulative impacts of development.\nAdditionally, we have heard about the many gaps that exist in legislation and policy regarding archaeology, Indigenous engagement, and handling of artifacts and sacred sites including burial grounds. SON\u2019s comments once again address the lack of essential frameworks in place to mitigate, monitor and prevent impacts caused through archaeological work.\nOntario must ensure that the existing PPS provisions in place to respect and protect Indigenous interests are not weakened. As SON writes, \u201cthese provisions form a fundamental, overarching direction to land use planning that\u201d both SON and other Nations across Ontario rely to protect themselves from unwanted impacts of development on their lands, their rights, and themselves.\nProposed Provincial Planning Statement (PPS) Provisions\nIn this section, we outline our specific concerns with elements of the proposed planning policy instrument.\nPreamble & Vision. We are gratified that the government chooses to acknowledge \u201cthe unique role Indigenous communities have in land use planning and development.\u201d However, we are disheartened that this symbolic statement lacks substance. Specifically, there are no provisions made for the time, resources, funding, training, capacity building, statutory decision-making roles in provincial and\/or municipal planning processes to make such a statement meaningful.\n6.2 Co-ordination. Once again, we are gratified that the government insists that, \u201cPlanning authorities shall undertake early engagement with Indigenous communities and coordinate on land use planning matters to facilitate knowledge-sharing, support consideration of Indigenous interests in land use decision-making and support the identification of potential impacts of decisions on the exercise of Aboriginal or treaty rights.\u201d Once again, however, we note that capacity issues and the preying upon of community resources and time is not considered (see SON, 2017).\n4.0 Wise Use and Management of Resources. There is a deafening silence here on the inherent rights and interests of Indigenous peoples in the wise use of their resources on their territories, otherwise known as Ontario.\n4.6 Cultural Heritage and Archaeology. We are gratified that the government insists that, \u201cPlanning authorities shall engage early with Indigenous communities and ensure their interests are considered when identifying, protecting and managing cultural heritage and archaeological resources, built heritage resources and cultural heritage landscapes.\u201d However, we note that planning authorities are not mandated, but only \u201cencouraged to develop\u201d archaeological management plans, when AMPs are known to reduce construction-delaying incidents by at least 20%.\n6.1 General Policies for Implementation and Interpretation. We are gratified that the government insists on respecting the Indigenous Rights protected in Section 25 & 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.  However, we note that in the identification of key indicators to measure PPS outcomes, to be done \u201cin consultation with\u2026 Indigenous communities,\u201d there is no provision of resources for such an undertaking.\nPPS Language\nThe use of the phrase \u201cIndigenous communities\u201d is slowly becoming a term only used to represent those native people who live in town. If that is what is meant, and it is defined as such, then it is fine.  However, if the terms \u201cFirst Nations & Metis Nation of Ontario\u201d are what is meant, then that phrase is more appropriate.\nThe Greater Golden Horseshoe Growth Plan\nWhile numerous policies were or are now found in the PPS, integral policy components in the Growth Plan that have any application specific to the GGH have been abandoned, as has the entire basis of establishing a provincial plan to lay out and coordinate planning and resource management efforts in the GGH - one of the largest and fastest growing city regions in North America. To that end, maps laying out the visions and spatial connectivity of the GGH have been abandoned.\nWith the repeal of the Growth Plan the province now treats the region virtually the same as any other part of Ontario, despite being home to 70% of Ontarians, the vast majority of anticipated growth, and where major investments are being made in infrastructure, particularly in public transit via the $60 billion Regional Transportation Plan.\nThe repeal builds on the removal of planning authority for 6 regions in the GGH via Bill 23 (yet to be proclaimed). This is despite the fact regions are legally responsible for planning and funding major transit, sewer, water and social housing and managing growth amongst their lower tiers, based in part on those responsibilities along with oversight over large regional agricultural, natural and water resource systems.\nThe overall thrust is to create a laissez faire approach to regional planning empowered by the 96 single and lower tier municipal governments, rather than have it coordinated through the Province and the 21 upper and single tier governments. The major policy plank of promoting compact urban form within our major urban areas is now augmented by a major policy thrust to essentially allow any residential development \u2013 including scattered residential lots and subdivisions \u2013 including in prime agricultural areas.\nThis approach to planning encourages development sprawl that stands to impinge on Indigenous lands and rights, as discussed in previous sections of this comment. It also risks the further fragmentation of Ontario\u2019s planning regime, reducing the already precarious capacity of municipalities and Indigenous communities engaged in consultation and development processes.\nOur Suggestions\nDevelopment, specifically of residential projects, is sorely needed in the Province of Ontario and the ever-expanding GGH. However, it needs to be conducted in a way that protects and respects Indigenous, Aboriginal and Treaty Rights.\nTo that end, we ask that, moving forward in regards to planning legislation and policy, the Government of Ontario:\n1) Respects and accommodates requests emanating from First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities in Ontario\n2) Retains the strength of protective language used in PPS 2020\n3) Works with First Nations and M\u00e9tis governments to develop frameworks that facilitate meaningful consultation, accommodation, and archaeological processes\n4) Develop a policy planning tool that limits sprawl, which serves to enhance the pressures of development on Indigenous communities\nThank you for your consideration,\nThe Shared Path Team\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for consulting on the Province's proposed new Provincial Planning Statement (PPS). Attached is a copy of Report PDL-CPL-23-011.1 outlining the Regional Municipality of Waterloo's response to this proposal. Waterloo Regional Council accepted the report at its meeting on May 24, 2023.\nBelow is an executive summary of our report.\nThe proposed PPS 2023 would significantly scale back Ontario\u2019s current land use planning policy framework. This change is intended to stimulate housing supply by giving municipalities more control and flexibility to determine where and how they should grow, while continuing to support the goals of building healthy, liveable and complete communities.\nHowever, over the long term, the increased policy flexibility could result in a more fragmented approach to growth management at the regional scale. As a result, the proposed policy changes could potentially weaken strategic decision making on a wide range of Regional services, such as public transit, assisted housing, public health, economic development, and infrastructure including water supply and distribution, wastewater collection and treatment, and roads.\nMoving forward, ongoing close collaboration between the Region and its seven Area Municipalities will be essential to coordinate planning for growth with the planning, delivery and financing of various Regional services.\nThe Region and its Area Municipalities have been leaders in the protection of agricultural land for many years. If passed, the Province\u2019s proposal to permit up to three new residential lots on an existing farm parcel would significantly impact the quality and character of the region\u2019s countryside. These agricultural impacts would make it much harder to operate a farm in Waterloo Region, weaken the agricultural sector, and work against the goal of building a strong sustainable local food system.\nThank you once again for the opportunity to comment on this proposal. Please refer to the attached report for more detailed comments.\n",

        "comment":"The Upper Thames River Conservation Authority (UTRCA) has undertaken a review of the Environmental Registry of Ontario posting (ERO 019-6813) related to \u201creview of the proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument,\u201d alongside the draft Provincial Planning Statement document. Upper Thames River Conservation Authority staff appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed document that will guide land use planning across the Province and our watershed. We value working together to ensure liveable communities and thriving economies proceed in a safe and healthy environment under the direction of a comprehensive and integrated policy direction.\nABOUT US\nThe UTRCA is located in southwestern Ontario, covering a geographical area of 3,430 km2 and home to approximately 600,000 people. There are 17 member municipalities within our watershed with a range of urban and rural communities including the City of London, a large and fast growing municipality identified by the Province. The predominant land use within our watershed is agriculture, occupying approximately 2\/3 of the area, while urban and natural areas make up the remainder. The UTRCA collaborates with member municipalities and local counties to provide technical and planning policy review services to guide safe development and ensure consistency with the Provincial Policy Statement (2020) and other policies and guidelines. We work to ensure that planning decisions are coordinated with requirements under Section 28 of the Conservation Authorities Act to achieve efficient and timely approvals where permits are required for development.\nCONTEXT\nThe UTRCA offers a variety of services to aid in sustaining a healthy environment including supporting safe development, stewardship programs, providing natural spaces, and empowering communities and youth. It is our experience that municipal partners and watershed residents place enormous value on the natural features and water resources within their communities, and hold a strong desire to see growth managed in a sustainable manner that ensures the long-term protection of our natural environment. Conservation Authority\u2019s provide valuable services to protect, improve and restore natural assets.\nCOMMENTS\nOn June 27, 2023, Conservation Ontario submitted comments to the Province on behalf of all 36 Conservation Authorities. The UTRCA endorses those comments and provides the following additional comments. As per Chapter 1, this document has been read in its\u2019 entirety.\n1. Chapter 1, How to Read this Policy Statement, Provincial Guidance, pg. 3: The UTRCA supports the direction to complement the review of Provincial policy documents with guidance materials, guidelines and technical criteria. In particular, the MNRF Technical Guides for Flooding and Erosion are heavily relied upon in our industry. It is our understanding that future updates to these documents are expected and will assist in applying policies found under Section 5.1.\n2. Chapter 1, Vision, pg. 4 and 5:\na. Paragraph 2: To be consistent across the document, we recommend updating the second paragraph to include a \u201csafe\u201d environment.\nb. Paragraph 5: Complete communities represent good land use planning. To further support this idea, the UTRCA recommends including reference to the natural environment, not just recreation and public spaces.\nc. Paragraph 6: UTRCA recommends the final sentence be revised to include \u201cconvenient and safe access to housing.\nd. Paragraph 8: Prevention is the preferred method of addressing natural hazards. The UTRCA recommends revising to state that \u201cthe impacts of a climate change, will be avoided to the extent feasible or mitigated where other alternatives do not exist.\u201d The principle of avoidance over mitigation is a more prudent and cost-effective means of protecting people and property. Additionally, climate change is a pressing concern for the livability of our communities and the resiliency of infrastructure.\n3. Chapter 2, pg. 14 to 19: The UTRCA recommends revising the title of this chapter to include the previous language, such as \u201cBuilding Homes, Sustaining Strong, Healthy and Competitive Communities.\u201d\na. Policy 2.1.1: The UTRCA encourages the Province to consider the cumulative impacts of private servicing on water resources.\nb. Policy 2.2.1 b), 2.: To remain consistent with the policies under Chapter 5, the UTRCA recommends including language that residential intensification be \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cwhere locally appropriate\u201d to set appropriate expectations for landowners\/developers undertaking projects of this nature.\nc. Policy 2.3.2: The UTRCA encourages the addition of \u201cf) support safe development\u201d to ensure consideration is given to natural hazards.\nd. Policy 2.3.4: The UTRCA strongly recommends that settlement area changes \u201cshall\u201d consider the criteria provided, including the addition of \u201cf) the applicable lands do not compromise natural heritage or natural hazard features.\u201d\ne. Policy 2.4.2.3 a): The UTRCA is supportive of the proposed polices that allow for the consideration to reduce density targets that may be contrary to other Provincial policies, such as natural hazards.\nf. Policy 2.6.1 c): The UTRCA recommends that appropriate public servicing is available for new multi-lot residential development in rural areas due to the cumulative impacts on water resources that may occur as a result of numerous private systems.\ng. Policy 2.8.1.4: The UTRCA is strongly supportive of this policy. The UTRCA recommends implementing the same or similar language as it relates to residential development as well, where risks to people and property may be greater.\n4. Chapter 3, Infrastructure and Facilities, pg. 14 to 18:\na. Policy 3.1.4: The UTRCA is supportive of connection with policies from Chapter 5.\nb. Policy 3.2.1: The UTRCA is supportive of including \u201csafe\u201d transportation systems.\nc. Policy 3.5.1: The UTRCA is of the opinion that language could be added to strengthen that prevention\/avoidance is the preferred approach when dealing with natural hazards, and minimizing or mitigating risk is the final step in the hierarchy of considerations.\nd. Policy 3.6.1: The UTRCA is supportive of ensuring the natural environment and hazards are considered in planning for sewage and water services, as well as source protection planning.\ne. Policy 3.6.3: While the UTRCA considers the implementation of private servicing in select areas, there are concerns over using private servicing for multi-unit\/lot development. As per the comments provided on Chapter 2, there are potential cumulative impacts that could result. Additionally, we recommend revising the wording to state \u201cto support protection of the environment and avoid potential risks to public health and safety.\u201d\nf. Policy 3.6.8 d): Please consider revising to \u201cavoid\u201d, not \u201cminimize\u201d risks.\ng. Policy 3.9.1 c): Please consider revising to include \u201csafe public access to shorelines\u201d.\nh. Policy 3.9.1 d): Please consider revising to \u201cavoid\u201d, not \u201cminimize\u201d impacts.\n5. Chapter 4, Wise Use and Management of Resources, pg. 20 to 24:\na. Policy Section 4.1: The UTRCA strongly supports the Province\u2019s commitment to sustaining the wellbeing of our natural features and systems by maintaining the Natural Heritage policies.\nb. Policy 4.2.1 c): Please consider revising to \u201cavoid\u201d, not \u201cminimize\u201d potential impacts.\nc. Policy 4.2.1: Please consider re-instating the policy relating to climate change, as it is connected to the Vision of the document, \u201cevaluating and preparing for the impacts of a changing climate to water resource systems at the watershed level.\u201d\nd. Policy 4.2.1: Please consider re-instating the policy relating to stormwater, as it is a basic function of all forms of development and municipal servicing, \u201censuring stormwater management practices minimize stormwater volumes and contaminant loads, and maintain or increase the extent of vegetative and pervious surfaces.\u201d\ne. Policy 4.2.2: The UTRCA recommends revising the language to state \u201c\u2026will be protected, improve or restored. Alternative development approaches may be required, however where alternatives are not feasible, mitigation measures may be considered.\u201d\nf. Policy 4.2.3: The UTRCA is supportive of municipalities undertaking watershed planning. Please consider adding language that speaks to working with Conservation Authorities while undertaking a project of this nature.\ng. Policy Section 4.3: As the UTRCA watershed is largely comprised of agricultural lands, our staff work closely with this community to ensure watershed planning and applying natural hazard policies\/regulations does not prevent the continued use of agricultural lands for their intended purposes. The policies currently proposed in this section of the document place a greater emphasis on residential development and sprawl within the rural area, and are contrary to allowing agricultural uses to continue for their intended purposes. While these concerns are largely based on community building concerns and agricultural protection, they connect back to the natural environment through a variety of means such as servicing, impervious\/pervious surfaces, sprawl, climate change, etc.\nh. Policy 4.3.3.1 a) 4. iv: Please consider revising to include \u201csafe ingress and egress;\u201d\ni. Policy 4.3.3.1 a): The UTRCA is supportive of ensuring these matters address public health or safety concerns.\nj. Policy 4.3.3.3: The UTRCA encourages the addition of \u201cprotection of natural heritage or natural hazard lands, where the severance would result in the long-term protection of the overall natural environment system.\u201d The addition of this policy would align with Section 50 (3) (e) of the Planning Act, as it relates to Conservation Authorities acquiring land for preservation of environmentally sensitive or hazardous lands.\n6. Chapter 5, Protecting Public Health and Safety, pg. 27 to 28: Overall, the UTRCA is supportive of the Province\u2019s direction to continue protecting public health and safety.\na. Policy 5.1.2: Please re-instate the direction from the 2020 PPS which states \u201cMitigating potential risk to public health or safety, or of property damage from natural hazards, including the risks that may be associated with the impacts of a changing climate, will require the Province, planning authorities and conservation authorities to work together.\u201d\nAs per the Vision of this document, climate change is a pressing concern and will require all parties\/collaborators to work together to address its\u2019 impacts.\nb. Policy 5.2.1: The UTRCA encourages the addition of \u201cplanning authorities and Conservation Authorities shall identify\u2026\u201d\nc. Policy 5.2.2 b) and Policy 5.2.3 c): The UTRCA encourages the addition of \u201csurface water features\u201d, as it captures a more comprehensive list of features that may be hazardous.\nd. Policy 5.2.6 a): The UTRCA encourages the addition of \u201cadditional needs housing,\u201d as this use is newly defined within this PPS and encompasses some of the uses already listed.\n7. Chapter 6, Implementation and Interpretation, pg. 29 to 30:\na. Policy 6.1.4: The language used in this policy is vague and subjective. The UTRCA suggests re-instating previous language such as \u201csupport strong communities, a clean and healthy environment, and the economic vitality of the Province,\u201d etc.\nb. Policy 6.2.1 f): The UTRCA recommends revising this wording to include \u201cnatural and man-made hazards, including flooding, erosion and wetlands;\u201d\nIn closing, the UTRCA is of the opinion some of the changes proposed do not ensure that complete communities are designed appropriately. We recommend further consideration be given to the following areas of concern:\n\uf0b7- Require greater focus on the impacts of a changing climate;\n\uf0b7- Encourage greater cohesion for watershed planning, including interjurisdictional matters;\n\uf0b7- Ensure all forms of development are designed to be safe;\n\uf0b7- Require adequate and appropriate servicing for all new or re-development;\n\uf0b7- Consider cumulative impacts for new or re-development, particularly in agricultural areas; and,\n\uf0b7- Re-visit the hierarchy of avoidance, mitigation, and restoration \u2013 focusing on avoidance as the first consideration for all new or re-development.\nTo provide a transparent process, the UTRCA would be appreciative of receiving correspondence on how feedback was considered and either included or excluded within a revised document.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\nYours truly,\nUPPER THAMES RIVER CONSERVATION AUTHORITY\n",

        "comment":"The following comments are provided by myself, Devon McCloskey, RPP, MCIP, Manager of Planning Services, City of Thunder Bay.\nAs observed by many other planners (OPPI) and Municipalities in Northern Ontario such as Sudbury,  several policies within the proposed 2023 PPS are contradictory.\nI am supportive of policies that promote compact and complete communities, with mixed uses that are serviced with full urban municipal services, but I am not supportive of policies that would open up residential lot creation in prime agricultural areas, or lot creation in rural areas on private communal or partial services within rural areas,.\nI am also concerned that creating and expanding settlement areas without substantial justification, will lead to further pressure on municipal government to approve development in unserviced areas which is not financially viable and risks greater hardship in infrastructure planning, as well as greater burden on tax payers and asset management, negating efforts to resolve existing infrastructure gaps, and ultimately furthering social disparity between lower and higher income earners.\nThunder Bay, like many northern municipalities is not short on land supply, and needs stronger policy support to encourage compact development. Policies that allow for single serviced or partially serviced developments could be said to have been phased out already and should now be eliminated. Justification for partial servicing based on no negative impacts is dependent on D-Series Guidelines which do not properly contemplate small lot development on partial services.\nIf rural lot development is to be allowed in prime agricultural areas, rural lands within northern municipalities, which produce vegetables, hay, and pasture land, although not as productive as Southern Ontario farmland, are also vulnerable to speculative exclusive single detached residential development that is inefficiently planned and proposed on private services. Meanwhile, these lands are agriculturally productive and providing food to local citizens a practice that supports low carbon activities, food security, health and well-being.\n",

        "comment":"August 4, 2023\nERO Number: 019-6813\nSubmitted to: \tMinistry of Municipal Affairs and Housing\nMinistry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs\nSubmitted by:\tTown of Caledon, Business Attraction & Investment Division\nCommunity Services Department\nThank you for the opportunity to provide comments on behalf of the Business Attraction and Investment Division of the Town of Caledon for the proposed changes to the Provincial Policy Statement and Bill 97. To assist Caledon with preparing for significant future population and employment growth, please consider the following:\nEMPLOYMENT\nTwo of the key industrial sectors for the Town of Caledon are advanced manufacturing and food and beverage processing. We consider the uses associated with this sector as sensitive land uses which has not been specifically identified or included in the PPS, 2020 or within the proposes Provincial Planning Statement. The manufacturing and warehousing of these products require protection from neighbouring employment use contamination. The official plan designations, zoning by-laws and the Ontario Land Tribunal have not been effective in protecting these manufacturers from incompatible uses from locating beside them. We are concerned and would request that amendments be made within the proposed Provincial Planning Statement to amend and not remove the wording as was included within section 1.3.2.2. from the existing PPS, 2020 policy requiring separation or mitigation from sensitive land uses (including sensitive manufacturing operations) within employment areas planned for industrial and manufacturing uses.\nWithin the current Section 1.3.2.5 of the PPS and the concept of provincially significant employment zones, it would be beneficial for the Town of Caledon to have additional protection for employment areas. The Town of Caledon experienced a significant amount of warehouse and logistics development which has limited job density and opportunities for economic diversification in priority sectors, for example advanced manufacturing. Having some form of Provincial land use protection or policy mechanism to promote investment from sectors deemed a priority for the municipality and province would be extremely helpful for in ensuring the long-term viability of local economies.\nEMPLOYMENT AREAS\nSection 2.8.2 Employment Areas prohibits the opportunity for major standalone office development to locate within employment areas. Although office demand has decreased since the pandemic, it is difficult to predict with certainty future demands for employment land uses. We request the following content removed from Section 2.8.2 to ensure the Provincial Policy Statement allows for future shifts in employment demand:\nb) prohibiting residential uses, commercial uses, public service facilities and other institutional uses;\nc) prohibiting retail and office uses that are not associated with the primary employment use;\n\u2003\nRURAL AND AGRICULTURAL AREAS\nThe Town of Caledon\u2019s Business Attraction and Investment Division has identified agriculture and food production as key industrial sectors. Caledon\u2019s farm and agricultural businesses rely on the protection of its prime agricultural lands and the connectivity between the agricultural areas.\nThe Division is supportive of municipal comprehensive review processes that increase the density of residential development within our urban settlement areas and create jobs within our employment areas. To ensure agricultural systems are protected from negative impacts, the Division is not supportive of section 4.3.3 within the Proposed Provincial Planning Statement, 2023 and the additional creation of residential lots in agricultural areas. This policy would have an extremely negative impact on the current agricultural land base and the ability for farms to exist. Agricultural land must be recognized as a finite resource that is to be protected and preserved for present and future food production.  The potential for agricultural lands to be severed into 3 additional lots, would be detrimental to food production in Ontario.  Any increase of lots within a concession block will result in issues with trespass, nutrient application, odor, sound and sight complaints for present and future farm operations.\nThe Town of Caledon\u2019s Business Attraction and Investment Division supports the continuation of the Agricultural Systems Mapping and the approach to be required rather than encouraged for all municipalities as per 4.3.1.1.\nThe Town of Caledon\u2019s Business Attraction and Investment Division has identified tourism as one of its key sectors. As such, the Town is supportive of Section 2.5 Rural Areas in Municipalities,\n1. e) promoting diversification of the economic base and employment opportunities through goods and services, including value-added products and the sustainable management or use of resources;\nf) providing opportunities for sustainable and diversified tourism, including leveraging historical, cultural, and natural assets;\nCaledon\u2019s main assets are its unique rural and agricultural characteristics. To ensure the long-term viability of this sector we ask that the Province ensure the long-term protection of the lands within the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine and Niagara Escarpment Plan areas. It is critical that policies and actions are in place for the conservation of our environmental, rural and agricultural areas to support the Town\u2019s Corporate Vision to offer the best of rural and urban life for everyone.\n",

        "comment":"The following comments from the Township of Laurentian Valley are being provided by the Township Planner as directed per resolution of Council.\nCOMMENTS FROM THE TOWNSHIP OF LAURENTIAN VALLEY\nERO POSTING NUMBER 019-6813\nReview of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nThe following comments are provided as directed by Resolution of Council of the Township of Laurentian Valley related to the Province of Ontario\u2019s Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nNeed for Differentiation of Planning Across all of Ontario:\nAs the Provincial Planning Statement applies provincewide, there should be a clear delineation between urban, rural, and northern communities and the differences in planning for them respectively.\nSupport for the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA):\nThe Provincial Planning Statement proposes large-scale changes to prime agricultural and rural areas by allowing additional severances and rural residential development.  These changes risk adversely impacting the long-term viability of farms due to the sometimes-disruptive nature of farming operations, including raising livestock.  Additionally, rural municipalities which have limited fiscal resources, will be shouldered with additional infrastructure burdens to support this low-density growth in agricultural areas.\nThe Township supports the following comments issued by OFA in a January 6, 2023 statement:\n\u201cOFA supports the current lot creation policies under Section 2.3.4.1 of the PPS (2020) as is. OFA is utterly opposed to any re-introduction of lot creation policies in the agricultural area that may resemble policies in previous versions of the PPS. We desire to work with the Ontario government to increase density and housing in rural Ontario in ways that do not sacrifice farmland. Anywhere low-density housing already exists presents critical opportunities to advance \u201cgentle density\u201d that addresses the provincial housing supply, preserves farmland, and builds complete communities characterized by smart growth principles in land use planning. OFA believes that in prime agricultural areas, the only permitted uses should be agricultural uses, agriculture-related uses, and on-farm diversified uses.\u201c\nBased on initial early feedback from the OFA, it is understood that there are indications that the Province will be pulling back from the initial direction that would have over-ridden municipal planning policies and would have allowed for additional severances. With the distance separation requirements between livestock buildings\/barns and manure storage, through the Minimum Distance Separation (MDS), the presence of additional dwellings in agricultural areas would also further constrain the potential for certain farm\/livestock expansion.  It is noted that in Laurentian Valley, the trend has been for larger farms through a number of farm operators acquiring additional farm properties and severing the surplus existing dwelling as they need the land not the house. This provides the opportunity for retiring farmers and\/or family members to remain near the farm. It is also noted that within Laurentian Valley, much of the prime agriculture lands that are designated Agriculture are also in areas where there is Karst topography (potential hazard lands) and near bedrock resources for aggregate quarries, all of which place other constraints on residential development but not agriculture.\nIt is recommended that the Province accept the OFA position on this issue and revise the proposed policy change as farming can only occur in areas that are suitable for agriculture while residential development has other options on where to locate. There are other approaches that the Province needs to implement in order to achieve an increase in affordable and attainable housing.\nAdditional Policy Clarity Required and Education and Support:\nAs noted in the comments issued by the Ontario Professional Planners Institute (OPPI) in the July 24, 2023 comment letter to Minister Clark, \u201cThough the Provincial Planning Statement strives to streamline the planning process in Ontario to speed up the delivery of new housing, the simplification of numerous policies and removal of core policies compared to the Growth Plan and Provincial Policy Statement may have the opposite effect.  By providing less clarity and direction across numerous policies and chapters, the document may create unintended ambiguity which can delay the planning process and subject planning applications to political, rather than policy-based approval processes and decisions. This ambiguity may also lead to more appeals and hearings to argue the intent of the Provincial Planning Statement, which represents the opposite of streamlining the planning process.\nTo ensure effective communication of these foundational changes, the Province should develop a robust communications and education plan that reaches a wide audience, including the public, development community, and elected officials.  The responsibility for introducing and defending the new provincial planning policies should not solely rest on local municipalities.  Additionally, Municipal Services Offices within the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing should be adequately staffed to provide support to municipal planners with navigating new policies and legislation.  These offices should also be authorized to offer interpretations, provide \u201cone window\u201d comments, make Minister\u2019s modifications and, where necessary, make appeals in order to respond to the Auditor General\u2019s December 2021 recommendations regarding monitoring and implementation. Since there is no appeal mechanism for the provincial policy changes, the Province should prioritize transparency and accountability to the public.  Providing a detailed response with the notice of decision, outlining how all feedback was considered and addressed (or reasons for non-addressal), would foster this transparency.\u201d\nThe comments from OPPI set out in the July 24, 2023, letter to Minister Clark need to be considered and addressed.\nIt is noted that with past significant PPS reviews, the Province engaged in more robust consultation programs with municipalities and stakeholders, including workshops for gathering input and discussion with planners, the public, municipal representatives and other stakeholders. The approach to simply post a draft on ERO for a comment period without full details, prior to adoption places a heavy burden on municipal staff and stakeholders to review and comment, particularly during this time in Ontario where planning departments are experiencing unprecedented workloads and challenges that include keeping up with changes as a result of constantly changing provincial legislation. Opportunities to be engaged in sessions and workshops where provincial staff can provide explanation and overviews of changes, prior to round table inputs would help streamline processes and allow for more meaningful and collaborative comments from municipalities to the Province on proposal for legislative changes. There are concerns that the changes being proposed will not actually achieve the objectives of streamlining process to achieve more affordable and attainable housing in Ontario but rather will create new problems while still not assisting in addressing the issues around the housing crisis in a meaningful way.\nCouncil feels that it is important for municipalities to voice their concerns related to the direction that the Province has been taking in terms of proposed legislation changes and to engage in consultation process when opportunities are presented. With the current legislative approach of the Province many changes are occurring with little consultation with municipal stakeholders. Unfortunately, this misses out on important insights on what the issues really are that are contributing to the housing crisis. More meaningful collaboration between the Province and municipalities would benefit all Ontarians in the joint goal of finding ways to address the supply issue of affordable and attainable housing.\nThank you for consideration of the comments from the Township of Laurentian Valley.\n",

This initiative resonates with our company's ethos of promoting sustainable and responsible development.\nThe proposed Statement's comprehensive approach to land use planning, which balances appropriate development with the protection of provincial resources, public health, safety, and the quality of the natural and built environment, is commendable. We believe that this approach will contribute significantly to a more effective and efficient land use planning system whilst taking significant steps to address the Housing Supply Crisis.\nMoreover, the Statement's emphasis on comprehensive, integrated, place-based, and long-term planning aligns with our commitment to fostering strong communities, a clean and healthy environment, and economic growth. We are particularly encouraged by the Statement's focus on providing a diverse range of housing options for all Ontarians.\nWe strongly urge that the proposed Provincial Planning Statement be adopted as soon as possible. The sooner it is put in place, the sooner we can begin to mitigate the ongoing housing crisis in Ontario.\nWe are eager to witness the positive impacts of the proposed Provincial Planning Statement on Ontario's land use planning and development. Rest assured, the Ahmed Group is committed to working within this framework and contributing to the achievement of housing objectives across Ontario.\nWe extend our gratitude for your efforts in improving land use planning and management in Ontario. We stand ready to support and contribute to the successful implementation of the proposed Provincial Planning Statement.\nSincerely,\nMoe Ahmed\nPresident and CEO\nAhmed Group of Companies Inc.\n",

However, Wynford remains concerned with how the new definition of \u201cEmployment Area\u201d may be interpreted in the absence of clearer direction on the status of lands that are currently designated as Employment Areas in municipal official plans and that currently either include permissions for and\/or have existing commercial and institutional uses. These lands would now be expressly excluded from the new definition of Employment Areas. In particular, we respectfully recommend that the Minister include clear policy guidance that confirms that lands with permitted or existing commercial or institutional uses are no longer subject to policies requiring Employment Lands conversions in order to be redesignated and that such lands may amend their official plan designation by way of an official plan amendment application pursuant to section 22 of the Planning Act. In addition, we also respectfully recommend that the Minister impose timeframes for municipalities to update their official plans and zoning by-laws to be consistent with the New PPS.\n",

        "comment":"The Honourable Steven Clark\n Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing\nDear Minister Clark,\nI live and farm in Wilmot Township near New Dundee in Waterloo Region\nI address you today with a heavy heart. The community that I know and love is under threat from pending legislation involving changes to the Provincial Policy Statement and Bill 97. The implications are many and profound but I will focus on two changes specifically, they being the threat to Prime Farmland from the proposal to allow 3 severances per farm parcel and opening up of land zoned \u201crural\u201d to development.\nWe live in a special place here in Waterloo. It is arguably the most innovative, dynamic, well planned and prosperous community in Ontario if not all of Canada.\nAt the same time, surrounding this urban footprint, is one of the most fertile, productive, and prosperous agricultural communities in Ontario,  a community that features the second highest farm income per acre and per farm in Ontario.\nThat doesn\u2019t just happen! It\u2019s not an accident. We, as a region, planned to be the best urban and rural municipality in Canada. Our culture of good planning, countryside lines, farmland protection, a prohibition on farm severances since 1973, and deliberate intensification, is not only an urban success story, it is a rural agricultural success story. Our leadership and our Official Plan are the template for good planning, housing people from around the world, innovation, prosperity and farmland protection in municipalities throughout Ontario.\nWhat is threatened? Only 5% of Ontario\u2019s landmass is suitable for agriculture and less than one half of that is considered to be prime like we have here in Waterloo. The proposed unappealable ability to obtain 3 severances per farm parcel and the opening up of \u201crural\u201d land for development threatens the ability of farmers in Ontario to conduct the business of farming in a safe and profitable manner.\nThe detrimental impacts of lot creation are well documented. They include the fragmentation of the agricultural land base, increased conflicts between neighbouring land uses, and the inflation of farmland values which makes the purchase of farmland by new entrants unattainable. As farmers, here in Waterloo and across the province, we have worked diligently to manage, mitigate and minimize conflict between farming and non-farming neighbours by supporting Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) formulas to properly separate farms and residential lots.\nDr. Wayne Caldwell, former professor of rural planning at the University of Guelph has calculated that the addition of 3 severances and accompanying dwellings and the resulting MDS on every farm will make it impossible for farmers to build or expand livestock facilities in Ontario. He predicts that livestock farming will disappear within the 30 planning time frame imposed by the Province. That would be tragic not only for Waterloo but for the province as a whole.\nShould proposed changes to the PPS come into effect, all four townships in Waterloo Region have the potential to sever at least 2000 new lots. If every severance averages 1 hectare, that means over 8,000 hectares or 20,000 acres of farmland would disappear. At 2.5 people per dwelling, these 8,000 severances would accommodate 20,000 residents. If these same 8,000 hectares were located within an urban boundary, (at a density of 50 people per acre) they could accommodate more than 400,000 people. One has to ask, is this good stewardship of our precious farmland resource.\nThe opening up of land zoned \u201crural\u201d also presents an enormous threat to agriculture. The rural designation is integrated throughout the agricultural landscape of Ontario and for the most part is composed of high quality farmland. The proposal to allow low density sprawl to occur here, presents the same problems as rural severences except at a much larger scale. Farmland surrounded by islands of residential development precludes the growth of livestock agriculture and presents an ever present impediment to normal farm practices including the ability to move farm equipment on highways frequented by those living in and commuting from the countryside.\nWe live in a special place here in Ontario and particularly in Waterloo Region. Our regional form of collaborative government has enabled us to build a community that is the envy of many. It was Waterloo Region that allowed us to pioneer the Protected Countryside designation, the Environmentally Sensitive landscape designation, the LRT, the Countryside Line, a prosperous urban landscape and a prosperous rural landscape. The evidence is clear that visionary regional government works. We invite you to take the opportunity to visit Waterloo Region. Take a walk through downtown Kitchener or Waterloo and look at the skyline that profiles our innovative and prosperous economy, or step outside this very building and survey a landscape that not only feeds us but sustains every part of our natural environment. We urge you to consider using Waterloo Region as the template for growth, affordable housing, innovation, prosperity, good planning and farmland protection in Ontario.\nFinally, please remember that farmland is a non- renewable natural resource and that those who chose to protect it will be remembered by future generations for their foresight.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"Any planning policy changes that will reduce development density, and increase the rate of agricultural land consumption from the already current high rate ( estimate 319 acres\/ day ) should be removed from current proposals. I'm submitting further comments below for additional context.\nAgriculture is a diversified and complex industry. 50 years of planning policy framework in Ontario have helped to plan the future of agriculture. This framework has recognized that farming is an industry, and mixed uses including residential, shouldn't be interspersed within an agricultural zoning.

It is troubling to note that our concerns have only grown by the actions of this provincial government the weeks since our original submission.\nWe have seen farming organizations across the province unite and fight the absurd three rural severances proposal that doesn't seem to have been thought about in advance by anyone other than land speculators as its impacts would be so far reaching and devastating across the entire province - forever impairing our ability to feed ourselves, protect our groundwater and farm efficiently.\nWe have seen the Natural Heritage System and Agricultural System updates released that while not containing many changes themselves have new definitions that completely change the context of things in very negative manners.\nWe have seen our membership grow considerably and protests grow larger and larger as more citizens are so horrified by the actions of this government seemingly serving only developers and private interests at the expense of the greater public good they are actively taking to the streets and protesting with very creative signage and very angry letters.  Not only are the crowds increasing in size but the sheer number and diversity of groups participating are unprecedented in recent decades.  Environmental groups, climate change groups, agricultural groups, neighbourhood associations, community groups, unions, affordable housing groups, the list goes on and on of organizations coming together to speak up and oppose this government and these proposals to the PPS, Bill 23, Bill 97, the Greenbelt takeouts and many other issues.\nPlease seriously reconsider these actions.  Please listen to our membership and act in the interest of citizens - not developers and do what is needed for our future - not solely profits - this includes environmental protection, climate action, farmland protection and building sustainable communities - not just houses at any cost.\nThank you.\n",

(Section 4.6)\n\u00b7\tHeritage resources which qualify for designation under the Ontario Heritage Act, but not already formally recognized by municipalities, risk demolition. Municipalities will not be able to protect the heritage value of a property when it is threatened by new development.\n\u00b7\tBecause this statement applies only to protected properties, municipalities will not be able to assess non-protected properties to see if the heritage attributes should be protected.\n\u00b7\tThe proposed Provincial Planning Statement undermines the Planning Act which clearly states \"the conservation of features of significant architectural, cultural, historical, archaeological or scientific interest\" is a matter of provincial interest.\n\u00b7\tPolicy 4.6.1 should be strengthened to say \"Cultural heritage property, which may contain built heritage resources or cultural heritage landscapes, shall be conserved.\"\nIt will reduce the likelihood that existing buildings will be kept, maintained and reused, weakening Ontario's ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change.\n\u00b7\tSection 2.9 on \u201cEnergy Conservation, Air Quality and Climate Change\u201d needs to specifically mention that maintaining, retrofitting and adaptively reusing existing buildings and structures is a good way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of a changing climate.\n\u00b7\tProperties that currently meet the criteria for designation, which have not yet been designated, due to time and financial constraints, which were significant under the former PPs are no longer allowed to also be protected.\n\u00b7\tThere are 33,000 properties on municipal registries, which have some heritage potential, but have not been afforded full protection. If these are not designated by December 31,2024, they will have no protection.

Some municipal governments have no specialists who can evaluate the listed properties to see if they should be protected.\n\u00b7\tMunicipal heritage procedures have been in place for about 50 years and there have been extremely few cases where heritage properties put new development at risk. If a building with heritage value was in a location where development was planned, the development simply went around it. There are a number of cases in our region where the homes built in the late 1800s are still intact, with large subdivisions all around them. These properties have retained their heritage value and in addition are sold for large sums of money.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Provincial Officals,\nMy comments reflect my expertise as a PhD land, environmental, and resource economists, including my 25 years research experience and findings.  I am a full professor in the School of Planning at the University of Waterloo.\nThe proposed PPS abandons important principles that were contained in the previous growth plan and PPS.  Those principles encouraged sustainable urban intensification and protection of natural assets.  They are critical to building sustainable and livable environments.  With climate threats increasing, they are also crucial for protecting the people of Southern Ontario against climate flood and heat island risks.  Encouraging compact development and intensification, while maintaining blue green infrastructure, is also fiscally sound, as it encourages municipalities to provide housing at least infrastructure cost.\nThe new PPS appears to be based on incorrect assumptions about housing needs and how to address them.  It\u2019s well known that land for housing is not scarce.  Instead, the major barriers to housing provision including investor led financing models and too low \u201cas of right\u201d unit numbers on all residential lands.  As of right zoning for 4 units, plus floating zoning for 10 unit apartment buildings, on all existing residential lots, would go a long way towards addressing housing supply and affordability.  This policy was the consensus view of the housing task force.  Policies need to encourage parking lot conversion, instead of ag land conversion.\n15 years of housing research indicates that households want housing, green space, and urban amenities.  They can only afford intensified housing with reasonable transportation costs.\nThe provinces policies are not evidence based.  They don\u2019t appropriately consider household sizes  and housing needs.  Such a major policy deserves credible analysis.\nFinally, allowing additional rural housing disproportionately harms ag land.  My thesis research showed how quickly ag land uses can be destroyed via land market pressures as other uses harm the viability of agriculture. It\u2019s a bad idea.\nFinally uncertain policy environments harm the real estate development industry.  No one can keel up with the chaotic and unpredictable changes.\nthanks,\nDawn Parker\nProfessor, school of planning\nUniversity of Waterloo\n",

The APA is specifically concerned with the language under Section 4.6, namely:\n1.\tThe APA requests that statements be updated to clarify and emphasize that lands containing previously unidentified archaeological resources shall be conserved in the same manner as lands with known and protected archaeological resources. The proposed policy statement contains language declaring the need to conserve archaeological resources and cultural heritage landscapes on protected heritage properties (Section 4.6.1) and the requirement that development and land alteration activity on lands containing archaeological resources or with archaeological potential can only proceed once those resources have been conserved (Section 4.6.2.) However, it is not clear within either statement that lands containing unidentified archaeological resources will be subject to rigorous archaeological survey methods to identify those resources and evaluate their cultural heritage value or interest.\n2.\tWhile the APA lauds the proposed policy statements that encourage municipalities to develop archaeological management plans (Section 4.6.4) and requires that municipalities engage with Indigenous communities early in the process of identifying, protecting, and conserving archaeological resources (Section 4.6.5), we emphasize that there needs to be responsible multi-party oversight of these processes.\n3.\tThe language throughout Section 4.6 emphasizes the need to conserve archaeological resources where \u201cconserve\u201d is defined as \u201cthe identification, protection, management and use of built heritage resources, cultural heritage landscapes and archaeological resources in a manner that ensures their cultural heritage value or interest is retained.\u201d While the definition includes mitigative measures, we request that language be clarified to ensure that the definition of \u201cconserve\u201d includes the protection of archaeological resources through excavation and curation of those resources or through Avoidance and Protection of archaeological resources (see MCM Standards and Guidelines for Consultant Archaeologists, 2011).\nFurthermore, as a major organization representing the archaeological profession within Ontario, the APA requests that the Ministry engage directly with our organization throughout the process of updating the provincial policy statement and in all future legislation that has the capacity to significantly affect the archaeological process within Ontario. Our members work on archaeological assessments triggered by land development throughout the province of Ontario and are collectively involved in hundreds of archaeological projects every year. We kindly request that the APA be informed by the Ministry in advance of any future policy proposals that have the capacity to significantly alter the process of archaeological assessment within the province so that we have the opportunity to meet with Ministry staff early in the proposal process.\nSincerely,\nJordan Downey,\nDirector of Investigations, APA (Ontario)\nAuthorized by the Executive of the Association of Professional Archaeologists (Ontario)\nCc: Laura McRae, President, APA (Ontario)\nCc: Lawrence Jackson, Vice President, APA (Ontario)\n",

I was born, raised, live and work in the Greater Golden Horseshoe.  I participated in the initial public consultation process for \u201cA Place to Grow:  Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe almost 20 years ago.  I also attended and participated in the 2015 Consolidated Plan Review under David Crombie.\n\u201cThe Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, 2006 was the first growth plan to provide a framework for implementing Ontario\u2019s vision for building stronger, prosperous communities by better managing growth in this region.  It established the long-term framework for where and how the region will grow, while recognizing the realities facing our cities and smaller communities and acknowledging what governments can and cannot influence.  It also demonstrated leadership for improving the ways in which our cities, suburbs, towns, and villages will grow over the long-term.\u201d  The Vision for our GGH is as follows:\n\u2022\tThe GGH will continue to be a great place to live, work and play\n\u2022\tA strong economy and an approach that puts people first\n\u2022\tProtects the Greenbelt and ensures a cleaner environment is passed on to future generations\n\u2022\tSupports the achievement of complete communities (transit, protected employment zones and an increase in the amount and variety of housing available)\nFurthermore, our cultural heritage resources and open spaces in our cities, towns, and countryside will provide people with a sense of place.\nI strongly oppose the creation of a new Planning Statement which is aimed at accelerating housing development at the expense of other matters of provincial interest.  Eliminating the Growth Plan under the guise of incorporating its\u2019 policies into a new Planning Statement jeopardizes years of land use policy and disregards the commitment and engagement in the development of the Plan.\nFollowing are examples of Growth Plan (2020) and Provincial Policy Statement (2020) policies that will be weakened or eliminated should this proposal be put onto effect:\nGGH 2020 (4.2.8.2 a) protects key natural heritage features and key hydrologic features in significant wetlands, habitat of endangered species and threatened species, and significant woodlands (subject to definition and demonstration) by PROBITING new mineral aggregate operations, ancillary and accessory uses.\n-\tSometimes you have to say NO and sometimes you have to say NO repeatedly (see ERO-019-1680 proposal and the subsequent decision)\nPPS Proposed (4.5.4.2 a) b) all references to specialty crop areas (removed) consideration for other alternatives (removed) and protection of prime agricultural lands (removed through changes to rehabilitation in the proposed planning document)\n-\tPrime agricultural lands and specialty crop areas (and recognition of their unique microclimates) must be IDENTIFIED and PROTECTED for long-term use.  They are a finite and non-renewable resource)\nPPS Proposed   (3.5 Land Use Compatibility) has been significantly altered to favor major facilities without the need for a reciprocal assessment of sensitive land uses.\n-\tStressing a one-way impact assessment which favors major facilities without emphasizing a reciprocal sensitive land use assessment, will increase land use conflicts.  The onus is on the major facility to initially, continually and permanently eliminate or minimize adverse effects to public health and safety on impacted sensitive land uses. This does not represent good planning.\nIn addition to the above, I am not in support of rewriting a Policy Statement and Growth Plan under a demonstrably false premise.  \u201cLand is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts\u201d (Ontario\u2019s Housing Affordability Task Force, 2022).  What is presented here is short-sighted.  Both the Provincial Policy Statement (2020) and the Growth Plan for the GGH (2020) are critical provincial policies that provide comprehensive, integrative, and balanced direction on land use planning in Ontario.\nThe proposed document has far-reaching, long-term and irreversible outcomes by proposing changes that would:\n-\tEliminate mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets\n-\tDisregard decades of land use policy in favor of land development at a time when a changing climate is threatening and irreparably damaging our natural environment, our health, and our safety\n-\tAllow municipalities to expand settlement areas at any time, while eliminating Municipal Comprehensive Reviews which promotes sprawl\n-\tRedirect growth into unserviced areas, including prime farmland, and targets growth to cities that may not have the capacity to supply clean drinking water.  The report from the Walkerton enquiry is comprehensive, extensive and critical to these proposals\n-\tRemoves the requirements for municipalities to undertake watershed planning.  This is contrary to Policy 4.2 (Policies for Protecting What is Valuable, The Growth Plan 2020) which states that \u201cUpper- and single-tier municipalities, partnering with lower-tier municipalities and conservation authorities as appropriate, will ensure that watershed planning will be undertaken to support a comprehensive, integrated, and long-term approach to the protection, enhancement, or restoration of the quality and quantity of a watershed.\u201d\n-\tAbandon Ontario\u2019s long-standing commitment to promote compact, transit-friendly development and prevent sprawl\n-\tEliminate the Growth Plan which identifies and protects our natural heritage, water resources and agricultural systems, our cultural heritage resources and our sense of place\nIn conclusion, the frequency of the Environmental Registry of Ontario\u2019s Proposals by the current provincial government is indicative of the numerous and recent law and policy changes.  It is unsettling for the public, municipal and regional governments.\nIn the interest of the public and future generations of Ontarians, I urge you to exercise caution. DO NOT PROCEED with the replacement of these two key policies.  \u201cThey have been developed over decades based on the experience of municipalities, expertise of planners and through intensive public consultation.\u201d (Ontario Nature and Environmental Defence submission ERO 019-6177).  The things that are being proposed are things you can\u2019t take back (Bruce Arthur, Toronto Star April 11, 2023).\n",

        "comment":"RE: Agricultural Lot Severances, ERO #019-6813 for review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument\nDear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime agricultural areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023, section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments.\nComments regarding section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nI am concerned about proposed s.4.3.3 which permits the severance of three residential lots from parcels in prime agricultural areas. This poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. As it currently reads, this policy could apply to any parcel of agricultural land, regardless of its size or whether it was previously severed before January 2023. Given that there are 48,346 farms4 and as many as 170,000 farmland properties in Ontario5, the province could see anywhere from 145,038 to 510,000 lots severed from agricultural properties. Therefore, if each lot is approximately 1-acre in size, this policy alone would be responsible for removing anywhere from 1.25% to 4.3% of Ontario\u2019s finite agricultural land base.\nThe use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays6. While I appreciate that proposed s.4.3.1 states \u201cPlanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach,\u201d this policy does not provide the strength needed to require agricultural systems, and appears to be in contradiction to the permissions of s.4.3.3. When you factor in s.4.3.2.5, which permits up to two additional dwellings in prime agricultural areas, this could result in as many as 1.5 million dwellings on newly severed lots in agricultural areas. This will lead to significant farmland fragmentation, which is contradictory to the purpose of an agricultural system, and will cause significant disruptions to surrounding agricultural operations.\nMoving to rural areas often means embracing the realities of agricultural living, such as noise, dust, odors, and farm equipment on the roads. Unfortunately, this leads to land-use compatibility conflicts that are difficult to mitigate once residential units are developed in agricultural areas. This poses significant challenges for farmers, especially when Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) is not properly followed during development approvals. This is concerning given that Bill 23 prevents third-party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal, making it difficult for nearby farmers to address MDS concerns. Additionally, constructing residential units up to the MDS line will limit any future growth of the agricultural operation, threatening the future viability of animal agriculture in Ontario.\nFurthermore, additional residential units on prime agricultural areas will result in an increase in water usage from underground aquifers. Three additional lots, including three additional residential units would put a significant strain on the water usage and increase the likelihood of water source issues for both the residents and the agricultural operation. Agriculture uses significant amounts of water to irrigate crops and provide water to livestock. Although a large percentage of water is returned to the source, often it has been changed and carrying soil and dissolved compounds7. With less water available in the aquifer, any contaminants will be more concentrated. Therefore, permitting three lot severances in prime agricultural areas will have significant implications for water availability and safety.\nBy permitting lot severances, the province will be impacting the financial accessibility of farmland for the next generation of farmers, making farming less financially viable. Each farm property will likely increase in price relative to the value of three vacant lots in the respective region. Ontario experienced a 19.4% increase in property values in 20228, making it unattainable or financially unfeasible for many young farmers to buy land. The proposed severance policies will incentivize developers, who can outbid young farmers, to purchase farmland or provide cash incentives for farmers to sever lots, contributing to the increase in farmland prices. This will result in the next generation experiencing a fragmented agricultural system and keeping ownership of farmland out of their reach. This is concerning because if the next generation of farmers cannot afford to farm, and experience it as increasingly difficult to farm, the province will not have a viable agricultural sector for much longer.\nI have noticed that the new proposed PPS 2023 states in policy 4.3.1.2, \u201cAs part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d However, permitting lot severances for residential use contradicts lands being designated for the long-term protection for agriculture.\nI believe that the proposed s. 4.3.2.5, which would allow two additional units on existing farm properties, could be significant in providing housing opportunities for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. Similarly, the proposed s. 2.2.1.b.2 allows more land for housing by converting existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use. Given these other proposed policies permitting additional housing and the significant concerns over the proposed lot creation policies, I question why there is a need to permit such a significant allowance for severances.\nFurthermore, permitting these severances is in contradiction to proposed s. 2.2.1.c, \u201cpromoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation.\u201d S.4.3.3 will not promote efficiency in these areas and will detract from the intentions to support intensification.\nI believe that municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising between non-farming residents and the agricultural community. However, proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being more restrictive, which could be vital for preventing these types of conflicts. For rural communities whose economies and culture are intricately associated with agriculture, s.4.3.3.2 will prevent municipalities from protecting a key component of their communities and is contradictory to the content on page 3 that states the PPS 2023 recognizes the diversity of Ontario and that local context is important. S.4.3.3.2 restricts rural municipalities from ensuring the local context of their agricultural system is protected from farmland fragmentation.\nI, therefore, urge the province to consider these concerns and remove s.4.3.3 in its entirety so that the proposed changes do not harm the province\u2019s agricultural lands and the farmers who depend on them. The province should require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping and allow municipalities to implement additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and prevent conflicts with non-farming residents.\nThank you for considering our submission, and I look forward to the province\u2019s response.\nSincerely,\nHailey\nReferences:\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"I would like to voice my strong opposition to these proposed planning changes. They fly in the face of the escalating climate emergency we are in, and make a mockery of what a true conservative would do. We should be doubling down on promoting housing density within existing settlement areas, while protecting our natural resources and our irreplaceable farmland. This provincial PC government's own report showed there is already enough existing supply of developable land, and recommended we retain the important protections we have - for a reason! - for our green spaces, our water, our forests, our arable land, our quality of life. What this government is proposing, tearing apart these important regulations in order to promote a type of development that is not sustainable nor resilient, should be illegal. Indeed we do most definitely face a housing crisis, but the solution is not to deregulate more, it should be to support energy efficient, FF-free housing planning development.\nIt makes me incredibly despondent to see this government renege on its promises to protect green space, and then go further and work to undermine all the progress that should rather be built upon to make our province a more livable and resilient place to live. Right now it seems that all these proposed planning changes will do is grow the profit of certain developers at the expense of the rest of us, as we are all exposed to the increasingly uncertain weather encouraged by these GHG-positive policies, the potential lawsuits from people who buy not-fit-for-purpose houses built on these newly deregulated lands, and the prospect of living in a province where profit is more important than our collective future.\n",

        "comment":"The Honourable Steven Clark\nMinister of Municipal Affairs and Housing\n17th Floor, 777 Bay Street\nToronto, Ontario M7A 2J3\nSubmitted via email to Minister.mah@ontario.ca. Growthplanning@ontario.ca and via the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO)\nDear Minister Clark.\nRE: ERO 019-6813 Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nThe Waterloo Federation of Agriculture has endeavored to represent the interests of its farmer members for over 80 years.  We focus our lobbying activities on ensuring that Waterloo Region continues to be a leader in both urban and rural planning thus ensuring a vibrant and productive rural agricultural countryside as well as an innovative world class urban community. We continue to support upper tier planning as it is best able to employ visionary planning ideas that have contributed to Waterloo\u2019s status as a world class centre for innovation, education, and manufacturing. We have also collectively and intentionally planned a community that can provide places for people to live and work and at the same time protected valuable and productive farmland. We firmly believe that the solution to the housing shortage  in Ontario lies within the planning policies employed by the Region of Waterloo, the current PPS and Places to Grow.\nSouthern Ontario is a unique place in North America in that its climate, its soils and its proximity to the moderating influence of the Great Lakes allow it to grow a longer list of field crops, fruits, vegetables and livestock than any other locality on the continent other than the Central Valley in California. Unfortunately this farmland is in peril if we do not intentionally plan to protect it. The Ontario Federation of Agriculture calculates that if proposed planning policy changes are enacted, the current rate of farmland loss of 319 acres per day will increase to such an extent that we will lose half ( 6 million acres) of our existing farmland by 2051. This is a wholly preventable tragedy.\nWe suggest the following solutions to the housing shortage in Ontario and the concurrent need to protect farmland.\n\u25cf\tWe strongly oppose new residential lot creation on the agricultural landscape. The detrimental impacts of lot creation are well documented. They include the fragmentation of the agricultural land base, increased conflicts between neighbouring land uses and the inflation of farmland values which makes the purchase of farmland by new entrants unattainable. Agriculture flourishes in Waterloo Region where we have not allowed rural non-farm severences since 1973. We attribute our province leading income per farm and income per acre to the fact that we recognize the need to support an agricultural landscape system that prioritizes agriculture in rural Ontario.\n\u25cf\tWe strongly oppose changes to land designated as \u201cRural\u201d  that will allow scattered rural development, unconnected suburbs and low density urbanization of the landscape. The vast majority of land zoned \u201cRural\u201d is also farmland and needs to be protected from residential lot creation.\n\u25cf\tWe support hard settlement boundary policies. They are an essential part of a long term planning process that ensures that farmland is protected and that urban growth occurs in a fashion that is sustainable.\n\u25cf\tWe support mandated intensification requirements for all urban centres. Waterloo has a current intensification rate of over 70%. Intensification saves farmland and we believe that it can be accomplished in a way that provides people with liveable, walkable communities that are desirable by the vast majority of inhabitants. Waterloo is a living example. We are one of the most desirable places to live and work in the province.\n\u25cf\tWe support mandatory densities in all new residential developments. Higher densities, if designed well, are desirable places to live and are less costly to service with water, sewer and public transit etc than low density sprawl. High density developments in Waterloo Region\u2019s cities are fully subscribed before a shovel is placed in the ground.\n\u25cf\tWe strongly support visionary planning regimes in urban municipalities that eliminate farmland loss by building complete, liveable communities in a denser form that reduces servicing costs, promotes affordability, and provides people with a highly desirable place to live, work and play.\n\u25cf\tWe support the ability of Municipalities to enact land use policies that are more restrictive than the provincial planning documents including the proposed Provincial Planning Statement. Municipalities are generally the innovators when it comes to new and innovative plans and policies and an allowance to be more restrictive recognizes their ability to advance innovation  that may become a template for others in the future.\nHumans have cultivated the land and grown food here in Southern Ontario for over 2000 years and yet farmland is a non-renewable natural resource. If we pave it over, it is gone forever. However if we plan well and look after the land it is a perpetual resource that has the potential to feed us for another 2000 years. We have the ability and the knowledge to both protect farmland and provide people with a place to live and work. Intensification, compact form and visionary long term planning are the tools that will save our natural landscape and our ability to feed ourselves.\nFinally, remember that we only have one landscape and people, the natural environment and agriculture all have to share it.\nSincerely,  Waterloo Federation of Agriculture\n",

        "comment":"Greetings,\nI think the Ontario Government has to re-think the strategy it is presently forcing on the citizens of Ontario.  To cut into wetlands or farmland will have a backfiring approach down the road.\nFarmland - these are employment lands.  The harvest from the farmlands will be processed, sold to mills to be turned into grains which then are sold to supermarkets where consumers will purchase.  Many jobs are created from the time of planting to when these products are ready to be eaten by families.  Many many jobs are created in the process.  When we lose our farmland, these products have to be imported at great costs which many consumers today cannot afford.  I see in my community where farmland is allocated to homes.  Where will these homeowners work?  The jobs will not be there.  Employment lands give municipalities the tax dollars they need to maintain servicing of old and new lines.\nIndustrial lands - now being re-zoned for housing!  Once again - these lands are employment lands and they should not be re-zoned to developers who will cram too many homes in these areas so existing industries cannot function.  ie- S.C.Johnson in Brantford found out the hard way that a property originally zoned industrial was purchased with the intent for houses without letting local industries even know this had occurred.  Their message to Brantford Council 'think really hard about this and whether you want us to stay here'. They will move and many many jobs and spin off jobs are gone.\nWater - Brantford's only water supply is from the Grand River.  Yet source water protection only covers a spill in the area designated as a protection area.  Upstream of the city water intake, a rather large developer wants to build.  The property has a high water table with an ANSI feature.  Two moraines meet and one of the ANSI features involve water spouts and sink holes.  Yet the developer has now gone to LPAT to get approval for more homes.  This is also a heritage site with three pre-contact village sites and a Mohawk Mission Site from the 1800's.  All integrity for the environmental, archeological and Indigenous values for this site will be erased to create home - providing they can de-water fast enough.  Some areas need to be studied for 'net' negative impacts even when a proposal claims there won't be.  How can this be proven with developers given the upper hand and the community and natural heritage have no place?\nI am concerned about the carving up of farmland and wetlands.  We cannot bring back once the damage has been done.  Locally we value the heritage of the Grand River and its tributarys. Thank you for listening.\n",

        "comment":"ERO #019-6813 \u2013 Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and PPS to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nAdditional Submissions and Addendum:\nAt the original June 6th ERO deadline, this extension until August 4th sounded like a great idea, however, it seems that in these weeks the provincial government has only continued it rampage of destruction of the province for profit at the cost of future generations and the greater public good.\nWe have seen the housing crisis worsen, with interest rates soaring, affordability weakening, and fewer homes being built - not more.  Worse yet - the majority of announcements from the province are for urban sprawl single detached homes unaffordable to most in remote locations far from where people want to live in complete walkable communities near existing schools, amenities, shops, services and employment.  We are seeing our Greenbelt needlessly destroyed in extremely questionable decision-making and our climate crisis worsening because the Doug Ford Conservative government has little regard for the environment, climate change, sustainability and has spent five years cancelling the wind, solar, energy, and environmental programs that at one point had Ontario as a global leader.  Instead we now have fossil gas plants being built again and extensive pollution and warming forecast.\nIt is astounding how much this government is moving in the wrong directions and despite the recent promises to cancel the three rural severances absurdly proposed with no public consultation and obviously no forethought, or planning.  We need to ensure that these severances are cancelled in every way form and manner and that local municipalities and regional government can continue to forbid land severances like the Region of Waterloo No Rural Severances Less than 80 Acres Policy.  The fear is that the government will only cancel them on Prime Ag lands after the considerable protests of all the farm organizations and that they will still be applied to other rural lands.  We need to ensure that they are forever cancelled and removed from all lands!  Development should only be encouraged in our urban areas - not our farms and countryside.\nThe proposed definitions to the Ag System and NHS system need to be reverted back to their original forms and the government needs to rethink the entire approach to growth and the PPS.\nWe need a provincial government acting for the people - not billionaire buddies with the sustainable climate change solutions we need - compact, intensification within urban boundaries in complete walkable and transit supported communities.  All new homes and buildings need to be net-zero meeting strict Green Development Standards and we need to ensure that we hit our 2030 and 2050 climate targets.  Not miss them wildly which seems to be the current trajectory.\nPlease do more and do better!  Our children are depending on it.\nHere's also our original submission:\nPremier Doug Ford, Minister Clark, Minister Thompson, other Cabinet Members, MPPs and Staff,\nIt is with complete horror and astonishment that I am writing to you to state my family\u2019s strong opposition to replace the PPS and Growth Plan for the GGH with a new Provincial Planning Statement.\nThe changes being proposed are the opposite of SMART Growth, undo decades of good planning, and would allow for rampant urban sprawl, massive farmland loss and completely prevent Ontario from reaching our climate change goals under the Paris Accord.\nWe need to ensure complete, compact, sustainable, transit supported, efficient communities \u2013 not encourage the very automobile dependent, inefficient, 1960\u2019s style urban sprawl that has created our climate catastrophe and destroyed our planet in the first place.\nWhile there is no doubt that we are in a housing crisis, the schemes being proposed by this government are only going to greatly worsen the housing crisis and do the opposite of improving affordability, providing the missing middle housing, and creating the sustainable communities of the future we are going to need.\nWorst of all is the completely absurd proposed rural farmland severance policy to allow 3 severances per farm \u2013 even on prime farmland for up to a total of 12 homes on every farm.  The implications of this are staggering \u2013 not only for efficient farming, MDS regulations, and ensuring we can produce enough food to feed our population in the future but even for things like rural schools, infrastructure, highway entrances, the electrical grid, internet and telephony infrastructure, rural hospitals, etc.  It has never been anticipated to relocate hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of people scattered across the rural parts of the province in the most inefficient manner possible.  The implications and costs we will all pay are staggering \u2013 particularly compared to the far more sustainable options to properly house people within existing communities where much infrastructure already exists (and may even be currently underutilized) without destroying our countryside, farms, groundwater recharge and natural areas.\nIt has been clearly demonstrated and become broadly accepted that land for development is not the issue \u2013 there is no land shortage \u2013 there is decades of land supply already designated in municipalities across the province and developers have been sitting on massive inventories for years as there is no approval expiry and no incentive for them to move forward to meet the market needs \u2013 in fact, the opposite by restricting supply they keep prices high and ensure constant demand at premium prices.\nThe proposed removal of intensification targets and population forecasting is confounding and allowing municipalities to expand settlement areas anytime without and MCR or justification is a recipe for disaster that will bankrupt many municipalities in the years ahead.\nThe ongoing attacks on our Conservation Authorities and the continued weakening of watershed planning will be looked upon by future generations as unfathomable and will guarantee Doug Ford a place in history as one of the most short-sighted leaders ever to be removing the safeguards and common sense policies put into place to protect people and infrastructure.  Much like there are the Darwin Awards currently recognizing people who have done humanity a favour by ending their genetic lineage and removing their not so smart genes from the gene pool, I predict future Ford Awards will be used to describe something done only for greed and profit, defying all common sense, greater public good and even basic human safety in an era of rapid climate change and climate chaos.\nWhich brings up the absolutely logic-defying removal and weakening of all policies addressing climate change.  At a time that the rest of the world is moving forward, increasing resilience and preparing for a very different future, here is our provincial government moving in the opposite direction and dooming future generations.\nMy family and I urge you for the sake of our children \u2013 currently 4 and 6 years old to abandon these confounding, absurd and poorly considered proposed policy changes and go in the opposite direction of providing the sustainable solutions we need for the future, building upon our current world-leading successful planning system, and implementing regulations that will actually solve our housing challenges while preparing our province for the climate crisis we are already facing.\nThank you!\n",

        "comment":"Submission to ERO: 019-6813\nReview of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and Provincial Policy Statement\nto form a new provincial planning policy statement\nGravel Watch Ontario (GWO) is a province-wide coalition of citizen groups and individuals that acts in the interests of residents and communities to protect the health, safety, quality of life of Ontarians and the natural environment in matters that relate to aggregate resources. Formed in 2003 we have over 20 years of experience assisting both communities and government agencies in matters related to aggregate matters.\nReplacing the Provincial Policy Statement 2020 and the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe with the Provincial Planning Statement 2023 focussed solely on accelerating housing supply is short sighted and maladaptive to deal with the broad scope of issues not only related to affordable housing but also neglects consideration for the public interest and the social and environment aspects inherent in good planning practice. The singular focus of PPS 2023 which prioritizes land development at the expense of other provincial matters concerning the public interest is irresponsible governance. Good planning practice is comprehensive, integrated, and has a balanced policy direction for land use planning which is missing in this ERO.\nWe urge you once again to not proceed with the proposal.\n",

My mom, my grandfather, his father before him, along with uncles, cousins have been doing it for decades.\nMy grandfather has recently passed\u2026 I have the opportunity to own a piece of his land to build a forever home on and raise my two sons on for the rest of my days. I cannot afford to buy the entire farm land because of inheritance between my siblings. However, I have the opportunity to buy a 2 acre parcel from my cousin who can purchase the land\u2026\nHere lies the problem\u2026.Oxford County is probably the most strict county when it comes to this. The land division won\u2019t even back my proposal to severe two acres to build a forever home on and raise a family on our families land because it fails to meet their parameters\u2026the actual proposal only takes once acre of actual workable land, the other has an old barn on it and meets requirements for building.\nI live in Woodstock\u2026some of the development I\u2019ve seen here baffles me that it can get approved. Townhomes basically being built in people\u2019s backyards, get approved because money talks apparently. However, I have to be denied or jump through hoops to own a piece of land on an already existing family farm because the big dairy farms and agricultural associations are the only ones who have a voice!!\nI understand the implications and restrictions with some of their crop farming and operations of big developments being set up close to or bordering their land. I understand it can put a potential complication with some of their operations. However, I haven\u2019t seen it yet. There is literally a city in it self being developed across the street from farms on highway 17 north Woodstock. Again, money talks\u2026\nNo one is forcing these farms to sell their land and one day them being able to sever a parcel for their kids in this insane housing market might be a good option for them. Kids who may not want to take over the farm, can\u2019t afford to buy other siblings out or simply can\u2019t even afford to buy a house period. This gives them options! They will win regardless because they have the money to buy out the little farms and swallow them up anyways.\nNo one wants to see pockets of big developments swallowing up our precious farmland. Especially not me\u2026I was born and raised a country kid who would love to give my boys the same experiences and opportunities. Which in turn opens up my house in Woodstock for someone else in need of a good home.\nMeet in the middle here\u2026don\u2019t approve three lot severances, how bout only 1 or restructure the rules to make it a little easier for people in unique situations that yes, I\u2019m very fortunate to possibly have.\nThank you for your time\u2026I truly hope this reaches someone and they take the time to read it fully.\nRegards,\nKyle\n",

        "comment":"I am shocked and horrified at your proposal because it undermines all good planning policies that have been in place and created the Ontario we know and love.  Housing, although important,  is NOT the priority for Ontario's future.  instead our future lies in planning based on preserving our natural, cultural and heritage resources.  Almost every change this document proposed will destroy or seriously diminish the above resources, as well as undermining citizen participation in our municipalities.\nYou have listened to the demands of developers rather than to the wishes of the citizens of this province.\nI am especially concerned about the sections of the policy proposal that undermine and diminish the protection of the Ontario Heritage Act and the present PPS of our heritage resources.  I support the statements of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario as copied below:\nIt will weaken the protection of Ontario's heritage.\n\u00b7                 It would limit protection of built heritage resources and cultural landscapes to only those already designated. (Section 4.6)\n\u00b7                 Heritage resources which qualify for designation under the Ontario Heritage Act, but not already formally recognized by municipalities, risk demolition. Municipalities will not be able to protect the heritage value of a property when it is threatened by new development.\n\u00b7                 Because this statement applies only to protected properties, municipalities will not be able to assess non-protected properties to see if the heritage attributes should be protected.\n\u00b7                 The proposed Provincial Planning Statement undermines the Planning Act which clearly states \"the conservation of features of significant architectural, cultural, historical, archaeological or scientific interest\" is a matter of provincial interest.\n\u00b7                 Policy 4.6.1 should be strengthened to say \"Cultural heritage property, which may contain built heritage resources or cultural heritage landscapes, shall be conserved.\"\nIt will reduce the likelihood that existing buildings will be kept, maintained and reused, weakening Ontario's ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change.\n\u00b7                 Section 2.9 on \u201cEnergy Conservation, Air Quality and Climate Change\u201d needs to specifically mention that maintaining, retrofitting and adaptively reusing existing buildings and structures is a good way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of a changing climate.\n\u00b7                 Properties that currently meet the criteria for designation, which have not yet been designated, due to time and financial constraints, which were significant under the former PPs are no longer allowed to also be protected.\n\u00b7                 There are 33,000 properties on municipal registries, which have some heritage potential, but have not been afforded full protection. If these are not designated by December 31,2024, they will have no protection. There is not enough time for municipal heritage committees to evaluate such a large number of properties and have them designated.  Some municipal governments have no specialists who can evaluate the listed properties to see if they should be protected.\n\u00b7                 Municipal heritage procedures have been in place for about 50 years and there have been extremely few cases where heritage properties put new development at risk. If a building with heritage value was in a location where development was planned, the development simply went around it. There are a number of cases in our region where the homes built in the late 1800s are still intact, with large subdivisions all around them. These properties have retained their heritage value and in addition are sold for large sums of money.\n",

I believe that the weakening of provincial planning rules will result in increased sprawl that will threaten farms, forests, other natural areas, and freshwater sources.  The houses that developers will build in areas that are currently rural will not address the housing crisis because they will be unaffordable for most people and will not be accessible to public transit.  The resulting sprawl will not only add to traffic congestion and Increased emissions, but it will compromise the carbon sequestering and flood prevention that natural areas provide; the long-term food security for Ontario; and the availability of clean water.  There is no question that more housing is needed but research has shown that there is available land in urban areas that already have access to services that are easily accessible.  Recent communication from a spokesperson for the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark stated that \u201cProviding choice to people about the types of homes that are available is important to ensuring the overall livability of our province.\u201d  If the government is really concerned about the \u201coverall livability of our province\u201d, it will reconsider the planned changes to the Provincial Policy Statement so that affordability, access to services, food security, protection of natural areas and the environment are priorities when making policy decisions.\n",

        "comment":"Hi there, I am a young farmer submitting comments on the 'A place to Grow' act and the new proposed Provincial Planning Statement. I am happy to see some things in the proposal that should make for better urban areas, more housing  and reduce pressure on farmland. These things would include establishing and meeting density targets around transit lines (assuming these density targets are set reasonably high), creating better transit systems and corridors in new areas, providing a greater mix of housing options, density and types, and requiring intensification policies for communities. Much to my dismay however, are policies in the proposal that seem to run counter to both improving our communities and reducing impact on the environment such as; allowing for more development in rural areas (which increases infrastructure cost, reliance on car transportation, consumes farmland and disturbs wildlife) and allowing urban boundary expansions without demonstrating prior need. Given our increasing loss of farmland in Ontario, we should be using urban boundary expansions as a last resort to providing sources of housing. There is much infilling that we can do in our communities that would help to reduce development pressure on farmland and improve our communities through lessening car dependency and increasing active transport and accessibility to amenities. It is absolutely foolish to encourage rural settlement, when we know that it creates low population density, inefficiencies in providing services, creates car dependency, and increases emissions. We must put our resources towards, be encouraging, more, and better, denser urban settlement. We are seeing a weakening of our rural communities, in part due to our poor urban planning. We must have strong, vibrant urban communities so we can have strong, vibrant rural communities, instead of a mix of low density country estates across the country side. There must be a clear definition between what is protected as farmland and habitat, and what is consumed for urban area. We must have hard urban boundaries that are not easily expanded, and tough agricultural zoning that is not changed at the drop of a hat. We must have better sustainable planning than what is being presented.\nI am also confused why municipalities must map their prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas. While it is always good to know where these areas are, presumably the provincial mapping system should already know where these areas are. Does the wording surrounding this weaken the protection around these lands?\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nComments regarding section 4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nI am concerned about proposed s.4.3.3 which permits the severance of three residential lots from parcels in prime agricultural areas. This poses a significant threat to the long-term viability of the agricultural sector. As it currently reads, this policy could apply to any parcel of agricultural land, regardless of its size or whether it was previously severed before January 2023. Given that there are 48,346 farms4 and as many as 170,000 farmland properties in Ontario5, the province could see anywhere from 145,038 to 510,000 lots severed from agricultural properties. Therefore, if each lot is approximately 1-acre in size, this policy alone would be responsible for removing anywhere from 1.25% to 4.3% of Ontario\u2019s finite agricultural land base.\nThe use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land, given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays6. While I appreciate that proposed s.4.3.1 states \u201cPlanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach,\u201d this policy does not provide the strength needed to require agricultural systems, and appears to be in contradiction to the permissions of s.4.3.3. When you factor in s.4.3.2.5, which permits up to two additional dwellings in prime agricultural areas, this could result in as many as 1.5 million dwellings on newly severed lots in agricultural areas. This will lead to significant farmland fragmentation, which is contradictory to the purpose of an agricultural system, and will cause significant disruptions to surrounding agricultural operations.\nMoving to rural areas often means embracing the realities of agricultural living, such as noise, dust, odors, and farm equipment on the roads. Unfortunately, this leads to land-use compatibility conflicts that are difficult to mitigate once residential units are developed in agricultural areas. This poses significant challenges for farmers, especially when Minimum Distance Separation (MDS) is not properly followed during development approvals. This is concerning given that Bill 23 prevents third-party appeals at the Ontario Land Tribunal, making it difficult for nearby farmers to address MDS concerns. Additionally, constructing residential units up to the MDS line will limit any future growth of the agricultural operation, threatening the future viability of animal agriculture in Ontario.\nFurthermore, additional residential units on prime agricultural areas will result in an increase in water usage from underground aquifers. Three additional lots, including three additional residential units would put a significant strain on the water usage and increase the likelihood of water source issues for both the residents and the agricultural operation. Agriculture uses significant amounts of water to irrigate crops and provide water to livestock. Although a large percentage of water is returned to the source, often it has been changed and carrying soil and dissolved compounds7. With less water available in the aquifer, any contaminants will be more concentrated. Therefore, permitting three lot severances in prime agricultural areas will have significant implications for water availability and safety.\nBy permitting lot severances, the province will be impacting the financial accessibility of farmland for the next generation of farmers, making farming less financially viable. Each farm property will likely increase in price relative to the value of three vacant lots in the respective region. Ontario experienced a 19.4% increase in property values in 20228, making it unattainable or financially unfeasible for many young farmers to buy land. The proposed severance policies will incentivize developers, who can outbid young farmers, to purchase farmland or provide cash incentives for farmers to sever lots, contributing to the increase in farmland prices. This will result in the next generation experiencing a fragmented agricultural system and keeping ownership of farmland out of their reach. This is concerning because if the next generation of farmers cannot afford to farm, and experience it as increasingly difficult to farm, the province will not have a viable agricultural sector for much longer.\nI have noticed that the new proposed PPS 2023 states in policy 4.3.1.2, \u201cAs part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d However, permitting lot severances for residential use contradicts lands being designated for the long-term protection for agriculture.\nI believe that the proposed s. 4.3.2.5, which would allow two additional units on existing farm properties, could be significant in providing housing opportunities for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. Similarly, the proposed s. 2.2.1.b.2 allows more land for housing by converting existing commercial and institutional buildings for residential use. Given these other proposed policies permitting additional housing and the significant concerns over the proposed lot creation policies, I question why there is a need to permit such a significant allowance for severances.\nFurthermore, permitting these severances is in contradiction to proposed s. 2.2.1.c, \u201cpromoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure and public service facilities, and support the use of active transportation.\u201d S.4.3.3 will not promote efficiency in these areas and will detract from the intentions to support intensification.\nI believe that municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising between non-farming residents and the agricultural community. However, proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being more restrictive, which could be vital for preventing these types of conflicts. For rural communities whose economies and culture are intricately associated with agriculture, s.4.3.3.2 will prevent municipalities from protecting a key component of their communities and is contradictory to the content on page 3 that states the PPS 2023 recognizes the diversity of Ontario and that local context is important. S.4.3.3.2 restricts rural municipalities from ensuring the local context of their agricultural system is protected from farmland fragmentation.\nI, therefore, urge the province to consider these concerns and remove s.4.3.3 in its entirety so that the proposed changes do not harm the province\u2019s agricultural lands and the farmers who depend on them. The province should require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping and allow municipalities to implement additional restrictions to help protect agriculture and prevent conflicts with non-farming residents.\nComments regarding proposed changes to intensification, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion\nI have significant concerns regarding the proposed policy changes found in the PPS 2023 regarding intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion. These policies should ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. However, while the proposed PPS 2023 generally states support for intensification, it does not require targets for municipalities across Ontario and provides many permissions that would undermine attempts at intensification. Additionally, the intensification targets for many municipalities in the Growth Plan have been reduced or removed altogether, which will use up lands in municipal boundaries faster and lead to increased rates of urban boundary expansion. Without the requirement to complete municipal comprehensive reviews, this poses a significant threat to farmland. As noted below, reducing and eliminating density targets is contrary to encouraging complete communities found within the proposed PPS. This will lead to fragmented patterns of development, including when settlement boundary expansion occurs.\nI have noted concerns under s.2.3, Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions. The policy in s.2.3.2 now states that \u201cland use patterns within settlement areas should be based on densities and a mix of land uses\u201d. The province opted to change the language from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d, which weakens the policies that are meant to support intensification. Additionally, the language that states land use patterns should \u201cminimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, promote energy efficiency\u201d and \u201cprepare for the impacts of a changing climate\u201d has been removed.  This is concerning given the climate crisis we are facing and that agriculture relies on healthy and stable ecosystems to produce a consistent supply of quality local food. By removing this language, the province is undermining the future viability of the agricultural sector, the largest sector of the Ontario economy.\nRecommendation 1: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.2 that will require municipalities to adopt land use patterns that support density targets and also minimize negative environmental impacts.\nFurthermore, s.2.3.3 states that \u201cplanning authorities should support general intensification and redevelopment to support the achievement of complete communities, including by planning for a range and mix of housing options and prioritizing planning and investment in the necessary infrastructure and public service facilities.\u201d Once again, the use of \u201cshould\u201d is not strong enough to ensure the deliverables of complete communities. Furthermore, the policy no longer requires planning authorities to identify appropriate locations or take stock of suitable existing sites, eroding the possibility of efficient land use. While I encourage the use of complete communities in the planning framework, the removal of intensification targets will not only have sever impact to farmland but it will undermine the existing urban  planning framework to achieve complete communities.\nRecommendation 2: The province should use stronger language in s.2.3.3 that will require municipalities to identify appropriate locations for intensification.\nThe policy on settlement area expansion has also been weakened, which will further threaten Ontario\u2019s prime agricultural land. A major concern is removing the requirement of a municipal comprehensive review that demonstrates the need for expansion. Additionally, the language in s.2.3.4 has been changed from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cshould\u201d which weaken the policy, making it possible for development to occur on prime agricultural lands. While proposed s.2.3.4.b states that applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas, this is a subsection under s.2.3.4 which states planning authorities \u201cshould\u201d consider this. Since the language does require planning authorities to consider this, there is the likelihood of it still occurring. This is also the case for s.2.3.4d regarding impacts on agricultural lands and operations that are adjacent or close to the settlement.\nRecommendation 3: The province should require municipal comprehensive reviews prior to settlement boundary expansion and require the planning authority to demonstrate the need. Furthermore, the province needs to adopt stronger language in s.2.3.4 that ensures the applicable lands do not comprise specialty crop areas and that prime agricultural areas are avoided to the greatest extent possible as determined through an agricultural impact assessment.\nI have also noted the removal of policies from s.2.6 Rural Lands in Municipalities, in particular, \u201cwhen directing development on rural lands, a planning authority shall apply the relevant policies of Section 1: Building Strong Healthy Communities, as well as the policies of Section 2: Wise Use and Management of Resources and Section 3: Protecting Public Health and Safety.\u201d I suggest that the removal of this policy will undermine the future resiliency of rural communities.\nRecommendation 4: The province should reinstate the policies pertaining to directing development on rural lands that require planning authorities to apply relevant policies that support strong and resilient communities as found in the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020.\nFinally, there is concern pertaining to the language in s.2.1.1 that states, \u201csufficient land shall be made available to accommodate an appropriate range and mix of land uses to meet projected needs for a time horizon of at least 25 years.\u201d As noted above, without improving language and goals pertaining to density targets, it will be increasingly difficult for municipalities to plan accurately for beyond 25 years. This will likely lead to further settlement area expansion to accommodate the likelihood of urban sprawl, which will reduce investments in agricultural operations surrounding urban boundaries.\nRecommendation 5: The province should maintain the current requirement for planning authorities to plan for up to 25 years in order to minimize unnecessary and premature settlement area expansion.\nIn conclusion, the proposed changes to intensification targets, municipal comprehensive reviews, and settlement area expansion weaken policies that would ensure strategic growth for communities while protecting highly valuable farmland. The use of weaker language and the removal of requirements will lead to increased rates of settlement boundary expansion and further threaten farmland and the agricultural sector. It is essential that the policies are strengthened to ensure efficient land use and protect Ontario\u2019s agricultural operations and communities.\\\nThanks for taking the time to read my comment, and I hope that we can find a better balance between preserving our natural heritage, our farmland and agri-food system, and improving our communities while providing housing.\nReferences:\n1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"I am strongly opposed to the proposed changes that the provincial government wants to make to the Provincial Policy Statement.  I believe that the weakening of provincial planning rules will result in increased sprawl that will threaten farms, forests, other natural areas, and freshwater sources.  The houses that developers will build in areas that are currently rural will not address the housing crisis because they will be unaffordable for most people and will not be accessible to public transit.  The resulting sprawl will not only add to traffic congestion and Increased emissions, but it will compromise the carbon sequestering and flood prevention that natural areas provide; the long-term food security for Ontario; and the availability of clean water.  There is no question that more housing is needed but research has shown that there is available land in urban areas that already have access to services that are easily accessible.  Recent communication from a spokesperson for the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark stated that \u201cProviding choice to people about the types of homes that are available is important to ensuring the overall livability of our province.\u201d  If the government is really concerned about the \u201coverall livability of our province\u201d, it will reconsider the planned changes to the Provincial Policy Statement so that affordability, access to services, food security, protection of natural areas and the environment are priorities when making policy decisions.\n",

        "comment":"Many of the changes to provincial policies proposed by the province in its new land use policy document are deeply flawed.\nScrapping the requirement for municipalities to do a comprehensive review before expanding their settlement area is irresponsible. The areas that municipalities will expand into, if and when they decide to do so, are dominated by farmland and natural areas like woodlands and wetlands. Given that only five per-cent of Ontario can support agriculture and farmland has been lost at about 175 acres per day, leniency towards municipalities expanding their settlement areas would reinforce an already unsustainable trend. Likewise, most of southern Ontario has been depleted of its forest cover. Massive biodiversity losses are being experienced all over the world, and encouraging the development of farmland, woodlands, and wetlands certainly contributes to this existential threat to mankind and the Earth we call our home.\nContinuing to expand outward without proper review increases the likelihood of car-dependent urban sprawl continuing as a trend in municipal development. It is well known that urban sprawl contributes to municipalities, and by proxy taxpayers, being burdened by large and unnecessary infrastructure costs. Because urban sprawl involves building at a lower density than would intensifying the use of space within municipalities' urban boundaries (such as brownfields and greyfields), the taxes and revenue generated from new settlement will not cover the costs of infrastructure. which will, if anything, cause less housing to be built due to the inefficiency in land-use inherent to suburban sprawl.  Growing cities at low density means increasing commutes, meaning rises in carbon emissions due to longer car commutes to employment and basic amenities. The low density of suburban sprawl means that servicing these areas frequently enough with public transport will be unfeasible, just as cycling and walking distances will become longer and make active transport an unlikely choice for residents of newly built low density settlements. Removing mandatory intensification and density targets will only exacerbate these problems.\nAs usual, these planning proposals lack any respect for Indigenous jurisdiction over their territories outside reserve lands, including a lack of any stated need to gain Indigenous consent before greenfields and environmentally sensitive areas. The province has already made the mistake of not taking Haudenosaunee land jurisdiction seriously numerous times, most notably in 2006 and 2020 in Caledonia within the Haldimand tract. Engagement and consultation are no replacement for the requirement to gain the free, prior, and informed consent of Indigenous peoples as outline in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples.\nMunicipalities should not be forced to expand against their will, especially since doing so is almost always in conflict with the interests of and lacking the consent of First Nations. Increasing the availability of housing is not as simple as merely redrawing the boundaries of a municipality, since there is always the question of how these urbanized areas will have their needs met, including access to employment and  basic amenities.\n",

        "comment":"Settlement Area Boundary Expansions\nThe DRFA strongly opposes the proposed changes to settlement area boundary expansion policies. Higher-density development is needed to limit agricultural land loss.\nThe requirement to justify need and also conduct a comprehensive review must be maintained and not removed in the policy wording. Allowing these changes could lead to inconsistent implementation across municipalities, agricultural land fragmentation and inconsistent protections and considerations for agricultural land across municipal boundaries.\nThe DRFA supports fixed, permanent urban boundaries to limit the loss of agricultural land and to focus future urban growth within existing urban boundaries. This means urban growth primarily through redevelopment of vacant and underused lands, and higher density development. In urban areas, higher density development should be mandated province wide to take full advantage of existing infrastructure.\nAgricultural Impact Assessments (AIAs)\nAIA  policies from A Place To Grow should be incorporated directly into the proposed PPS policies on settlement area boundary expansions, as the current policy outlines and including APTG Policy 2.2.8.3 h) \u201cany adverse impacts on the agri-food network, including agricultural operations, from expanding settlement areas would be avoided, or if avoidance is not possible, minimized and mitigated as determined through an agricultural impact assessment;\u201d.\nThe use of AIAs ensures that agricultural uses continue, and normal farm practices are protected. AIAs identify opportunities to increase compatibility between agricultural and non-agricultural uses by looking for ways to avoid, minimize, then mitigate adverse impacts on agricultural operations and the Agricultural System.\nAgricultural Systems Mapping\nThe Provincial Agricultural Systems mapping, through consistent criteria and methodology is an important tool for municipalities to identify their most productive agricultural lands and the businesses supporting the agriculture industry.\nThe DRFA supports the extension of the Agriculture Systems Mapping and approach to be required across the province rather than encouraged as per 4.3.1.1.\nThe removal of Provincial Agricultural Systems policies and mapping, lessens protection for agricultural and natural heritage lands.\nLot Creation and Additional Residential Units\nWe understand that the three-lot severance proposal will not be moving ahead, however, we will reiterate that DRFA does not support further lot creation and severances. The creation of additional lots and severances would only mean that additional incompatibility issues would be introduced for current and future farm operations, presenting even more challenges to carry out normal farm practices.\nWe can support Additional Residential Units (ARUs) on existing farm parcels, and in rural hamlets and communities as this supports our agricultural system. ARUs should be subordinate to the principal dwelling on an agricultural parcel, but no additional lot severances are to be made on these parcels.\nHowever, the criteria and specifics for enabling ARUs will require being further defined. The Ontario Federation of Agriculture in consultation with other local federations across the province, like DRFA is well suited to provide input in the development of guidelines\/BMPs for ARUs.\nMinimum Distance Separation (MDS)\nThe MDS formulae are a proven means of separating livestock facilities and permanent manure storages from neighbouring land uses. The use of MDS reduces health and safety risks and\/or complaints from neighbouring land uses arising from livestock\/manure odours and practices..\nThe DRFA supports and values the rationale and use of the MDS formulae and guidelines to provide sufficient separation between new or expanding agricultural livestock buildings and uses and neighbouring non-agricultural buildings and uses, again to lessen the likelihood of odour complaints or health and safety risks or concerns.\nEmployment Lands\nChanges in Employment Lands policies may impact agricultural land use and therefore it is prudent to be cautious of making the changes proposed.\nMunicipal Flexibility\nDRFA concurs with the OFA, that the PPS should be a baseline that allows for some flexibility. Municipalities should be allowed to be more restrictive within the local policy so long as it is in accordance with provincial policy.\nFarmland provides not only local food, but helps to protect habitat and wetlands which then help in water management and mitigates climate change. Agricultural practices such as conservation tillage, cover cropping and rotations, and in sequestering carbon into soils.\nTo be clear, as an industry, we are not opposed to development outright. On the contrary, further population growth and prosperity is in our collective interest. Growth management to meet housing demand and farmland protection are two sides of the same coin. However, in addressing the housing affordability crisis the focus must be on more protection against development on agricultural land combined with fixed, permanent urban boundaries and mandatory compliance with urban density and intensification requirements. This will achieve community development and farmland protection objectives.\nIntensification will boost economic growth, create new jobs, provide new affordable housing options, support municipal infrastructure systems, ensure food security, and contribute to environmental stewardship.\n",

        "comment":"July 31, 2023\nThe Honourable Steve Clark\nMinister of Municipal Affairs and Housing\n17th Floor, 777 Bay Street\nToronto, Ontario\nM7A 2J3\nDear Minister Clark,\nRe: ERO 019-6813 - Review of proposed policies adapted from A Place to Grow and\nProvincial Policy Statement to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nThank you for the opportunity to participate in the consultation process for planned policy changes\nto the PPS. Our topline feedback is summarized below:\n\u2022 Settlement Area Boundary Expansions: MFA strongly opposes changes to settlement\narea boundary expansion policies, we believe that higher-density development is needed\nto limit agricultural land loss.\n\u2022 Additional Residential Units (ARUs): MFA supports ARUs on existing farm parcels and\nrural hubs, but we have concerns about lack of criteria and specificity.\n\u2022 Minimum Distance Separation (MDS): Ontario farmers value the MDS formulae as a\nproven means of separating livestock facilities and permanent manure storages from\nneighbouring land uses.\n\u2022 Employment Lands: MFA would like to caution against changing Employment Lands\npolicies, as it may impact agricultural land use.\n\u2022 Municipal Flexibility: MFA believes that the PPS should be a baseline that allows for\nsome flexibility. Municipalities should be allowed to be more restrictive within the local\npolicy so long as it is in accordance with provincial policy.\n\u2022 Agricultural Impact Assessment (AIA): MFA supports AIA inclusion for land use\nproposals and has some concerns about the granting of exceptions.\n\u2022 Natural Heritage & Water: MFA believes that the Provincial Planning Statements should\nnot remove the words \u201call municipal\u201d from section 4.2.1(e)(1). MFA is a strong advocate\nof protecting water supplies and wetlands, in a way that prioritizes Normal Farm Practices.\nProtecting the Future of Farming\nThe Middlesex Federation of Agriculture (MFA) was formed in 1939 to work on a local level to represent the voice of the farmer in Ontario. We work on behalf of more than 1,950 members in Middlesex County. We work to advance agriculture and the rural community through partnerships, education and advocacy. MFA has a strong voice for our members and the agri-food industry on issues, legislation and regulations administered by all levels of government. We are passionate and dedicated to ensuring that the agri-food sector and rural communities are considered and consulted with for any new or changing legislation that would impact the sustainability and growth of our farm businesses.\nOntario\u2019s agri-food sector is an economic powerhouse \u2013 producing more than 200 farm and food\nproducts, fueling rural communities, generating nearly 750,000 jobs and contributing more than\n$47 billion to Ontario\u2019s annual GDP. The province\u2019s agri-food strategy, Grow Ontario, aims to\nstrengthen the agri-food sector, support economic growth and ensure an efficient, reliable and\nresponsible food supply. By removing barriers, unnecessary costs and red tape, Ontario farmers\nwill be positioned to seize opportunities and rise to the challenge of an ambitious growth strategy,\nallowing the agri-food sector to continue to drive the economy forward.\nWe appreciate the reconsideration of the lot creation issue on agriculturally zoned properties. The\noriginal direction would have had significant potential impacts on agricultural operations across\nthis province, and we thank you, Minister, for the change. We have reviewed the remaining\npolicies originally proposed within the statement using an agricultural lens, and provide the\nfollowing comments.\nAgricultural System Mapping and Agricultural Land Protections\nMFA is a strong advocate for the protection of Ontario\u2019s farmlands for their long-term ability to\nproduce food, fibre, fuel, flowers and nursery stock, not only for Ontario\u2019s growing population, but\nalso for consumers beyond our borders.\nMFA believes that farming to produce food, fibre, fuel, flowers and nursery stock is the best use\nfor farmland. Ontario\u2019s limited supply of farmland is a scarce resource, making up less than five\nper cent of all the land in the province. It\u2019s vital that Ontario has a strong, viable and sustainable\nsupply of food products grown, harvested and processed right here at home. Ontario\u2019s shrinking\nagricultural land base is alarming. The current rate of loss is measured at 319 acres per day in\nour province, according to the 2021 Census of Agriculture. These losses are not sustainable.\nWe also wish to emphasize that there is only one Ontario landscape. The full range of urban,\nrural, agricultural, natural heritage, cultural heritage and mineral extraction land uses must coexist\nacross this landscape.\nProvincially, the protection of Ontario\u2019s prime agricultural areas for their long-term agricultural use\nmust be a key objective. It is one thing to think about housing the anticipated additional two million\npeople that will reside in Ontario over the next 10 years, but it is another to think seriously about\nhow we will feed this increasing population. Ontario's agricultural lands are a finite and shrinking\nresource. We cannot sustain continuing losses of agricultural land while maintaining our ability to\nproduce food, fibre, fuel, flowers and nursery stock from this limited and declining agricultural land\nbase. Therefore, any proposals looking at increasing housing supply must be done with\nconsideration to the needs and support of the agricultural community.\nMFA endorses the 2020 Provincial Policy Statement (PPS 2020)\u2019s Agriculture policies [Section\n2.3] that require municipalities protect their prime agricultural areas for their long-term agricultural\nuse. We further support the flexibility afforded to farmers to engage in on-farm value adding of\nprimary farm products, as well as agriculture-related, on-farm diversified and agri-tourism uses.\nWe believe that prime agriculture lands should be defined as Class 1-6 plus speciality crop lands.\nClasses 4-6 support agricultural activities such as grazing livestock, growing crops for biofuels,\nand the agriculture sector has demonstrated that the productivity of this land can be improved\nthrough activities such as tile drainage, stone picking and addition of lime. Provincial policy must\ncontinue to protect specialty crop areas because they are scarce and unique; if lost, they cannot\nbe recreated. They are important economically and represent some of Ontario's highest-earning\nagricultural lands. In addition, they provide many value-added and agri-tourism opportunities.\nNot all agricultural land in Ontario is zoned as prime agricultural land, and there are many farms\nand agricultural lands that municipalities have zoned as rural land. The proposed change to add\nmulti-lot residential development as a permitted use on rural lands within section 2.6.1 is very\nconcerning. We believe unrestricted growth in rural areas will have negative consequences,\nespecially for the preservation of agricultural lands. Land use planning in Ontario must balance\nopportunities for growth with the need to preserve our agricultural lands, regardless of whether it\nis zoned rural or agricultural. Focusing growth in existing settlement areas will support local\neconomies, reduce farmland loss and reduce land use conflicts.\nWe believe strongly in the PPS 2020 Agriculture policies that govern farmland and rural areas,\nprotecting the right to farm and the Agriculture System in Ontario. In addition to this, MFA believes\nstrongly that the fragmentation of farmland in rural areas is counterproductive for the agricultural\nbusiness structure in Ontario\u2019s rural areas.\nMFA is against the removal of the requirement to use the provincially mapped agricultural system\nas it would allow for agricultural fragmentation, inconsistent classification of agricultural lands and\nspecialty crop areas and disconnect in agricultural land mapping and classifications across\nmunicipal boundaries.\nSettlement Area Boundary Expansions\nMFA is strongly against the proposed changes to settlement area boundary expansion policies.\nSpecifically, changes in functional policy language have removed both the requirement to justify\nneed and to conduct a comprehensive review, as such could result in uncertainty and ambiguity\nfor the process, expectations, and requirements for these expansions. MFA believes that these\nchanges could lead to inconsistent implementation across municipalities, agricultural land\nfragmentation and inconsistent protections and considerations for agricultural land across\nmunicipal boundaries.\nMFA supports fixed, permanent urban boundaries to limit the loss of agricultural land, thereby\nfocusing future urban growth within existing urban boundaries. This means urban growth primarily\nthrough redevelopment of vacant and underused lands, and higher density development.\nWe further believe that in urban areas, higher density development should be mandated\nprovincewide to take full advantage of existing infrastructure. MFA supports urban intensification\/densification as one way to protect agricultural land and create complete\ncommunities.\nMFA believes that urban areas should only be allowed to expand onto abutting agricultural lands\nonly after exhausting redevelopment of underused or vacant areas within their existing urban\nboundaries. This would include the rehabilitation and redevelopment of both \u201cgreyfield\u201d and\n\u201cbrownfield\u201d sites. Lastly, urban expansion onto abutting agricultural land must be directed onto\nlower class agricultural land adjacent to the existing urban boundaries.\nMFA does not support scattered or strip development within prime agricultural areas. This form of\ndevelopment not only limits the ability of new and existing agricultural operations to function but\nfails to contribute financially to municipalities. MFA believes that urban expansion should only be\npermitted onto abutting agricultural lands where municipal sewer and water services are available.\nMFA wants to see PPS policies in Section 1.1.3.8 remain as is. Keeping these policies intact (and\nholding municipalities and MMAH accountable to following these policies) is critical for meeting\njoint goals of balancing farmland protection with urban development. Further, MFA wants to see\nAgricultural Impact Assessment (AIA) policies from APTG incorporated directly into the proposed\nPPS policies on settlement area boundary expansions (APTG Policy 2.2.8.3 h). Specifically\nreferencing AIAs as the current policy outlines:\n\u201cWhere the need for a settlement area boundary expansion has been justified in\naccordance with policy 2.2.8.2, the feasibility of the proposed expansion will be\ndetermined and the most appropriate location for the proposed expansion will be\nidentified based on the comprehensive application of all of the policies in this\nPlan, including the following: ... h) any adverse impacts on the agri-food network,\nincluding agricultural operations, from expanding settlement areas would be\navoided, or if avoidance is not possible, minimized and mitigated as determined\nthrough an agricultural impact assessment;\u201d (APTG Policy 2.2.8.3 h).\nAs Ontario becomes more urbanized, municipal councils and staff may not apply an agricultural\nlens to their plan-, policy- and decision-making. This is critical as we need to plan for 'farm-friendly'\nurban development that promotes compatibility at the urban-agricultural interface. For example,\nparcel size, configuration, building setbacks, road patterns, institutional locations, drainage\npatterns and location of municipal servicing will all have implications for agriculture.\nMFA firmly believes in the widespread use of AIAs, as it ensures that agricultural uses continue,\nand normal farm practices are protected. AIAs identify opportunities to increase compatibility\nbetween agricultural and non-agricultural uses by looking for ways to avoid, minimize, then\nmitigate adverse impacts on agricultural operations and the Agricultural System.\nLot Creation and Additional Residential Units\nMFA is optimistic about the reconsideration of the proposed lot severance policies and are eager\nto work with the government to balance the need for housing with the protection of agricultural\nland without severances.\nWhile MFA does not support further lot creation and severances, we do support Additional\nResidential Units (ARUs) on existing farm parcels, and in rural hubs, hamlets and communities to\nsupport our agricultural system. MFA would like to establish our support for additional dwelling\nunits subordinate to the principle dwelling on an agricultural parcel but do not support the\nestablishment of additional lot severances on these parcels.\nIn our previous submissions to the government regarding the PPS 2020, we have commented\nthat the PPS 2020 does not go far enough in protecting our finite agricultural lands. We have\nrecommended strengthening PPS 2020 in order to require fixed urban settlement boundaries and\npolicies requiring mandatory intensification within the existing built urban areas as well as\nmandatory \u201cgreenfield\u201d density requirements to better utilize infrastructure, improve the financial\nviability of public transit and protect our prime agricultural lands from sprawl.\nWhile MFA is supportive of additional residential units, we do feel there needs to be further\nspecificity in the policy. Our concerns include a lack of criteria for ARUs, insufficient consideration\nfor onsite infrastructure and servicing, inconsistency between policies on provincial guidance, a\nlack of consideration for the distinctiveness of municipalities, and the exclusion of specificity\nsurrounding whether these policies apply to both farm and rural lots.\nMFA believes that there should be additional consideration of a set of criteria for ARUs as well as\nclarification on the extent of this policy. There is a distinct lack of inclusion for the type, size, scale,\nand location of these proposed ARUs that needs to be addressed as well as the clarification on\nwhether this policy is exclusive to farm lots or includes rural lots as well.\nFurther, we are concerned that inconsistencies between policies on permitted uses in agricultural\nlands could lead to the misinterpretation or unpredictable development and approval of ARUs.\nSpecifically, under section 4.3.2 Permitted Uses, 4.3.2.4 (principal dwellings) states that the policy\nmust be in accordance with provincial guidelines, however, 4.3.2.5, does not include this\nprovision. MFA believes that this exclusion in conjunction with the lack of criteria for ARUs could\nresult in development that does not align with our position that farming to produce food, fibre, fuel,\nflowers and nursery stock is the best use for farmland.\nAdditionally, we must highlight the distinctiveness of municipalities across Ontario, both in their\nlandscape as well as their governance ability and priorities. No two municipalities are alike,\ntherefore flexibility within provincial level policies allows municipalities to address their local\nconcerns in accordance with provincial policy. MFA believes the Ontario government needs to\nclarify the extent of provincial-level direction and as well as outline considerations and guidance\nfor onsite infrastructure and servicing.\nMFA sees that opportunities to build more rural housing should be concentrated within, and\ndirected to, rural settlements and settlement areas as identified in APTG Policy and PPS (2020)\nPolicies 1.1 \u201cManaging and Directing Land Use to Achieve Efficient and Resilient Development\nand Land Use Patterns,\u201d 1.1.3 \u201cSettlement Areas,\u201d 1.1.4 \u201cRural Areas in Municipalities.\u201d Density\nand intensification targets should be analyzed and identified in accordance with APTG\nmethodology and appropriately applied to rural settlements and settlement areas.\nWithin rural lands, MFA recommends that agricultural uses, agriculture-related uses, on-farm\ndiversified uses and normal farm practices should be protected and given higher priority as permitted uses under PPS (2020) Policy 1.1.5.2 and throughout Policy 1.1.5 \u201cRural Lands in\nMunicipalities.\u201d\nMFA previously requested that this proposal be applied to rural and smaller-town municipalities\nwithin designated rural settlements and settlement areas. We acknowledge the servicing capacity\nlimits many rural communities in Ontario face, such as that with private water and wastewater\nservices. However, rural communities also need additional housing. There are opportunities within\nexisting smaller villages, hamlets and towns to increase density on parcels of land in the\nsettlement area that are adequate for servicing and more efficiently contribute to the rural tax\nbase. This would serve to eliminate the need for lot severances on agricultural lands while\nproviding increased housing options across Ontario.\nMFA welcomes the opportunity to be a part of a potential group to establish best management\npractices (BMPs) or regulations surrounding ARUs to effectively develop\nMinimum Distance Separation\nOntario farmers value the MDS formulae as a proven means of separating livestock facilities and\npermanent manure storages from neighbouring land uses, thereby reducing health and safety\nrisks and\/or complaints from these neighbouring land uses arising from livestock\/manure odours\nand practices. MFA wholeheartedly supports the use of the MDS formulae and guidelines to bring\nabout adequate separation.\nThe MFA supports MDS, its rationale being to prevent encroachment by neighbouring non-\nagricultural uses on livestock farms by providing sufficient separation between livestock uses and buildings and neighbouring non-agricultural uses and buildings to lessen the likelihood of odour\ncomplaints as well as any health and safety risks or concerns.\nThe MFA also endorses the use of the MDS formulae to provide sufficient separation between\nnew or expanding agricultural livestock buildings and uses and neighbouring non-agricultural\nbuildings and uses, again to lessen the likelihood of odour complaints or health and safety risks\nor concerns.\nEmployment Lands\nIn our submission to the Standing Committee for Bill 97, MFA cautioned against changing the\ndefinition and policies for Employment Lands proposed in the Planning Act amendment in\nSchedule 6 of Bill 97. We would like to maintain that the resulting impacts of reduced protections\nfor Employment Lands could result in increased pressure to utilize agricultural lands such as\nPrime Agricultural Lands and Specialty Crop Areas for employment uses in the future as well as\nput agricultural processing operations at risk.\nMunicipal Flexibility\nMFA believes that the PPS should be used as a baseline and remove the provisions that limit the\nflexibility of municipalities. As we have highlighted, municipalities vary across the province, and it\nis MFA\u2019s belief that municipalities should be allowed to be more restrictive within the local policy\nso long as it is in accordance with provincial policy.\nAgricultural Impact Assessment\nWhile we are very happy to see that Agricultural Impact Assessment (AIA) is included in the\ndefinitions, we do believe that an AIA must (not should) be completed under section 2.3\nSettlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansions. We are pleased to see the\nrequirement for \u201cavoiding, or where avoidance is not possible, minimized and mitigated as\ndetermined through an agricultural impact assessment...\u201d in section 4.3.5 Non-Agricultural Uses\nin Prime Agricultural Areas. We are also very pleased to see the application of 4.3.5.2 applied to\nMineral Aggregate Extraction in Prime Agricultural Areas under 4.5.4.1.a. Avoiding impacts to\nagricultural areas from mineral extraction is an important protection of Ontario\u2019s limited agricultural\nlands.\nMFA is very pleased to see the requirement for an AIA or equivalent analysis for mineral extraction\nin prime agricultural areas, yet we remain concerned there are circumstances in which \u201ccomplete\nrehabilitation to an agricultural condition is not required....\u201d As established in 4.5.4.2. It is our\nbelief that an application to extract minerals in prime agricultural areas that cannot be rehabilitated\nto an agricultural condition should not be approved on the basis that it does not meet the\nconditions of that application.\nNatural Heritage & Water\nMFA believes that the Provincial Planning Statements should not remove the words \u201call municipal\u201d\nfrom section 4.2.1(e)(1). We believe that this section should remain: \u201cImplementing necessary\nrestrictions on development and site alteration to: 1. Protect all municipal drinking water supplies\nand designated vulnerable areas; ...\u201d\nMFA is pleased to see that the definition of \u201cWetlands,\u201d as it currently exists in the Provincial Policy\nStatement, 2020, has been retained.\nMFA is pleased to see that the statement in Section 4.1.9 has remained across the versions of\nthe Proposed Provincial Planning Statement. However, to address potential conflicts between\nNatural Heritage and Agricultural landscapes MFA recommends the inclusion of a provision that\ngives priority to Normal Farm Practices.\nWe look forward to further engaging in future Natural Heritage policy discussions.\nMFA notes the legend in Figure 1 requires updating to reflect the changes in section numbers.\nWe are concerned that combining A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden\nHorseshoe and the Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 would diminish the protections and support\nfor agricultural lands and community and therefore open the floodgates for a rash of developments\nthat run counter to our overarching philosophy of farmland preservation which is paramount to\nour mission of \u201cFarms and Food Forever.\u201d\nWe request including greater specificity and guidance on these proposed policies as well as\ngreater consideration for agricultural land, operations and community.\nMFA appreciates the opportunity to provide our feedback and agricultural perspectives on the\nproposed Provincial Planning Statement. We look forward to working with the provincial\ngovernment and our municipal counterparts to protect Ontario\u2019s farmlands as well as sustain\nOntario\u2019s housing supply and communities.\nSincerely,\nJason O'Neil\nPresident\nMiddlesex Federation of Agriculture\n",

It is important to understand that unintended consequences can plague us in perpetuity.\n     Agricultural land is a scarce and precious non renewable resource that must be protected for the present and future long time use. The Government should be doing a lot more and should be using the PPS as an instrument to better protect agricultural land.\n    Farmland is not just empty land that no one is using. It is not under taxed wasteland as some urban politicians have described it. It is vital to maintain our food supply. Agriculture is a major economic engine in Ontario.\n    Residential encroachment and land fragmentation are major problems in Ontario. The revised PPS will very likely make each of these problems worse. Frequently new non farm people clash with farmers. In our area we have experienced theft, vandalism, and arson.\n    It is understood that we need more housing. Laying waste to Ontario\u2019s farmland is not an acceptable solution. There is more than enough land set aside already to achieve the Province\u2019s stated goal of 1.5 million residential units so those lands should be developed first. We need more intensive development and increased building heights to house more people in fully serviced areas. The rules must compel municipalities to do that. We also need to vote wisely in the next Federal Election.\n    Unserviced development and lot creation in rural areas must be discouraged. The boundaries of settlement areas including Cities, Towns,  Hamlets, and Villages must be made rigid and permanent. We need to grow up not out.\n     It is understood that there can now be 3 residential units on all classes of land except Heavy Industrial. First that threatens Employment Lands. Secondly most existing residents will not do that because the cost is prohibitive. Developers who want income properties might do that.\n     As a farmer I have no interest in building 2 more residential within, attached, or in close proximity to my current dwelling unless I can bring in a manufactured (park) home that can be removed when no longer needed. Most municipalities would not allow that unless the Province amends Legislation to force them. Multiple houses on the same lot could create serious legal issues in the event of a business or personal relationship breakdown. Money would be better spent on more land, machinery, barns, and storage for grain, forage, and machinery.\n     Many farms contain multiple parcels. Since a dwelling could always be built on an existing lot of record it follows that on each individual parcel anyone could build 3 residential units within, attached, or in close proximity to each other.\n     The PPS allows a surplus dwelling to be severed provided the remnant lands are rezoned to prevent the erection of a dwelling in perpetuity. The revised PPS allows for up to 3 lots with dwellings to be severed off using the Surplus Dwelling Provision. This is a big problem. Each of the severed lots can now create 3 residential units within, attached or in close proximity to each of the houses for a total of 9 residential units where there was once only one. It is recommended that the Surplus Dwelling Provision should be limited to ONE parcel with the 3 residential units on it. The alternative would be not to allow a surplus dwelling severance on any property with more than one dwelling on it.\n    Local Planning Authorities usually get around MDS1 using the Committee of Adjustment for a Minor Variance to get dwellings built near livestock facilities. Conversely MDS2 is applied to the nanometer when siting livestock buildings near existing houses.\n     I want to close on a positive note. A previous Proposal contained provision to sever three residential lots from an agricultural land parcel. It is very much appreciated that the Government responded to our Community\u2019s concerns and removed it. It is good to know that the Government listened. It gives one hope that the Government will once again listen and might fix the imperfections of this Proposal.\n     Agricultural land is a scarce and precious non renewable resource which must be protected for the present and the future.\n    Thank you so very much for the opportunity to comment.\n",

        "comment":"Hello, here is my feedback:\n- Transportation-oriented communities are good because they discourage sprawl and its associated costs (i.e. environmental, infrastructural, etc.). For any new major transit work (like adding a new transit station), please make it mandatory to include some sort of housing project or a mixed use place (housing + retail) if that is possible. (To add on, Canada, generally, has a strong car-centric culture. I think while building new infrastructure, it\u2019s important to account for the alternative modes of transportation, such as bikes and e-scooters, as well as making things easier to access by foot. This will encourage people to use their car less, which would be beneficial for congestion and environment. Also, asking companies to implement more hybrid\/remote options might be good for easing congestion.)\n- Please look into trying to convert unused offices into either a housing to buy or rent, like this project: https:\/\/kitchener.ctvnews.ca\/downtown-kitchener-ont-office-building-bei\u2026\n- Perhaps asking municipalities to get rid of mandatory parking minimums for development (like they did in Toronto, Edmonton and in other cities around the world). This way it will make it a bit less expensive for developers to build housing.\n- I think looking into alternative methods and \/or new technologies would help to reduce the cost of housing construction would help (like using 3D printer, for example). Links: https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/show\/can-3d-printing-become-a-solution-for\u2026 , https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/science\/3d-printed-houses-1.6178421\n- I agree that working with municipalities to change the zoning laws to increase densification is a good idea.\n- Strong protections for environment and farmlands are absolutely needed as we are in the midst of climate crisis. I think it\u2019s in the best interest of all Ontarians that we have sufficient resources to be able to grow our own food when needed since there is a concern that it might become unsustainable to rely on imports for food sometime in the future (Link: https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/9863235\/climate-change-effects-food-security\u2026 ). Additionally, disregarding the environment is not wise as there are associated health concerns that would result in additional costs (i.e. people getting sick because of pollution) Link: https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/environment-climate-change\/campaigns\/canadian-\u2026 . In addition to that, we need to prepare better for the forest fires, as this has become a massive problem this year.\n",

Approved building lots, become an investment, have value attached to them. purchase price (thousands of dollars) at market value , lawyers fees, property taxes,etc. Also severed existing lot into two lots all agencies involved had input at this time. By changing the rules this will have a massive impact on investment. Basically, these areas will become worthless with little to no value when the province is allowing building on Prime Agricultural areas.\nI understand om a similar situation , example Oak Ridges Morrain, existing building lots were grandfathered into the system. Would this set precedence for this and other similar situations.\nAs part of the PPS I am requesting the province to grandfather exisiting building lots into the system, allowing the building of houses on these lots. These are lots of record.\nMineral Aggregate Resources:\nI own 100 acres of land which is primarily aggregate. There is a former gravel pit on the south end of this property and a former aggregate pit on another property next to the property on the north end. The property is primarily hill and ridge,  gravel and sand. This deposit runs from the north end to the south end of this property. Also recently several construction people have inquired about this property.\nIt has good access and close to areas to were aggregate is required. It has been brought to my attention that this area is within the natural heritage system. As part of the PPS can this area (mineral aggregate resource) be grandfathered into the system as a  Mineral Aggregate Resource\nLot Creation and Lot Adjustments:\nWhy should family members have to leave the farm, to find a home and then return daily to the family farm .We should try to keep our young people in the rural area, helps with affordability.\n",

The businesses on the industrial land made the decision to locate there because it was zoned industrial, these are billion dollar decision. The industrial land needs highway transportation and a sewage treatment facility to make the industrial park an asset that would appeal to light and heavy industry. The location already has two dock to load or offload ships and the hydro towers are present for the hydro load to be fed into the area. The new city of Townsend is still waiting to be further developed, so there is no need to piecemeal out or encroach on this industrial designated land and bugger all the businesses that have set their future on this area.\n",

Many of the proposed measures described on the web page for this 019-6813 seem sensible on the surface. Regrettably, the government seems determined to carry this out in a highly objectionable manner with steps that are both unnecessary and harmful.\nIt's nice to have the option to provide references but it hardly seems necessary. Open any newspaper on almost any day going back to late 2022 and it's easy to find reporting on the many faults with this government's plan.  You have at least backed away (or so you claim) from enabling multi-home development on farmland.  (Where do you think the food is going to come from to feed this huge increase in population?)  Now, before it's too late, scrap the rest of your ill-advised ideas.\n- Developing portions of the Green Belt.  Everything about this has the stink of backroom dealings with developer friends.  First, while campaigning to be leader, the now-premier proposed to allow development.  After strenuous criticism, he promised to leave it alone. How curious that the developers would go ahead and buy the land anyway. Then -- surprise -- once in power, promise broken, development is on again. Massive profits for developers and evacuation of public investment.\nhttps:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/ford-wynne-greenbelt-development\u2026\nhttps:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/canada\/article-ontario-greenbelt-plan-o\u2026\n- False claims that it's necessary to open more development land. Your own government's industry-led task force, as well as others, (e.g. Regional Planning Commissioners of Ontario) have shown that there are already enough housing units in the approval pipeline. \"There is not by any stretch of the imagination a case to be made that we need more land designated for housing in order to meet that 1.5 million threshold.\" (Quote by the Ontario environment program manager of Environmental Defence)\nhttps:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/canada\/article-ontario-greenbelt-lands-\u2026\nOne wonders if part of the agenda is to justify the ridiculous Highway 413 by building subdivisions in the Green Belt and then saying see, we need another highway to serve all those residential areas.\n- Will you really back away from subdividing farms? Apparently you've said so, yet it is reported that subsequent revisions to the proposal still call for it.\nhttps:\/\/www.observerxtra.com\/rally-against-urban-sprawl-draws-100-to-pr\u2026\n- Again helping developers at the expense of \"the little guy\" whom you claim to support, you intend to shift development fees away from developers and onto municipal taxpayers.

My region has many years of careful planning to preserve farmland, the aquifers we rely on for water, and undisturbed spaces for wildlife. Yet you presume to override this and impose your agenda. How carefully did you evaluate the plans that these regions have made? On what basis do you vacate them and dictate your own?

Where we build:  Pillar #2 in the Provincial Planning Statement proposes that one priority should be to \u201cmake land available for development.\u201d I suggest that instead of removing protections from land in the Greenbelt or agricultural land to make it available, developers should be required to first use land currently sitting vacant that is already development-ready. In other words, \u201cmake land available for development\u201d should be changed to \u201cuse available land within existing urban boundaries for development.\u201d\n2. What we build: Before any land is used for purposes other than affordable housing, the projected need for affordable housing should first be addressed. Locations in existing residential or commercial areas should be developed as Missing Middle communities, with the proportion of affordable housing being greater than anything that might be termed \u201cluxury\u201d or \u201cupscale\u201d  or \u201chigh end\u201d(with price tags that match the descriptors).\nWe need to stop developing in ways that suit the ageing demographic of wealthy SFD or condo owners, and instead need to re-envision the way we use land for work, recreation and living space.

Ontario has one of the highest qualities of life in the world - we need to have enhancements to the current provincial planning approaches not a dismantling of them - giving away our province to developers.\nPlease listen to all of our farm organizations - the three rural severances proposed must be cancelled entirely and municipalities must be allowed to continue their no rural severance policies.  Their must be more attention paid to sustainability and climate change - not policies that take us in the opposite direction - housing should not come at any cost.  We need to have balanced, efficient and complete communities that leverage existing infrastructure - not destroy our remaining farmland and greenspace.\nPlease listen to all the citizens speaking up, the environmental and climate change organizations, the farm associations and so many others providing such clear feedback.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"As a farmer whose family has farmed the same farm in Caledon for 150 years, I am supportive of the proposed policies to form a new provincial planning policy instrument.\nI disagree with those who have concerns with the loss of farmland as well as those who are concerned with food security.\nThe daily loss of farmland to actual urban development is in fact a very small percentage as compared to the numbers that we have heard in the press. Ontario actually saw an increase in cultivated acreage as compared to earlier census figures.\nAny proposed increase in population will not result in food\nsecurity issues. Food security may be a difficult issue to address when seventy percent of our\ncrop production is exported. Throughout Covid 19, Ontario faced numerous challenges to our\nsupply chain which spurred innovation within our fruit and vegetable sector and our processing\nand packaging sectors to name just a few. As we pivot to more locally grown food through\ninnovation, Ontario farmers have an opportunity to serve a growing population and benefit from\nretaining an increased market share of our consumers\u2019 grocery budget.\nIncreased severances in rural areas will pose significant challenges to existing\nand expanding livestock operations. Will we need to revisit the current MDS guidelines or should\nthe owners of new severances agree to some type of an acknowledgment that could be put on\ntitle that they will not object to normal farm practices on the surrounding farm?\nIn many circumstances farm severances support the succession of the family farm. In 1970, my\nmother was widowed in her 40\u2019s when my brother and I were 14 years old and 9 years old\nrespectively. Through the sale of the allowed 3 one acre lots per 100 acre parcel, we had the\nresources to hold onto the farm until such time that we were both old enough to farm. We both\nmaintain farming operations to this day.\nThe increase in farmland values is another reason to support farmland severances. It is virtually\nimpossible for one sibling that is a farmer to buy out the other non farming sibling\u2019s share of a farming\nenterprise upon the death of a parent. Upon reaching such an impasse, the land is often sold to\nsettle an estate and the farming sibling is forced to exit the industry.\nWhen farms such as previously mentioned or any other 100- acre or 200-acre farms are bought\nand absorbed into larger farming enterprises, it is not uncommon for the purchaser to demolish\nthe older house and barns on the property to reduce the tax assessment along with his tax bill.\nThis results in a lower assessment for the municipality and an increased mill rate for the existing\nratepayers. Such practices result in a net loss of housing in some of our rural areas.\nTo direct all future growth to urban areas exclusively would be short sighted without fully\nunderstanding the challenges of doing so. The mayor of Brampton stated last week that they\ncurrently have building permits for thousands of apartment units on hold due to undersized\nwastewater services in an older community that did not anticipate growth of this magnitude in\ntheir downtown core. The time required as well as the cost to replace all pipe to the sewer main\ntrunks not only creates a massive increase in housing costs, but it also disrupts local residents\nand businesses for years to come.\nThere are other infrastructure deficits within built boundaries such as insufficient storm water\nretention and catchment areas and a shortage of schools, parks and recreational areas.\nOntario has promoted intensification within our urban boundaries for upwards of 20 years.\nThroughout that period, a series of unintended consequences have materialized that have had a\ndetrimental impact on the affordability and the availability of housing in Ontario.\nDuring Covid 19 many families moved out of our urban areas for reasons of affordability, housing\nchoices, safety from crime and fear of infection and the ability to work from home. A new\nphenomenon occurred called leaping the Greenbelt whereby new homeowners relocated from\nthe GTA beyond the Greenbelt to Simcoe County to name just one municipality.\nMany of our small rural communities have experienced a relocation of schools and recreational\nfacilities to larger urban communities due to previous planning policies.  If Ontario is to retain vibrant rural settlement areas, those areas must\nhave an opportunity to expand their settlement areas to sustain not only their residents but the\nrural economy surrounding them. Expanding employment areas are also vital to stimulating the\nrural economy. All too often, these opportunities are denied to municipalities that are constrained by the Greenbelt and its restrictive policies.\nI look forward to the passing of the new provincial planning policy for the benefit of both urban and rural Ontarians.\n",

        "comment":"Given each of these target areas & \u201cfast growing\u201d municipalities are unique, with their own challenges, I am submitting these comments specifically for the MZO & subsequent mechanisms proposed  for the Nanticoke Industrial Park - which would result in rezoning these lands to residential allowing for them construction of 15,000 new homes, housing upwards of 40,000 people within the existing Nanticoke Industrial Park which is home to 2 major heavy industrial employers & multiple auxiliary businesses.\nThe existing 3 kilometre buffer zone is composed of woodland and farmland, preserved because zero new housing has been permitted after existing homes were dismantled 50 years ago.\nThere can be no compromise on allowing housing \u2026 whether it be 40,000 people or 400 or even 40 the threat to Lake Erie Steel Works, Imperial \/ Esso, & any future industrial development will come from complaints about heavy industry noise, dust, odour, truck traffic, vibration, soot, dust, health risks. Housing & heavy industry are mutually exclusive.\nI will address my concerns using the 6 themes detailed in the EBR Posting;\nResidential land supply\nIf there was no other lands within Haldimand County, or along the municipal boundary shared by Haldimand & Norfolk Counties, to consolidate & service than this proposal would make sense. But the village of Townsend still has ample lands which can be reconsolidated around existing infrastructure without creating conflict with existing heavy industry, who are major local employers & industrial taxpayers. One must question will the loss of these industrial zoned lands to residential development be replaced locally elsewhere? If this question has not been answered, it should be, as duplicating what the Nanticoke Industrial Park has, with access to rail & water transportation with an established utility corridor. And who pays & coordinates the required consultation required to establish this \u201cnew\u201d area for industry to develop. Can we afford to duplicate the development required to build the infrastructure specifically invested for industrial development within the area defined as the Nanticoke Industrial Park. Bottomline residential land supply must go hand in hand with industrial land supply as without the one you cannot have the other.\nAttainable housing supply and mix\nThe existing residents of the village of Nanticoke have shared their personal experiences that such a development & it\u2019s new residents will have to deal with by living beside heavy industry. Existing industry has forewarned managing these concerns & assisting the cleanup of the byproducts of their production, as a good responsible neighbour, will exceed their economic capacity with the addition of 15,000 new homes.\nRather than focus on legislating the fast tracking of lands to encourage development - focus on creating the framework which requires an affordable mix of housing for developers to gain access to said lands. We can all agree the supply of housing is an issue - supply can only be addressed by ensuring all future developments be required to have an appropriate mix of housing - & this is where the province, & even the federal government restricting the infrastructure funding pursestrings, can regulate. NIMBY, at the local level, continues to be an issue municipal councils struggle with, when it comes to residential development. Take this out of their hands & developers will have no choice but to provide a mix of housing or they will not be able to gain access to any new supply.\nIn the case of the Nanticoke Industrial Park, supply & mix can be developed elsewhere, given there is ample local lands available to consolidate elsewhere - lands which would not create conflict or threaten the loss of major employers - all because of poor planning.\nGrowth management\nGrowth requires not only land but infrastructure, which requires a strong industrial sector which provides employment & a tax base. Other than that the Nanticoke Industrial Park has a large block of land, which could accommodate such a large residential development, no other amenities exist. The developer promises to address some of these, but again this infrastructure & these supporting services exist elsewhere, under-utilized. Growth requires more than infrastructure services but also requires adequate transportation capacity, community services, access to medical services & schools to name a few - all of which do not exist in the Nanticoke Industrial Park, & would  exceed existing capacity if the latter were added to neighbouring communities already over burden services. Again planning requires forethought beyond the construction of a home & this proposal does not address these deficiencies.\nEnvironment and natural resources\nThe industrial buffer of the Nanticoke Industrial Park was to prevent conflict w residential neighbours, these lands are for the most part farmland & forest, which creates green space & a natural buffer. The abundance of wildlife that thrives in this area, complimented by the natural landscape that serves to capture & naturally scrub carbon has been given no recognition. This is all lost if there is no buffer given between the industrial-residential interface.\nNo one has listened to industry when they\u2019ve spoken to the improvements they\u2019ve invested to become \u201ccleaner\u201d - the loss of this investment & future investments will come at a cost - it will also result in another community benefitting from their commitment when they move their operations to a more accommodating community. This will also undermine any future opportunity to further develop the Nanticoke Industrial Park as a leader in cleaner steel & fuel production. Yet undeveloped is the remaining connectivity through the utility corridor that remains from Hydro One - new green initiatives, small scale nuclear development - all could benefit to this corridor that provides access to Ontario & U.S. markets. This existing corridor also has yet unexplored opportunities which could expand new technologies which connect us & store our data - again an opportunity to be greener in this growing sector. An additional opportunity exists within our national security sector, NORAD, is seeking lands to build new facilities, central to Canada\/U.S, w capacity for connectivity, including physical infrastructure that could utilize existing utility corridors that connect both countries. These opportunities require lands w buffers, not conducive to neighbouring subdivisions.\nCommunity infrastructure\nAs spoken to previously, under-utilized municipal infrastructure capacity exists elsewhere, specifically the village of Townsend. Unfortunately we cannot solve all our problems by trying to build ourselves out of the housing shortage - a home has no value if you do not have access to water, have to sit in traffic on roads not meant to accommodate 15,000 new residents, have to drive an hour to a grocery store, cannot find a doctor, dentist or other professional services, have to travel outside of your municipality for community services, to a hospital or for schooling - again building of new homes should only happen after this capacity is built, so when this great influx arrives, we do not further undermine already existing stressed systems & services. Why do we see NIMBY associated w these major developments? In part due to frustration from existing residents who see this influx for what it is - poor planning. Want to build support for a growing Ontario, build capacity to support growth.\nStreamlined planning framework\nThis only comes about through wholistic planning, again just building homes does not address the many considerations one must make to ensure every resident has access to infrastructure & services. Streamlining the process requires improved communication between all levels of government & longterm funding w performance measures that ensures transparency & accountability.\nI trust some of these thoughts would apply elsewhere but my comments are specific to my community.\nBy no means am I opposed to development - I am just suggesting there is a better way, one in which all parties would benefit vs being pitted against each other.\nIn my opinion the developer has no standing on this matter, as they knowingly purchased these industrial lands, from a company forced to shore up their employees pension fund.\nCan a developer profit from a change of location? If they were prepared to do the work to reconsolidate the Townsend site lands & if government works with them to sell the lands in the Nanticoke Industrial Park, to industry which will fuel the demand for homes.\nWithout industry you have no jobs, without jobs, just building it, thinking they will come is shortsighted & an economic Russian roulette w Haldimand & Norfolk counties local economy.\nThe last point I would like to make is we need to seriously look at densification & steering development clear of paving over anymore of our agricultural lands.\nOur country has recently seen how our economy can be held hostage when we do not have capacity to produce our own goods in Canada - we must remember that we have a finite amount of agriculture land & we must plan around its conservation not the reverse.\nSadly many municipalities, & even provincial & federal ministry\u2019s, believe we can build our way out of all the issues we face, that by bigger & larger developments this will lead to local  prosperity.\nUnfortunately cutting corners when we try to \u201cfast track\u201d projects will forgo the necessary planning & development to support these new residential developments. I was taught in life there are no shortcuts - you pay now or pay later - todays society has always pushed out these costs to the next generation to deal with. We wouldn\u2019t need to do this is if when we planned future development we took into account all the required costs associated w building a sustainable community.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Clark,\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed changes found in the proposed Provincial Policy Statement, 2023 (PPS 2023). Specifically, I am concerned about the impact the proposed policies will have on agricultural lands in the province.\nOntario\u2019s prime agricultural land is a finite, non-renewable resource that comprises less than 5% of Ontario\u2019s land base1. With the growing rate of farmland loss in the province, currently at a rate of 319 acres per day2, it is more important than ever before that the province protects our prime areas. Ontario\u2019s farmland directly supports the agri-food sector, which is the largest economic sector in the province, employing more than 750,000 Ontarians along the supply chain and annually contributing over $47 billion to the province\u2019s GDP3.\nWhile I recognize the need to address issues of housing availability and affordability, I am concerned that several of the policies in the proposed PPS 2023 will not adequately contribute to the housing issues and instead will create significant issues for the long-term viability of Ontario\u2019s agri-food sector. This submission will focus primarily on the proposed PPS 2023 impacts on the agricultural system.\nComments regarding Agricultural Systems and the proposed PPS 2023\nWhile I appreciate the attempt to adapt the Growth Plan policies pertaining to agricultural system mapping into the PPS 2023, the language undermines the previous requirement for municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe from requiring them to use agricultural systems. S4.3.1 states, \u201cplanning authorities are encouraged to use an agricultural system approach.\u201d The use of the word \u2018encouraged\u2019 is not strong enough and will not require municipalities to use the provincial agricultural system mapping. Given that this is now optional for municipalities, it will decrease the likelihood of adopting agricultural systems mapping and create fragmented agricultural systems between municipalities. This is partly due to the added responsibility on rural municipalities that tend to have more limited resources to complete agricultural system mapping that the province would otherwise support. The use of a provincial agricultural systems approach to planning is crucial to protect agricultural land given its importance as an economic driver and in recognition of the natural heritage and hydrological features and functions that farmland plays4.\nRecommendation 1: The province should amend the language in the proposed PPS 2023 that requires agricultural system mapping for all municipalities.\nI note the removal of the policy language which stated, \u201cplanning authorities shall designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas in accordance with guidelines developed by the Province.\u201d Instead, the proposed s.4.3.1.2 states, \u201cas part of the agricultural land base, prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture.\u201d There is concern as to the various approaches that municipalities may choose to take on designating prime agricultural areas. Provincial guidelines should remain the standard by which municipalities designate prime agricultural areas, in order to ensure a consistent approach across municipalities. By removing this policy, the province is risking inconsistent approaches to designating prime agricultural areas which can lead to further farmland fragmentation, particularly between municipal boundaries. It is important to note that farmland fragmentation makes farming practices significantly more challenging and creates and assortment of land-use conflicts. While the policy states that prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas shall be designated and protected for long-term use for agriculture, s.4.3.3 permits up to three lot severances per farm parcel, which undermines the protection s.4.3.1.2 states it is intended to provide. It is important to highlight here the contradictory nature of these sections: S.4.3.3 needs to be removed in order to protect the agricultural system that the PPS 2023 proposes needs to be protected.\nRecommendation 2: The PPS 2023 should include the requirement for municipalities to use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nRecommendation 3: S.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts the notion of a contiguous agricultural system.\nI acknowledge that the policy provides opportunities for housing for new and young farmers during succession planning and transitioning the farm to new operators. However, municipalities should be permitted to allow for additional restrictions to help protect prime agricultural areas and mitigate the likelihood of conflict arising. The proposed s.4.3.3.2 prevents municipalities from being able to be more restrictive and prevent these types of conflicts, as well as utilize their own local knowledge and context for their communities needs, such as rural communities whose economies are heavily based on agricultural production. The weakened policies on utilizing provincial frameworks for designating prime agricultural areas as well as agricultural system mapping will put these rural and agricultural communities at risk.\nRecommendation 4: S.4.3.3.2 should be removed in order to allow rural and agricultural communities the ability to properly protect their agricultural system, rural character, and implement local context into their official plans and zoning by-laws.\nI urge the province to reconsider the proposed policy changes that have weakened the requirements for municipalities to implement an agricultural system and limit their  ability to include more restrictive provisions to protect their rich agricultural land base and economies. This will help ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in Ontario and protect the agri-food sector\u2019s significant contributions to the province\u2019s GDP and employment numbers.\nSincerely,\n(your name \/ organization name)\nReferences\n[1] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. 2016.

        "comment":"I do like the ability of the municipalities to have the control over housing allowing them to use infill and higher density within the borders of the boundaries already existing.  Rather than paving over our precious, life sustaining agricultural land, it is much better to use the existing infrastructure within the\nexisting borders and keep the farmland to feed the growing population in Ontario.  The goal should be to be able to get as much food as possible local to decrease the reliance on other sources, especially since we have seen the supply chain problems can affect our population.  The municipalities have more accurate knowledge of the local situation and are then able to respond to improve the local issues in housing.  There should not be encouragement or incentives from the government to sever farmland.  Farm federations should be listen to when they speaking against this encouragement.\nRecommendations:\n \u00a0\u00a0\nS.4.3.3 should be removed in its entirety as it undermines and contradicts overall connected farm resources and protection of farm land.\nIn 2.3 under Settlement Areas and Settlement Area Boundary Expansion, language requiring\ndensification and mixed land uses has been changed from \"shall' to \"should\" weakening policies aimed at intensification and use of current lands available.\nThat municipalities use the guidelines developed by the province to designate prime agricultural areas and specialty crop areas.\nMaintain growth plans that include comprehensive municipal review, and protect farmland and greenfield sites.\nThe definition of affordable to 30% of income has always been the goal for people when budgeting.  Leaving the definition up to the municipality is a wise decision.  I don't understand how the so called attainable housing can apply to everyone.  The census information should guide the ratio of what housing is being made in any subdivision.  There should be an adequate amount of housing to match the income amounts of the residents in each separate area.  I know that Stratford's housing is so expensive that waitressing and personal support workers who are needed in the area can't afford to live in the immediate area.  The control over what is being built should meet the need in each city.\nRecommendation:\u00a0\nReturn affordable housing and low\/moderate income household definitions to the provincial planning statement.\nPrevious planning statements recommending land use patterns should \u201cminimize negative impacts to air quality and climate change, promote energy efficiency\u201d and \u201cprepare for the impacts of a changing climate\u201d have been removed.  With the climate crisis and the \"era of global boiling\" these recommendations should be reinstated with the PPS.\nMZO (Ministry zoning Orders) would no longer be required to be consistent with any\nprovincial policies\/plans or municipal official plans. The Minister may require an MZO for lands\nbeyond those designated by a municipality for housing. That use of an MZO would be final, and\ncould include infrastructure requirements.\nRecommendation:\u00a0\nMZO's must be consistent with provincial policies and with municipal official plans.  The use of MZO's should be very limited and definitely not overuse as has been the case.  I speak from Stratford where I fought the Xinyi MZO which was illegally acquired by the Mayor only and did not have a public discussion or vote.\nWith the extreme flooding that is being experienced, the expert professional advice that Conservation Authorities have followed in the pass should be restored as we need updated, reliable watershed plans.\nRecommendation:\nEnable Conservation Authorities to prepare watershed plans.  Continue to require watershed plans in advance of urban boundary expansions.\n",

        "comment":"I would like to make a few comments concerning the MMHA proposal in regards to Indigenous engagement, the importance of archaeological sites, and the possibilities of protective mandates when dealing with First Nations heritage.\nYou've identified that there be proactive strategies for identifying archaeological sites as part of your steps moving forward. However, you have no mention of the proactive protection of set archaeological sites if (mis)identified or discovered where there was thought to be not potential.\nIt is one thing to acknowledge First Nations heritage sites that are important to Indigenous communities. It is another to make appropriate protocols for ensuring that the future generations have a place that is meaningful to return to. It is unfair that even the awareness of what was once there, such as a village, is now a highways or housing subdivision. Hidden away from public eyes and never to be celebrated or remembered.\nThe Ministy of Citizenship and Multiculturalism  released statements to registered Archaeologists that 3500 projects were opened with the Ministry in 2022, and 3200 reports were filed for the entirety of the province. Nothing released in these bulletins describes how many sites were protected or completely removed through excavation. It is likely that the majority of the site has been removed. I am for this new planning initiative, then what are we doing in terms of heritage? Who's heritage? Indigenous sites are contiuiously and completely removed. What is to be remembered and celebrated?\nI ask that more stringent engagement protocols for lands and projects that have Indigenous interest. Particularly when sites are triggered for an archaeological assessment, the duty to consult. I will provide an example of the type of lack luster protocols and engagement that happen and what the MMHA and the updated plan may be able to assist with.\nAn archaeological (CRM) company that is tasked with performing the assessment is bending the law and formality of the duty to consult. They have stated that they wish to protect the client into entering an agreement with the First Nations. Communication between the client and First Nations communities can not be established as they with to be named anonymous and refuse to engage,\n\"[The] Proponent has not agreed to provide contact information....at this time the CRM company reminded the Proponent of the expectation among local Indigenous communities that representatives be retained as paid on-site monitors during a Stage 3 field survey\".\nThey continue and state that the current legislation does require the private\/independent corp. are not required to engage but is a suggested that they do. However, they do state that Indigenous representatives can come out for free and watch the destruction and removal of our heritage. I wish to move forward and ask that it not be suggested but required for First Nation involvement at all stages of archaeological assessments and not merely 'suggested '.\nAs a First Nations person and archaeologist, I find it very difficult within my profession to deal with this behaviour. The cilent and archaeology company are asking for free consultation and behalf of the community. The CRM company has, however, \"recommended that all applicable Indigenous communities be granted access to the property throughout the investigation. \" This tells me that they want free consultation on treaty lands and on sites that have Indigenous materials, and it be out of the goodness of our hearts that we participate.\nMy final point that I would like to address is when an archaeological assessment is triggered and when. I have been part of multiple site discussions that involve compromised protected sites or sites that have yet to be assessed properly.\nEvery municipality around the GTA seems to have a different idea of what engagement means and what is required of them for archaeological assessments. I ask that not only does this new planning ask for site assessments that have potential, but better protocols for site protection and enchment of the Ontario Heritage Act. Not every site should be excavated. Not every site has a stone foundation. Time and time again are Indigenous villages, burial sites, and early settlements completely removed. They are being removed because the money is there and and the province does seem to care about the CHVI value of First Nations' site or history. it stands in the way of housing developments, highways, and even walking paths in conservation areas. It is unfair that private housing developers hold the land title, the money, and the blessing of the province to remove the cultural heritage of another group they have no concerns about.\nI hope that some of these points resonate with the current plan in development.\n",

These two documents represent decades of progress on land use policy.  The Growth Plan was the first plan to provide a framework for implementing Ontario\u2019s vision for building stronger, prosperous communities by better managing growth in this region.  The GGH has some of Canada\u2019s most important fertile soil and productive farmland, a moderate climate, and abundant water resources.  It is one of four provincial plans that guide this region\u2019s growth.  I urge you not to eliminate our Growth Plan.\nThe proposed Planning Statement is housing focussed and facilitates urban sprawl development by:\n-\tEliminating mandatory intensification and greenfield density targets\n-\tAllowing Municipalities to expand settlement areas without a Municipal Comprehensive Review\n-\tAllowing multiple severances on prime agricultural lands\n-\tWeakening and eliminating policies that address climate change\n-\tRemoving the requirements of the Growth Plan that requires Municipalities to undertake watershed planning\nOntario\u2019s Housing Affordability Task Force in 2022 determined that the housing shortage was not caused by a land shortage.  The Task Force advised that the solution must come from densification.  Our existing Growth Plan is focussed on achieving complete communities supported by transit, protected employment zones and an increase in the amount and variety of housing available.\nDo not replace the PPS (2020) and the Growth Plan with a Planning Statement which prioritizes land development at the expense of other provincial matters.  Building on the policies already in place and incorporating strong policies to protect and restore our natural environment is urgently needed.  Floods, wildfires and extreme heat are causing life threatening and irreparable damage to our natural environment, our health and our safety.  What is proposed  fails to address the conditions we are facing.\n",

We must RETAIN all Provincial Policy Statement and Growth Plan policies for the Greater Golden Horseshoe designed to curb sprawl and protect farmland and natural areas.\nThe proposed changes would accelerate urban sprawl and the ongoing loss of farmland and natural areas in Ontario.\nA shortage of land is NOT the cause of Ontario\u2019s housing shortage, as noted by the Housing Affordability Task Force in 2022:\n\"Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts. \u2026 Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (p. 10)\"\nThe proposed policy changes would undermine density targets designed to reduce urban sprawl and allow municipalities to expand without a review of impacts on farmland and natural areas.  The removal of the requirement for municipalities to undertake watershed planning will lead to flooding events as our climate changes due to global warming.\nThis government wants to force municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm, even in prime agricultural areas.  Considering that Ontario is losing farmland at the rate of 319 acres per day this will make matters much worse and spell disaster for the lands and waters that sustain us.\nIt is time to listen to the experts, who have shown that the amount of land already designated for development FAR EXCEEDS what is needed to meet long-range housing targets.\n",

        "comment":"I am very concerned with further weakening of what remains of Ontario\u2019s planning rules, with the proposed  Provincial Policy Statement, and the removal of the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe altogether.\nI would applaud intensification done with good planning. Of great concern to me is the weakening of intensification targets and other measures that will limit the creation of inclusive, and complete, walkable communities that offer affordable housing and provide ready access to services and to parks and nature.  When viewed by the eyes of a child, senior, or one with physical handicaps, and planned for them, communities become liveable for everyone.\nI am concerned that housing will be created that is not conducive to the creation of community and will be out of the reach for only the well-off.\nI would applaud improved watershed and flood management, and any increase to the Greenbelt and other natural areas with increased linkages among them, rather their fragmentation. I would applaud measures that help agriculture rather than fragmentation of farmland which in turn threatens the viability of agriculture in the Province.\nI am concerned about the removal of protections to environmentally sensitive lands, the mandated opening up of land within the Greenbelt and in many other rural areas for development and unchecked sprawl.  The result will be increases in CO2 and other noxious chemicals in the air and water; loss of their moderating effect on temperatures; and increased flood risk. Further more there will be increased food insecurity and higher food prices, with greater malnutrition and hunger.\nThe loss of agricultural land is a major loss to Ontario\u2019s economy and to the world\u2019s food supply.   The loss of agricultural lands includes the loss of their woodlots, and wetlands. Their loss along with the loss of green spaces exacerbates the climate crisis with its increasingly severe weather events, putting our health, our lives, and homes at risk.\nI expect that Ontario Government to work for the betterment of Ontario, all that live here  and for the improvement of our health and wellbeing. The environment has a huge impact on our health and safety and so would expect the Provincial Government to protect, value and improve our natural environment.   Go back to the drawing board!\n",

The intent of the Growth Plan was to refocus on balancing growth with agriculture and\nOMAFRA has spent significant time and resources (at our expense as taxpayers!!) to\ndetermine which areas have the Prime Agricultural Lands (Class 1-3 for specialty crops)\nAND for the first time there is recognition for the need for Classes 4-7 to farm effectively\n(these lands are still used for crops AND for pasture for cattle \u2013 ALL of which is\nnecessary to farm!) REQUIRING MUNCIPALITIES TO PROTECT SPECIALTY CROP AREAS IS\nNOT SUFFICIENT AS CLASS 4-7 FARMLAND ESSENTIAL FOR FARMING!!!!!!!!!!!! This was\nFINALLY understood in the Provincially-Mapped Agricultural Systems Approach.\nRemoving this requirement places agriculture at risk in municipalities where the\nprotection of agriculture is not valued.\nb.\n4.3.2.Permitted Uses\n1. On-Farm Diversified Uses (OFDUs) should have more strict criteria, and should \u2018benefit from\nbeing on a farm\u2019. The province\u2019s attempt with On-Farm Diversified Use allows businesses to be run on\nfarms that DO NOT BENEFIT FROM BEING ON FARMS with disastrous results as follows:\n\uf0b7 Results in more traffic on narrow rural roads which decreases safety for farmers on roads,\ninterferes with timely access to crops (which is time-sensitive due to weather) \u2013 resulting in Loss\nof crops A VISCIOUS CIRCLE WHICH WILL RESULT IN FARMERS OUT OF BUSINESS AND ONTARIO\nNO LONGER ABLE TO PRODUCE ADEQUATE FOOD\n\uf0b7 Businessmen purchase farms that \u2018farmers who farm for a living\u2019 can no longer afford. The \u2018real\nfarmer\u2019 rents the land \u2013 creates \u2018farming income\u2019 for the owner\/businessman to qualify as a\nfarmer \u2013 essentially allowing \u2018businessmen to create a farm on which to run a business!!\u201d This is\nidentified as a loophole in University of Guelph professor Dr. Wayne Caldwell\u2019s \u201cGuidelines on\nPermitted Uses as a Tool to Achieve Farmland Protection, Farm Diversification and Economic\nBenefits: Assessing effectiveness and identifying best practices\u201d.\n\uf0b7 Businessmen who come out to the country to run their business off a farm are building\n\u2018agricultural buildings\u2019 in which to house these businesses prior to making application for On\nFarm Diversified Use \u2013 they get breaks on taxation, permits etc when the intent is not\nagricultural (in hindsight)\n\uf0b7 Businessmen running OFDU businesses on farms are not paying the same taxes and do not have\nthe overhead of their competitors in commercial areas \u2013 puts these people out of business and\ndoes not make sense in terms of employment opportunities.\n\uf0b7 The government needs to reassess \u2018who is a farmer\u2019 ; the current $7,000 gross income\n(established in the 1970s) has not kept up with inflation (which now would equal approximately\n$58,000) and is too easy to achieve. As a result, municipalities are not getting the same tax\npayments (as these \u2018farmers\u2019 are not actually farming for a living, but they get the same tax\nbreaks as the farmer who does farm for a living). Consequently, municipalities cannot maintain\nour roads and other infrastructure as they do not have sufficient money!\n\uf0b7 Results in customers driving to the country for businesses that should be in urban or settlement\nareas \u2013 causing more emissions which affect climate \u2013 which then affect ability to grow crops \u2013\nVISCIOUS CYCLE!!! AND more cars on these roads, who meet the farmer at the top of a hill \u2013\nfarmer killed as no protection while on a tractor (THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY!!) When we\nlose another farmer, we lose the farm production!!\n\uf0b7 OFDUs need to be analyzed in terms of intent! The province allows almost any \u2018business\u2019 to be\nan OFDU \u2013 not recognizing that a business NOT relating to AGRICULTURE will bring in more\nincome than farming! FARMING IS HARD WORK \u2013 LONG HOURS, LARGE EXPENSE FOR NO\nGUARANTEE OF GOOD CROPS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE! When an OFDU is making money,\nwhy would a farmer continue to farm?? IT is ACTUALLY PULLS FARMERS AWAY FROM FARM\nINCOME GENERATION \u2013 TOO MANY RISKS COMPARED TO A NON-AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS!\n\uf0b7 OFDUs should support the agriculture and\/or agri-tourism industry and BENEFIT FROM BEING\nON A FARM!\n4.3.3 Lot Creation and Lot Adjustments\nMore residential lots should NOT be allowed in prime agricultural areas:\n\uf0b7 Promoting an agricultural systems approach is not possible if houses are scattered in among\nfarmland. Farmers can no longer afford farms! They have to rent land and consequently are\nconsistently on our rural roads with large equipment (This is a MAJOR CHANGE since the days\nwhen farmers could make a living on their \u2018home farm\u2019). These roads are narrow and not safe\nfor additional residential traffic. THE ABILITY TO FARM NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED AND\nMINIMUM SEPARATION DISTANCES BETWEEN LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS AND HOUSING IS ONLY A\nSMALL PART OF THE WIDER CONSIDERATIONS WHICH MUST BE IN PLACE FOR FARMERS TO\nCONTINUE TO FARM IN THESE PRIME AGRICULTURAL AREAS!\n\uf0b7 The current Agricultural Impact Assessment DOES NOT FULLY COVER ALL IMPACTS TO\nSURROUNDING AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS!!!!\n\uf0b7 Protecting specialty crop areas (Class 1-3 land) is not sufficient, as classes 4-7 also required for\nfarming. There are many crops that can be harvested on Class 4-5, while Class 6-7 land is good\nfor pasture. All of this needs to be balanced.\n\uf0b7 Reference to the need for Agricultural Impact Assessment is NOT SUFFICIENT! Analysis of\nminimum distance separation does NOT take into account the impact on road use, increased\ndensity where people are not familiar with cattle \u2013 go into fields and disturb cattle (and could be\nhurt!), ride ATVs and noise\/backfiring scares cattle and they run through fences, to name just a\nfew!\n\uf0b7 Our rural road currently has 62 residential homes in a 2.6 km stretch of the road. There is still\nspace for more as some farmers did not sever lots when this was allowed years ago. HOWEVER,\nwith the lack of farm income, this is TOO TEMPTING AS A MEANS FOR A FARMER TO PAY DOWN\nDEBT!! We actively farm for a living and could benefit from the sale of lots off our farms \u2013 BUT\nTHIS IS WRONG! We cannot get the land back and this will become more of an issue in future\nyears when our current agricultural land will not support crop growth due to the\ndisappearnance of the carbon in the soil. AND THIS GOVERNENT IS DOING NOTHING TO\nSUPPORT SUSTAINABLE FARMING (rotational, no-till crops for example \u2013 to stop erosion and\nenrich soil - and with decreased fertilizers and weed spraying) \u2013 the farmer doing this gets the\nsame price for his crops as those who do not, but this typically results in less crops and there is\nNO FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR FARMERS TO FARM IN THIS WAY TO SAVE THE LAND!\n\uf0b7 These additional houses also increase the risk of climate change to farm practices, due to\ngreenhouse gas emissions with people driving out to the country and then having to drive into a\ntown for all of their personal, shopping and business needs. Houses should be congregated in\nsettlement areas!!\n\uf0b7 Specifying that agriculture should be the \u2018principal use of the existing lot\u2019 is a MISTAKE. This is\ntaking up good farmland! Lots should only be allowed on farms IF THEY ARE NATURALLY\nSEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE FARM AND NOT BEING USED TO PRODUCE CROPS, GRAZE\nCATTLE ETC. (Eg. A piece of property that is separated by a stream or wetland, and CANNOT BE\nACCESSED FOR FARMING! And \u2013 even under these conditions \u2013 NO MORE THAN ONE LOT \u2013 and\nONLY IF CANNOT BE USED FOR AGRICULTURE!!\nPolicy Direction for Large and Fast-Growing Municipalities and Other Municipalities\nBalance housing with resources:\n1. Require municipalities to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate and develop approaches\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.\ni. Putting subdivisions outside of towns means driving is required for ALL\nexcursions\nii. Many people want the downtown experience, yet municipalities are building\nOUT instead of UP.\niii. Building OUT means increased use of vehicles for transportation as\nresidents cannot walk or take public transportation to town\nactivities\/entertainment\niv. More emphasis should be placed on 15-minute communities - where\njobs, retail and other amenities are within a 15-minute excursion of one\u2019s\nresidence (preferably by walking or biking) \u2013 to reduce urban sprawl, cluster\nneighbourhoods (instead of lots spread out all over agricultural areas) \u2013 and\nensure living, working and day-to-day needs such as groceries, drug stores and\nrestaurants are all within this area\nv. The impact of this on climate results in weather conditions which mean farmers\nLOSE money every year \u2013 insufficient rain for crops to grow; too much rain and\ncrops rot in field, extreme winds which damage crops \u2013 every year the farmer\nhas more debt because the money they spend on seed, fertilizers, etc is lost\nwhen those crops do not come to fruition!\n2. 2.9 Energy Conservation, Air Quality and Climate Change\na. Climate change is a very small portion of this new PPS (Section 2.9.1 ONLY) to cover\nthese 3 VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPTS!! This is especially true, given that the A Place To\nGrow Document was very serious about saving energy, improving air quality and\naddressing climate change.\nb. MZOs have been executed in communities where people will work over an hour away \u2013\nwith no transit options \u2013 HUGE impact on greenhouse gas emissions with all of this\ndriving!! Transit should be available BEFORE houses are constructed!!\nc. This very small section looks like a \u2018token offering\u2019 in the midst of a PPS that proposes\ntaking more land from agriculture\nProposed Policies to Generate Housing Supply (including range and mix of housing options)\nGenerate An Appropriate Housing Supply\n1. Identify fast-growing municipalities with specific direction to plan strategically for growth:\na. MZOs are mandating which communities should be \u2018fast-growing\u2019 without taking into\naccount the lack of infrastructure which includes:\ni. Insufficient day care spots (we had over 800 children on a list for Day Care\nbefore the province mandated that 7000 houses would be built here)\nii. Inability of current hospital to accommodate more people; our hospital is small\nand will not accommodate this growth, especially with vacant positions\niii. Regional Health Centre is almost an hour away and dealing with the\nsame issues of expansion; built 10 years ago and already can\u2019t accommodate\npatient needs\niv. Schools not available where housing occurring (on the outskirts), yet\nolder schools available in downtown area\nv. AGREE \u2013 with residential intensification (Section 2.2.1), in downtown areas\n(where schools are also sitting empty!), ESPECIALLY in repurposing existing\ncommercial and institutional buildings for residential use; ensure transit\navailability and PREVENT URBAN SPRAWL to decrease greenhouse gas emissions\n2. Provide a range of housing\na. There is opportunity to put new housing in current \u2018downtown\u2019 area \u2013 where homes are\nrun down \u2013 and schools are available; yet building all occurring on outskirts\nb. Majority of housing is single- family homes, all requiring vehicles to access (how does\nthat take into account the aim in A Place To Grow to decrease greenhouse gas\nemissions?)\n3. Provide\/allow for more residential development in rural settlements and multi-lot residential\ndevelopment on rural lands defined in PPS as \u201clands which are located outside settlement areas\nand which are outside prime agricultural areas\u201d\na. Without the implementation of the provincial mapping developed by OMAFRA, rural\nlands are in the middle of agricultural areas and this impacts farming practices\n4. Require municipalities to permit more housing on farms, including residential lot creation\na. HUGE MISTAKE - as this brings housing into the middle of farm areas which creates\nmore problems for farmers \u2013 farms need to be enveloped in \u2018active farming\ncommunities\u2019 and bringing in more traffic and complaints will be the final straw for\nfarmers already struggling \u2013 they will toss in the towel!\nProposed Policies on Conservation of Agriculture, Aggregates, Natural and Cultural Heritage Resources\nThis proposed PPS is DETRIMENTAL to ALL of these areas:\n\uf0b7 More land proposed to be taken from agriculture\no Lot creation on farms is a problem, given the extent to which this was allowed back in\nthe 1970-s.

It\u2019s a farming community and farming is hampered by\ntraffic; unsafe at top of hills where farm equipment is wide and cars travel too fast\n\uf0b7 Wetlands have NOT been protected under this current government \u2013 MZOs have reduced our\nwetlands, especially in the areas surrounding Toronto\nProposed Policies on Planning for Employment\n\uf0b7 Our area\u2019s PRIME EMPLOYER IS AGRICULTURE, yet this PPS takes more land from agriculture to\nbring in housing for people FOR WHOM WE HAVE NO JOBS!!!

It followed the Greenbelt Plan (2005) designed to\nhelp preserve agriculture \u2013 WHY IS ALL OF THIS IMPORTANT RESEARCH BEING IGNORED????\n",

        "comment":"We support the submission of the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition:\n\"Our greatest concern is that many of these changes will reduce or eliminate altogether a planning regime that ensures consistency across municipalities, strong protection of farmland, climate action and protection of shared watersheds. These new proposals:\n\u25cf\tEliminate policies that were designed to rein in urban sprawl, thus protecting nature and farmland, such as greenfield density targets and mandatory intensification targets\n\u25cf\tAllow municipalities to expand settlement areas without a comprehensive review of associated infrastructure needs or potential impacts on farmland, watersheds or natural areas\n\u25cf\tRemove the policy for and direction of \u201caffordable\u201d housing making it harder to track, measure success and hold developers accountable to within-site plans\n\u25cf\tForce municipalities to allow three lots to be severed from every farm including in Prime Agricultural areas.  This is a policy that all farming organizations in Ontario have jointly opposed as they see it as weakening farmland protection and preservation of the agricultural systems.\n\u25cf\tExempt lands given a Minister\u2019s Zoning Order (MZO) from complying with provincial policies and official plans\u2014essentially overwriting local, community-developed plans.\n\u25cf\tForce municipalities to enter into servicing agreements with developers even in lands that were not a part of their designated growth areas or infrastructure that wasn\u2019t included in capital plans.\n\u25cf\tWeaken the commitment to watershed planning and removes watershed planning requirements before urban boundaries can be expanded.  In a region like ours where groundwater is still the main source of water for daily use for most municipalities, this is a dangerous change.\n\u25cf\tBy eliminating the Growth Plan, many climate actions that were related to planning, such as policies that encourage more compact, transit supportive designs, would also be eliminated in favour of weaker policies that put speed of construction before smart housing supply that increases affordability, healthy communities and climate action.\nOn top of that no policies have been released for review that specifically address Natural Heritage Systems (NHS).  Strong, coordinated policies can help support a regional natural network that continues to function to provide clean air, water and green spaces.  Weakened or eliminated policies could put many wetlands, forests, shorelines, watersheds and corridors in jeopardy.\nAlone this is troubling, but combined with the proposal to remove Simcoe County as a planning authority and reducing the involvement of Conservation Authorities makes this proposal a direct threat to the health, connectivity, equity, affordability and climate resilience of many communities across Ontario.\nAs an example, lower tier or single tier governments do not have the ability to track and support the established Natural Heritage Systems and Agricultural Systems identified in provincial mapping beyond their boundaries. Who will do this critical work to ensure these systems are protected, enhanced and maintained?\nTransferring planning power and authority to local municipalities  with strong-armed provincial caveats (Ministerial powers to override local plans, MZOs, forcing capital agreements with developers, financial audits) while also removing expertise supports (Conservation Authorities, regional governments) appears to be a successful formula to further constrain municipal efforts to build housing that is affordable and climate resilient and instead opens up the mentality of \u201cbuild anything, anywhere, at any time\u201d.\nFrom our perspective, this policy needs to be rescinded and more thought needs to go into how to increase the type and scale of housing needed at the local level.  It also must be mentioned that forcing municipalities to increase supply is not the issue.\"\nIn sum our recommendations are as follows:\n\u25cf\tAbandon this initiative in lieu of more consultation with municipalities, Indigenous governments, community organizations and other stakeholders to ensure that unintended consequences of these policy proposals are mitigated or avoided\n\u25cf\tAbandon plans to dissolve Simcoe County Regional government and instead give it more authority to support the various municipalities within the region that lack staff, financial resources and taxation base to provide housing in the right places in the right way.  Further, recognize the impacts and costs of removing this level of government outright.  In 2022, Simcoe County provided the following services across the region to the benefit of  municipalities that would not be able to afford these services on their own:\n\u25cb\tParamedic services - $67M\n\u25cb\tLong Term Care and Senior Services - $92M\n\u25cb\tChildren Services - $105M\n\u25cb\tCommunity Services including poverty reduction, immigration supports and homelessness prevention - $19M\n\u25cb\tSocial Housing - $91M\n\u25cb\tTransportation and Engineering - $77M\n\u25cb\tSolid Waste Management - $85M\nHow will municipalities be able to take on these costs without pooling resources at a regional level?\nConsider the needs of smaller municipalities that do not have the  resources to implement the necessary changes to provide more housing quickly including staff resources, expertise, and taxation base.  Combined with the removal of development charges for some housing projects and increased cost of infrastructure, there seems little hope that these proposals will do anything more than clog up an already strained system.\nPolicy proposals such as what is being discussed in ERO 019-6813 have broad and long standing impacts to our built communities, our public health and our shared financial future.  We hope that the review team fully appreciates the gravity of these decisions and considers next actions carefully.\nAnd we support the position of the Ontario Public Health Association:\n\"In any proposed changes to the PPS, the province must\/should include policies that:\n1. Reintegrate health and well-being concepts in the Vision and in Chapter 2, \u201cBuilding Homes, Sustaining Strong and Competitive Communities\u201d, with the goal of creating healthy communities that enable people to thrive\n2. Strengthen policies that will help communities mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change\n3. Integrate affordability targets for low- and moderate-income households to support equity and promote housing affordability for all\n4. Mitigate exposure to incompatible land uses and harmful levels of pollution\n5. Prevent unsustainable urban expansion and fragmentation of agricultural lands\n6. Strengthen policies to protect and enhance natural heritage features in recognition of the vital function of ecosystem services for health, well-being and climate-resiliency\"\n",

        "comment":"To whom it may concern,\nThe new Provincial Planning Statement is yet another way that this government is  trying to weaken the protection of cultural heritage in Ontario.\nI live in Port Hope and we are proud of our Main Street and the surrounding area which boasts many fine examples of heritage architecture. We want to preserve the past to build the future.\nIn these days of climate change and global warming we should be keeping and reusing our older buildings to reduce our carbon footprint. Adaptive reuse rather than demolition.\nThis new policy shows no regard for older buildings which could potentially be designated.\nI find the new Provincial Planning Statement very shortsighted and am very concerned and disappointed in its possible development.\n",
