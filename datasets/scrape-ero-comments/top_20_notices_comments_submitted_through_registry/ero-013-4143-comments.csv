19523,/comment/19523,"This is the right approach that is long overdue.
Species classifications should be reviewed. For example:
Bald eagles - are common in northern Ontario but more limited in numbers in the south. Perhaps this listing can be adjusted
Algonquin wolf - the science behind this is questionable and limiting coyote harvest as a result is counterproductive because the largest threat to the Algonquin wolf is inbreeding with coyotes not human harvest
Cougar - The eastern cougar is extinct in Ontario and the western cougar is migrating east as the coyote did before it. Creating a recovery plan for cougars is ridiculous.
American ginseng - this plant is common and this listing causes harm to farmers trying to ship cultivated product.
There are many Carolinian species that are listed which have a limited range in Ontario, and always have had. They have survived along with humans, farming and tree harvest. In fact, some of them need young forest habitat to survive, which is discouraged by the plans for others. Other species are endangered and do need a plan to protect them.
Also, the committee should not have final say on listings without ministerial approval. At the federal level, the minister has the final say for all listings. Perhaps this system should be adopted to slow people with an agenda on the committee.

It is actually a lot of businesses who destroy the wildlife by continuing to ignore environmental protection laws or the biodiversity of the network of wildlife.   Bees are considered critically endangered and they live in Canada as a whole and Ontario.   If they can't pollinate we die.   I suppose Doug Ford government made up of business with little value for the opinions of their workers, neighbors, or families.   Make a buck continues to be their mentality with little respect for those who put them their.   We, those of us with a conscience, wish to protect what we have and a mirror image of what is left, to our children, their children and future generations.   How many of you have even taken the time to research how what you are considering passing will effect those animals who are already on the list of threatened.   We have lost the Rhino, and are looking at losing the elephant, the leopard, the bees, the giraffe's, and even lions.  Do any of you understand that in Ontario we are looking at the extinction of Blanding Turtles and many species of frogs.   They are the protectors and cleaners of our waterways and they work together with many other animals to achieve that.   When the Great Lakes become polluted worse than they are now and you continue with this madness, all those businesses you make a buck with, won't have enough bucks to clean those waterways up.   There goes the recreational use of our Great Lakes, and your summer homes will be worthless pieces of real estate.   But I expected nothing else from a group of governmental businesses leaders, who support only themselves.   Here is an interesting statistic you may want to think about ""If humans killed each other at the same rate that we kill animals, we would be extinct in 17 days.""

19779,/comment/19779,"You are talking about overhauling the last line of defense for the most vulnerable species. These are species that we have already failed by decimating their numbers to a point that they cannot be sustained without outside protections. If anything the existing protections do not go far enough. Fines should be higher, buffers should be larger, restricted access periods should be longer, and conservation and enforcement efforts should be greater. These regulations are already so riddled with loop holes that they barely protect the species in question.
I have worked in the oil and gas industry for several years as a wildlife biologist, and I can say definitively that when lobbyists petition to relax protections for sensitive species, or governments feel that they are spurring economic growth by reducing regulations they are not actually saving any money. More often than not construction activities can be adjusted so that they do not result in disturbance to sensitive species during the times of the year that they are most vulnerable, and then restarted once the species has vacated the area.
If you want evidence of this-- just look at Alberta, their regulations and enforcement put Ontario's to shame, and yet they're somehow able to carry on with development and have companies remain profitable. If you're looking to save money or spur economic growth this is not the place to do it.

The idea of removing or decreasing protections for endangered species is sufficiently extreme and horrifying that when I first saw the newspaper article about it I thought it had to be a satire.
I beg you to reconsider.

19956,/comment/19956,"I applaud the review of any legislation that needs refreshing in order to help sustain Ontario's natural spaces.
Having said that, however, the automatic review process of a government who has a habit of wanting to hide its decisions so early in its own tenure makes me nervous/terrified that its intentions are only superficially good.
This Ontario government is hitting its classic notes of ""say one thing to gain your trust sort of"" and then doing another. It was elected with zero environmental mandate - and also promised to leave Ontario's Greenbelt intact.
Bill 66 - to our collective horror - was tabled before Christmas, making this paper, at best, a superficial exercise. This has been championed by the Minister for Environment as a great step forward at enabling environmental oversight.
This specific exercise carried out by the Ministry might be very well in earnest. And if so, I applaud the attempt to streamline processes to gain clarity with regard to making endangered species (AND the spaces in which they live) a top priority with a clear direction forward.
Which brings me to this ""cited challenge"" in the paper released by the Ministry of Environment:
""Enforcement powers are
inconsistent across authorizations
and regulations, which can limit
the ability to inspect and enforce
compliance with regulations.""
How is the Ministry expected to enforce anything when environmental regulations are slated to be gutted and put into the laps of individual municipalities?
This paper, in tandem with the legislation tabled in Bill 66, makes zero sense.
It's almost as though it's a political tool to make the provincial administration look good while simultaneously dismantling regulation as much as it pleases - to the benefit of the few. Spoiler alert: It totally is.
We all live on the same planet. We currently have the ability to avert environmental disaster, and being such a huge land mass, help the global fight against climate change.
As a young Ontarian who will see the planet degrade when you've all long retired and your mistakes have fallen out of collective memory, I'm horrified by these actions.
To the environment minister: We do not trust you. You're essentially not allowing the Ministry to do its job in a fair and impartial manner based in scientific analysis. Your proposals are a superficial way to cover up an otherwise openly corrupt government.
Many describe this as ""stealing from our future to pay for your present."" Stop stealing from us. Leave environmental regulation alone.

20073,/comment/20073,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed change. First, I would like to emphasize that the cautionary principle should be use when it comes to protecting the biodiversity of fauna and flora of Ontario. If we think something might further impact the decline in biodiversity which always threatens the functions of a smooth running ecosystem we should stop. Secondly, the rules for the ESA were already loosened (2013), and in-fact should be re-tightened to eliminate the exemptions given to industries such as forestry, mining, extraction of gravel etc. Thirdly, if I am correct in thinking  a landscape approach as mentioned in the 10 yr review means putting aside land to protect species at a gross level, as long as is it significant land for biodiverse flora and fauna I agree. Fourthly, I think the Minister should not have the ability to grant exceptions, this should be handed  off to the environment commissioner of ontario. Fifthly, going slow in granting development permits is not a bad thing. Sixly, permits should only be allowed when it can be proven that another activity will benefit a species at risk and needs to be audited and proven. Seventhly, bees and other insects provide net benefit to humans through plant germination, animals such as beaver keep a healthy water environment, animals all along the food chain keep the environment healthy. For instance, wolves eat deer which protect river banks. Eightly, climate change is already having a devastating effect on all animals and plants. e.g. fires such as the California Laguna, Tunnel or cedar fire were once in a lifetime events, now fires that size are happening yearly. We need to act now to further protect the biodiversity of our planet with more restrictions not fewer. Finally, the 10 year review document said Ontario has fresh water, land and air, but this is not 100% true. Towns such as Iroquois falls, moonbeam and Kapuskasing, and cities like Toronto have issues with sewage disposal. Our air while better since closing down coal plants is a world resource were C02 is now above 400 ppm, and I have personal experience picking up litter in our streets, parks, conservation areas, on highways, and in remote areas, things are not as good as we pretend. We need to further protect our environment and all participants in it who need our help to protect them.

20110,/comment/20110,"Further protection is needed to support endangered species. When discussing the protection of habitat, we need to also protect sensitive food sources.
Priorities must be set that habitat protection is above all else, even economic gain. Human presence/ maintenance etc can be managed and reduced in areas that should be protected all year long, even when endangered species are not immediately present in their habitat. For example, strand lines on beaches need to be protect year round instead of only inthe presence of an endangered shore bird as removal dramatically dusrupts the life cycle of food populations.
Another issue we face is pressures to destroy or change habitat for 1) recreational use or 2) economic uses.
I am from South Bruce Peninsula where we hold to the position that we are “Ontario’s Natural Retreat” and are leaders in environmental protection/stewardship.
We have pressures to allow habitat destruction out of the hope of economic gain. Removing endangered habitat can not be proven to Increase economic gains in the long run. It simply cannot be proven.

We require the Natural attenuation that Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSWs) provide for filtration of water that eventually feed into our rivers, streams and lakes. This is important for our drinking water - which includes the quality and presence of important minerals.
Another important aspect of PSWs is drainage - we attribute crazy amounts of rain and melt off which leads to flooding because of climate change - People - use your heads, when we pave, develop, dredge and alter natural drainage - the water has no where to go! This leads to increased damages to buildings, homes and municipal infrastructure (ie storm sewers, overflow of our waste water treatment facilities into our lakes and rivers) which as result leads to increased taxes - increase in rates for insurance policies - the list goes on.

20914,/comment/20914,"Hello, I am a 20 year old student attending Sir Sanford Fleming College in the Fish and Wildlife program. In the time I have been at this school in this program, (I am in my last semester),  we have learned nothing but conservation, and protection of our species. We understand how IMPORTANT and NECESSARY our species are to our ecosystems (plant and animal) and to the public as a whole. Whether it be protecting the biodiversity in the environment that connects to the game species the public love so much, protecting native species or protecting the habitat of these species, these are all crucial to the survival of our listed species - all which could be compromised if we leave room for delay in protection to please businesses.
Management plans as well as recovery strategies for species is IMPERATIVE for the conservation of our endangered and threatened species. Yes, development of the economy and giving people jobs is important, but we must not throw aside or delay assessing habitat needs, or threats to the species merely to please the time limit of development. If pressure is coming from other forces to speed things up we should not delay protection/recovery/management practices, but find ways to speed up the process of dealing with these species needs, habitat assessments, minister conclusions/publications etc.  I understand that these processes take time which is the main reason that this act is under review, but the answer is NOT doing things that may put these species at risk of moving to a higher conservation title.
I also believe that the Protection and Recovery of Species section 9 and 10 should NOT be touched. Nor should the other sections and subsections of this act. What should you do then you ask? Try to get a more efficient system of protection rather then delaying the system. You should not be putting business before the environment. As a person that will be around a lot longer than you I am concerned about the future of the planet. I always hear ""not in my lifetime"" and "" It's not my problem because it doesn't affect me"" well what about your future generations? Your kids kids? Young adults my age are the future and we want to work with the government to ensure a safe and enjoyable future but constantly ignoring our opinions and concerns and only pertaining to the ""right now, right here"" way of thinking is doing more damage than you think. We must also look at the bigger picture here and not be ignorant to what is happening around us.
We are constantly losing species and more and more species are being listed as special concern, threatened, endangered, extirpated, extinct. I know this because I see it everywhere, more and more facebook articles, the way the other species and the environment reacts to declining species. I am constantly reviewing case studies in my classes here at Fleming and I am tired of coming to the conclusion that the government is not taking this, or any other environmental issue for that matter, seriously. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL and you can no longer ignore it, look around you the evidence is everywhere. We are the future, and pushing these concerns aside for ""right here, right now"" issues is going to affect us - yes, as I have previously mentioned, right here and right now IS important but you cannot ignore the bigger picture.

21088,/comment/21088,"""There is not enough public notice before a new species is automatically listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List.""
- The current amount of public notice is adequate. All kinds of public notice and in particular, time, would lead to detrimental impacts to Species at Risk and Species at Risk Habitat. For example, imagine a SAR tree species being considered for listing and then achieving habitat protection within the next 1-2 years. All businesses and landowners who were considering clearing land or filling in a wetland, or building within a forested habitat would swiftly work to cut down that tree and/or its habitat prior to the habitat protections being implemented leading to an overall disastrous impact to that species.
""In some cases, automatic species and habitat protections can contribute to high uncertainty and costly impacts to businesses and the public.""
- Has there been a price on the protection of any specific species at risk? Just like fisheries protection, drinking water protection, and air quality protection costs the people of Ontario money, so too does the protection of Species at Risk in Ontario. It is the cost of doing business and people/businesses need to deal with it.
""In many cases, conducting a review of progress towards the protection and recovery of a species within five years of the Government Response Statement is too soon.""
- It is too soon if the protection of Species at Risk is not viewed as a priority in Ontario. 5 years is a lot of time to write up a some paragraphs about what the government is barely doing/intends to do to protect species at risk. In fact, I find it humorous that 5 years to write these fluffy review statements is being considered as not long enough. If more money was contributed to the protection of Species at Risk and more work was being done to help their recovery, the government would have more to write about and then we can talk about an extension on conducting a review of progress.

Just because providing benefit to a species may take a longer period of time does not make it any less valuable. When future generations must clean up the environmental mess this government will no doubt make, it may be too late. Please consider how important the livelihood of these animals are, before you permit expansion on the lands they call home. Born and raised in Northern Ontario, I consider myself extremely lucky to live in a province with such beautiful nature and I truly hope that in the future, this will be maintained.

21091,/comment/21091,"To Whom it May Concern;
One only has to go online to the Ontario's Species at Risk site to see the alarming number of plants and animals that are already gone or extirpated.
They are being threatened to extinction by us, mankind. As our population increases so does the demand for land. Animals are being pushed back with little areas left for them to survive. As a wildlife rehabilitator I'm witnessing the impact we have on wildlife. Over 90% of the hundreds of orphaned, injured and displaced wildlife we treat is from direct human impact. I am also seeing tolerance for wildlife rapidly decreasing. There are many ways that we can mutually co-exist with native wildlife but in most cases the belief is ""it's just easier to get rid of them"". We moved into their territory, their homes, and therefore need to be respectful toward them and their environment. In today's fast-paced world, people only seem to care about themselves, their property and their own possessions.
When reviewing this important Endangered Species Act it is imperative for the officials to remember we are all responsible for being good stewards. Animals cannot speak for themselves. It is our responsibility to preserve their existence and their natural habitat. If we hear our politicians stress the importance of maintaining natural habitats, then we will follow suit. But it must be important to everyone.
Please listen to the scientists and the biologists. They are the experts. They have spent their entire careers caring for one thing. Nature. The beautiful forests, the lakes, the wetlands and all the diverse native wildlife that live there.
Nature requires balance. Bears, wolves, coyotes, hawks and owls are here for a reason. Foxes, deer, rabbits, raccoons, skunks, mice, birds and even insects are all here for a reason. Each individual has a purpose. Whether they are a predator or prey. They keep nature balanced. We are the ones that are causing the imbalance. From what I have seen, I can not stress enough how important it is we set things right.
To the officials, please don't just give in to businesses, caring only about the revenue they will bring. Care about where we live, who we share it with and how we can as an intelligent 'species' maintain it for many generations to come.
Thank you.

I've been working both in and out of government (MNR) in this sector for 30 years and the progressive and out-of-control movement to throw roadblocks in front of the industry has been shocking. In particular, the MNR, now MNRF, seems to have completed migrated from being a manager of natural resources to the Ministry of Endangered Species Act Protection and Roadblocks. Gone is any thought of working with industry. Gone are any efforts to compromise, enter into partnerships, and do anything innovative in terms of stewardship. Each year, more and more species are seemingly added to the list, resulting in time lags in MNRF study criteria and ultimately delays for aggregate development. Costs are out of control. Everyone in the industry understands that some habitat is off limits (i.e wetlands). However, farm fields (Boblink), forested areas (Bats), scrub fields (eastern meadowlark) and the list goes on and on in terms of areas off-limits to aggregate development.

21116,/comment/21116,"I was rather surprised by the ‘glowing’ description of Ontario in this policy notice: “Ontarians are fortunate to live in a province that is filled with clean air, land and water, valuable resources, and an incredible diversity of more than 30,000 species of plants, insects, fish and wildlife.”  Let's hope that becomes the goal for the future.
After all, we KNOW that Ontario’s water, soil, and air continue to be threatened  from a variety of sources.  In addition, Ontario also has many species of plants, invertebrates and animals at risk of extinction, due to the lack of consideration given to their needs for adequate natural habitat and migration corridors.
It would be a WELCOME RELIEF to see the Endangered Species Act updated by the Conservative government to ensure some of the outcomes mentioned in this review, specifically:
1.Landscape Approaches
2.Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
3.Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
4.Authorization Processes
Ontario has been cutting back MNR’s budget with respect to species assessments for about two decades.  Ontario really has no idea how many native and migratory species have been put at risk during that time.  It will be important to increase budgets to ensure there can be complete surveys of species, particularly with respect to eco-zones that have already been heavily damaged.   The government could issue 5-year contracts to specialists in biology and geology to perform an extensive survey of Ontario's ecology. For instance, we already know about 5% of Ontario’s southern Carolinian forests continue to exist.  What has that already done to dependent species there? We don’t really know, but their prospects for survival seem grim.  If government even hoped to protect 50% of native species, then it would have to ensure at least half of lands within Ontario’s existing eco-zones are set aside for conservation.  Of course, we know that already sounds “too late” for dependent Carolinian species, who have already been reduced or exterminated due to specific habitat loss.
Threats to species
Over the years, Ontario has done an inadequate job of protecting even  its most iconic species, such as woodland caribou ... or moose ... never mind the less obvious forms of endangered plant and animal life.   Back in 2015, there was an uproar about the shortened moose hunting season described in the Toronto Sun on February 10, 2015 at http://www.torontosun.com/2015/02/10/hunters-upset-at-ontario-plan-to-s…  because the CALF MOOSE HUNTING SEASON was reduced to TWO weeks from THIRTEEN weeks!  Two weeks to kill calves, but twelve weeks to kill cows .. and bulls?  This was a surefire ‘recipe’ for depleting the moose population, and this sad ‘prescription’ was written by Ontario’s MNR!
The Toronto Sun article reported: “Mark Ryckman, senior wildlife biologist for the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH), said proposed changes would impact northern Ontario hunters as well as the thousands of residents from the GTA and southern Ontario who head north to hunt moose. The moose hunt in Ontario is probably the province’s premier hunt.”
Mr. Ryckman failed to note the ‘impact’ on the hunted animals themselves.  While moose exist in a limited northern area and depend upon that area for their NATURAL food supply (no grocery stores for moose), THOUSANDS of hunters from all over Ontario (and the USA) converge on the moose’s limited home range with their weapons, intent on killing moose. Obviously, the moose hunt is completely unsustainable.
In mid-October 2015,  the CBC reported the nature of the moose-hunting predicament at  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/more-hunters-than-moose-as-ontari…  Specifically, Mark Ryckman is quoted: “There are about 80,000-90,000 moose in the province, but there are more than 100,000 hunters, Ryckman said.”   Too many hunters, not enough moose.
We also know there has been a precipitous decline in populations of bird species, as revealed in bird counts.  There are a huge number of DIFFERENT species at risk, in addition to birds, as listed at https://www.ontario.ca/page/species-risk-ontario
There is no doubt that many populations of animals are at risk and in serious decline according to the World Wildlife Fund’s 2017 Living Planet Report Canada at http://www.wwf.ca/about_us/lprc/ .  It showed  that on average from 1970 to 2014, half of monitored vertebrate wildlife species in the study suffered population declines. Of those, the average decline was 83% since 1970.  The picture is also worrisome for Canada’s federally protected species. Since 2002, when the Species at Risk Act became law, federally listed at-risk wildlife populations declined by 28%, the report showed. Even with protections, the rate of DECLINE for protected at-risk wildlife appeared to be increasing to 2.7% per year, compared with 1.7% per year in the period 1970 to 2002.
Threats to water quality, air and land
The general pattern of always expanding continguous land developments continue to ignore the services of nature.  When Brian Mulroney was the Conservative Prime Minister of Canada, he introduced the Green Plan (1990 to 1995).  Under that Plan, a comprehensive nation-wide study was conducted, entitled “Canada’s Biodiversity, the Variety of Life, Its Status, Economic Benefits, Conservation Costs and Unmet Needs”. The enormous final report was released in 1995, detailing not only threats to the landscape, its natural functions and dependent species, but the report's final conclusions stated the monetized value of nature’s services to Canada were valued at a$70-billion annually.  In the meantime, there has been a large increase in the human population, and more extraction activities in the forms of mining and logging, not to mention expanding cities, towns and infrastructure.  What are those natural services worth today?
The use of salt on roads is one common and ongoing source of contamination. Add to that, leaks of motor oil, on top of air pollution from vehicles, including sulfur emissions from all the huge transport trucks plying Ontario roads and highways.
Together, Bill 66 and the Ontario Environment Plan under-estimate the growing problems of expansive compacted non-porous surfaces in urban and suburban areas, which create ideal conditions for excessive flooding … even during normal rainfall – further threatening water quality.  The clearing and levelling of more landscape in preparation for continued paving and expanding dense development suggest flooding is written right into development policy at the Ministry of Housing and Development.
In March 2018, the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) stated, “Flooding is the new fire” in Ontario.
As a result of all this pavement, it is easy for contaminants like pesticides, fertilizers, road salt and motor oil to escape directly off vast areas of cleared, levelled, paved landscape into nearby creeks and rivers.
The Ontario Environment Plan brochure shows NO photos of dense developments, increasingly cluttered right up to the edges of multi-laned roads, including Highway  400? What are these new residents going to do for FRESH AIR?  We know about pollutants in exhaust fumes from cars and diesel-powered trucks, but the very real dangers posed by particulate matter seem to be ignored.  What about obvious respiratory and related health risks from airborne sub-micron sized particulate matter produced by the wear on (or mass lost from) brakes and tires on ALL roads? 50-70% of total ‘wear materials’ are released as airborne particles. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometry shows average loss rates of tire and brake materials are 97 and 9 mg/vkm respectively (vkm = vehicle kilometre).  Tiny particles are inhaled deep into lungs, resulting in lung disease, including certain types of cancer. These particles are rich in certain transition metals (ie, zinc, copper, iron), adding to air toxicity. Heavier vehicles (such as  transport trucks) create more brake and tire wear particles than lighter vehicles. This is only one type of pollution common to Ontario, and I suspect this particular threat to environmental and human health continues to grow.
Finally, let us not overlook the release of sewage into Ontario waterways. In the November 2018 report of the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, it was reported that, between 2017 and 2018: “ raw sewage overflowed into southern Ontario waters 1,327 times – 766 of these from 57 outdated municipal sewer systems that combine sewage with stormwater. Saxe added that provincial standards for industrial toxic wastes poured into our waterways are now 25 years old, and are likely outdated.”
Much of the problem was attributed to the continuing loss of natural areas that help to filter out pollution compounds, but there are also deliberate losses due to thoughtless poorly-conceived developments that are approved just for the sake of ‘more growth’, whether or not it is sustainable.
Such regular releases of effluent from aging sewage plants and infrastructure under assault from over-loading due to ill-conceived development in the past pose a continuing threat to plant, animal and human life – and let’s not forget the fish and other aquatic species who must try to survive in the affected waters.
If the Conservative government recognizes all these threats to the landscape, air, waterways and native species, and finds ways to ameliorate past damage while establishing a landscape that can support sustainable development within a system of adequate robust protected natural areas, then it will have accomplished something VERY important.

21129,/comment/21129,"The ESA was passed to ensure protections for species at risk. It is important to note the reasons why species become at risk: habitat loss from development, agriculture, pollution, resource exploitation and industrial activity. In other words, human activity is causing species to become endangered or extinct. The problem is us.
Area of focus #1:
It is impossible to answer these questions without first knowing how landscape approach would work. How would decisions be made about tradeoffs? How would conflicts between species be resolved? What criteria would be used to prioritize one species over another? Would there be a risk-based approach?
Area of focus #2:
The public should NOT have a say in which species become listed. This process should be transparent (i.e. share information with the public), but decisions should not be influenced by public or industry opinion. These decisions should be based on science, evidence and risk. It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that biased industrial opinions should outweigh good evidence.
Area of focus #3:
Time limits for government response statements should not be extended. This is a time sensitive issue that requires urgent action. The reason it takes so long to develop these statements is because of capacity limitations. So the solution is not to extend the timelines! The solution is to increase staffing levels and investment in recovering species at risk.
Area of focus #4:
Allowing adverse impacts to species at risk is counterproductive to the goal of recovery. Authorizations should be limited to exceptional circumstances only. A conservation fund is a band-aid solution that does not fix the problem. The only thing that will help species at risk recover is to stop destroying their habitat.

21336,/comment/21336,"I propose changes to the ESA involving the cultivation of endangered vascular plants. Currently it is legal to grow American ginseng under a shade-cloth in a field, but it is illegal to grow ginseng beneath a forest canopy. While I understand the rationale for this, the reality is that there is a market for wild and wild-simulated ginseng that field-cultivated ginseng cannot meet. What I suggest is that the ESA permit landowners to grow ginseng beneath a forest canopy, but to grow it without tillage, which could seriously damage woodlands. This practice, called wild-simulated, is practiced in the United States rather successfully, and it results in a product virtually indistinguishable from wild ginseng. This would ultimately reduce the demand for wild ginseng by filling the market demand for it, thereby not making poaching a worthwhile risk. I know of many landowners who would benefit from this, as they can make additional income from their woodlots, and it doesn't involve cutting down the forest! I, and many others in the United States, call this practice 'productive conservation'. This should also apply to goldenseal, black cohosh, and any other plants that may soon be on the endangered species list, such as wild leek. I realize that it may seem difficult to be in compliance with CITES, but many US states do it and are fully compliant with CITES - we should study them. It is worth noting that the ginseng poaching pressure is lower in NY state then Ontario, and in part I think this is due to the practice of wild-simulated ginseng cultivation.
Ultimately, I think my suggestion will improve the plight of American ginseng across Ontario by providing a suitable, sustainable substitute for wild ginseng. It is an expensive proposition to try and guard all the remaining wild ginseng populations in Ontario, but if we can lower the price by growing a nearly identical product, we will give American ginseng a chance.

Over the last 10 years, I have seen habitat that supports Endangered/Threatened species disappear at an alarming rate in Southern Ontario.  Along with habitat, we are losing the SAR that this legislation is in place to protect. Wetland and woodland loss in Lambton County and Chatham Kent and beyond must be stopped if we are to protect these vulnerable species.
Habitat that has not been lost to farming or other development is being degraded such that losses are compounded.  Fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides pollute watercourses and put additional strain on already stressed animals (e.g., freshwater mussels). Enclosures of the intermittent watercourses at the top end of the system (e.g., to improve farming efficiencies) decreases the resiliency of the the system.
More money and resources needs to be put into the support for this legislation.  This people left to implement this legislation have been under-staff and under resourced for 10 years.  The SAR Stewardship Fund has supported a tremendous amount of good work.  More resources must go into this Fund as well, if we expect to move to the Recovery of SAR species.
Streamlining, cut backs, exemptions are all a giant step in the wrong direction if the protection of SAR is the main objective of this legislation - which it should be.

21405,/comment/21405,"The Endangered Species Act is a critical piece of legislation which allows the Ministry of the Environment to act to protect Ontario's ecosystem. This is important both because Ontarians value our natural environment and also being ecosystem collapse would have an apocalyptic impact on many industries. Considering how much of the Ontario economy currently relies on the natural environment, ensuring that we have the means and resources to maintain the ecosystem is critical both for our wellbeing and our economy. Invariably, not all economies can flourish in a sustainable way, but this does not mean we must avoid stronger environmental legislation but rather ensuring that people who work in extractive and polluting industries incompatible with a sustainable future receive the support and opportunities to thrive in a new industry.
The Endangered Species Act is way overdue for a review. We have a massive backlog of endangered species with no plan of protecting them and there are too few resources to follow through on those plans. Our province needs a stronger Act protecting endangered species and the financial support to ensure the power of the Act is not solely on paper. This is not just good policy, it is a critical change that must happen now, before any more species are lost.

21413,/comment/21413,"One aspect about the Endangered Species Act that I think could be improved relates to the commercial cultivation of vascular plants. While I understand the rationale in prohibiting the cultivation of these plants in the 'wild' since it may displace actual wild populations of these plants, I believe this is unlikely to happen. Some of these endangered plants exist in such small populations that cultivated plants can be grown in large areas of the 'wild' without negatively affecting wild populations of said plants. Take American Ginseng, for example. It is very hard to find, and any known locations are kept secret from the public. Nevertheless, demand continues to be extremely high, and poaching remains an issue. Would it not then make sense to allow landowners to grow American ginseng  beneath a forest canopy, thereby creating a superior product to field-grown ginseng, and fulfilling some of the demand for wild ginseng? I should clarify some points here before I go any further. Growing ginseng beneath a forest canopy (wild-simulated) does not involve tilling the soil, and could be done in existing sugar bush operations, for example. There is a demand for wild ginseng, so growing wild-simulated ginseng, which is virtually indistinguishable from real wild ginseng, could fulfill this demand. The farmers growing ginseng underneath shadecloth in the Norfolk County area are growing a commodity product that is unsuited for fulfilling the demand for wild ginseng.
Allowing the cultivation of wild-simulated ginseng beneath a forest canopy will also attach more economic value to a woodlot, thereby providing a disincentive to clear it for agriculture or other developments. I believe this is one way we could reduce pressures on private woodlots in this province without it costing taxpayers anything. The private woodlots in southern and central Ontario harbour many endangered species, and I believe positive outcomes can be achieved by maintaining and expanding this valuable forest cover.
Many US States allow for the cultivation of wild-simulated ginseng, and this is entirely compliant with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The United Plant Savers, an organization devoted to preserving plants, promotes 'conservation through cultivation' as a good way to preserve plants.
We have seen that since the inception of the ESA, American ginseng populations have not expanded, but continue to be poached. I think the best outcomes can be achieved by allowing landowners to grow wild-simulated ginseng in their woodlots.

21421,/comment/21421,"Based on personal experience with a recovery permit for bobolink and eastern meadow lark , the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry should have more power to be able to review the permits on a case by case basis , and make changes with or with out the permit holders consent. The permits are issued for a 20 year term, with no provisions for change in property ownership , no provisions to fertilize the habitat area, or provide weed control in the habitat area. The permit holder , hires a biologist to monitor the habitat. The biologist answers directly to the permit holder, not the MNRF. In our situation we purchased a neighboring farm that had a lease in place for a C - permit to create and maintain grass land habitat for bobolink and eastern meadow larks. The permit requires that the hay not be cut until August 1, and the total area is 45 HA in size.  We have two main issues with the current permit conditions. Issue 1 , is the volume of very poor quality hay that we harvest on the 45 HA parcel, and the negative health effects it is causing to our beef herd. The second major issue is the permit has not provisions in place that require the permit holder to fertilize the habitat area, or provide proper weed control. The permit simply states , "" despite (1), if crop rotation is necessary, the overall benefit area shall be maintained as a hayfield for at least 5 consecutive years out of seven"".  The habitat area we are dealing with is entering year six as habitat. The permit holder has not spent one cent on fertilizer or weed control since the habitat was established. From our own production records the grass has seen a 40 percent decline in yield since year one to year five. This is due to both lack of nutrient being applied back to the soil, and also due to the composition of the habitat changing over time. Most of the legumes, which were required in the habitat establishment, have been lost due to the natural process of winter kill etc.  Another major issue is wild parsnip, listed as a noxious weed in Ontario, is growing , and spreading on the property. The permit holder has refused to allow crop rotation, even though we as the land owner have requested to do so to help with weed control. We as the land owner reached out to the MNRF for help on this situation. The permit holder has contacted MNRF staff and directed them to not discuss any conditions of this permit with us, the land owners. We have also put forward a request to move a portion of the habitat onto our pasture lands. Lands that meet all criteria for MNRF habitat for bobolinks and eastern meadow larks. Sadly we can not even confirm with MNRF staff if this request has been forwarded to MNRF staff due to the permit holders demand not to discuss with us. The entire purpose of this permit was to create and maintain habitat for the long term recovery of bobolinks and eastern meadow larks. Sadly due to wording of the existing permit, and the permit holders refusal to properly maintain the habitat , or allow any changes to the existing permit, are actually causing a loss of more habitat. In an effort to supplement the extremely poor feed we harvest from the habitat area we have resorted to cutting our other hay fields much earlier then before. We now cut , bale, and wrap these fields in early June to create better quality feed, and increase our second cut yields in an effort to over come the poor feed harvested from the August 1st cutting date.  This is a practice we did not do before the habitat hay became an issue for us. Normal beef hay production is done as ""dry hay"", and is harvested during the month of July. Sadly we are destroying habitat directly as an effort to overcome the conditions of the current permit. We have experience severe health issues in our beef herd due to the poor quality August harvested hay. We see weight loss, poor conception rates, poor colostrum, and poor calf health all related to poor quality feed. I will attach hay test results comparing June, and July cut hay vs August cut hay and the drop in protein and relative feed value. We have both spring and fall calving on our beef farm. This year our fall herd experience 25 percent open conception rate. This is completely unacceptable and directly related to the poor quality feed. We have already made plans to abandon our fall calving system as the poor hay simply will not sustain cows with nursing calves. This will mean a 30 percent reduction in our beef herd,,, a direct economic loss to Ontario. Our fall herd graze during the summer months on rented pasture. Sadly we will be giving this pasture up, and a neighboring crop farm has already showed interest in this land. Again a loss of grass land habitat directly as a result of a permit that was meant to protect this very form of habitat. Our request to move a portion or all of the habitat onto pasture land, which would allow us to harvest feed before August 1st has met resistance from the permit holder. A report was done on Amherst Island in 2016 that supported our request of pasture as habitat. There were more nesting pairs of bobolinks found in pasture settings then hay fields. This situation we are in could be easily resolved if the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry had more authority and power to look at permits such as this and make changes based on current science on a case by case basis. Trying to force a corporation to maintain grass land habitat with such lack of maintenance guide lines was a mistake. If changes are not made and the current habitat area is left as is for the entire 20 year permit term the entire habitat area, and the land itself will be in a sad state. The land will have been depleted of nutrients for 20 years, the weed situation will surely be out of control. Who ever the land owner is when the permit expires will be left with no choice other then to destroy the entire habitat area to try to reclaim the agricultural land. The cost to replenish nutrients and control 20 years of weed neglect will be more then I want to take on. If we can not find a reasonable solution, this property may be offered up for sale. This will mean we will have to reduce our herd further, and take pasture we currently have out and produce feed on this land to maintain our remaining herd.

21425,/comment/21425,"Good day, I feel that woodland Caribou should removed from the list.  I’m flying in northern Ontario and often see vast herds in the far north in the Big Trout Lake area.  The MNR is managing the forestry cutting for Caribou habitat thereby destroying moose habitat.   The province makes a lot of money from the moose harvest and not a dime from Caribou.   More emphasis should be placed on local knowledge from the locals in the bush, hunters trappers and bush workers.   There’s almost as many Caribou as there are Moose.
A good example of this is the increase of wolverines in Northwest Ontario, local trappers never caught them, now many trappersare catching them.  The same holds true for moose, deer and bear populations, the people working in the bush have valuable knowledge that is basically ignored by the Biologists.

21466,/comment/21466,"Protecting our species and natural environment is a proud legacy.  Please do not weaken ESA.
10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper (ERO 013-4143)
Public Comment Period January 18, 2019 - March 4, 2019 (45 days)
As an Ontario resident and Taxpayer I am opposed to weakening Ontario's environmental legislation including but not limited to the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  The ESA was struck to protect endangered species and steps to reach that goal should not be avoided simply for convenience or economic benefit.  To that end, I support the following recommendations:
1. Exemptions from the ESA must be the exception. Exemptions should only be used in very limited situations where the level of risk and the level of complexity are low, and where the impacts of the activities are well understood and can be adequately addressed.
2. Improve implementation of the ESA. Don’t weaken the law. Keep the need to get a permit before construction or logging takes place. Permits ensure that there is overall benefit to the species as per the ESA. Anything less is contrary to the purpose of the ESA, which is to protect and recover endangered species.
3. Registration for an exemption must be mandatory. In rare situations where an exemption may be appropriate, the proponent must be required to register with the Ontario government, outlining the nature of the activity, the anticipated impact, and the plan to achieve overall benefit for the species and monitor results.
4. To address budgetary issues, the government can recover the costs of permitting. Make those who will benefit from the permit pay for it.
I expect careful consideration of the following:
- The sale or destruction of Canada’s non-renewable resources including species at risk demands caution precisely because the assets are non-renewable.
- Non-renewable resource assets are not ours alone – they also belong to future generations.
- By virtue of diminishing supply, non-renewable assets will be worth more money in the future, therefore selling them now means selling at a reduced rate.
- The extraction of natural resources does a lot of environmental damage, makes indelible change and presents environmental risks to air, water and soil.
- Extraction may be warranted if the benefits outweigh the cost, however, benefits and cost must be calculated in full.  Current legislation, policies and regulations are not conducive to full cost accounting.
- Budgetary and financial shortfalls mean reduced monitoring and enforcement.  Close monitoring and enforcement are necessary to minimize damage from unforeseen circumstance.
- A strong independent Environmental Commissioner's Office provides accountability and transparency for Ontarians.
- Species need protection for future generations, future economics and to ensure bio-diversity.
I am opposed to weakening Ontario's environmental legislation including the Endangered Species Act.  As elected officials and government employees, YOU are the lead stewards of our land.  Please ensure we leave a legacy of significance for our children -- fresh air, clean water, good food, productive soil, ample green space, healthy lifestyle and environment.
Protecting our species and natural environment is a proud legacy.

- notify local rehabs; they have large numbers of followers; they have social media presence
- news outlets
- bus shelter advertisements
- Animal Planet television show or commercial
Should there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections?
- have a multi-step approval process
- COSSARO submits their findings/suggestions to a second committee for review
Time limit for the development of the Government Response Statement
- there should be a time limit; however, there should be a small number of exceptions for longer timeframes
- There should be a time limit on any time extensions
- it is ineffective to implement regulations and protections if there is inadequate enforcement and oversight
It is counter-productive to initiate protections and recoveries of the species without proper resources.
Enforcement powers should be enhanced.
More enforcement officers.
More inspections are required.
Implement a hot line for tips from the public.
Ontario should work closely with local rehabs, Animal Controls, and SPCA's.
Ontario should force municipalities to adopt and implement a plan to assist with recovery and protection efforts i.e. certain area of land has to be dedicated for wildlife etc.

21505,/comment/21505,"The Endangered Species Act was/is weak, it is a pay to play system with no real protection for any species.  If you have the money to compensate you can do what you want.  Real protection/common sense is needed.  I've seen developments put up were they destroy habitat and compensate right across the street and try to create suitable habitat.  Why would they have not just built across the street where they would of needed no compensation....this is not isolated situation, i am a biologist and I deal with this everyday.
Other than the lack of teeth the act is fine, the problem is it is constricting to development so super unpopular among the rich.  More restrictions are needed for the super sensitive species (ginseng....habitat destruction ...rare plant) while less is needed for others (butternut....uncontrollable fungus....abundant plant) which I find they have balanced very well.  I would just leave it, any changes that are proposed only favor developers and people will recognize that and not like it.  I've have never actually seen any project stopped by any species, so using economic development as a tool to try and argue to lighten some rules seams crazy, it is just making it cheaper for the rich to get richer.
So in conclusion i guess the only thing that can be done is to make it even more expensive to eliminate species, so even the rich won't (I know still a pay to play system), and add know species locations to official plans so during early planning they can be identified to better lessen the economic impact (you got a developer looking for land you can now direct him to land that may be better suited with less regulations).  Or better yet save us all some money and don't touch it, unless you abolishing the entire act, a review and a few changes won't bring in any savings.  Probably just bring us some kind of terrible re branding program like the liberals did (when was forestry not part of natural resources?)

21672,/comment/21672,"I am a Drainage Superintendent in Ontario responsible for managing municipal drains under the Drainage Act.
We currently work with the Conservation Authorities and Department of Fisheries and Oceans for drainage work completed on municipal drains across the Province of Ontario.  Working with the MNRF has not been the same when the movement went from an Exemption Agreement to Registry system.  As Drainage Superintendents we registered but all the responsibility was shifted to us as the Business Accountable person when it came to the species the Act was trying to protect with regards to mitigation plans.  When it was the Exemption Agreements, the mitigation plans were written by MNR staff and it worked well.  When the registry came into affect Head office with the MNRF said we just had to register and use the mitigation plans from the old agreements but the District Office at times felt differently about this.  There seemed to be a disconnect within MNRF.
With the DFO and CAs, with the help of OMAFRA we have been able to create committee's which allow us as Drainage Supers to work together with them to streamline a process and approvals for works under the Drainage Act.   These two committees are(1) DAWG - Drainage Action Working Group committee (Lead by DFO) and (2) DART - Drainage Act and Conservation Authorities Act Protocol committee (Lead by CA).
Within these committees we meet regularly to discuss drainage works.  We have created a process of a Drainage Notification Form that is submitted to these Agencies for Class Authorization (DFO Approval) and SCRs - Standard Compliance Requirements (CA Approval).  We have been able to develop a ""Do not send list"" with DFO as long as certain requirements are met.  On the DAWG committee we have developed a Guidance Document for maintenance and repair of drains in Ontario.
As a Drainage Superintendent I would love for a new Committee to be created to work with you related to works completed under the Drainage Act and so that all works comply with the ESA.

For example, the suggestion of ""longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat"" would undoubtedly put endangered species at risk. An animal is automatically added to the endangered species list when it meets the factual requirements for being endangered. Giving the public more notice before an animal is added is simply a way to ensure that businesses have time to do their potentially damaging work before they are prohibited, resulting in more damage to the landscape and species.
I want to see the government living up to the promise in the summary of this paper to continue to provide ""stringent protections for species at risk, [and] continuing to work with stakeholders and

21681,/comment/21681,"Comments on the 10 year review of Ontario ESA
Page 2, second column: it may be good to add invasive species as a threat to biodiversity and species at risk
Area focus 1
The ecosystem approach would be more effective when you have more than one species at risk in an ecosystem or an area. This approach has been promoted by DFO and Environment Canada and Climate Change for many years. However, you will still get push back from researchers with reductionist approach. Ecosystem approach as so means the need for more stringent policies for ecosystems, which Ontario has been weak. For example, wetlands are being destroyed as greater rate than ever, while it is well known they contain species at risk or uncommon species AND provide many essential ecosystem services. The advantage of ecosystem approach (which we promote at the Commission on Ecosystem Management, with its 12 principles) is that it responds to many other issues that species at risk and biodiversity are facing such as climate change and therefore potential migration of species. This also means looking at connectivity in landscape for better protection of these species. This would also mean stronger “green belts” or development of similar policies. There are ways to help with this such as better supporting Nature Trust and other such organizations or owners with conservation interest through conservation easements.
Area Focus 2
I would be careful in increasing time before listing a species. By the time it is done, the species may be extinct. The time is already long before a species can even be discussed. What is needed is a more transparent, open and inclusive communication process with not only a website that is difficult to navigate but also more locally focused activities and communication, including listservs for detection, information gathering, and call for development of assessment and conservation plan. These should anyway be more collaborative instead of being produce din closed doors.
I would avoid ministerial discretion as species shall not be entangled in politics. Species have no capacity to defend themselves (and should not be looked only for utilitarian purposes).
There are no circumstances unless you’re a politician or a business lobbying for a specific development (which we have seen too many): this should not be allowed. There are plenty of empty spaces that are always abandoned and should be looked at first. Stop using more natural areas. I know it may cost more for the developer but by the end, we may reduce the footprint of the province on natural habitats. You never know if that species could one day stop or cure a disease. Think about the yew and taxol.
The only way is to keep everything in open access (this is in fact required with any research…may want to see the UNESCO Recommendation on Science and researchers 2017, Canada supported it) to avoid political interference and closed-door lobbying.
Area Focus 3
Regarding additional time: I don’t think this is really needed. It would certainly not a benefit for the species. Again, is this politically motivated? If the system is transparent, open, with involvement of people (scientists, Indigenous Peoples, local nature groups, etc.), this should not be too much of an issue. Maybe an exception could be made in the case where more involvement and discussion with Indigenous Peoples are needed.
The 5-year review period is the normal system in most jurisdictions (federal, provincial and even most international). It could possibly be longer if there is a very good monitoring system in place and the species is relatively stable or in less risky category. BUT this would mean to be serious about monitoring and not only something done as a lip service.
This last point contradicts the ecosystem approach. Species don’t live in a bubble (only humans do). The idea that a species can just be move as desired is a false and unprofessional concept. As a species is integral part of an ecosystem, you cannot just take one and move to another place as it is impossible to recreate the same habitat. This has been known for a long time. Microorganisms in the soil may be as important as water or light.
Area focus 4
There are too many loop holes in the current system that lead to avoiding to protection. The best would be to reduce them. This is especially important close to urban centres. There is already not enough space for natural habitats in southern Ontario for example and close to urban centres. For developers (as the point is directly related to this), why not starting to teach them about intensification and the need to refurbish abandoned lands in urban centres. There are already too many of them. Stop building on newly cleared lands and start thinking about conservation easements in other places.  This is especially important under climate change (to ensure connectivity for species) and population decline (without immigration population of Canada is declining). Some countries, like China, are more advanced than us on this. They have learned quite a while ago to better protect rural and natural places.
So, by the end, it seems that the government wants to find a way to avoid species conservation and just go for development (I feel like we were in the 1970’s!!). This ‘business-as-usual’ approach will put Ontario in the dark age when we consider how other countries are moving away from this type of way of thinking. All policies and legislation shall integrate environmental concepts, protections and conservation of biodiversity. This is in fact against how the federal government is moving with the new round of negotiations on the CBD.
What is needed is more money for ESA and especially enforcement of all related legislation such as the Wetlands Act.

21694,/comment/21694,"One must consider the 10th year review of the ESA with today’s knowledge  and research in mind. For instance the World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Report documents extensive, and catastrophic declines in the numbers of wildlife world wide. Lest it be thought that Canada is exempt, the WWF Canada has produced a similar report for Canada, with broadly similar conclusions. Everywhere, including Ontario, wildlife is undergoing an apocalypse; obviously species are going to need more help and assistance in the future if biodiversity is to be maintained rather than decimated.
Thus, it is appropriate to substantially strengthen the protection that the ESA gives to the endangered wildlife in Ontario, and the government of Ontario should do so following this review.
However, the ESA 10th year review seems to be designed to make things easier for people in general and businesses in particular. Instead, the focus should be on how to improve the chances of success in rehabilitating endangered species (most of which, I'd wager, got to be endangered by the very actions the government wants to make easier).
I more or less support a landscape approach, especially if it incorporates the half-Earth concept; that is half the Earth fully protected for the preservation of wild things and biodiversity.
In various places in the document there is whining about ‘not enough notice’, ‘uncertainty’, ‘costly’, ‘administrative burdens’ and ‘barriers’. It must be remembered that the goal is to protect and rehabilitate species at risk, and not to make things cushy for business. Business should suck it up and realize that endangered species come first, stop complaining and get with the protection program.

Many Ontario species are in decline. The number of endangered species in this province has grown, and many could be at risk of disappearing forever unless we take strong action now.
I therefore call upon your government to:
1) Make it your government’s top priority on the endangered species file to halt and reverse the startling decline in Ontario’s animal, plant and other species.
2) Commit resources to properly enforce the Endangered Species Act. Ensure the responsible ministry meets its deadlines. Provide clear information to land users and to the public about how the ESA is being implemented. Establish implementation targets and monitoring systems.
3) End the blanket exemptions granted to industry and others that came into effect in 2013. Close loopholes in the legislation to prevent future abuse of the ESA’s flexibility.
4) Ensure local communities benefit from activities to maintain and restore endangered species and their habitat, including rural and Northern communities.
5) Acknowledge the continued leadership and critical role of Indigenous Peoples and provide funding for First Nations stewardship activities, for example the Indigenous Guardians Program.
6) Reassign the species at risk file and responsibility for implementing the ESA from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), which has proven itself to be unable to effectively implement the ESA, to the Ministry for Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP).

Having better access to data regarding SAR location would be useful for proponents. Providing proponents with guidelines for SAR screening in the vicinity of the project area will help ensure that habitat connectivity is considered and maintained, where possible. Are there maps and databases that are easily searchable available for proponents to use? The NHIC website is currently quite time consuming and onerous to pull information from. If the regulators can offer more information to proponents, they may be more willing to engage in the process if they do not feel burdened by having to consider SAR.
Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
Having a recovery strategies for all SAR would be useful for proponents. Refining recovery strategies to have a step by step format will be an improvement as the current recovery strategies are often wordy and convoluted.
Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
Enacting habitat regulations will help to make sure that SAR are actually protected under the act. Species recovery policies may be used in conjunction with the recovery strategies to guide proponents. Having a standardized process may remove some of the burden from proponents and may encourage them to actively engage in the process.
Authorization Processes

Please look at the long term picture. The health of the province; economic, social and environmental DEPENDS on looking after as much the the precious natural/undeveloped world we have left.  That fact that, “achieving overall benefit to a species” can be “long, onerous, and unpredictable.” is too bad.

21737,/comment/21737,"I am in favour of the Endangered Species Act but feel it could use some re-thinking.
I am speaking about the massassauga rattle snake.
I live just south of Parry Sound on an inland lake and over the past 40 years I have come into contact with 3 snakes on my property. I gave the snake space and when I came back it was gone and I didn’t see the snake again.
I have seen numerous snakes that have been run over on the back roads.
I believe education is the best and easiest way to prevent people from running over the snakes. These snakes are not aggressive and would only strike you if you step on them or get too close to their space. Usually they will turn around and go the other way if you come across one. Teach people this.
In the 35 years I was driving up here, most weekends in the summer I never once saw a snake flattened on the hiway. I assume they detect the noise or vibration from vehicles and stay away. Based on my observations I don’t understand why the government spent money, and lots of it installing a snake fence along the 400 south of Parry Sound. Like I said I have never seen a snake on the hiway!
Having said that imagine if there is a forest fire like there was this summer north of Parry Sound and the snakes and animals were trying to get away from the fire, they run into this fence and get burned!  Not very well thought out!

21752,/comment/21752,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. We look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA); either through a perpetual Section 55 Regulation or legislative change to the ESA. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, we must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
The sector will continue to operate under the CFSA which, by law, requires, forestry operations to follow an approved forest management plan. Guides delivered under the CFSA include operational prescriptions and conditions, which may include reserves, modified operations, or specific conditions on road use and construction in the area near a species at risk and their habitat.
Once a permanent Section 55 Regulation has been passed, or other legislative change made to the ESA recognizing equivalency between the two acts, more work must be done on species at risk policy currently being delivered under the CFSA. Overly precautious timing restrictions on forest operations for wood or Blanding’s turtle, for example, is currently putting people out of work for weeks to months at a time; this is while the sector operates under an existing regulation and through the CFSA.
It is our understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. It is our expectation that unworkable prescriptions, such as the turtle example provided above, will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
We have expressed to the previous Government a need to fulfill its duty to consult with First Nations relative to any developments that take place within our territory. We have clearly outlined the lack of information and consultation regarding species at risk prescriptions and the potentially devastating socio-economic impacts associated with other policy proposals. Despite our efforts requesting the Crown to act honourably through meaningful and advance consultation, the previous Government attempted to rush unbalanced and potentially damaging policy through the approval process without providing adequate information or meaningful consultation with First Nations. It is our expectation that moving forward, your government will take a different approach.
Further, we remain extremely concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with us well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid catastrophic socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.
We would be happy to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the best path forward to ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk while keeping people in this province working.
Best regards,
Charla Robinson
President
Thunder Bay Chamber of Commerce

What I do not support is trying to wiggle this documentation in order to support landowner development and access for developers to the Green Belt.

    Maintain mandatory habitat protection for endangered and threatened species. (The law already provides enough flexibility through habitat regulations and permitting, so there’s no need to politicize the process by adding ministerial discretion);
    Maintain COSSARO’s current species listing process, “based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge” (ESA, section 5 (3)); and

I have lost faith in our government with regard to protecting all the environment! In the end, what we have fought so hard to protect will be lost, and in doing so will not only eliminate endangered species and species at risk but the human species as well.

21784,/comment/21784,"While it is very important to protect endangered species in Ontario and work to improve their conditions so they are no longer endangered, we must deal with reality. For many species, they are on the northern edge of their habitat range, and human development (clearing, farming, urban development, roads, etc.) have removed and fragmented a huge amount of habitat in southern Ontario. That is not going to change and forcing proponents (companies, individuals, provincial and municipal governments, etc.) to take expensive and time-consuming steps to protect isolated pieces of habitat or create new isolated pieces of habitat is just not effective or efficient and likely produces only marginal improvements for the species. We need to look at the whole picture - it's an ecosystem landscape that species live within and if we want to protect and improve species we need to identify and protect ecosystem landscapes. If the Ontario government is serious about it we need to look to expand protected natural areas - parks, nature reserves, conservation areas, private lands (tax breaks), land trusts, etc. in key areas and habitats so there is enough of a block of land or corridor to provide needed habitat and environment for species. Protecting trees for bat maternal roosting or installing bat boxes or special bark is not going to help endangered bats if white nose syndrome is the root cause of their decline because of conditions in overwintering mines or caves. We're throwing money and resources in the wrong direction - the root problem needs to be addressed. Similar approaches need to be taken for other species where the Ontario habitat and conditions is not the limiting factor - loosing bird and butterfly habitat in central and South America for overwinter cannot be offset only by trying to take steps in Ontario - we need to work within reality and focus on species and habitats we can actually make an impacts.

21790,/comment/21790,"Under the guise of “enabling positive outcomes for species at risk” the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) is reviewing the Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA).
Allegedly responding to criticisms that the ESA is administratively burdensome and creates “barriers to economic development,” the government’s discussion paper is closely aligned with its broader “open-for-business” approach to governance.
Make no mistake: the ministry is inviting the public to consider options that, if passed, would undermine the very cornerstones of the law: science-based listing that includes Indigenous Traditional Knowledge, mandatory habitat protection, and legislated timelines for planning and reporting. Essentially the critical measures that enable positive outcomes for species at risk.
Proposals to “increase efficiencies” and “streamline processes” include:
- Using “ministerial discretion” to decide whether species or habitat protections should apply;
- Implementing a review process to second-guess the science-based listing decisions of the   Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO);
 - Simplifying requirements for industry permits or exemptions to undertake harmful activities;
 - Extending or removing legislated timelines for planning and reporting; and
 - Allowing proponents of harmful activities to simply pay into a conservation fund rather than meet current requirements to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species that they negatively impact.
Such proposals are about deregulation and making it easier for industry and development proponents to destroy the habitats of endangered plants and animals. As such, they call into question the MECP’s stated commitment to provide “stringent protections for species at risk.”
If the ministry really wants to “provide clarity” and “certainty,” then why is it fishing for public support to politicize ESA implementation through ministerial discretion and calling into question science-based species listings?
We need to remind the government that it is reviewing the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act. The law’s purpose is to protect and recover Ontario’s most vulnerable plants and animals. To that end two changes MECP should be considering are:
- Repealing the long list of exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development, approved by Cabinet in 2013; and
 - Amending the law to set a higher bar for creating exemptions through regulation by ensuring they cannot jeopardize the recovery of threatened or endangered species.
The 2013 exemptions have become the primary means for allowing harmful activities to proceed. As of October 11, 2017, there had been 2,065 registrations for exemptions and about 85 percent of these for activities that violate ESA protections for species at risk and their habitats.
The MECP must:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development industries;
 - Amend section 57(1)1 of the ESA so that any future exemptions cannot jeopardize the recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection for endangered and threatened species. (The law already provides enough flexibility through habitat regulations and permitting, so there’s no need to politicize the process by adding ministerial discretion);

I am concerned that the proposed changes will actually endanger species even more. I don’t see how species protection and supporting the economy go hand in hand. Many of the concerns listed seem to indicate that more leeway is needed, that more time for the government to come up with a response is needed, and that a review of the situation after the government response should happen later than it currently does. More time equals more time for species to become more endangered. Please when reviewing this Act, keep in mind its original goal, which is to protect endangered species from extinction, not to protect businesses and the economy. There are a plethora of other Acts that do that. Once a species is gone, there is no getting it back. Ontarians are counting on you to ensure that these species survive, the economy and businesses will do just fine.

I do not believe that any enterprise that uses business interests as a guiding principle has any place dictating environmental policy.

21802,/comment/21802,"A review of the Endangered Species Act is timely in light of the accelerating decline in the size of many species' population world-wide including in Ontario. The overall thrust of any review should therefore be to strengthen the Act, including increasing its effectiveness.  Comments follow on each of the Areas of Focus in the discussion paper.
Landscape approaches
Both landscape ans species-specific recovery actions are required, case-dependent.  Development proposals should always be assessed on a site-specific basis and not receive credit for attributes of a wider area.
The listing process
Colleagues who are closer to the COSSARO/COSEWIC process than I advise me that there is no need to make any changes to it.  Most certainly, automatic listing without political interference should be maintained.  It is fundamental to the integrity of the process.
Species recovery policies
The government should find ways to speed up the formulation of recovery strategies. The observed delays in Government Response Statements are consequential to the delays in coming up with strategies.
Reviews every five years also seems reasonable and should not be changed.
Identification of ""regulated habitat"" is an essential tool in many cases.  It is the only way to create the potential for expanded habitat.
Authorization processes
Overall Benefit Permits are being handed out as if there is no tomorrow. Yes, applicants are made to jump through hoops, but in the end get what they want.  Public comments appear to count for nothing.  Whether the species is experiencing a real ""overall benefit"" remains murky.  There is no accountability for the public to see. The process therefore comes across as a sham, and an expensive one at that.
Standardization of the criteria and mandatory implementation/results reports would be helpful.
Crown forests should not be exempted and the 2013 exemptions for other forestry, mining and development industries should be repealed.

For the most part they would do the opposite, making it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.
I would like to add that I am not commenting because I like animals, I am commenting because as a person with a background in biology, being aware of the interdependence of all living things, I am very concerned about the survival of humans. Eroding protections for species at risk is eroding the web of life that we all depend on.

21810,/comment/21810,"AREA OF FOCUS 1: I am for improving outcomes for species at risk. However, a landscape approach can easily be over generalized, and there is a lesser opportunity for a species to be treated with more care, especially if it is highly vulnerable. A landscape approach sounds like it may be effective at preventing extinctions, but not so effecting at promoting species recoveries as each species will not have a specific recovery strategy that is tailored to its needs.
AREA OF FOCUS 2: If there is not enough notice, a better communication platform for the automatic listing is needed so that businesses are informed as soon as species are listed. I strongly disagree with ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat. That is giving too much power to people, and ignoring scientific facts. If a species is found to be endangered and there are laws in place to protect it, nobody should be allowed to remove its protection for economic reasons. In the case that COSSARO is not transparent enough or there is conflicting information, additional reviews and assessments should be able to be requested.
AREA OF FOCUS 3: Nine months can be a long time for an endangered species, so I disagree with extending this time limit. I don't believe that species will benefit from additional time. Perhaps an expansion of the review team for recovery approaches would be best. A longer timeline for review of recovery progress makes sense, and the timeline could vary due to how fast a species reproduces and how long its life span is. K-selected species could have a bit of a longer timeline for review and R-selected species can maintain the 5 year review. However, even with these laws in place, some SAR still don't receive a 9 month response statement or a 5 year review. If the timeline is extended, how can we ensure that ALL species at risk receive both of these on time?
AREA OF FOCUS 4: This area of focus seems the most like it prioritizes economic development over any form of environmental protection, and completely disregards the value of ecosystem services and the economic benefits of protecting species and the environment.  An extensive requirement to obtain authorization is for the purpose of making it more difficult to be an exception to the rule, and making it so that economic developments are thoughtful and as environmentally conscious as they can be. Making the requirements less extensive shows the governments priorities. I completely understand the need for economic and urban development and the compromise between protecting and developing. However, an extensive requirement allows for checks and balances, and ensures that economic development take the best possible measures to be aware of environmental impacts. Upon read this, it is obvious that simplifying the requirements is completely and solely for the purpose of enabling economic development, and adding the phrase 'while providing positive outcomes and protections for species at risk' is ironic, unnecessary, and meaningless.
Looking at world news right now, I am honestly terrified and worried for the earth. I have always thought that Canada was a frontrunner in environmental protection, as there is so much nature and essential forests to protect here. I understand politics is a world of power struggles and chaos and sometimes even the MOECP does not have much say. But please find a better balance between the two, you hold so many peoples future in your hands.

21825,/comment/21825,"Mainstream political and policy debates have failed to recognize that human impacts on the environment have reached a critical stage, potentially eroding the conditions upon which socioeconomic stability is possible. Human-induced environmental change is occurring at an unprecedented scale and pace and the window of opportunity to avoid catastrophic outcomes in societies around the world is rapidly closing. These outcomes include economic instability, large-scale involuntary migration, conflict, famine and the potential collapse of social and economic systems. The historical disregard of environmental considerations in most areas of policy has been a catastrophic mistake.
Global natural systems are undergoing destabilisation at an unprecedented scale.
	• The 20 warmest years since records began in 1850 have been in the past 22 years, with the past four years the warmest ever recorded.
	• Vertebrate populations have fallen by an average of 60 per cent since the 1970s.
	• More than 75 per cent of the Earth’s land is substantially degraded.
Destabilisation of natural systems is occurring at unprecedented speed.
• Since 1950, the number of floods across the world has increased by 15 times, extreme temperature events by 20 times, and wildfires sevenfold.
	• Extinction rates have increased to between 100–1,000 times the ‘background rate’ of extinction.
	• Topsoil is now being lost 10 to 40 times faster than it is being replenished by natural processes, and, since the mid-20th century, 30 per cent of the world’s arable land has become unproductive due to 			erosion; 95 per cent of the Earth’s land areas could become degraded by 2050.
Human activity has altered the functioning of key natural systems that regulate the Earth’s life support systems and many Earth system scientists argue that humans are now the dominant driver of the overall environmental state of the planet. This disruption risks triggering abrupt and irreversible environmental change, which could undermine the viability of human society.
Natural systems are highly interdependent. For example, habitat loss – including land use changes such as deforestation and desertification resulting from farming – is the primary cause of species extinctions. As such, too much damage in one area can disrupt other systems, potentially triggering large-scale environmental change at a regional or global level which is unpredictable, abrupt, greater than the sum of individual hazards and not easily reversed. Pushing one natural system into an unsafe space can do the same to others.
Human activity is directly killing an increasing number of plants and animals and accelerating the extinction rate of species. This loss of biodiversity has reached critical levels, threatening the collapse of entire ecosystems.  Current extinction rates are unseen since the extinction of the dinosaurs; the Earth is undergoing the sixth mass extinction in its history. Up to 58,000 species are believed to be lost each year and vertebrate populations declined by 60 per cent between 1970–2014. Loss of vertebrate populations in some countries exceeds 85 per cent, while freshwater vertebrate populations have declined by 83 per cent across the world.
More than 40 per cent of insect species are declining and a third of species are endangered; the total mass of insects is being lost at 2.5 per cent per year. Overall, it is estimated that population declines since the emergence of human civilisation constitute 83 per cent of wild mammals, 80 per cent of marine mammals, 50 per cent of plants, and 15 per cent of fish.
Phosphorus and nitrogen are fundamental to life and are essential to functioning of the food system. Agricultural inefficiencies mean that high levels of phosphorous and nitrogen run off into rivers, lakes and seas, leading to over-enrichment of the water with minerals and nutrients. This induces excessive growth of plants and algae, resulting in oxygen depletion and ‘dead zones’, where other marine life dies due to lack of oxygen. It is estimated that marine dead zones span 245,000 km2 of oceans
globally.
Both air pollution from vehicles and industrial processes, and smoke and dust from land use, can influence the climate system and have adverse effects on human health. Human use of other chemicals, radioactive materials and pollutants can also negatively impact the environment. The use of pesticides is thought to be a major driver of the 75 per cent decrease in flying insects observed in Germany since 1989. The scale of non-biodegradable plastic waste, found almost everywhere on Earth, is likely to have wide-reaching health implications for people and marine life.
Laybourn-Langton L, Rankin L and Baxter D (2019) This is a crisis: Facing up to the age of environmental breakdown, IPPR. http://www.ippr.org/research/publications/age-of-environmental-breakdown
CONCLUSION:
The Proposal to amend the Endangered Species Act is a very small finger in a very large and fundamentally flawed dyke. Endangered species cannot possibly be protected unless human impact on the environment is radically diminished. Without changes to land use policies, farming practices, waste treatment, energy production, water treatment, transportation and industrialization policies all endangered species are facing an environmental Armageddon, and Mankind should be added to the List.

The ESA has proven itself clearly ineffective as seen blatantly in the handling of the ""Algonquin wolf"" and the protections of various reptiles and amphibians in Ontario. These are only two of numerous examples, of which any experienced wildlife manager could characterize as all being interconnected and affected by one another.
The relatively easy listing of the coyote-wolf hybrid, falsely recognized as the ""Algonquin wolf"" has triggered the complete abandonment of sound science and proven wildlife management methods, and threatened our ungulate and other mammal populations as well as the security of Canada's only true wolf, the Grey wolf. The protection of this hybrid violates the spirit of the ESA and does more harm than good by exacerbating the problem of hybridization and is resulting in unmitigated depredation of already struggling prey species. The recovery plan pertaining to the ""Algonquin wolf"" itself states that one of the greatest threats to the ""Algonquin wolf"" is further hybridization, but does nothing to inhibit the development of this supposed threat. Should this program be intended to be in the best interest of protecting species under its listing it is clearly falling short of making recovery possible. The ESA has quite obviously been used as an avenue to attack sustainable harvest which is clearly seen in the publicized recovery plans which create impossible problems to solve, ie. protecting hybrids threatened by further hybridization.
In addition, considering the current state of Ontario's reptile and amphibian populations, the ESA has glaringly failed a second time. Wetlands are lost everyday to ever expanding urban growth and agriculture with little to no effort taken to restore or rehabilitate tracts of lost wetland. The number one cause of wildlife decline is habitat loss and the ESA is powerless to address this problem. In addition, it also fails in its supposed purpose as a tool to develop species recovery plans. Owning the longest history of wildlife management within this great country, trappers have been the backbone of the great stewardship role in which Canada has in the past demonstrated its commitment too. Instead, the ESA has allowed novice conservationist whose opinions are based on emotion rather than science dictate recovery plan methods. These anti-sustainable harvest special interest groups have demonstrated their inability to grasp and implement simple conservation concepts and methods and have instead prioritized species to further their own agendas rather than recognize each species and value its role within the food web and ecosystem. One of the greatest threats to Ontario turtle populations aside from the aforementioned habitat loss, is unmitigated depredation by raccoons. Rather than promoting the sustainable harvest of raccoons, methods such as screening, sweeping, and costly veterinary treatment are being implemented. Screening and sweeping, if successful, only serves to divert raccoon predatory patterns to other prey species such as birds (many of whom are also listed under the ESA), resulting in another example in which the ESA is doing more harm than good. If proper and proven wildlife management techniques were implemented by those individuals with unique skills and experience, ie. Ontario trappers, species recovery would become a more realistic goal and foster sustainable predator populations rather than result in an over abundance in predator species and their inevitable collapse as a result in prey species decline.
I hope the government considers carefully the abuse of these current systems and more carefully ascertains in whom the more reliable and experienced wildlife management professionals are in this province and consult with those individuals accordingly. Sound wildlife management doctrine can prevent the majority of species listings, and the frequent reliance on the ESA only serves to further prove how ineffective it is a tool to recover species at risk. Protections should serve as a last resort, sound management should be the solution.

21841,/comment/21841,"The current provincial government is reviewing the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Based on the content of the review, the Ford government appears to be  focused on making it even easier for logging, mining and other industry to destroy the ecosystems that endangered species — and we — need for survival. Species are going extinct faster than ever but our laws are still having to play catch-up.
When the  ESA came into force in 2008 and it was heralded as a “gold standard” and “example for other jurisdictions.” It was intended to be science-based with strong protection for species, but with enough flexibility to be workable. Unfortunately, successive Ontario governments failed to enforce the ESA. The province’s environmental watchdog, the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, accused the responsible ministry of mismanagement, delaying habitat protection, and “deliberately ignoring public participation” on endangered species. In the ten years since the Endangered Species Act came into effect, the list of species at risk has grown from 183 to 243 species— and there are hundreds of vulnerable animals and plants that haven’t even been listed. Now, rather than fixing these problems and restoring the Endangered Species Act, it looks like Doug Ford is prepared to do the opposite. The ESA discussion paper proposes that politicians, not scientists, could decide whether an endangered species gets protection or not. The importance of having up-to-date laws that reflect today’s environmental realities, modern science, and contemporary values cannot be overstated. Effective legislation serves as the last line of defence for the province’s species at risk.
Effectively protecting species at risk is inherently connected to the larger issue of conserving Ontario’s biodiversity. The Environmental Commissioner of Ontario has repeatedly expressed strong concerns over the failure of the Ontario government both to grasp the severity of this environmental crisis and to understand that it has a direct responsibility to take concrete action. The Environmental Commissioner of Ontario is profoundly concerned about the lack of deliberate, systematic, and coordinated government action to conserve Ontario’s biological diversity. All too often, ministries such as the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) and/or Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) are forced into a conflicted role, having to advocate for the very resource extraction and utilization undertakings that can jeopardize biodiversity. Instead, their roles should be cast as champions of biodiversity in order to effectively stave off this environmental crisis and to uphold the public interest. Effectively administering the ESA  and conserving biodiversity in general requires that the MECP have the necessary capacity and resources to carry out its responsibilities.
The biggest problem with the Endangered Species Act is that it has never been properly enforced. Successive governments ignored deadlines, made minimal efforts, and watered down the rules. The current number of exemptions from the ESA available to commercial forestry on crown lands, development and infrastructure, pits and quarries, hydro electric generating stations, receational hunting and fishing and for specific species, compounded by lack of enforcement, totally conflicts with the original and overriding principle of the ESA. Protecting and conserving species by protecting the environment that species require to survive in is paramount.
The current government mentions, ""The Ontario government is currently undertaking a review of the Endangered Species Act to improve protections for species at risk, consider modern and innovative approaches to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk, as well as to look for ways to streamline approvals and provide clarity to support economic development."" The same ministry can not be overseeing both goals, ""improve protections for species at risk"" and ""streamline approvals and provide clarity to support economic development"". This method hasn't been effective at all. Any serious commitment to ""protecting and recovering our province’s species at risk"" must have protecting endangered species as the primary goal, must be given the proper budget and resources to achieve the primary goal and can not be managed by the same ministry and staff. If ""protecting and recovering our province’s species at risk"" is to happen then resource development, (economic development) must be secondary.
The very same Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) that is being proposed as the overseer of ""protecting and recovering our province’s species at risk"" has proven to be incapable of effectively managing the excess soil industry and the uncontrolled large scale soil dumping activities taking place in close proximity to areas where endangered species are to be monitored. Large Scale Soil Dumping is an industry very seriously endorsed by the provincial government. This industry involves large scale soil brokers and many municipalities in the affluent GTA or Golden Horseshoe eager to find inexpensive and readily accessible areas to market and pay rural land owners to accept the excess soils. Despite all the rhetoric from lobby groups and the current provincial government of improvements to the management of excess soils the soil source sites to a large degree simply stock pile the soils, find a market for the soils and perform a minuscule amount of testing on the soils. Alternatively though the most cost effective and direct movement of the soils has likely been accomplished by lining up private trucking operators willing to basically haul anything anywhere for a price. As long as the provincial and municipal governments who are supposed to represent our interests and our environment are engaged in a system where payments are made to landowners to find locations for the excess soil, while at the same time are incapable of applying and enforcing protective measures, then this industry will naturally and inevitably expand. At $100 per truckload to the land owner, which has been reported by one of the truck drivers at one site, and 200 truckloads per day over a 30 day period the landowner pockets $600,000. When municipalities are unable or disinterested in applying or enforcing their Fill Bylaws then there is little or possibly no expense involved on the part of the landowner.
The following is one account of uncontrolled large scale soil dumping taking place in the municipality of Ramara Township. Noncompliance is the issue. The Ramara Township Fill Bylaw 2012.70, revised in October 2018 to become Ramara Township Bylaw 2018.64, A Bylaw To Prohibit Or Regulate The Placing Or Dumping Of Fill In The Township Of Ramara has not been properly applied or enforced at any of the large scale soil dumping sites. This has allowed uncontrolled large-scale soil dumping of many thousands of cubic metres of soil to take place at each of the sites. Freedom of Information requests were submitted to Ramara Township to determine what level of compliance actually existed for three of the large-scale soil dumping sites. The information received through the Freedom of Information process confirmed that the protective measures of the Ramara Township Fill Bylaw were deliberately circumvented in all three locations. Despite the existence of stop work orders existing for two of the three locations large-scale soil dumping has been allowed to continue unchecked. So far there has never been any actual application and enforcement of the protective measures of the Ramara Township Fill Bylaw, and there hasn’t been any recognizable effort on the part of Ramara Township to believe that this will ever be the case. The following response was received from the Manager of the Barrie District Office of the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks dated March 19, 2018, ""Municipalities and conservation authorities  are responsible for fill placement through their related by-laws and permits"". This is the same Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks that the current government intends to be responsible for  ""protecting and recovering our province’s species at risk""? Not likely!
This is a critical moment for endangered species. Some of Ontario’s most beloved animals are at risk of disappearing forever. Endangered species are depending on us for their survival. The question is, can Ontarians count on the current provincial government to properly represent the interests of Ontario residents by implementing a functioning science-based Endangered  Species Act as it was originally intended.

21844,/comment/21844,"My comment is in regard to the review of Ontario's Endangered Species Act.  While I am in full support of protection for endangered species I am also very concerned that this Act has been used by special interest groups to forward their agendas which are not always based in science.  I think a very strict process needs to be put in place to ensure that strong scientific proof which has been documented by several reports must be used to justify listing a species in this Act.
I also believe their should be a weighted value to comments from individuals directly affected by the listing of a species.  It does not seem to be fair to take comments from other countries which have no or limited knowledge of a species and or situation at the same value as comments from those people in the province which have more knowledge of the species and overall situation.
               Thanks for giving me this opportunity to comment.

21845,/comment/21845,"Endangered Species Act contravenes the Crown Forest Sustainability Act and puts Forestry jobs at risk. The forestry industry already has an entire process in place in order to protect endangered species on a landscape scale through the implementation of forest management plans. These plans ensure the protection and creation multiple habitat types that native species require in order to be successful. Furthermore, on a smaller scale endangered species and other wildlife  are preserved through a fine filter approach that will protect areas of concern like nests, den's, water values, and caribou nursing areas etc. . It is already a challenge for the forest industry to find an adequate wood supply in Ontario and the last thing it needs is more red tape. Especially, for something that is already being intensively managed for.  Forestry and mining  are the lifeblood of the Northwest that support families, indigenous peoples, and communities. Please consider providing a permanent exemption to the ESA for the forest industry.

21850,/comment/21850,"I have been concerned with the Endangered Species Act since it's inception in that each of the members of Cossarro have their own pet animal to put on the list.  Most of the time without any scientific basis.  An example is the so called Algonquin wolf which in reality is a grey wolf coyote hybrid that was purposely bred by some of these experts who have input into the act it self.  In fact these animals are prime examples of the Eastern Coyote which has wolf genes .
I believe that the whole Act needs to be looked at to take the bias of the persons involved out of the decision making process.  There are some species that need protection but when that protection injures or harms the existence of another species this should also be considered.

21854,/comment/21854,"I disagree with the basic premises behind the consultation that the Endangered Species Act imposes restrictions that are too onerous on business. When the legislation was introduced a decade ago there had been extensive consultation to avoid such problems. Problems with the act are caused by exemptions brought in three years ago. Problems caused by these exemptions will be compounded by proposals for ministerial discretion which will wrongly politicize the process.
In this round of consultations it is not reasonable to expect more than the reversal of the weakening of the act by exemptions made in the past. However, it is to be hoped that that Ontario's policy framework to protect biodiversity will be eventually be expanded to include new instruments. This could be done by having a commission of inquiry which would investigate our province's role in this global crisis. New instruments could be developed such as economic incentives to prevent species loss.

Though I support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process and not allow possibility of minister discretion at listing.;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion. Delaying or removing habitat protection will allow irreparable damage to species that need protection ASAP, esp. those with long generation times (like turtles & bats); and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.

21861,/comment/21861,"To repeal any parts of the Endangered Species Act in the sole interest of expanding businesses is careless, and does not take into consideration many parts of what future generations need in order to survive. Businesses will not give us clean water. Businesses will not solve our air pollution. Species do not get to be sacrificed in the name of being ""open for business"". Your government seems to forget that this is not just our land; we must share this land with everyone and everything, and we need to give back to our land as we take so much.
Repealing parts of the Endangered Species Act to cater to corporations would only undo all of the work that has been apart of making the Endangered Species Act, and takes us further away from recognizing that we are all connected to our land and everything here. Please make no mistake- this connection impacts us all, and will impact generations to come.
I urge you to reconsider repealing parts of this Act. There can be devastating impacts if we repeal, and set a precedent that businesses matter more than our species and Earth.

I am concerned about some of the proposed changes to the ESA. As a MSc student, I think that the ESA should maintain its science-based listing process and not allow minister discretion at listing. It is also important that mandatory habitat protection is maintained without minister discretion as delays in protection can be permanently detrimental to threatened species. Lastly, successful species protection and improvement requires direct funding, a general conservation fund will increase the time and hoops conservationists need to go through in order to put protection measures in place and may redirect effort away from the most vulnerable species and habitats. I hope this ESA review looks forward long term and realizes many of the proposed changes will do more harm than good and re-directs back into efficient and effective conservation action.

There was absolutely no science relied on during this process, further more the EBR posting for this change was very very short, for reasons one can only speculate.

RE: Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act
Dear Minister Phillips,
For more than a century, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) has supported economic growth in Ontario by advocating for business priorities at Queen’s Park on behalf of our diverse 60,000 members, including local chambers of commerce and boards of trades in over 135 communities.
Responsible natural resource management drives economic development in Northern and rural Ontario. The forest sector alone supports 170,000 jobs across more than 260 communities and generates $15.5 billion in economic activity for this province. With only 0.2 percent of Ontario’s Crown forests harvested each year, there is room for the sector to grow while remaining a world leader in sustainability.
Ontario’s forest sector needs reliable and affordable access to wood fibre. The Government of Ontario’s ongoing review of the Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA) provides a critical window of opportunity to unlock the sector’s economic potential. The following recommendations were developed in consultation with Ontario’s business community.
•	First, formally recognize equivalency between the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) and the ESA to allow the forest sector to operate under a single act. Under the CFSA, industry is required to minimize landscape disturbances and adverse effects on plant and animal life. Duplication between the two acts creates unnecessary red tape. We encourage you to recognize equivalency through a legislative change or permanent regulation under Section 55 of the ESA. Coupled with reasonable and workable prescriptions, this is the best way to protect both the long-term health of Crown forests and the habitats of species at risk.
•	Second, while working under the CFSA, ensure that all species at risk policies and prescriptions are subject to socioeconomic impact analyses and account for the impacts of climate change. The results of those analyses should be communicated to relevant stakeholders, including Indigenous communities and businesses, prior to implementation of any policies or prescriptions.
•	Finally, we are deeply concerned that the Government of Canada might intervene, either through an unworkable Section 11 Conservation Agreement under the Species at Risk Act or an Emergency Protection Order. Federal interference would infringe on provincial jurisdiction at a time when local stakeholders are engaging in productive efforts to find a solution. We therefore urge you to work with the forest industry and Indigenous communities to reach an agreement well before the federal government posts any draft Conservation Agreement to a public registry.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ESA review. We look forward to continuing to work together to support evidence-based policies that support sustainable economic growth across Ontario.
Sincerely,
Rocco Rossi

This has most certainly not been the directive used in designation of the ""Algonquin wolf"". A species that in layman's terms is nothing more than a ""mut"" breed resulting from the interbreeding of 2 non-threatened species. The result has been provincial wide mis-management of a resource, protection of a non-existing species, at the expense of an already weak moose population, drastically dwindling deer population, and increased predation on livestock.

21883,/comment/21883,"10-year review of Ontario ESA - comments in response to Discussion Paper
The comments respond to the four areas of focus in the Discussion Paper.
1.  Landscape approaches to recovery planning
It is tempting to believe that landscape approaches will deliver efficiencies but to date the experience does not appear conclusive.  A quick internet scan turns up very few examples of this approach being used - a Carolinian ecosystem-level recovery approach has been taken to red mulberry and related species in southwestern Ontario  and there may be others, but it is not clear how these differ from a “multi-species” approach.  A clear agreed definition of “landscape approaches” for recovery planning is not easily found - it seems rather vague, although human-centred actions based on participation seem to be important for this approach.
There are examples of multi-species recovery strategies for groups of species occupying similar habitats, including in Ontario (5 mussel species in southwest Ontario rivers, the northern riffleshell and 4 others) , elsewhere in Canada , in the USA  and in Australia .  It seems logical and efficient to use this approach where groups of species are impacted by the same threats in the same habitats.  However it seems that this is not a very common situation, many species at risk are more or less “on their own”.
At least two reviews on the internet conclude that multi-species approaches have not been as effective for species conservation as single-species approaches .
Recommendations - where several species are impacted by the same threats in the same habitats, multi-species recovery approaches should be considered; actions to support recovery of species should be the priority, so normally recovery strategies should be at the species level.
2.  Listing and protections
Ontario takes the approach that species are listed based only on their biological status (without regard to social and economic circumstances) - similar to the approach in the US Endangered Species Act, but different from SARA in Canada.  Most conservationists would agree that this is a good approach which gives priority to the species, so this should be retained.  The option of having Ministerial discretion on listing (identified in the discussion paper) has not proved effective for species conservation in many cases under SARA (where listing decisions are made by recommendation of the Minister of Environment), notably for marine species.
However, listing on the basis of biology alone requires a very high degree of transparency and communication in the process of selecting, assessing and listing species - such that stakeholders can be aware of what is coming and get prepared.  Otherwise, it can look to outsiders like an obscure scientific committee is running the world.  The listing process under the US ESA is quite lengthy (1 year+) and provides extensive opportunity for input, and something like this (lots of upfront time and opportunity to understand and input) should be the goal for Ontario.
From what I can find on the Ontario web site, there is not presently a high degree of transparency and notification in the assessment and listing process - COSSARO has published simple tables of species to be assessed in future on its web site, but the latest one is for May 2017 (there is a list of assessed species from May 2018).  I did not find a lot of detail associated with this list, such that stakeholders could be aware of potential implications - for example on exactly where the upcoming species are found, what might be the results of a listing, etc.
Upfront notification, communication and opportunities for stakeholder input, although requiring time and effort, can have substantial downstream benefits and save time later by ensuring that stakeholders (and also all the other government Ministries which may be impacted by a listing) know what is coming up and giving them time to prepare.
Recommendations - retain the listing process in the current Ontario legislation; significantly upgrade communications and time for stakeholder input at the assessment and listing stage.
3.  Recovery policies, habitat regulations
The timelines (9 months to a response statement, 5 year cycle for reporting progress on recovery) seem reasonable from the standpoint of the species and for stakeholders.  No doubt these can be a challenge for the people who have to meet the timelines, but it is not clear how increasing these would help.
Since habitat threats are so important for most species at risk, it would be important to be as clear as possible about what is/is not permitted where.  This would probably require regulations - or some alternative vehicle which clearly outlines habitat prohibitions and requirements.  The Discussion Paper suggests that this requirement could be relaxed but whatever approach is taken, clear statements of what is not permitted where will be essential.
Habitat regulations or prohibitions to help species at risk should be integrated with those for other conservation purposes (forestry, works in aquatic environments, mining etc) - there should not be separate regulations for species at risk and for other purposes.  This also comes up under permits (pt 4) - it would surely simplify life for economic operators to deal with a single set of regulations.  Perhaps this is already done but this is not apparent from easily available materials.
4.  Permits, regulatory exemptions
This is obviously a very complex and potentially burdensome area, both for economic operators and for the provincial administration.
The explanations on the Ontario web site describing the various processes are clear for someone who knows the jargon (although quite complicated), but must be frustrating for non-bureaucrats.  A first suggestion would be to ensure that explanations on permits and exemptions be written such that they can be easily understood by non-specialists. This would probably require that a writer with good communication skills and without specialist knowledge of bureaucracy and biology write the explanations.  Also, specific points of contact for further information should be provided (not just “your local OMECP office”).
Upstream communication about what may be listed in future (see point 1) would be important to help economic operators and government officials in the full range of Ministries get ready for downstream issues (permitting, regulations etc).
It would be essential to ensure that permits, exemptions, regulations etc are integrated across Ontario government Ministries - there should not be separate permits for species at risk and for other conservation purposes under management by other Ministries.  Perhaps this is already done, but that is not evident from the web site materials.
If this IS done, again, the instructions for economic operators should be written from their point of view, providing a clear picture of what they have to do to undertake activities in a given area.

White the Act can be time-consuming to comply with at times it is the best chance we have of changing people's behaviour so that endangered species are protected.
Specifically, I would like to see:
1. Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development industries.  These well-funded interests would have no problem complying with reasonable protections and restrictions on damage to endangered species and their habitats.
2. Amend section 57(1)1 of the ESA so that any future exemptions cannot jeopardize the recovery of endangered and threatened species.
3. Maintain mandatory habitat protection for endangered and threatened species. Do not allow 'ministerial discretion' to politicize the process of listing species.  We do not need more political decisions being made, they should be based on facts.
4. Maintain COSSARO’s current species listing process, “based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge” (ESA, section 5 (3))
5. Require compensation that results in a direct overall benefit to affected species where harmful activities are permitted. Do not allow proponents of harmful activities to bypass protections by simply paying into a fund.
6. Where appropriate, use a similar mechanism as is being applied for Butternut to help the recovery of other endangered species. This mechanism allows proponents to work to restore the habitat of an endangered species and permits more creative methods to achieve this than a strict ban.

21887,/comment/21887,"Environmental DNA or eDNA is a modern method for confirming the presence or absence of an aquatic or semi-aquatic species. It is based on the detection of eDNA left behind by an organsims. It is very sensitive thus less prone to false negative results of the old catch and identify the animal methods. It is also more specific and reduces the risk of mixing up species as current visual methods do.
Biologist are attached to old methods they know. Modern science is better for monitoring species at risk, because  it is more reliable, faster and costs less that the old methods. Yet, there seems to be resistance to abandon the comfort of old methods and move to modern science. Lack of reliable data is at the core of fuzzy monitoring of species at risk.
Therefore the speceis at risk act that clearly and non equivocally states that environmental DNA should be used, when possible, to provide better.

I wish to indicate at the outset that none of our family has a competing interest, as no one works for a conservation agency or a provincial of federal park. We are, however, deeply concerned about maintaining the environmental integrity and vitality of our province!
Although the Discussion Paper outlined four major focus areas, our family's response will address  only two directly -- #1 Landscape Approaches and #3 Species Recovery. Overall, from what we read and see personally, what is needed is actually greater protections to help recover the province’s at-risk species. The studies in this area seem clear that resource extraction, habitat loss, and industrial activities continue to threaten the survival and recovery of wildlife throughout Ontario. We live on the Bruce Peninsula and we see this happening all around us as precious habitat is destroyed for ""development"" (forestry, quarries, housing).  Although there are important and unique natural areas around us, the approach so often taken is one of act first and ask forgiveness later! This results in the loss or irreparable damage to ecosystems that cannot ""forgiven"" or replaced. Other members of our family live in the Golden Horseshoe, and they witness similar threats there.
Indeed, the ""report card"" for Ontario seems to indicate that we are not achieving many of our goals in species protection. If our personal experiences are at all representative, it is small wonder. Ecosystems and habitats are NOT being protected and preserved. Rather, they are being destroyed and fragmented.
#1 Landscape approaches
While I am not entirely clear about this term and its implications, there is very reasonable evidence that habitat protection is vital to species viability, resilience and recovery. Thus, we urge you to focus MORE attention on habitat-protection measures -- approaches that are effective for the listed species and that address the increasing threats from invasive species. Properly addressed, this will simultaneously improve outcomes for multiple species -- those at risk and those that may become endangered by our inaction.
•  Support local communities in developing activities and policies that maintain and restore endangered species and their habitat, including rural and northern communities.
•  Work with organizations such as Nature Conservancy Canada, Bruce Trail Conservancy, Escarpment Biosphere Conservancy. Biosphere Associations, etc to promote their crucial work in this area. Nature Conservancy in collaboration with universities has been developing tools that could provide leadership in this area. Their focus has shifted to  preserving those landscapes that are most likely to endure and maintain as wide a variety of characteristics to preserve as many species as possible (see links below). This could have broad benefits for everyone, as well as for species at risk!
•  Support the continued leadership and critical role of Indigenous Peoples in conservation initiatives.
•  Work with other ministries (provincial AND federal) to ensure coordination to limit cumulative impacts on the lands and waters that provide wildlife habitat.
#3 Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
As mentioned above, there definitely is potential benefit to harmonizing approaches to habitat protections more broadly. Indeed, we would support a shift towards an ecosystem-based approach that conserves large expanses of habitat and addresses the needs of several species at once, rather than trying to protect individual species.
However, we do have major concerns about two of the bulleted “permits” under the Act (p 6 of Discussion Paper) that could allow exemptions -- (1) Significant social or economic benefit permit, s. 17(2)(d): A significant social or economic benefit permit may be issued for an activity that will result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario, but the activity would have impacts that are otherwise prohibited under the Act. and (2) Regulatory exemption, s. 55: An exemption may be made in a regulation that allows activities to impact species at risk without requiring a permit, provided the requirements of the regulation are met. These exemptions are very broad and have the potential to be abused with too little thought given to the environmental impacts (as already is occurring too frequently now).
We suggest --
•  Amend the Act to actually set a higher bar for species at risk -- by ensuring exemptions cannot jeopardize the recovery of threatened or endangered species.
•  Do not extend timelines (p 5 of Discussion Paper) without clear and public explanation of the rationale. In particular, a review of progress towards the protection and recovery of a species within five years of the Government Response Statement would rarely be too soon to see if there is any impact at all. Waiting longer is quite likely to mean waiting until it is too late!
Thank you for considering our perspectives.

21908,/comment/21908,"This review is deeply concerning since it indicates that 'economic development' is driving the review rather than the need to protect our endangered species.  What is going on in this Province?  We've already seen how developers have deep tentacles in our conservation authorities, prompting decisions that are in the best interests of the developers at the blatant expense of our most vulnerable wildlife.
The government watchdog, ECO, that did such a brilliant report on the limitations of MNRF is conveniently being shut down in a few months time.  Another sign that we're being 'managed'.
I'm a member of the public, someone who observes from the sidelines but also someone who is seeing a great injustice being done.  Many small groups came together over proposed Bill 66.  I belong to one of these groups.  We're watching - and the latest ""review"" is nothing but an opportunity to make life even easier for those who seek to make a profit at the expense of our environment.

21911,/comment/21911,"Yes, the ESA isn't perfect, but the last thing that is needed is for economic development to be easier and more ""streamlined"". That is the main issue with the ESA. It is not strong enough to stop or alter developments that majorly impact SAR. Things are swept under the rug, recovery plans take too long, species aren't getting the attention they need. ""well what's one more infilled wetland, what's more demolished barn, what's one more forest cut down?"" We already can't afford to loose anymore.
For example. An old barn, that could be nesting habitat for 30+ threatened barn swallows can simply be destroyed with a notice of activity and a newly built kiosk (which are not used by barn swallows). This is absolutely unacceptable!
We are currently in a very important time where change needs to be made and quickly! Wildlife populations are dropping dramatically because of human intervention. What we need is smart growth, not streamlined development for all. It should be tough to get approvals!

21912,/comment/21912,"The protection of endangered species is incredibly important. In nature everything is connected with complex relationships between species that we still don't even fully understand. The loss of one species could be a trigger for a collapse of an ecosystem. If you consider the crash of bee populations, other pollinators such as birds, butterflies and other insects are even more important than ever. 40% of the world's bird populations are in decline, of which many species have suffered over a 50% loss. Birds are a great indicator for the health of ecosystems and also play a role in maintaining the health of those ecosystems. This also holds true for a variety of other species. Since humans rely on healthy ecosystems to survive in respect to clean water and clean air, the less species diversity there is means that ecosystems will suffer. Putting the interests of business over the health of our environment and ultimately our own health is incredibly irresponsible and short sighted. Once these species are gone there is no turning back the clock and once an ecosystem collapses, it's near impossible to resuscitate it.

21914,/comment/21914,"Dear, Honourable Hon Phillips,
As a student taking part in Craig Kielburger Secondary Schools Environmental Science class It has become aware that The Ontario Endangered Species Act is changing to make acceptions for businesses to destroy the habitat of threatened or endangered species. As a place with a rich ecosystem, it should be prioritizing species protection over business activities and maintaining the current strength of the Ontario Endangered Species Act. The Ontario Endangered Species Act is one of the best acts regarding the healthy balance within our ecosystem. It has kept many of our species from extinction and even increased low populated animals due to the organized breading from people involved in the Act. If anything, COSSARO needs more funding and access to government agency biologists considering they are species at risk experts. It should be biologists who make decisions about what status a species-at-risk should have because they are the ones who are deeply knowledgeable about this subject and care more about the ecosystem and less about protection over businesses, which is what’s really needed right now. We have to make smart decisions that look further into the future in order to make sure a future is sustainable for our environment and species. Everything is connected in one way or another and upsetting the balance could cause mass destruction. The businesses won’t matter when we end up with deteriorating land and a mass extinction of animals. Habitat destruction and direct killing by people are the primary causes of species extinct. This could lead to more vital extinctions that affect us even closer. This could affect our crops and the amount of quality air. Unless an overall benefit is planned in accordance with the Act, it should not be carried through. Yes, it may be costly for the economy to reduce their activities, but money comes and goes and is a man made object. Once our ecosystem and the species within it are diminished, it is gone. It will take way longer to fix, if fixable, and have stronger repercussions than keeping up with the money needed for hydro, forestry, and other industries. Thank you for taking the time to read and consider my notion about The Ontario Endangered Species Act and why it should remain the same. It is greatly appreciated.
Sincerely, Student from Craig Keilburger Secondary School

This has been the result of hard work by the Friends of Nancy Island and Wasaga Beach Park, Wasaga Beach park staff and many dedicated volunteers.  Great progress has been made.
The Friends do not have the financial resources to fund Piping Plover programs and care if the SAR funding is dropped.  If this very modest funding is lost, it would be extremely detrimental to the Park, tourism and habitat studies for the public, especially students.

21918,/comment/21918,"There is a clear conflict of interest between the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
The ESA requires specific direction for the protection or enhancement of habitat for each individual species at risk.   Where, the CFSA requires Registered Professional Forester's (RPF) and a team of experts to write forest management plans (FMP) in a balanced, sustainable approach providing forests for everyone and everything, including species at risk.
The single species approach of the ESA not only contradicts the overlapping benefits of managing strategies in FMPs required by the CFSA, but will reduce the availability of the forest for other users and uses.
RPF's have been managing for and providing habitat for wildlife species, endangered or not, for many years and should be able to continue to do so without the added bureaucracy of the ESA.
Secondly, there needs to be some accountability applied to the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO).    Currently there is little credibility in how or why species are added to the list.   For example, the addition of Whippoorwill increased the monitoring of this bird species only to find they are abundant in the Northwest.   Similarly, Wolverines are being accidentally trapped on many occasions due to their abundance in the Northwest.  Why were these species identified as ""species at risk""?

21922,/comment/21922,"I am a student in Milton who has concerns about the proposed changes for the Endangered Species Act.
After conducting in class discussions and thorough research, I have found that the potential additions lack the promise of the original Endangered Species Act. The Act is supposed to ensure that the protection of at risk species is the highest priority and main focus. The proposed additions fail to deliver this promise, because they seem to prioritize the interest of industries. The additions that have been created are removing the legal protection from these animals, in order to simplify the regulations of businesses, which will make their operations easier.
The economic focus that the Act is developing will degrade Canada’s rich biodiversity. Animals will lose some of their legal protection, just for the convenience of industries. By giving businesses more power, the recovery of the at risk species will be greatly delayed. The government needs to take a stronger focus on its biodiversity, because it is a vital factor in the success of an ecosystem.
It is in Canada’s best interest to discard the proposed additions, and to reinforce the original Act. Shifting the Endangered Species Act to encourage more economic development, rather than its original purpose, does not uphold Canadian values. As a society, we have a responsibility to protect our environments to the best of our ability. Changing the Endangered Species Act to include economic interests prevents us from following through on this responsibility.
I hope that theses concerns will be recognized and resolutions will be achieved, for the benefit of our communities.

21923,/comment/21923,"Regarding the Endangered Species Act, I am aware that there is a proposal for changes in which many individuals and groups are not pleased. As someone who has done research and taken interest in this proposal, I would like to make a couple of suggestions to help aid with the current problem of the Endangered Species Act; included in this letter, I will be referring to some past changes of the Endangered Species Act, as well as a way to help with your situation.
	My first suggestion which I will be talking about is how I think that there should be no exemptions for any industries or landowners if it means that it will negatively impact any species. I am aware that in the past, the Endangered Species Act made an exemption for the forestry industries which was to allow them to kill, hurt or destroy the habitat of caribou in order to conduct forest operations if the person has an approved management plan. The reason why I am suggesting that there should be no exemptions is that an exemption, such as the one given to the forestry industry, can add the potential for a species to become endangered. Depending on the amount of caribou they kill, it can cause grave problems in the environment such as a decrease in biodiversity, which is why there should be no exemptions which can negatively impact any species.
	The second suggestion of mine regarding the proposal of the Endangered Species Act is to hire or work with a conservation scientist if you haven’t done so already. The job of a conservation scientist is to negotiate with landowners, the government, and more to ensure that resources and forests are being used wisely while caring for the environment as well. Because their job includes negotiating with many people about the environment, I think that they would most definitely help make wise decisions to not only help many endangered species but also with development and what is best for everyone.
	I hope you consider my suggestions regarding the proposal of the Endangered Species Act, and that the solution to this current issue is solved and beneficial for everyone.

21924,/comment/21924,"Ontario’s endangered species act is an act that protects species of living organisms that is listed as threatened and/or endangered by SARA. For this review session, they are looking for comments on how the Act can achieve its goals and fix some of its flaws. One of the biggest suggestions includes the landscape approach. In the endangered species act’s protection is based on protecting individual species and their life history, Whereas, landscape approach’s protection is based on protecting areas along with the species inhibiting in that area. Although endangered species act have its flaws, switching to the landscape approach will arise new different ones. Each species is unique and requires different resources to survive, which shows the complications and the huge amount of resources need for the landscape approach. Although endangered species act needs improvement, it is still the most efficient method to save species. One of the improvements that are needed involves achieving positive outcomes for species at risk. This is a debatable matter since rushing the results will cause unforeseeable consequences. Some of these flaws can be fixed with the help of the government as support, along with the cooperation of other landowners. An article explains that Ontario’s endangered species act can be unfair to the private landowners, because that group also wants to be recognized and included in the process (Olive, 2016). A potential way is to incorporate the landscape approach as a minor attachment to the endangered species act. This way, maybe the landscape approach can fill in some of the flaws of the endangered species act without wasting too much valuable resources.

21925,/comment/21925,"I am writing today to provide comments about the “10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper”. I have read the discussion paper and feel that there are some serious issues presented. My primary concern is that this discussion paper suggests changes that would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals – rather than protecting them, which is what the ESA is supposed to do.
I have structured my comments to reflect the different parts of the discussion paper.
Area of Focus 1: Landscape Approaches
Although I support the management of recovery actions at a landscape level or for multiple sets of species, the listing process must remain as a species-specific process. The data collected for each species is important for identifying trends, habitat needs and recovery actions. This step must continue to be done on a case-by-case basis.
In some cases recovery strategies are written for multiple species if they share habitats and threats. Once recovery strategies are completed, I would support the grouping of multiple species based on habitat regulations to enable recovery at a landscape level.
I am not clear what is meant by:
“For species that depend on habitat across wide ranges, a landscape approach that enables planning and authorizing activities at a broad scale may be preferred.”
Authorizations should remain a species-specific process to ensure each species is recognized as being affected by damaging activities.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process And Protections For Species At Risk
The challenges identified here deal entirely with positive outcomes for BUSINESSES, not SPECIES AT RISK. The goal of the Endangered Species Act is to protect vulnerable species that have to a great extent already been impacted by poor decisions and various business practices. The current standards of making decisions that are evidence-based by an independent committee of science experts (COSSARO) for listing and protection must be upheld. We do not ask our business people or government officials which medications will help our medical conditions, so we should not ask those people which species need to be listed and what their habitat needs are. The experts are there for a reason, they know what they’re talking about.
By the time species are listed they are already in steep decline and in trouble. Allowing any extra delays in listing could seriously impact their recovery. Automatic listing and habitat protection must be upheld. Any delays would simply be allowing more time for damage to be done. This contradicts the purpose of the legislation.
Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies And Habitat Regulations
I would not support a longer time frame for developing government response statements in general. I would support the addition of an option to request an extension in extenuating circumstances (e.g. where recovery strategies are complex, additional consultation is required) on a case-by-case basis.
Reviewing progress within 5 years may be too soon, especially if little action is taken as is often the case. My concern is that if the government response statements are delayed than how long is it before a review is conducted after the species is listed? Perhaps a review should be based on a time limit related to the listing, rather than the government response statement. In that case anything from 5-10 years would be appropriate.
Regarding habitat regulation (from https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-species-risk-are-protected#section-3):
“A habitat regulation replaces general habitat protection. It provides a more precise definition of a species’ habitat and may describe features (e.g., a creek, cliff, or beach), geographic boundaries or other unique characteristics.
Regulated habitat may be smaller or larger than general habitat. It may include areas where the species isn’t currently found. These areas may have been previously occupied by the species or could be occupied in the future.”
It is clear that the habitat regulation, which is formulated after the recovery strategy is completed, is a more effective and accurate description of the species needs. It also includes important protections for locations where the species used to be or could be reintroduced. Skipping the habitat regulation would not be an effective way to guide recovery of species at risk. Developing habitat regulations is an important aspect of the ESA and must be upheld.
Area of Focus 4: Authorization Processes
There are already plenty of authorization tools for exempting harm and habitat destruction of species at risk. We do not need any other “tools” to help business activity damage species at risk. We should instead be asking, “what additional tools could help protect species at risk from harm done by business activity?”. WHY SHOULD DAMAGING HABITATS AND SPECIES IMPORTANT TO ONTARIANS BE EASY? WE ALL DEPEND ON THESE HABITATS FOR OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. This should not be sacrificed for the economic benefit of the few. Businesses need to file the paperwork, or better yet, adapt their practices to minimize harm and reduce the need for authorizations.
I oppose any changes to make it easier for businesses to harm species at risk. The first three discussion points in this section are not acceptable changes to the ESA.
I support the investment by the Ontario government in increased staffing of enforcement officers to ensure compliance with the ESA.
In conclusion, I am concerned that the primary purpose of this discussion paper is to weaken the Endangered Species Act, rather than improving it. Yet at the start of the paper I see this statement:
“The government is committed to ensuring that the Endangered Species Act provides stringent protections for species at risk”.
I urge you to keep that commitment and strengthen the ESA.
I leave you with the following comments from an expert. Please consider these words before you make changes that will impact all Ontarians now and in future generations.
“The world is now experiencing an extinction rate that is 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than the natural background rate. Reports flow in every day about this growing biodiversity crisis, from the decimation of insect populations to jaw-dropping declines in songbird populations. These reports are more than an economic inconvenience. They are flashing lights warning us that we are racing toward a cliff (and picking up speed).
Unravelling complex ecosystems by removing one piece after another is, frankly, a recipe for disaster. We don’t even fully understand all the roles and relationships within ecosystems that keep our natural systems functioning — our air and water clean, breathable and drinkable, our crops growing and fish swimming — yet we feel free to treat them as capable of bearing any burden we place on them or, even worse, too expensive and inconvenient to make room for.
Instead of worrying so much about maximizing short-term economic opportunities, we must start focusing on long-term ecosystem damage. Yes, people need jobs and Canada still relies heavily on resource extraction for economic growth. But the last thing we should be doing is shying away from making hard decisions about limits because that may entail valuing natural wealth over simple GDP.
In fact, it is in our direct interest to pay attention to the long view for the simple reason that it is far more costly to restore the natural environment once we have learned that it’s actually important. So when it comes to taking care of our province’s species at risk, we need to work a lot harder on finding new paths — whether it is much more rigorously tailoring resource operations to the actual tolerances of species, transitioning to a less resource intensive (and consumptive) economy, or helping people find good work that restores rather than diminishes the natural world.
I know that is not a task that lends itself to a simple slogan or “streamlining.” But it is not just the survival of wildlife that is at stake here — it is ours as well.”

21931,/comment/21931,"The ESA legislation and recovery plans provide habitat protection for over 200 animals and plants.  Never in all the years I have worked in the consulting industry has an ESA permit prevented proposed development.  The only complaint proponents have is the length of time the review takes.  If the Ontario government wants to streamline the development process then my suggestion is to hire more staff to review ESA applications.  Increased MNRF or MOECP staff numbers will result in a faster review time.
What cannot happen is a blanket approval for any type of development.  Habitat loss is the main reason species populations are declining.  I do not want my children asking in 20 years why we let developers remove the last wildlife corridors .  Interior forest requires a certain area to provide nesting habitat, watercourses require a certain size buffer and LID methods to keep them cold/ cool, wetlands provide water quality, infiltration and wildlife habitat.
Climate change is occurring and the loss of buffers between natural features and development will result in negative impacts.  The weakening of the ESA is not something that we should support if we want to provide a healthy environment for our children.  No one will look back and say ""wow the Ford government really saved tax payers a lot of money by letting that small percentage of  developers remove habitat for wildlife without a review process, mitigation or compensation"".  They will say what were you thinking, that industrial park requires roads, sewers, hydro, gas and outfalls all of which impact different  aspects of ecological function.  Roads, crossings groundwater pumping, all can cause disruption of wildlife's ability to breed, eat, overwinter, migrate, etc.  Who will assess those functions if the ESA is further dismantled?
I request that the act is made stronger by providing additional staff and support to actually provide good scientific feed back on how development and natural features can both thrive.

21936,/comment/21936,"1. I have strong concerns with how COSSARO as it is misusing this Act. They are listing anything they want without a proper and proven factual science to back their theory for example the ""Algonquin Hybrid coy-wolf"" This hybrid coyote/wolf/dog which has NO proven DNA is not a species at risk. It is among the  same species as a sasquatch or other mystical creature. There is an Easter coyote, Western Coyote, Red Wolf and a Grey Wolf. A hybrid should not be granted as a species.
2. I do believe and need and will encourage everyone to help protect and promote a species that is at risk. We need to protect the environment and species that could become extinct.The exception is an invasive species that is doing harm to the environment and putting native species at risk like the giant hog weed, zebra mussels and others. These invasive species should be eradicated.
3. Also believe that the lobbyist groups like PETA, Greenpeace and other organizations that push their anti hunting/fishing/trapping/logging must be prohibited from providing funding and support to this process and ESA. These organization are terrorist organizations, paid to destroy business and renewable resources. They are after the mighty dollar and are not concerned for the environment or the welfare of animals.
4. More involvement/participation of educated scientist, enforcement officers and along with the experienced hunter, fishermen/women, trappers, loggers and other outdoor enthusiast (front line eyes, ears and voice) to bring awareness to changes in the habitat and wildlife populations. This team will be your most effective means to provide a rapid response to these changes in the environment and wildlife population. They will also be able to provide some valuable recommendation and suggestions to help with a quick recovery of the species at risk.
5. Establishing a team approach as in point 4. will help promote our environment and ensure a healthy, abundant and renewable resource. This also establishes a communication chain that would benefit the whole of Ontario, Canada and even reaching out to the world.
6. Lastly, why do people form outside of our country have the same weighted response equal to Canadians who respond to these EBR?
It should be the people of the area affected, then the province and then Canadians that have the most weight in the response to these EBR. There is nothing wrong with research in other areas inside and outside of Canada that experienced a similar situation to help provide an educated solution.

21937,/comment/21937,"OVERALL, There is a fundamental difference between revising the law and improving its implementation.  To improve outcomes for species at risk we need to improve ESA implementation not weaken the law.
LANDSCAPE APPROACHES:
Regarding landscape planning, the ESA already provides for this. No change to the law is needed
With regard to authorizing harmful activities at a broad scale, such an approach is inappropriate for endangered and threatened species. It doesn’t lend itself to addressing site-specific or species specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.
LISTING PROCESSES AND PROTECTIONS:
The ESA already allows the Minister to request a review of a COSSARO decision if “credible scientific information” indicates the listing is not appropriate (sec. 8(2)). Changing the law to allow ministerial discretion about automatic protections will politicize the process, fuel controversy and weaken protections for species at risk. The ESA already provides more than enough flexibility through permits and exemptions.
Science-based listing and automatic protections provide certainty.
Improving notification is an implementation issue which should be addressed through better communications
RECOVERY POLICIES AND HABITAT REGULATIONS:
There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce Government Response Statements (GRS) within nine months of the release of Recovery Strategies (sec. 11(8)). Failure to meet the legislated deadline is an implementation issue.
The required five-year reporting on progress is reasonable and ensures transparency and accountability. It provides an impetus for action, ensuring that effectiveness is assessed, and contributes to institutional learning and adaptive management.  In fact, the government should legislate additional reporting requirements (e.g., every five years) to drive ongoing action and monitoring beyond the first five years.
There should be no changes to the legal provisions for habitat regulations, which describe specific boundaries or features of areas deemed to be habitat and provide enhanced certainty for ESA implementation and enforcement.
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS:
Proponents of harmful activities should NOT be allowed to simply pay into a conservation fund - an easy way out that reduces accountability and facilitates harm to species at risk and their habitats. Retain the current requirements to provide an on-the-ground, overall benefit to species harmed.
Strengthen protections for species at risk by repealing the sweeping exemptions for industry and development (forestry, hydro, mining, aggregate extraction, and more) approved by Cabinet in 2013. The 2013 exemptions have become the primary means for allowing harmful activities to proceed. As of October 11, 2017, there had been 2,065 registrations for exemptions and about 85 percent of these were for activities that violate ESA protections for species at risk and their habitats
There are already sufficient authorization tools. No new tools are needed. Challenges should be addressed through improved implementation.

21941,/comment/21941,"Dear Han Phillips,
I have been informed about your proposal on changes towards the Endangered Species Act and through careful analysis, your proposal is reasonably thought out and crafted. I conquer that adjustments should be manufactured to have some economic development while still remaining to care for species in need. To go alongside your proposal, I have a few suggestions to be taken into consideration while finalizing your decision.
	To begin, a meeting between some representatives in the natural resource industries, politicians, conservation scientists and the members of COSSARO should occur to negotiate decisions and acts towards the species, their environment, or any development or changes seeked. This would benefit for giving insight from experts in the fields affected by what’s presently occurring to make reasonable decisions that still prioritize the species and environment's well being. As well, by adding conservation scientists, both the economy’s needs and care for the species and their environment will be worked together so both are positively affected after the changes are made. Additional to this point, please confirm that each party has diligent research on their needs, but remain flexible and still negotiate an understanding. This research would consist on changes they desire from what’s currently happening, why their industries needs this change, how they want to change it, and as well as the after effects for both the company and the environment/species in the long term.
	Another suggestion to take into consideration is to make the care for each species on the list different based on their placement on the list (eg. endangered versus at risk) and as well as how big of a part they play on biodiversity (eg. coral reefs). Also, have the COSSARO set limitations for certain species that play a big part in biodiversity. Those limitations would be strictly illegal as they would negatively affect those species while economic profit is held as the priority. This would be revised by the conservation scientists to seek fairness and once finalized are non-negotiable until next year with updated information on those species.
	Thank you so much for taking the time to read my letter and consider my suggestions for further development in Ontario’s economy while still remaining true to Ontario’s animals and ecosystems.
Sincerely,
a caring citizen of Ontario

21948,/comment/21948,"I have been advised that the current Endangered Species Act is having a negative impact on the forestry industry due to the existing guidelines, conditions, etc. In recent years there appears to have been a  move to lessen some of these guidelines. It is my opinion that any move to decrease the guidelines will have a very severe impact on Endangered Species in Ontario. The forest Industry is suggesting a short time period for habitat protection (turtle nesting and snake wintering sites). This would reduce habitat protection not enhance it.
Recently the MNRF has introduced a guideline entitled ""Forest Management Guide for Conserving Biodiversity at the Stand and Site Scales"". In my opinion this document offers less protection for Species at Risk and their habitat.  I was told that the amendments were science based however it appears more likely that economics has trumped science once again.
One of the glaring failures in the current Act is the lack of project oversight and compliance to the Act. In my experience there appears to be very few warnings, charges and prosecutions of violations of the Act. This may be a staffing or training issue. The public has become very aware of the need to protect these rare and endangered species and the need to enhance the protection of the spcies and their habitat.
Here are some examples of compliance failures that I have observed;
In preparation for the realigning of Highway 69 MTO hired a consultant to conduct Whip Poor Will surveys. These surveys were not conducted in compliance to existing guidelines. Some of the surveys were conducted during the wrong timeframes. Some surveys were conducted on right of ways that had been cleared of all vegetation. How can we have any confidence in surveys that are so poorly conducted. Did anyone follow up with MTO?
As part of the same project the MNRF issued a license to MTO  regarding Species at Risk.  MTO Contract employees received training on species identification and handling. In spite of the training there were violations of the terms and conditions of the Permit issued by MNRF. Reptiles were moved outside of their local habitat. When MNRF was made aware of these violations the MNRF response was that would discuss the issue with MTO at their next annual meeting. No investigation, no warning, no followup, nothing?
During one phase of this project MOECC staff investigated over 30+ environmental spills.  These spills included release of deleterious materials into watersheds, streams, rivers, sensitive wetlands, etc.  Some of these violations were reported to DFO, DFO did not investigate or send any compliance staff to investigate the potential negative impacts to the habitat, the Species at Risk the natural environment, etc.
During the construction of the two bridges at the Murdock River, the MTO contractors repeated exceeded the MOECC Blasting Guidelines. The records of these blasts was shared with MOECC staff and nothing was done, no investigations, no warnings, nothing. The Murdock River is habitat for many Species some of which are Endangered.   How can the public have any faith in the process if there is no compliance or reprimand to the violators?
Our previous Premier stated that polluters would be held responsible for their decisions. It is time to put those words into action.
In closing I would offer the words of Albert Einstein ""Nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.""

21951,/comment/21951,"RE:  EBR Registry #013-4143
EACOM Timber Corporation welcomes the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, and I am pleased to submit comments on behalf of the Company.
Since 1994, the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) has governed forestry in this province to ‘provide for the sustainability of the Crown forests,’ consistent with ‘large, healthy, diverse and productive Crown forests and their associated ecological processes and biological diversity’. The CFSA establishes a robust framework with inventories, planning, monitoring, compliance and auditing. Ontario’s forest management system offers a solid and comprehensive statutory, regulatory and policy guidance framework for species at risk (SAR).
At first glance, the ESA and the CFSA appear to have similar conservation objectives. Yet, since its introduction a decade ago, the ESA has proven challenging to implement and particularly so in a forest management context. The Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario’s often arbitrary listings trigger reactive, siloed single-species processes that ignore an existing CFSA framework designed to achieve comprehensive sustainability objectives. This has created significant administrative burden with little to no added value for SAR.
Following years of attempts at harmonization, we offer that the path forward is to recognize Forest Management Plans (FMPs) within the ESA and work to implement SAR guidance through the CFSA. Of Ontario’s 243 listed SAR, EACOM is responsible for the planning of prescriptions for 9 species, most of which are SAR birds. As we already plan actions to protect the species and their habitats through forestry activities, EACOM requests the opportunity to work with the ministry to develop appropriate actions that achieve conservation results for all these species through our FMPs.
We applaud the government’s efforts to improve SAR guidance in Ontario through this review.
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this consultation.

21954,/comment/21954,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the discussion paper on the
Endangered Species Act (ESA). This document represents the official position of
the Ottawa Field Naturalists’ Club. The world is currently facing a biodiversity
crisis, with many species declining or going extinct. A recent analysis found a
60% decline in the size of populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and
amphibians over the last 40 years (1). The province of Ontario is not immune to
these declines. Currently there are over 200 species at risk (SAR) in Ontario (2).
Already 16 species have been wiped out from the province (2). Any changes
made to the ESA should be done carefully and cautiously, as without diligent
management of our species at risk there is a significant risk of further loss of
additional populations or additional habitat of these species. Further declines in
some species may cause them to be eliminated from Ontario, reducing the
diversity of our natural heritage.
Area of Focus 1 – Landscape Approaches
In terms of recovery actions, activities focusing on specific landscapes or
ecosystems can be beneficial for many species. Activities, for example, which
aim to reduce forest fragmentation, and increase forest connectivity and the
amount of core forest area in the Carolininan Zone would benefit many species.
At the same time, many recovery activities must be focused on the individual
species given the threats facing certain species (e.g. Butternut canker). There
should be a mix of ecosystem and species-specific recovery actions. At the
same time, an ecosystem focus on species at risk recovery should not be used
as a justification to “support a proposed activity” (p.3). Too often development
proposals argue that a species is widespread in an area and therefore the loss
of one habitat patch will be inconsequential to the longterm survival of the
species. This kind of thinking is ecologically unsound and it is our hope that this
is not the intent of this area of focus. Development proposals should be
reviewed on a site specific basis and an overall benefit determined based on the
magnitude of the effect of each project.
Area of Focus 2 – Listing Process
There is absolutely no need for longer timelines before listing a new
species at risk. Currently the COSSARO review process is slow. If the
government wishes to provide more advanced notice about potential additions to
the list of SAR then the species to be reviewed by COSSARO should be made
public as early as possible. This would let the public know which species may be
listed after the review process.
There should be no change to the automatic listing of SAR after review by
COSSARO. The decision of whether a species is at risk is not a political
decision. It is a science-based decision and this should not change. Removing
the automatic listing of new species at risk would undermine the fundamental
principles of the ESA and weaken the protection for declining species. Similarly
there should be no change to the automatic protection of habitat for newly listed
threatened or endangered species. Habitat protection is a key element of the
ESA.
The COSSARO review and assessment process does not need to be
changed. If anything the process should be sped up. Most species assessed by
COSSARO have already been assessed by the federal COSEWIC process.
There are rarely any surprises from the COSSARO assessment and this is as it
should be. No actions should be taken to delay the already lengthy COSSARO
assessment process. New information is always becoming available but this
should not prevent making decisions based on the best available knowledge.
Area of Focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies
A modest delay in the production of a Government Response Statement
(GRS) is certainly reasonable under some circumstances. However, it should be
stressed that the government of Ontario has frequently not been preparing
recovery strategies or GRS documents on time. According to a recent analysis,
less than half of the GRS documents for birds and mammals, and less than 60%
of the GRS documents for plants have been prepared on time (3). A GRS is not
prepared until a recovery strategy has been published and many species are still
lacking a recovery strategy years after they were listed. The ESA specifies that a
recovery strategy should be produced within 1 year for endangered species and
2 years for threatened species. American Gingseng was listed as endangered in
2008 but a recovery strategy has still not been published. And hence no GRS is
required until then. Rather than trying to delay the release of GRS documents,
the government should be focusing on ways to speed up the production of
recovery strategies.
Conducting a review of progress on recovery of species at risk every 5
years should not be changed. It is certainly true that recovery for some species
may take decades. That is understandable. It does not mean that a 5 year
review is not worthwhile. Each 5 year review provides valuable information on
whether conditions for that species is getting better, remaining the same, or
getting worse. Without the 5 year review it would be not be readily obvious if
species are continuing to decline despite recovery actions.
Habitat regulation may not be required for all threatened and endangered
species, but this should be addressed on a case by case basis. General habitat
descriptions are adequate for identifying the core areas used by SAR but only
regulated habitat “may include areas currently unoccupied by the species, such
as areas where the species formerly occurred or areas where there is the
potential for the species to become re-established” (4). Hence, at a minimum,
regulated habitat is required for those species that need to expand their current
range to become down-listed. Habitat regulation should also be mandated for
those species with limited current distributions in the province to ensure that the
current habitat, and adjacent potential habitat, is protected. These species with
few populations left in Ontario are the most vulnerable to any future habitat loss
or the negative effects of development pressure. We also recommend that
habitat regulation be mandated for all species found in the Carolinian Zone
given the lack of natural habitat left in this area.
Area of Focus 4 – Authorization Processes
The current process to get an Overall Benefit Permit (C permit) can be
onerous. We encourage the government to develop standard overall benefit
actions to compensate for specific actions for particular SAR. These
compensatory actions should provide tangible benefits to the species in question
and clearly provide an overall benefit to the species on the ground, not just
research.
The current process to get a Significant Social or Economic Benefit
Permit (D permit) should not be changed. D permits were never intended to be a
common tool to allow development to over-ride the powers of the ESA. D
permits should only be considered in rare cases where there is overwhelming
social benefit. They should not be granted for draining a wetland to build a
parking lot for a box store. Even in the cases when a D permit is granted, the
mitigation efforts expended on SAR should also be significant, such as the
example of the Herb Gray Parkway in Windsor which has created habitat for
SAR and improved connectivity of habitat patches (5). The process for getting a
D permit should not be streamlined.
Forestry under Ontario’s Crown Forest Sustainability Act should not be
exempt from the ESA. The powers of the ESA should not be weakened on
Crown Land to allow commercial activity. Crown Land should be protecting
habitat for species and permitting public access to these natural areas.
Beyond the points raised in the discussion paper, we encourage the
government of Ontario to act to truly strengthen the protection for SAR in the
province:
1) It is time to repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and
development industries. These exemptions allow the widespread
destruction of SAR habitat.
2) Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed
if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and
threatened species.
In conclusion, the ESA is a powerful piece of legislation that is respected
across North America. We are in strong disagreement with any proposed
changes to the ESA that would weaken protection for species at risk or their
habitat, delay the production of recovery strategies or government response
statements, or reduce the obligation of developers to genuinely provide an
overall benefit to species at risk in their permits. We hope that the government
will continue to uphold the core values of the ESA and ensure the continued
protection of Ontario’s many species at risk.

Though I support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge the MECP to:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.

21963,/comment/21963,"There are many problems with the ESA and it is important that they are addressed and that changes made to it are not just to open ""barriers to economic development"" without a primary objective of protecting Ontario's biodiversity!
Taking a landscape/ecosystem approach would be an excellent improvement if done with, again, the objective of strengthening the sustainability of Ontario's rich but threatened biodiversity.  In the south especially there is much overlap of Species-at-Risk (SAR) and their habitats.  The Sydenham River Recovery Strategy is a good example of taking an ecosystem approach to recovery.  Unfortunately it was not followed where there were many opportunities, such as in Tall Grass Communities and Carolinian Woodlands, two attempted ecosystem strategies that I was involved in developing but in the end were rejected and only the individual species recovery strategies were accepted.  So yes, let's re-examine the value of looking at the whole landscape or a region, and recovery of whole ecosystems again!
There has been much work looking at recovery of landscapes by Carolinian Canada and Ontario Nature; bring those NGOs into the discussion and use their mapping as a guide to protection and restoration of natural landscape linkages.  Increasing the forest cover in s. Ontario, especially the highly deforested SW, would go a long way to protecting SAR.  Involve Conservation Authorities in targeting restoration plantings in the gaps in the connectivity of the landscape.  We also know that increasing forest cover will help protect us against extreme weather events, and climate change is often listed as a threat for SAR.
Further north, the same approach of a landscape level overview could be used to better define important SAR habitats, migration routes, etc. which should be rigorously protected.  This approach would be far better than just exempting major industries such as forestry and mining, an anomaly in the spirit of the act that should not continue!
Processes and protection: the species under review are known two or more years before the status is granted (and the backlog of un-reviewed S1 and S2 species is unacceptable!) so provisional lists could be issued, vs. delaying the listing of species given COSEWIC status.
COSEWIC is a group of knowledgeable, and I assume still unpaid volunteer, scientists for each subcommittee.  Political interference is unwelcome!  There is no need to oversee what the experts are reviewing and the status they give.
It is currently too easy to evade the spirit of the act, such as by allowing the destruction of habitat if another piece of land is set aside as habitat for the SAR.  When this was regulated by MNRF, biologists I spoke with have said it is a routine exemption that developers take, but with very little evidence that these pieces of land serve as alternate habitat for displaced SAR.

How can endangered and sensitive species be protected while reducing the barriers to development?
Bulldozing wetlands, fields and forests to clear the way for buildings, roads, parking lots, bridges and interchanges cannot possibly improve conditions for endangered species.
The objectives need to be re-written to take out any reference to facilitating economic development.  When we destroy parts of the web of environment for other creatures, eventually we will destroy the web that supports our lives.

2. Climate change and introduction of new species: with the warming of our climate and changing weather patterns, new species and ecosystem dynamics are created. It will be important to consider these dynamics in managing and supporting Ontario's species

21980,/comment/21980,"As Conservation Director I would like to share concerns on behalf of members of Waterloo Region Nature regarding the ESA Review (ERO #013-4143).  This is the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act. The priority must be on protecting and recovering species at risk.
•	The law should not be changed to allow landscape approaches “instead of” species-specific approaches. The fine scale of species-specific status assessments, listings and protections is needed.
•	There should be no alternative to automatic species and habitat protections (e.g., through ministerial discretion to remove or delay protections).
•	The ESA already allows the Minister to delay the development of a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)b) or to not proceed with a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)c). No change to the law is needed.
•	There are already sufficient authorization tools. No new tools are needed. Challenges should be addressed through improved implementation.
•	Proponents of harmful activities should NOT be allowed to simply pay into a conservation fund - an easy way out that reduces accountability and facilitates harm to species at risk and their habitats. Retain the current requirements to provide an on-the-ground, overall benefit to species harmed.
•	Do not simplify requirements for sec. 17(2)d permits. These are intended to be available only for projects that “result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario” and that will not “jeopardize the survival or recovery of the species in Ontario.” These are appropriate requirements and ensure that such permits are issued only an exceptional basis.
•	Do not simplify requirements for exemptions through regulation. On the contrary, make the requirements more stringent by amending the law (sec. 57) to ensure that exemptions are premised on providing an overall benefit to species at risk and cannot jeopardize their survival or recovery.
•	Strengthen protections for species at risk by repealing the sweeping exemptions for industry and development (forestry, hydro, mining, aggregate extraction, and more) approved by Cabinet in 2013. The 2013 exemptions have become the primary means for allowing harmful activities to proceed. As of October 11, 2017, there had been 2,065 registrations for exemptions and about 85 percent of these were for activities that violate ESA protections for species at risk and their habitats.
•	Enforcement officers have no authority to routinely inspect exempted activities to ensure compliance with legal requirements, and consequently no inspection takes place. Implement the recommendation of the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario to amend the ESA to give enforcement officers the power to conduct compliance inspections.
•	Enhance transparency and accountability by amending the exemption regulation (242/08) to require all proponents of harmful activities to automatically submit their mitigation plans and annual reports to the government and to ensure that these are publicly available.
•	The ESA (sec. 18) already provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. No legislative change is needed. This is an implementation issue.
Please consider our comments carefully. The survival of Ontario’s endangered species depend on it!

21981,/comment/21981,"Species recovery policy and habitats regulations
Pollution and climate change has been major factor impacting on wildlife some have adapted and some went extinct.   Certainly, weather over these past 10 years had changed quite rapidly that even affecting human on a global scale: tornado, tsunami, wildfires, pathogens and more… Technologies help us adapt to serve conditions of the environment, but animals alone can merely hang on their adaptability to embrace the changes or perish and became part of the history. Human activities had changed the landscape and climate that was once suitable for many species and as the conditions change they have move along with the changes in order to survive. Human given enormous burden on the biodiversities and has altered the landscape with agriculture purposes, local economies, deforestation and water consumption.  It is time to make changes and start recognize the value of wild species and there are couples of things we can take into considerations that will hopefully slow down the rate of changes to a more adaptable level for wild life animals. There are not enough of spaces provided for some species that require large habitats throughout their life cycle such as migratory birds. They might have hard to allocate a suitable nesting place or hunting ground with fragmentation of land, so opening up non commercial landscape such as Napanee Limestone Plain for conservation purpose is necessary. Many species are still not well understood and some of the species data are out of date such as the northern leopard frog which last update on its status was 10 years ago, further researches will be require to reduce unexpected factors that might emerges and interfere with new implantation.  Water resources regulations also priority as Canada holds the largest fresh water reservoir on the planet and life’s depended on it.

That being said, for the purposes of making those decisions, species of Special Concern, or the equivalent term in the neighbouring jurisdiction, should be included in the criteria even though not fully Species at Risk. Species that are common, then, in one or more of those jurisdictions, but not 'at risk' in any of them, would not be included. Licaeides melissa samuelis, for example, would continue to be included since New York recognizes it as Endangered. If it were common in Ontario (it is not), though, it of course would not be included on Ontario's list, regardless of its status in New York.

With increasing risk of climate change effects, forecasting of future impacts on wild populations of plants / animals should be considered (e.g. work MNRF does).

21985,/comment/21985,"As the 10 year review of the Endangered Species Act in Ontario approaches, it provides an opportunity to fill in any gaps that were missing or improve the current policies in place. Specifically, I will be focusing on Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations. In this area of focus, it outlines the duration of time allotted to come up with plans to protect species habitats and provide recovery strategies. The issue with this area of focus is that it lacks specificity in terms of what qualifies for a habitat to be protected and the species involved, the ""general habitat"" of a species can encompass many meanings and it allows greater chances for disputes to neglect important habitats, hotspots need to be defined for better protection. Another issue with this focus is the duration of time allowed to come up with a viable plan to protect a species habitat and the necessary steps for recovery. I believe that time should be extended from 9 months to a 1 year since that little bit of extra time allows for better planning and understanding of the task at hand for the species/habitat in focus.  Lastly, there needs to be some sort of incentive or even consequence in place to have these plans be made up. During the Harper government, many species were not being listed at a timely manner and till this day, there is a backlog of all the species that need to be reviewed. It is unacceptable to wait YEARS to list species onto a list in order to protect them. Given the current political and environmental climate, it is clear that we are fighting against time to save species. Without incentives or consequences, it might be too late to protect these species at risk. The loss of many species is a loss for future generations and a massive loss to our biodiversity on this planet.

21986,/comment/21986,"Hello,
I am a 4th year undergraduate student at the university of Toronto and I wanted to comment on these proposed changes. Although not an expert I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposal.
In regards to focus 1, I do agree in utilizing a landscape approach in regards to the species at risk act to streamline the process, it is essential that the current species specific approach can not be left behind as an old method. It should rather be used for certain especially important keystone or critically endangered species.
In regards to focus 2, The essential missing bridge of communication is a key issue outlined in the proposal and I believe this could be mitigated by having a liaison type position to notify and interpret the act itself to the public. This could take the form of a very small team or just an individual that could operate an easily accessible chat line or phone line for some hours of the day.
In regards to transparency it is also possible to increase the level of transparency by working with the independent committee to include more information in their assessments. Of course an increased level of information would require more research to be done, to expedite that process in a timely manner the field work could be outsourced to public volunteers or open new opportunities to new graduates as entry level positions.
However, I strongly disagree with removing the automatic listing of species as not only would it create even more bureaucratic backlog, it would also dramatically slow down the entire process of listing a species which was a key concern of the proposal. This point seemingly goes against the aimed message of the proposal which aims to expedite the process and instead will weaken the act itself whether unknowingly or otherwise.
I hope the act is treated with care as with our changing environment in these turbulent times, it is paramount that we take every precaution necessary to ensure a better future.

21988,/comment/21988,"Some years ago, I signed up for alerts on the EBR regarding exemption permits that once were correctly defined as permits ‘to harass, maim or kill’ species at risk but then changed to the  ridiculous moniker of permits to achieve an ‘overall benefit’ as if directly harming or wiping out species at risk or their habitat will ever be of any benefit.
Since that time, of all the many alerts for hundreds of these permits applied for – estimate to be around 2000, no matter how egregious the scope of harm to species at risk,  with perhaps a couple of exceptions, were all approved.   In 2013, the threats to species at risk escalated when the government passed a the long list of exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining, wind turbines, and commercial development.
Developers seeking permits where automatic exemptions did not apply have presented ‘mitigation’ strategies which are theoretical at best, and have never been tested or evaluated in the real world. Mitigation strategies are often assembled by so-called ‘consultants’ who are working for their client and not in the best interest of protecting Ontario’s ever-vanishing species at risk.  In addition, neither the MECP nor the MNRF have the staff to ensure that so-called ‘mitigation’ measures are actually implemented and that they are successful.
Now, this proposal, if adopted, will allow for ‘ministerial discretion” to decide whether species or habitat protections should even apply thus making it even simpler, as if it could be any simpler,  for applicants, especially  large scale residential, commercial and industrial developers to undertake harmful activities and then not even have to file any reports.   This proposal facilitates the ability of industry and development proponents to wipe out the habitats of endangered plants and animals without consequence.  To allow applicants to pay into a ‘conservation fund’ instead of instituting prohibition, demanding following strict protocols be followed and/or implementing proven mitigation measures is incomprehensible especially in an age where the need to protect the environment in order to promote human sustainability has been made paramount world-wide.
If the province loses its species at risk, we lose biodiversity which in complex ways keeps us humans alive. To destroy  the environment for the short term financial gain for developers and often-touted ‘instant’ economic benefit, in the long term, will have disastrous consequences. This has happened throughout history where once great civilizations vanished because the inhabitants destroyed the local environment and their vast empires became unsustainable.
Instead of stripping and chipping away at very weak legislation, legislation needs instead, to be amended setting a higher bar through regulation for creating any exemption ensuring any proposal cannot jeopardize the recovery of threatened or endangered species. The government should also repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, energy, mining and commercial development industries.
To date, the Species at Risk list in Ontario (O. Reg 230/08)  lists  a stunning 115 designated ‘endangered’ species,  56 species as ‘threatened’ and 50 listed as ‘special concern’. .. a total of 221 species. There should be NONE on that list. https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/080230
There are already 16 species  listed as being extirpated – this proposal, if adopted instead of decreasing this list, guarantees that list of extirpated species will increase as well as the number of species on the endangered, threatened and special concern list.  This is not what Ontario should be known for - the province that managed to wipe out the most species at risk for the promise of unproven short-term economic benefit and in doing so destroyed the quality of life for all of its human inhabitants.

in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,
I go and lie down where the wood drake
rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.
I come into the peace of wild things
who do not tax their lives with forethought
of grief. I come into the presence of still water.
and I feel above me the day-blind stars
waiting with their light. For a time
I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.

21993,/comment/21993,"As a land use planner my comments/concerns related to the protection of our lands. Most importantly the protection of our lands in sensitive areas (Oak Ridges Moraine, Green Belt, Watersheds) to be free of aggressive development, especially development that will contribute to further contamination of the surrounding lands and waterways.
There is plenty of areas within cities (identified within the places to grow act) which can tolerate and accommodate further intensification. This should be the primary objective of this government, to facilitate and encourage the ""infilling"" of existing communities so as to not continually need to plow under yet another farm.
Here, the protection of the Greenbelt is paramount. This province can not afford to lose any more farm land, whether they are productive or not at this moment is not relevant. They should be considered as an asset store. At some point in the near future, as the climate continues to grow more unpredictable across the globe, these lands with extremely fertile soil will be unparalleled.
The best way to both protect our waterways, farm lands and species at risk, is to prevent the destruction of their ecosystems. The best way to do this is to limit/prevent development in these sensitive areas as well as to control/prevent the use of harmful pesticides and herbicides.

The process of adding species to the list and developing recovery plans for them must be done faster not more slowly.
Habitat regulations for individual species must be maintained unless an ecosystem approach can protect several species. This is the way it is done now.

The protection for Ontario’s most vulnerable wildlife species shouldn’t even be in question. We must not digress in our progress. It is our responsibility to put these species as the top priority above business. We have done enough damage to the natural world and caused enough extinctions and extirpations as it stands. Ford is not an ecologist, biologist, or even science minded. He is greedy. He is not credible to be creating proposals in ecology related legislation.
I am an ecologist. I study and work very closely with species at risk. Once their habitat is gone, there is no possible way we can ever bring the species back. It is a vital time on earth where we can’t afford to make any more wrong decisions. I will continue to strive to preserve the integrity of Ontario’s natural environment. Please don’t let industry win. Please don’t let greed compromise the well-being of these vulnerable species.

Dear Sir/Madam,
RE: ERO # 013-4143, MECP’s 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper
When enacted, the Endangered Species Act , 2007 (ESA) was considered to be a ‘Gold Standard’ for protecting Ontario’s 243 species at risk.  However, protections were soon significantly weakened by the Liberal Ontario Government in 2013 when it approved a large number of exemptions to Ontario Regulation 242/08 to allow major industrial activities, such as forestry, mining, energy, and residential development, to bypass strict protection standards.  The result was “Overall Benefit” going to industries instead of the species at risk for which the ESA was enacted.  This was a very short-sighted, self-serving, and backward move by the former Liberal Ontario Government.  In the past 40 years, it is estimated that more than 50% if Earth’s wildlife has been lost.  Human industrial activity has much to answer for.  Its detrimental effects on the environment (atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic) are impoverishing most species, including humans, and their future generations, which depend on a healthy natural and biodiverse environment.  The ESA was enacted to protect and recover the most vulnerable species in Ontario and should be enhanced, not weakened.   At this time, 140 of the 243 species at risk are still without recovery strategies.
The Conservative Ontario Government’s proposals outlined in the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks’ Discussion Paper may be interpreted as another move to promote an “open for business” approach to environmental law and policy, while being an assault on protections for species at risk. It will also undermine Ontario’s floral and faunal biodiversity.  The legislation being addressed here is the Endangered Species Act, not an Endangered Business Act.  The disturbing fourth bullet on Page 2 of the Discussion Paper states, “ Increase efficiencies in service delivery for authorization clients”, which can be interpreted by many Ontarians to mean “Speed up the permitting/authorizing of industrial and other types of development at all costs”.  The primary focus must be on protecting and recovering species at risk, not facilitating development at the expense of species at risk.
The Provincial Government/MECP should be promoting strong adherence to the ESA’s original purpose to protect species at risk; should be removing the exemptions to Ontario Regulation 242/08 introduced in 2013; and should be implementing the policies of the ESA in a timely fashion.  It should not be further weakening the law.  Many of the “activities” referred to in the Discussion Paper pose threats to species at risk by allowing their habitats to be damaged or destroyed by harmful development activities.
The following are responses to the questions posed in the Focus sections:
Focus 1:  Landscape approaches
The ESA (c. 6, s.13; and c.6, s.14) already provides for landscape-level planning, in it multi-species recovery strategies, for example.  Therefore, no change to the ESA is required.  The fine-scale of species-specific status assessments, listings, and protections is essential in the law.
Allowing broad-scale authorizations of harmful activities is inappropriate for endangered and threatened species, and wouldn’t serve to address site-specific or species-specific concerns. It would contribute to unwarranted additional risk for imperilled species. Therefore, do not introduce broad-scale authorizations.
Focus 2:  Listing process and protections
COSSARO’s science-based listing and automatic protections of species at risk are cornerstones of the ESA and must be retained.  The ESA allows a clear approach to listing based on best available scientific information from highly credible and independent experts.  The ESA allows a COSSARO listing to be reviewed if there is no”credible scientific information” to support the listing of that species.  Therefore, respect and retain the science-based, independent process for listing.
Automatic species and habitat protections must stay in place, and must not be subjected to ministerial discretion/interference to remove or delay protections.  Politics should not be allowed to interfere with these protections.
There are years of notice involved in the listing process for species.  Federal COSEWIC listings must be taken into account by COSSARO before it issues its listings.  Improved communications might speed up the listing process; surely, modern technology can be used to speed up the process.
Focus 3:  Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
Reasons for timeline challenges have to be analyzed and addressed, as they are the main reasons for delayed implementation of recovery policies and habitat regulations.  These implementation issues can be addressed without the need for legislative changes.  No legislative change should be required to ensure Government Response Statements (GRS) are produced within nine months of the release of Recovery Strategies under the ESA.  Timelines need to be met.  Sufficient staff and funding should be made available for this.
The required five-year reporting on progress is reasonable and is needed for transparency and accountability.  It is necessary for assessing effectiveness, and contributes to learning and adaptive management.  Therefore, retain this reporting requirement.
Additional reporting requirements to propel ongoing action and monitoring beyond the first five years would make sense, and should be legislated.  Therefore, consider a longer monitoring period.
No change to the law is required to delay the development of, or to not proceed with, a habitat regulation, as the ESA permits the Minister to take these actions.
No changes should be made to the legal provisions for habitat regulations; they give extra certainty for ESA implementation and enforcement.  They afford a significant opportunity for protection and recovery efforts to be extended beyond areas where species at risk are currently found.
Focus 4:  Authorization Processes
No further authorization mechanisms are required in the ESA and there are already sufficient mechanisms.  The purpose of the ESA is to protect and recover species at risk, not facilitate development by industrial and development proponents by permitting them to carry out activities harmful to species at risk.  Therefore, do not provide additional authorization mechanisms in the ESA.
The current requirements to provide on-the-ground, overall benefit to species that are harmed should be retained.  Do not allow proponents of harmful activities to simply pay into a conservation fund, which reduces their responsibility for harmful activities.
The requirements for permits for projects that “result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario” and will not”jeopardize the survival or recovery of species in Ontario” should be retained and the permits should be issued only in exceptional circumstances.  Therefore, retain the current authorization requirements for sec. 17(2)d permits.
Make the requirements for exemptions through regulation more stringent by amending the law to ensure that exemptions are based on providing an overall benefit to species at risk and cannot harm their survival or recovery.  Therefore, do not simplify requirements for exemptions through regulation.
Strengthen the protections for species at risk by repealing the sweeping exemptions approved by the Liberal Government Cabinet in 2013, which have allowed harmful industrial activities to proceed, many of which violate ESA protections.
Give enforcement officers the authority to inspect exempted activities routinely to ensure compliance with legal requirements.
Transparency and accountability need to be improved.  Therefore, amend the exemption regulation (242/08) to require all proponents of harmful activities to submit their mitigation plans and annual reports to the government, and make sure that these are available to the public.
The ESA does not need to be changed to to harmonize it with other legislative or regulatory frameworks as the ESA already provides a means to do this.
This ESA Review Discussion Paper raises one especially serious concern.  It appears to favour the interests of industries and development proponents instead of concentrating on strengthening the ESA and implementing its goals to protect and recover species at risk in a timely manner.   The comment made by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario on page 248 of her 2017 report on environmental protection, “The MNRF has utterly failed to implement the law effectively”, is telling.  The MECP needs to find meaningful and workable “efficiencies” to strengthen the ESA and its implementation.   It is encouraging to see, on p. 50 of Ontario’s Environment Plan, that the Ontario Government is committed to “Reaffirm our commitment to protect species at risk and their habitats, as we mark the 10th anniversary of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act. We are committed to ensuring that the legislation provides stringent protections for species at risk, while continuing to work with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of the program.”  One sincerely hopes this government will prioritize the protection and recovery of species at risk, not the facilitation of development projects which threaten species at risk.  The existing protections legislated by the Endangered Species Act, 2007 must be stringently enforced.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments.

22006,/comment/22006,"Re: EBR 013-4143: 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act
1. Landscape Approaches
The legislation should not be changed to promote landscape approaches in place of species-specific approaches.  Species-specific status assessments, listings and protections are essential.  The ESA already provides recognition for landscape-level approaches when appropriate.  No change to the law is required for this purpose.
With respect to the suggestion of issuing authorizations for harmful activities at a broad scale, this approach is not appropriate for endangered and threatened species.  Working at a broad scale would not properly address site-specific or species-specific concerns.  Such an approach therefore, would present unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.
2. Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
Science-based listing and the automatic protection of designated species are essential aspects of the ESA.  These requirements must remain fully in effect.  There should be no change to the listing process and the role of COSSARO. The law sets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of “the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.” (sec. 5(3)).
In its listing process, COSSARO is required to consider species listed by the federal Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.  There thorough notice requirements built into this process, from the release of COSEWIC status reports to the listing by COSSARO.  The process leading to designation is already lengthy enough.  No further delay is required.  Introduction of Ministerial discretion would not improve the process.
3.  Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
It is not necessary to change to the legal requirement to produce Government Response Statements (GRS) within nine months of the release of Recovery Strategies (sec. 11(8)).  Rather than changing the legal requirement, the province should provide the resources that would enable staff to meet the necessary dates.
The required five-year reporting on progress is reasonable and ensures transparency and accountability. It provides an impetus for action, ensuring that effectiveness is assessed, and contributes to institutional learning and adaptive management.  Furthermore, the government should legislate additional reporting requirements (e.g., every five years) to drive ongoing action and monitoring for periods beyond the initial five years.
The ESA already allows the Minister to delay the development of a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)b) or to not proceed with a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)c). Therefore, it is not necessary to change this part of the act.
There should be no changes to the legal provisions for habitat regulations, which describe specific boundaries or features of areas deemed to be habitat and provide enhanced certainty for ESA implementation and enforcement. They can include areas where a species “used to live or is believed to be capable of living” (sec. 55(3)b), presenting a significant opportunity for protection and recovery efforts to extend beyond places where species at risk currently persist.
4. Authorization Processes
The ESA already provides ample flexibility.  It is important to note that the legislation under review is the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act.  One of the purposes of this legislation is “To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.”  Protecting species at risk must remain the top priority during the current review process.
The current legislation provides sufficient authorization tools.  The authorization process must be taken seriously, as the overall intent is to protect species at risk.  The province should allocate sufficient resources so that staff may conduct their reviews in a timely manner.
It is not appropriate to simplify the requirements for a permit under s. 17(2)d.  These permits are intended only for projects having significant social or economic benefit, and that will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario.  Current requirements ensure that such permits are issued only on an exceptional basis.
It is not appropriate to introduce new exemptions.  The current review should strengthen protection for species at risk by repealing the sweeping exemptions for industry and development that were approved by Cabinet in 2013.  These exemptions are allowing harmful activities to proceed, contrary to the purpose of the act.
Where exemptions are granted, transparency and accountability must be enhanced by amending the exemption regulation (242/08) to require all proponents of harmful activities to automatically submit their mitigation plans and annual reports to the government and to ensure that these are publicly available.
As previously recommended by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, the ESA should be amended to give enforcement officers the power to conduct compliance inspections.
The ESA (sec. 18) already provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. No legislative change is needed. This is an implementation issue.

22008,/comment/22008,"I would like to comment on the wording of the regulations pertaining to threatened species.
I am a farmer and landowner, and I have seen a few species of birds on my land over the years. I would think many of the species at risk are on private land in Ontario. Some species thrive in some agriculture ecosytems. I see Bobolinks and Ellis sparrows and they reproduce well in grass hay fields that resemble the native prairie grasslands.
I pride myself that over thirty years the populations have increased here.
But as a farmer, I cringe when reading the regulations. As a farmer nearing retirement I would never call the biologists at the MNR and tell them I have threatened species on my land. I told my wife I was going to comment on this forum and she looked at me as if I had lost my mind. I said there a few things that are bothering me and would like to see the world a little better place than when we came into it. I feel most farmers are like that, but economics are also a reality.
When the wording of the regulations indicate that ""habitat will be protected"" it indicates that a farmer could lose control of her property and most farmers have all their retirement plans based on their farm value.  The regulations indicate that if the farmer is enrolled in an Ontario Enviromental Farm plan, there could be compensation but in reality those small compensations mean nothing when farmland is in the $5,000 to $20,000 per acre market and a protected area could involve 30 or 40 acres in a middle of a farm. Retiring farmers need that asset for health care costs, drug costs, hospital care, or old age care facilities. Farmers don't have pensions or benefits.
That is not to say that farmers would not protect these species. I think they would, especially if biologists educated them and they did not feel threatened by provincial regulations.
Now I have some other points that possibly may sound very unlike a farmer. As I read the list od plant species on the threatened list, I saw many I had never heard of. But to be honest I never looked in my woods when I walk through it. They could be there, but who knows? No one told me. How many species are threatened because land owners don't know about them? Today farmers are clearing many woodlots and fence rows that could contain these species...who know? Perhaps there should be a permit system for clearing land, and biologists should first inspect the forested area before permits are given.
There are land holding companies in my area clearing thousands of acres of land. The land is then rented to large cash croppers who also tear up the old hay fields that fed beef cattle for decades. These are fields where the Bobolink hatched young. There is a problem here, and I'm sure you can see it. The large land holding companies are often pension funds and wealthy share holders from outside of Ontario. They rent the land to a farmer and get 75% rebate on property taxes.
Another problem is that the large land companies are getting a huge tax break from Revenue Canada to clear the land under  Farm Improvements that are not capitalized, but treated as an expense in the year the land owner wishes to use it to decrease a large non farm income. It can be used 100% or held back for decades. It definitely is a benefit to wealthy investors to clear forest.
For instance I have an older widow that owns a 60 acres behind my home farm. It was basically unimproved land that a few Sandhill Cranes hatch young each year on. Migrating Sandhill cranes are drawn to them and approximately 5,000 cranes land on our farms here. I've never asked her to sell it to me because to be frank, I'm nearing retirement age myself. I have ten acres of Boreal forest next to forty acres of her Boreal forest. It has bears and Timber Wolves travel through it because it is a corridor for wildlife. But she is facing a municipal drain cost and I suspect she will sell the land to pay the cost despite she is not benefiting from the drain. The land companies will buy that land and it will be cleared in a week.  I can protect my ten acres but it will no longer be a corridor for wildlife which is sad.
I hope I gave a few insights.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ESA review discussion paper.  Though I support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal.  On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
-Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry hydro, mining and development industries;
-Amend section 57 (1) of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
-Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;

Accessibility therefore is an issue that must be kept in mind. The permit and application process must be clear and understandable for applicants. It should include definitions of key scientific or legal terms that applicants might be unfamiliar with where applicable to ensure a fair authorization process. In addition, because authorization processes include activities that would not otherwise be allowed on the Endangered Species Act, there is potential for unexpected environmental/economic/social consequences resulting from these activities which would require close monitoring. There must be a legislative framework in place to ensure compliance of these activities with other regulations. The different provisions under the Endangered Species Act that would allow for these extraneous activities must be spelled clearly and specifically in order to ensure that applicants and legislators understand what types of activities would be safe and appropriate and in what circumstances. Deciding what activities merit approval and authorization might not be a clear-cut process, therefore having an appropriate team or committee of workers of diverse backgrounds should help ensure that the authorization process is conducted in a fair and objective manner.

- Maintaining that every species gets assessed by COSSARO, and if necessary receives a science-based Recovery or Management Strategy, a Government Response Statement and a Progress Report within existing mandated timelines. Any ""landscape approach"" must exist over and above species-specific regulations.
- Maintaining science-based listing by COSSARO, and abandoning the idea of allowing ministerial discretion regarding habitat and species protection under section 9 and section 10 of the ESA

- Requiring all proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground, monitored and enforced overall benefit to impacted species and abandoning your proposal to create an option for such proponents to pay into a conservation fund to compensate for conducting activities that are harmful to species at risk

- Amending section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and/or recovery of Endangered and Threatened species

22020,/comment/22020,"Memorandum
Background
The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been in place since 2007. The province recently initiated
a review of the legislation, and has released a Discussion Paper outlining the history of the Act,
how it is administered and the goal of the review. It also outlined four key areas where
comment is sought:
- Landscape approaches;
- Listing processes and protections for species at risk (SAR);
- Species recovering policies and habitat regulations;
- Authorization processes.
This memo documents comments from IO in response to these four key areas, as well as
providing input on other topics that have arisen during our work related to specie at risk.
Area of Focus #1: Landscape Approaches
The Discussion Paper raises the prospect of using a landscape approach as a new tool for
handling SAR within a specific geographic area or ecosystem where the needs of multiple SAR
can be addressed.
Currently, SAR habitat is protected case by case and is species specific. IO generally agrees that
having a second option of using a landscape approach would be useful. Situations where this
might be helpful include unique and/or rare habitats and habitats that provide a corridor for
species movement. Using the landscape approach would have the added benefit of reducing
the potential fragmentation of habitats by protecting a large tracts of land rather than much
smaller areas that result when using the species specific habitat protection approach.
If the landscape approach is pursued, the Province may pursue proactive assessments of large
scale greenspaces to better understand which areas are suitable habitat for consideration as a
protected landscape. IO manages large tracts of undeveloped land in the form of landbanks, but
does not have the resources or expertise to oversee and protect such lands. It is advisable that
landscapes targeted for protection are integrated into the existing provincial conservation
system with care and control of these lands the responsibility of the appropriate Ministry
(currently the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks).
Area of Focus #2: Listing Process and Protections for SAR
The Discussion Paper considers whether the current process of automatically protecting species and habitats when a new species is identified is clear and transparent, and appropriate given the competing interests in some habitats.
IO is not aware of any formal notification process within the Provincial government regarding the listing of new species. IO encourages the development of such a process if it does not currently exist.
Caution should be taken when considering options other automatic protections for SAR and their habitats once identified as threatened or endangered. The identification of a new SAR requires significant scientific research and such decisions are not taken frivolously. However, it is also recognized that the unexpected identification of a newly listed species can significantly impact a project’s timelines and budget. Consideration should be given to how best to balance the protection of newly identified species with the implications of such decisions on projects that are underway. For instance,
- Identifying species with a high potential for future protection to help those planning large scale projects consider the risks of future protection on implementation;
- Phasing protection measures for species that currently have healthy but significantly declining populations (e.g. avian insectivores);
- Grandfathering provisions for projects that are tendered and/or underway.
Area of Focus #3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
The Discussion Paper examines the timing of government responses to the identification of a new species and whether the replacement of a general habitat statement with a habitat regulation is required in all instances.
IO is engaged in the implementation of the ESA only, and the processes that lead up to the identification of a new species and its protection have little impact on its business. However, IO does recognize that the identification of specific habitat in the form of a habitat regulation can provide added certainty to IO and its clients when planning large scale developments.
Area of Focus #4: Authorization Processes
The Discussion Paper examines the burden that the current permitting and authorization processes puts on projects and proposes exploring new tools such as paying into conservation funds and using strategic or collaborative approaches, and investigating efficiencies within the existing frameworks.
In IO’s experience, the timing of review and permitting processes are unpredictable , and often time consuming. It presently can take a year or more to receive a permit once an application is made. Efforts to increase efficiencies and consistency in the review and approvals process would be welcomed. Suggestions include:
- Streamlining the application and approvals process;
- Delegating the signing of permits to a director or district manager level
- Developing performance metrics on application processing timelines could be considered to help to determine how the process can be further streamlined.
Exploring alternatives to the current permitting and authorization processes is appropriate and encouraged, but only if a monitoring component is built into the processes to determine their success in providing an overall benefit to the SAR and its recovery. Without this monitoring component, significant funds may be wasted and species put at further risk unnecessarily. Examples of alternatives that might be considered include:
- Leveraging existing organizations who engage in habitat enhancement, protection and development to implement compensation programs on behalf of others (e.g. Conservation Authorities, non-governmental organizations such as Bird Studies Canada). Providing opportunities to engage a partner that has a proven track record and expertise in the areas of habitat compensation will result in sustainable funding to those organizations and more successful compensation programming in the long run. A good example of this type of partnership is the engagement of conservation authorities in the delivery of butternut compensation programs.
- Collecting fees from projects commensurate with the level of impact on SAR and/or SAR habitat and investing that funding strategically to larger scale landscape or watershed protection or improvement projects. This could be both less costly for the applicant and more effective towards species protection and enhancement.
- Providing more options for habitat compensation. In many instances, habitat enhancement and/or creation can be completed at a significantly lower cost than protection measures. In such instances, not only are funds used more effectively but they may ultimately result in a greater overall area of suitable habitat for the target species. Completing a cost accounting comparing the level of expected outcomes vs the cost of implementing the permitting requirements could be a tool to determine support the decision to develop and apply a compensation project instead of straight protection measures.
Other:
Streamlined Approaches:
IO appreciates the streamlined approaches that have been developed for some species that are threatened and/or endangered, such as the process for altering a structure that is habitat for the barn swallow. These approaches provide a clear process to follow that allows sufficient certainty to effectively plan their budget and schedule. IO encourages these streamlined approaches to be revisited and updated regulatory based on the developing science.
IO also encourages the addition of more detail with regards to the monitoring elements of streamlined approaches. The benefit of monitoring the programs is to develop a better understanding of their success and to adapt the process accordingly. Without clear guidance on the monitoring requirements, monitoring programs implemented by different groups could result in findings that are not comparable, thus limiting the data that can be used to determine the success/failure of the program or identify ways to improve it.
Best Management Practices:
Best management practices to address impacts to species at risk are often not available or documented, especially for newly listed species. This can lead to delays in the application, review and approval processes, as well as inconsistent treatment of applications by the regulator. This can result in significant impacts to project budgets and schedules.
Ideally, best management practices would be developed and made available before a species is listed. Once established, the best management practices should be applied consistently as a means of streamlining the process. The requirements for each species should to be clear, consistent and quantifiable.
Habitat Compensation Lands:
IO manages a significant portfolio of undeveloped lands that may be suitable for habitat compensation. Where these lands are non-viable or undevelopable, there may be opportunities for the Province to work together to identify which lands may be suitable for habitat compensation and market them as such to third parties.

I also believe there needs to be proper consensus between neighboring countries on what species are considered endangered or threatened. What I mean is that in a country a species can be endangered but in it's neighboring country that species is stable, therefore the question arises whether or not we should put resources into saving a species that is doing well next door to us.

-The government should legislate additional reporting requirements (e.g., every five years) to drive ongoing action and monitoring beyond the first five years.

-Do not simplify requirements for exemptions through regulation. On the contrary, make the requirements more stringent by amending the law (sec. 57) to ensure that exemptions are premised on providing an overall benefit to species at risk and cannot jeopardize their survival or recovery.
-Strengthen protections for species at risk by repealing the sweeping exemptions for industry and development (forestry, hydro, mining, aggregate extraction, and more) approved by Cabinet in 2013. The 2013 exemptions have become the primary means for allowing harmful activities to proceed.

    One of the act’s main challenges is that it adds delay towards activities subject to other regulatory framework such as Ontario’s Crown Forest Sustainability Act. Instead of delaying such activities and causing complications, finishing an activity in progress should be done first, unless a species needs urgent protection for Ontario’s Endangered Species Act to be prioritized.
    Another problem is that enforcing regulations across all Ontario is inconsistent, thus, severely taxing companies producing more waste than they’re permitted to is very important. There needs to be certain guidelines enforced so that it's fair across Ontario.

22026,/comment/22026,"The recently proposed updates to Ontario’s Endangered Species Act need to be reanalyzed for numerous reasons, some of which I will address below. Area Of Focus 2 – Listing process and protections for species at risk, proposes changes that would be detrimental to numerous species and is a terrible example of the morals and goals exemplified by Canada – a leader in the green movement. The review mentions an alternative approach to automatic species and habitat protections, however, this would simply allow companies a grace period to complete the impending damage before the protections were to come into place. At that point, the damage caused to the environment would already be done and the protections would be less effective and would need to be directed more towards restoration than protection or maintenance. Removing automatic protections when a species is added to the registry would put all species at risk – even those not yet deemed at risk. The article had also mentioned the difficulties reading and understanding the protections currently in place, and issues regarding a supposed lack of public notice before a new species is automatically listed on the Species at Risk Ontario Registry. The system currently in place for notification and information organization is thorough. It is my professional opinion that companies could benefit from an environmental translator to better understand the policies currently in place and what that means for potential projects that could affect newly or previously inhabited/protected areas. It is a requirement, in Canada’s own literature – that we must use the precautionary principle where there may be potential for damage to public or environment (Morris, 2019). We must prevent the damage before it occurs. Removing automatic protections for species at risk mean that we are opening a pocket for destruction and pollution of environments leaving them beyond repair before restrictions come into place. We have the knowledge, and technology. Removing automatic protections would imply that business takes president over the environmental views that We - as a country supposedly exemplify. We are responsible to conserve the species and their environments. It is our responsibility. Do not be the reason that more animals become at risk, endangered, or go extinct.

22035,/comment/22035,"As a conservation biology student from the University of Toronto, I would like to comment on how the protection of species at risk can be enhanced. To begin with, the extensive implementation of case-by-case and species-specific policies reduces the protection of certain species at risk since these approaches tend to restrict or interfere with the protection of other species of the same habitat. Species at risk that rely on wide-ranged habitats may require a landscape approach that is a able to conserve these species at a larger scale. Landscape approaches should be extensively implemented over case-by-case and species-specific approaches because it is more effective in areas where multiple species at risk can be managed and protected. A study conducted by Lesbarrères et al., regarding the conservation of amphibians and reptiles listed as at-risk by COSEWIC, explores the challenges of successfully and effectively conserving these species and possible solutions to these challenges. One of the challenges encountered was that the habitat selection studies were mostly conducted at small spatial scales even though these herpetofauna occupy a wide-range of habitats in northern Canada (Lesbarrères et al., 2014). The authors of this article had suggested that approaches which correlate habitat selection to fitness, and are conducted at a large spatial scale (landscape approaches) would be effective in determining suitable habitats for conservation (Lesbarrères et al., 2014). In addition, the authors had proposed that further research and advancements in analytics regarding the understanding of evolutionary potential and dynamics of edge-of-range populations is necessary to achieve future conservation goals (Lesbarrères et al., 2014). New advancements in analytical tools have been proven to be helpful in determining suitable habitats for conservation, as they have allowed conservation biologists to determine source and sink population dynamics, population histories, reactions caused by environmental change from the past (Lesbarrères et al., 2014). All in all, the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks should make amendments to the Endangered Species which allows for the landscape approaches and conservations solutions proposed by Lesbarrères et al., to be implemented.

22036,/comment/22036,"Re: 10th year review of the Endangered Species Act
I grew up on a small farm in southern Ontario. For the past five years, I have been studying the rare and endangered plant species of southern Ontario’s forests and talking to the landowners who own these forests. I am very concerned that the current review and proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act will counteract the very reason the Act was enacted: to promote recovery of species that are in danger of being extirpated from Ontario.
From the Act itself:
The purposes of this Act are:
1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.
2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.
3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.
My main concerns are as follows:
(1) Species listed as endangered or threatened by COSSARO are already in great danger of becoming extirpated. In NO circumstances would these species benefit from extending the timeline for the development of Recovery Strategies and Government Response Statements. From the Act: “A species shall be classified as an endangered species if it lives in the wild in Ontario but is facing imminent extinction or extirpation.” These species cannot wait for action. Lengthening or doing away with timelines would be counter to the purpose of the Act.
(2) The plants that I study live in the highly reduced and fragmented forests of southern Ontario. This landscape was once over 80% forested, but now in some counties less than 10% of the land area is forested. For those species with only a few populations left, protecting the forests in which they live is necessary to prevent their extinction. Any activity that would result in the destruction of their habitat results in further losses and prevents recovery. Not providing automatic protections to threatened and endangered species and their habitat would make the Act completely ineffective.
(3) The 2013 exemptions to the Act’s permit requirements have already weakened habitat protections and allowed a proliferation of authorizations to harm the species the Act was meant to protect, as reported in the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario’s 2017 Environmental Protection Report. Further weakening of authorization requirements will only lead to worse outcomes for species at risk. In order to protect species at risk, development that threatens them and their habitat must be prevented, not facilitated.
(4) The plants and animals that have lived in Ontario for thousands of years are unique parts of our Natural Heritage. Most landowners I interviewed in southern Ontario say they value species at risk, and agree that regulations are necessary to help protect them. In a survey of 1,000 Canadians, 89% agreed that it is important to prevent the extinction of wild plants and animals in Canada, and 80% agreed with the need to limit industrial activities in certain areas in order to protect endangered species (see web link).

I can tell you with confidence that the ESA has been sorely needed, but it's not enough.  There are so many Provincially Rare Species that are not protected by the ESA that are in decline.  Moreover, there are so many Provincially Rare Habitat Types that are not covered by the ESA that are being lost.  It's not enough to only protect ""official"" Species At Risk.
Furthermore, even when those official Species At Risk are protected under the ESA, there is very little oversight and enforcement by government agencies (mostly municipal and regional governments) when Species At Risk or their habitats are damaged.  For example, Niagara Region has the richest, most biodiverse natural habitats in the country, but their municipal and regional governments and their conservation authority do little to nothing to enforce the ESA.  Niagara Region is losing SAR and Provincially Rare Species left and right because of a disinterested, incompetent municipal and regional work force steeped in nepotism.
The ESA needs more enforcement and oversight now!
As well, the province and each municipality needs an invasive species strategy to actively control the spread of invasive species in the province.  The spread of invasive species is one of the greatest threats to the survival of SAR.

- relax government timelines on protection and recovery of habitat and/or species
- allow government to override processes and timelines that don't fit within the government mandate/timeline
- increase timelines to act on Species at Risk
- put businesses and making money as first priority, habitat and species be damned

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Endangered Species Act review discussion paper. As an Ontario sheep farmer, I appreciate the importance of preserving biodiversity on my farm and the complexity of doing so.
Given my experience with species at risk I propose the following recommendations:
Recovery strategies should be developed through a holistic lens that includes the impact on other species in the area and an economic impact analysis before (not after).
    I would submit that the timeline allowed to develop a recovery strategy be flexible to allow for enough scientific review of the information available and evidenced-based strategy development.
    The entire process from identifying animals as endangered right through to the strategy development process should also be more inclusive bringing in ecologist, farmers. I believe this would lead to better outcomes and help create a collaborative environment with more sustainable outcomes.
    The process of identifying species at risk should be more transparent. I would recommend that a list of animals be published that indicates where they are in terms of population numbers (as is currently done with birds). This could help us be more proactive and potentially proactively implement habitat protection strategies before they are determined to be species at risk.

The main issue with this legislation is the undermining aspect of how the constitution would trump all decision making in regards to species at risk. This act does not hold any weight federally and there should be a nation-wide agreement in order to protect the biodiversity of Canada. In regards to the specifics, endangered species should be looked on a higher taxonomic order, which would preserve diversity and would be much easier to identify when protecting. Furthermore, this act should be treated as more important than certain economic endeavors that destroy a lot of habitats such as mining, pipelines, and urban sprawl. There should be more areas such as the greenbelt to protect urban sprawling from expanding, and furthermore, strong legislation to prevent the destruction of the protected areas.

22050,/comment/22050,"Habitat fragmentation and isolation is considered one of the major drivers of species endangerment and extinction. Without continuity between habitats, habitats will shrink in size and become more environmentally and biologically homogenized. This decrease in habitat diversity will put pressure on certain species, especially those that are specialized to live within very particular conditions. As a result, species adapted to live under a wide range of conditions will dominate new homogenized habitats and push out those species with narrow tolerance ranges. Isolating habitats from one another could also impede species migrations and species interactions which could not only be detrimental to individuals within the species but could also reduce genetic variability within populations as individuals become increasingly cut off from one another. Decreasing genetic variability due to a reduction in gene flow will increase the occurrence of inbreeding and will lead to inbreeding depression within a population over time.  Decreasing habitat fragmentation and isolation will increase habitat heterogeneity and provide species with the means to protect themselves thereby reducing the chances of endangerment and the need for human intervention. Habitat fragmentation can be reduced by interventions such as migration corridors and gradients at regional scales.

This suggested change contradicts both the intended purpose of the ESA and the positive associations between a region's biodiversity and its economic potential. The ESA's primary purpose is to protect Ontario's environmental wealth, as represented by a diverse set of species, habitats and ecosystems. It is impossible to achieve the intended goal of the ESA without setting some limits on industrial development. Wild areas must be preserved, conserved, maintained and even expanded. The future of this province and country rests on the ability of ecosystems to continue to support vital services, including: clean drinking water, carbon sequestration, eco-tourism and agricultural output. Deregulated expansion of industrial activities and land conversion will absolutely compromise these vital ecological services. I urge this government to abandon changes to the ESA that would compromise its ability to protect species and habitats at-risk, and focus on changes that set informed and achievable conservation goals. I submit these comments as both a professional ecologist and citizen who is proud to call Ontario home.
As a final note, I would urge the government to fully disclose ALL proposed changes to provincial legislation BEFORE implementing them, such that public input can be maximized and the full ramifications of the changes can be analyzed and fully understood by all.

22056,/comment/22056,"1.	Landscape-level Protection
Ontario needs to change its current approach for conservation. Rather than protecting individual species, Ontario needs to protect landscapes rather than individual species. Switching to a landscape-style conservation program is more efficient and cost-effective, and arguably more effective than our current species-based approach.
What is landscape-style protection? Instead of protecting a species in a particular area, we focus on protecting a larger area. For example, we protect a river valley, a length of connected woodland, or a watershed. In doing this we can protect multiple species and habitats. We protect corridors used by species to disperse, forage, and migrate. Corridors are becoming increasingly important as a method for species to respond to pressures associated with climate change. In addition, protecting larger areas we conserve population variability for multiple species. This allows species to maintain genetic diversity. If there is genetic diversity, a species may be able to adapt to climate change through new mutations or phenotypic plasticity. As well, genetic diversity prevents reduced fitness that may occur in small isolated populations due to inbreeding.
Finally, we protect the many ecosystem services required both by humans and by the species living within the protected areas. These services include clean air, erosion protection, carbon storage in above- and below-ground biomass, and buffering against rapid nutrient loading into watersheds (via passing more slowly through the soil and being taken up by plants along the way).
2.	Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness
There is too much uncertainty involved in protecting single species. We must research the species, write assessments, monitor the species, review the status of the species, and make changes if needed. This approach has led to a backlog of species waiting to be assessed. There is simply not enough time to address each species. There is a better option provided by landscape-scale protection.
3.	Keeping the Land Natural
One last comment relates to human access. We need to reduce human impacts on our protected areas. Ever visit one of Ontario’s major parks? Algonquin maybe? Ever notice how developing protected areas into “tourist sites” tends to create more harm than good for these areas? Do not advertise the new protected areas. Do not develop them into tourist attractions with parking lots, roads, visitor centres, and guided activities. They can allow backcountry-style camping and low-impact use such as hiking and canoeing. This way people can still appreciate the areas without placing too much pressure on the ecosystem. Thank you for considering my comments. I am looking forward to an improved conservation strategy for Ontario.

22058,/comment/22058,"Dear ERO Review Committee,
Strategies:
Create migration corridors
Span elevation and latitudinal gradients
Impact:
Migration corridors can have a powerful impact in protecting endangered species because they allow more effective dispersion and migration. This creates greater exchange of genetic material between isolated individuals which protects the genetic variability in these populations. Genetic variability should be protected because is vital in allowing allowing species to adapt and recover from disturbances such as disease and climate change. Greater variability will allow endangered species to have greater phenotypic plasticity, and the potential for rapid evolution in response to change.
When protecting areas, elevation and latitudinal gradients should be considered so that population interactions across these gradients are maintained. Additionally, species which use different zones depending on seasonality would benefit greatly from a conservation approach that considered their habitat at different times of the year. A latitudinal gradient conservation approach would also allow migration of populations in response to climate change, thereby reducing the potential impacts that climate change would have.
Implementation:
A landscape approach where the focus lies on maintaining the ecosystem function will be more effective than simply considering the direct species interaction structure. If you protect the ecosystem function, then you will also have captured the important aspects of the ecosystem structure. An example of a migration corridor is the Mandai Eco-Link bridge in Singapore (link attached). This is relevant in Canada where transportation paths divide species ranges and isolate populations. These structures could be an effective strategy, if implemented to protect ecosystem function, to mitigate impacts of anthropogenic activity.
Similarly, protecting areas that span various climatic zones such as: a section of prairie land from its southern range to its transitions to tundra, or following the path of a river as it spans different latitude, or a mountain range as it changes in elevation and latitude can be hugely important in protecting ecosystem function.
In conclusion, protecting species alone is not as environmentally effective or cost effective as a landscape approach which considers the ecosystem functions that protect the threatened species as well as all of the interactions which maintain it.

22060,/comment/22060,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the discussion paper on the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Ontario is home to over 200 species at risk, with many taxa still not thoroughly reviewed. The ESA was created to protect species, and the legislation has been used to do so since its implementation in 2008.
Area of Focus 1-Landscape Approaches
Recovery activities focusing on specific landscapes or ecosystems can be beneficial for numerous species. However, this approach must be species dependent and decided by experts, as certain species at risk require very specific recovery strategies (e.g. Butternut canker).
Area of Focus 2-Listing Process
I disagree with any change to the automatic listing of SAR after review by COSSARO. As the panel is comprised of up to 12 experts using the best available science along with TEK, their decisions are sound. I do not believe that the COSSARO review an assessment process requires any change or delay.
Area of Focus 3-Species Recovery Policies
As opposed to delaying Government Response Statements, I believe that a commitment should be made to publishing recovery strategies and other recovery documents in a timely manner. The Spotted Turtle is an example of a species that was assessed as endangered when the ESA took effect in 2008 and a provincial recovery strategy has yet to be written.
Conducting 5-year assessments of progress on recovery are essential. They not only allow us to use the documents that took numerous hours and tax dollars to create and review but to use current scientific literature to determine if the species are continuing to decline.
I believe that habitat regulation is not required for all species at risk but this is a topic that should be handled on a case by case basis and decided by experts on the species being considered. Species with very few populations in Ontario should have mandated habitat regulation as they are the most vulnerable to future habitat loss and development pressure. I also believe habitat regulation in the Carolinian zone be mandated given the lack of natural habitat left in this area.
Area of Focus 4-Authorization Processes
I encourage the government to develop standard overall benefit actions that provide a tangible benefits to the species in question and an overall benefit to the species on the ground as opposed to research funding.
I strongly oppose the changes to obtaining a D permit. This is a last resort where there is overwhelming social or economic benefit and the obtaining of a D permit should not be handled lightly. In the case that a D permit is granted, the mitigation expended on SAR should be significant.
Forestry under Ontario’s Crown Forest Sustainability Act should not be exempt from the ESA. Crown land should be protecting habitat for species and permitting public access to these natural areas.
Aboriginal Significance
In indigenous communities throughout Ontario, animals and plants have various cultural and spiritual values. The ESA recognizes these beliefs and works with First Nations communities in order to protect these species and the habitats they live in. The strength of the current ESA allows for this and any changes to lessen the protection of species at risk would negatively affect the species themselves and the first nations communities that rely heavily on them for medicines and food sources and their cultural and spiritual values.
Economic Benefits
The habitats species at risk reside in provide economic benefits to nearby cities. As an example, wetlands prevent major flooding, filter water and indirectly provide food sources as species such as bear, waterfowl and moose rely on wetlands as food and water sources (EPA 2006).
In summary, I strongly support the current ESA. It is a powerful piece of legislation that can protect our rarest species and the habitats they live in. I strongly disagree with any proposal to change the ESA that would weaken this. If anything were to be changed, a more rigorous process should be created by the government preceding the approval of an overall benefit to ensure that the species affected are truly receiving an overall benefit. Sustainable developments and conservation are possible, but require more work upfront to ensure species protection as well as economic benefits.

I also believe habitat regulation in the Carolinian zone be mandated given the lack of natural habitat left in this area.
Area of Focus 4-Authorization Processes
I encourage the government to develop standard overall benefit actions that provide a tangible benefits to the species in question and an overall benefit to the species on the ground as opposed to research funding.
I strongly oppose the changes to obtaining a D permit. This is a last resort where there is overwhelming social or economic benefit and the obtaining of a D permit should not be handled lightly. In the case that a D permit is granted, the mitigation expended on SAR should be significant.
Forestry under Ontario’s Crown Forest Sustainability Act should not be exempt from the ESA. Crown land should be protecting habitat for species and permitting public access to these natural areas.
Aboriginal Significance
In indigenous communities throughout Ontario, animals and plants have various cultural and spiritual values. The ESA recognizes these beliefs and works with First Nations communities in order to protect these species and the habitats they live in. The strength of the current ESA allows for this and any changes to lessen the protection of species at risk would negatively affect the species themselves and the first nations communities that rely heavily on them for medicines and food sources and their cultural and spiritual values.
Economic Benefits
The habitats species at risk reside in provide economic benefits to nearby cities. As an example, wetlands prevent major flooding, filter water and indirectly provide food sources as species such as bear, waterfowl and moose rely on wetlands as food and water sources (EPA 2006).
In summary, I strongly support the current ESA. It is a powerful piece of legislation that can protect our rarest species and the habitats they live in. I strongly disagree with any proposal to change the ESA that would weaken this. If anything were to be changed, a more rigorous process should be created by the government preceding the approval of an overall benefit to ensure that the species affected are truly receiving an overall benefit. Sustainable developments and conservation are possible, but require more work upfront to ensure species protection as well as economic benefits.

22063,/comment/22063,"To whom it may concern,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Endangered Species Act review discussion paper. As an Ontario sheep farmer, I appreciate the importance of preserving biodiversity on my farm and the complexity of doing so.
Given my experience with species at risk I propose the following recommendations:
Recovery strategies should be developed through a holistic lens that includes the impact on other species in the area and an economic impact analysis before (not after).
I would submit that the timeline allowed to develop a recovery strategy be flexible to allow for enough scientific review of the information available and evidenced-based strategy development.
The entire process from identifying animals as endangered right through to the strategy development process should also be more inclusive bringing in ecologist, farmers. I believe this would lead to better outcomes and help create a collaborative environment with more sustainable outcomes.
The process of identifying species at risk should be more transparent. I would recommend that a list of animals be published that indicates where they are in terms of population numbers (as is currently done with birds). This could help us be more proactive and potentially proactively implement habitat protection strategies before they are determined to be species at risk.
Thank you again for the opportunity to comment.

22064,/comment/22064,"Humanity has wiped out 60% of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles since 1970 worldwide, some of which have certainly been destroyed here. Each species that is significantly reduced in number or made extinct by human actions has a direct impact on the environment within which they have lived. The primary cause of wildlife decline in Ontario, Canada and globally is habitat loss and degradation - a direct result of ""economic development"" activities that have resulted in hunting to near extinction (particularly of predators who are necessary for a thriving ecosystem), habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, climate change, and pollution of the earth, air and water our wildlife needs to survive (and of course, so do  we!). Scientists generally agree that the most important factors that will help to stop the decline in population of our wildlife (nearly half of all species are in decline at this time) is to stop habitat loss, strengthen environmental regulations, and do whatever is necessary to stop the human impacts on climate change.
Based on this science, I believe that any adjustments to the Endangered Species Act should be with these necessary actions in mind.  We must stop the mentality of ""current economic good"" being more important than either the short or long term health of our province's wildlife and the ecosystem that we all depend on for our survival. What economic benefit ""now"" is worth the tradeoff of destroying our province and our planet in the long-term? Strengthen the Act.  Make it harder for industry to destroy the environment for the sake of corporate greed.  Begin to shift our province's policies towards working with the environment rather than trying to overpower it.

To comment on the ESA review discussion paper, I am writing to strongly support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, but the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.

22068,/comment/22068,"Hi there,
What with Doug Ford's proposition to make changes to the Endangered Species and At-Risk Species act, I would like to be informed as to  how the ESA creates “barriers to economic development?”
Living in a country, and province, which fosters diverse ecosystems will make way for a positive life shared between both humans and animals. Decreasing protection for at-risk animals is quite literally going against our best interest, so I am confused as to how this would result in “positive outcomes.""
I fear this will decrease the public view of Ontario, which is already abysmal, reduce corporate willingness to invest & develop here, and will be an overall setback in Ontario's development.
The world around us is quickly changing for the worse, and ignoring these issues will not make them go away. Global Warming impacts every single human, animal, and plant on Earth; no amount of money can protect you from what is inevitably going to happen. The fact that our own Premier can't even feign concern is terrifying, let alone the fact that he is a wrecking ball through what feeble protections we currently have in place.
Humans have let ourselves get to the point where we shouldn't even be eating animals anymore, as it is in such unsustainable proportions, yet here we are in 2019 with the leader of one of the biggest province's in Canada ready to shoot his population in the head.
I'm sick of living in a province that puts corporate interest above that of the population. It is disgusting and un-Canadian.

22070,/comment/22070,"10 year review of the ESA
Area of Focus 1-landscape approaches
A case by case approach works for individual properties, developments and small areas of habitat. Compensation on an isolated parcel is not ideal. The maintenance of larger areas of contiguous habitat is always preferred, especially for grassland species, interior species and wetland species. However with much of the land in southern Ontario in private hands, maintaining contiguous areas or approving small patches of habitat compensation and protection, may have limited benefit and adjacent land changes may make that protection or compensation in effective in the long run. At a landscape level, achieving sufficient habitat for long term population maintenance or increases in population, even if it concentrates the efforts on more remote areas or areas with less development pressure may work better.
I have found that one species biology is typically not the approach taken under ESA permit negotiations by MNRF, as they will look at multiple species and benefits, eg. bobolink compensation with overall benefit of creating grassland habitat for many bird species.
Focus Area 2:  Listing species is based on a set of science based criteria used by the COSSARO experts. However a more transparent approach to the listing and some warning of the listing is definitely needed. As a environmental consultant, I deal with the ESA on a daily basis and see the impact of new species listings on the public and private sector.
Species such as butternut, eastern meadowlark and bobolink were added to the list very quickly. All of these species have a wide range in Ontario, but with pockets of higher populations. Changes to the populations and decline rates are the triggers for the COSSARO folks and the listing, but putting them from Not At Risk, suddenly to threatened or endangered should be reviewed more carefully. In some areas of southwest Ontario where agriculture crop changes have had a huge impact on grasslands, to develop in the GTA, it seems that populations are declining across Ontario. In my area (Kawarthas) and in eastern Ontario, they are all very common and in high concentrations as development pressures and farming practices have changed very little over time. As a birdwatcher for over 40 years, the grassland bird population in my area has changed very little.
Habitat protections are important and maintaining the population of species should be a priority.  The species under review for upcoming meetings of the committee are posted, and I do look for those. Although it is difficult to have different approaches for different areas of Ontario or transition policies, more thought needs to be put into listing a species. Putting a species as special concern first and working up the list, as more information comes to light and is documented by biologists doing EIS reports, management plans and research.
The automatic habitat protection is effective in putting the species on the radar. It does have an immediate effect on the number of applications under the ESA for businesses. I do a good number of ESA applications each year for smaller parcels with one or two grassland birds in the urban fringe around Toronto. While the habitat protection has an province wide effort to protect habitats, it includes larger populations of wildlife, as well as small parcels and isolated pockets of marginal habitat.
Focus Area 3: Government responses statements are a necessary tool. In some circumstances, more than 9 months would be beneficial, or we risk not fully understanding the species and the habitat requirements. Habitat regulations and General Habitat Descriptions are especially helpful to  understand what is being protected, the exemptions and the regulations for each species. As a consultant, I use the GHD categories to prepare mapping for my client and MNRF, as well as for determining the Categories. Five years is more than adequate to prepare those.  A longer timeline leaves the habitat protection in limbo without clear direction for the public and developers. GHD guidelines is an important tool to ensure enough habitat around a species nesting site is protected and adequate compensation, mitigation measures and overall benefit measures are put in place to limit impacts and separate land uses.
Focus Area 4:  My experience is only with overall benefit permits. The process is onerous and can include a myriad of different compensation, habitat creation and mitigation tools. While it is a long process and expensive for proponents, it does act as a deterrent and gives a chance to protect areas or modify plans. The expense to proponents in part is from the monitoring and habitat creation costs, more than the actual ESA process to obtain the permit.
In other parts of the USA, habitat banking and cash-in-lieu is used, example in Florida. However it is not always without controversy. For my clients, they would love an option like this, where they only have to write a cheque and not deal with the ESA process. It may however be too easy and not effective. Florida collects huge amounts of banking, and takes several thousand acres at once to add to the Big Cypress Swamp federal nature reserve. This involves buying and expropriating lands with the long term goal of preserving a core natural area of several hundred thousand acres of land in central Florida. A good long term habitat block but at the expense of other parcels of habitat that could be preserved, but developers choose to go the banking route instead. For my clients they also want to know where the money is going to  and if they can get some recognition or their name on something, that they can use for PR and advertising their conservation efforts.
Habitat protection and authorizations with MNRF should look at providing the applicant with some direction on the options and land base needed. As it is left up to the applicant and their consultants to propose the mitigation measures and compensation, there is a lot of back and forth. If there was clearer direction on if Category 1 or 2 is possible to remove or is a non-starter, this would eliminate proponents from trying to go into areas they should be avoiding, a limiting their impacts to Category 3 for certain species.
The ESA is always floating above all other policies and approvals and delays a project until an OBP is obtained. This is understandable as until a development has draft approval, it is not guaranteed it will go ahead. The ESA approvals are usually related to specific issues and cannot necessarily be linked with other approvals under ECA or other regulatory approvals.

22078,/comment/22078,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the discussion paper on the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
Ontario is home to over 200 species at risk, and those are only the ones which have been thoroughly reviewed. The ESA was created to protect species because of the value that Ontario holds in being a leader and protector against species at risk and their habitats.
The ministry in regards to ESA implementation is throwing a blind eye to its fundamental responsibility. Holding and valuing a mentality of ""industry first"" diminishes the entire entity of the original ESA created in 2008. The ministry continues to make amendments and create alternatives to regulations that have been put in place to serve and protect our endangered species. We cannot stand by as a society and continue down this path to distraction. Allowing industries this amount of leniency is an injustice when regulations are put in place to avoid harmful and toxic actions.
I believe that a commitment should be made to publishing recovery strategies and other recovery documents in a timely manner. The regulatory exemptions require government assessment and need to continue to be documented. Along side this fact, the public has a right to this information and the proceedings that take place behind closed doors. Often times operations are not required to submit there mitigation plans unless requested to the MNRD. This leaves no opportunity to digest the massive impact their decisions may cause.
In summary, I strongly support the current ESA. It is a powerful piece of legislation that can protect our rarest species and the habitats they live in. I strongly disagree with any proposal to change the ESA that would weaken this. If anything were to be changed, a more rigorous process should be created by the government preceding the approval of an overall benefit to ensure that the species affected are truly receiving an overall benefit. In no shape, way, or form is Ontario a province in which it's overall ecosystem should be put in the shadows. It is our moral obligation as a society to protect continue to be a leader when it is asked upon us and we have the ability and the forces to do so.

22082,/comment/22082,"This draft review is extremely leading and inappropriate. The ESA does need a review as there have been many tools which have been used which have made it less effective, but the Act itself doesn't need to be changed.
- COSSARO should continue to be made up of arms-length scientists with relevant expertise.  They should be given all the resources to be able to do their job properly, without any delays.  The Minister should not interfere with the decisions of the committee. Committee members should be given ample time before their meetings to be able to prepare and gather data from additional stakeholders. I feel the communication before meetings to stakeholders has been enough. Also, COSSARO uses IUCN criteria to assess species at-risk.  These are the globally accepted criteria and are also used at the federal level. Their assessments of species using these criteria and best available data should be what the species is listed at.
-There should not be any consideration given for socio-economic impacts of endangered species protection. This act is to conserve biodiversity, not an act to increase business.
-There is no support for landscape-scale approaches to species conservation in this review paper.  Without an argument based on scientific evidence, there is no reason to consider this option. In some cases, habitat loss is not the main threat (eg white-nose syndrome in bats).
-There should be more red tape, not less. Industry should have to ensure they are not increasing pressure to declining populations.
-The value of biodiversity cannot be quantified solely in terms of economics. Species have an intrinsic right to exist and we have a responsibility to protect them.
-Species should continue to be listed automatically, at the category COSSARO determines using the best available scientific evidence.
-While some species seem to still be common (e.g. Blanding's turtle, meadowlark, bobolink) , it's important that we look at the examples of the passenger pigeon and American Burying beetles.  Once declines are noted, species need to be protected.  Even species numbering in the millions can go extinction.

Landscape - I agree that it is logical to address multiple species that occur within a specific habitat or geographical area for recovery plans or other initiatives
Listing - i think it is important that Minister not have discretion on COSSAROs assessment since that person is no expert.  At the federal SARA, in some cases species were assessed by COSEWIC yet government did not allow their status to pass for years resulting in 2 status lists which was very confusing for the public.  On the other hand COSSARO is currently not allowed to consider impacts that listing may have and whether assessment may negatively affect.  I believe that COSSARO should have some consideration of implications perhaps with input from SARPAC prior to disclosing status to the minister.
Recovery and Habitat Regs - i agree that 9 months may be too short for effective government response.  Timeline is needed however, 12 or 18 months would be more realistic.  On the other hand 5 years is a reasonable length of time for recovery review.
Authorization - permits which allow violation of act to allow for development should be the exception not the rule.  i agree that a simple system of authorization should be available to remove habitat for some species which are nearly entirely dependent on human habitats (e.g. nesting Barn Swallows)

I recently found out about the proposed changes or themes that are aimed to be changed in the 10 year review of Ontario's Endangered Species Act. I read the discussion paper and am disappointed in the theme it seems to be taking, namely: to remove road blocks for developers and leaving the endangered species to the wayside.
I do not like the direction the Government of Ontario seems to be taking on this and would like to express this to you so you can bring this forward and change or alter the direction this seems to be going.
The part that is especially troubling is 'Challenge"" number 3 of Area of Focus #3, on page 5 of the discussion paper. It very clearly lays out the Ontario Governments current knowledge on species at risk - very little. It says that endangered species do not need their habitat protected... this is absurd. This is exactly, I repeat EXACTLY, what endangered species require to survive - to have the habitat that they require to live to be protected so that they can have a chance at increasing their population. The 'general habitat protection' that exists now is not a legally binding protection for species - if their area is referenced lightly it is just saying the type of habitat features they require to survive, there are no actual measures that stop a developer from going in to an area and starting work without proper environmental impact assessment work. It seems that this is exactly what the Ontario Government wants to see happen and it is disappointing.
Stronger habitat protection is needed for species that are endangered or at risk, not weaker. The proposed changes that are highlighted in the discussion paper do not accurately reflect the current knowledge (e.g. science and indigenous traditional knowledge) on the protection of species, and it should be.

22101,/comment/22101,"Despite the Government's reassuring words, it feels to me like this ""effectiveness on environmental protections"" does not consider what is best for the environment, and will be mostly based on deregulation. Remember - there is no economy (good or bad) without the environment. The functions and services provided by the environment, such as clean air, clean water, water infiltration, flood control, erosion control, carbon sequestration would be worth trillions of dollars if were converted to currency.
The 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion paper provides little to no data to support its assertions. It is not clear where these “challenges” and “discussion questions” were based on or who has been consulted to formulate those. While I agree that there is certainly room for improvement in the outcomes for species –at-risk in Ontario, I would like to point out that the problem is not the Act itself, but its implementation and enforcement. The conversation should be around implementation improvements, such as additional staff to keep the Government on schedule with Government Responses/Management Plans/Recovery Strategies, or additional staff to provide a more efficient enforcement.  Instead, the overall direction of this review seems to be environmental deregulation (“to cut red tape”), and I am deeply concerned that the Act will be changed to facilitate depletion of natural resources to allow for “development” in detriment of the at-risk species and their habitat. Species are at risk primarily due to habitat loss – to improve the Act we need to improve habitat protection, not make it easier for certain business to operate in habitat. Additionally, the current exemptions should be repealed - there is virtually no protection for the at-risk species in those habitats (e.g. forest harvesting on Woodland Caribou habitat).
Please note that the three main purposes of the ESA are: 1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.;  2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.; 3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk.  (ESA 2007, c. 6, s. 1. ). If any modifications to the Act are proposed, they should be consistent with these objectives.
An automatic species and habitat protection is one of the most important portions of the Act and it must not be removed. It is consistent with the precautionary principle: taking preventive measure in face of uncertainty, particularly when there is significant intersection between a species or its habitat and human activities. The burden of proof should be on the proponents of an activity that could cause impacts to the at-risk species and their habitat, and not on the legislation or the species/habitat themselves. Otherwise, if protection is conferred only after years while the impactful activities continue, it is likely that by the time the protection is granted, there won’t be enough habitat (or population) left to protect that species. Additionally, the more destruction is allowed on the habitat of the species-at-risk, the more expensive their recovery will be.
The landscape approach is already possible in the existing Act, and it is a great additional tool to implement in habitats where multiple species are at-risk. However, it cannot replace the case-by-case and species-specific policy, since in many cases, this is the only approach that will work.
It is also of concern to me the proposal that application, removal or temporary delay protections for a THR or END species or its habitat could be based on Ministerial discretion. This decision should be based on scientific knowledge, such as the way in which the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario assess and classify each species, and not on political will.
While I understand that the current Provincial Government focuses on increasing the economic growth for Ontario, I believe that there are other ways this could be achieved, other than cutting down on protection for species-at-risk (or health and education). For example, the Government could consider focusing in investing in sustainable development, renewable energy, and development of technology. Having an economy based on depletion of natural resources (hard commodities) is simply no longer viable in this age; this is the development model of the past centuries, it is outdated and no longer applicable.  I believe that Ontario could achieve great economic development while preserving its natural resources, including SAR, for generations to come.

We are experiencing a period of frightening decline in many species, which could rip apart the stabilizing capacity of our natural ecosystems and has the potential to result in mass extinction by 2100 if we do not act.  This would be a crime of negligence against future generations for which our generation would be justifiably vilified in history.
The Act as it is needs to be more rigorously enforced. There are far too many exemptions; I understand that virtually all requests for exemptions are granted.  The logging industry in particular seems to have carte blanche, but other industries are also succeeding in obtaining approval for habitat destruction and other activities that harm the environment.  We must develop an economy that does depend on damaging more natural ecosystems.
The science-based decision-making process must be maintained.  I think it’s understandable to expect transparency in the basis for listing species as threatened or endangered, however I strongly object to the proposed Ministerial discretion to overturn decisions of the science-based panel.
Finally, we must act as responsible stewards of our natural environment, and project the consequences of our actions over very long time frames – thousands of years.  It is vitally important that we act on existing commitments such as protecting 17% of our land; especially forests, wetlands and areas enabling migration of land-based species.
I have the following comments with respect to specific sections of the discussion paper:
Area of Focus 1 – Landscape Approach
""Longer timelines before a species is listed""
Given that a proposed species is endangered and therefore its population is declining, any changes that would delay action would be counterproductive.
""Longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat.""
The Minister should not have discretion to remove or delay protections, as this would be subject then to political interference.  Any changes in status should be based only on sound science.
""Is [there] significant intersection between a species or its habitat and human activities, complexity in addressing species threats - as reasons for delaying or failing to protect a species or its habitat""
We cannot fail to protect a declining species for these reasons; given the damage already done to natural ecosystems, if we apply this criterion then it would provide far too little protection for endangered species and important habitat.  The intersection of human and species activities is exactly the space that is most challenged, and we must learn to limit our activities that are damaging to other species.
Area of focus 4 – Authorization Process
""Significant social or economic benefit permit, s. 17(2)(d): A significant social or economic benefit permit may be issued for an activity that will result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario, but the activity would have impacts that are otherwise prohibited under the Act.""
We cannot remove or fail to apply protections to species because there would be social or economic benefits to destroying habitats (or other activities).  This would leave a huge hole in the Act and basically anybody could do anything they wanted if it was to provide an economic or social benefit.
""Aboriginal persons – permits and agreements, s. 19: Instruments under this section maybe issued to (or entered into with) a band (as defined in the federal Indian Act), a tribal council, or an organization that represents a territorially-based Aboriginal community.""
I may be mis-reading this, but if the intent of this section is to allow Aboriginal people to hunt species that would otherwise be protected by the Act; I cannot support it. It doesn’t make it any less problematic if endangered animals are killed by people of any particular racial origin.
""What new authorization tools could help businesses achieve benefits for species at risk?""
Many people would agree that compliance with environmental regulations can be onerous because of their complexity and possibly scientific nature, especially for small businesses. This is particularly the case if many small businesses all have to go through the same expensive learning process. Therefore, assistance for companies to comply will be beneficial through cost-effective access to knowledgeable advisors who know the regulations, how to assess potential impact and how to comply (not how to find loopholes and get around them). Make counsel available for small businesses and individuals to expedite and reduce the cost of their compliance.

When government claims to be “for the people” it must prove so through its actions. Who are “the people”?  All people deserve good food, safe safe shelter, clean water  and air. Long term protection of the environment and the creatures in it, must be a priority for long term healthy development. A balance must be struck. To help one at the expense of the other is wrong headed. All species appear to be in decline, not just species at risk. Laws need to be strengthened because it is obvious that the natural world is losing. What good is development if it is killing the very things people need to be healthy. “To kill the water, to kill the fish, to kill the trees, to kill the birds, is to kill ourselves.”(William Kent Krueger)

22106,/comment/22106,"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper. We are submitting this feedback in our capacities as Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Canada scientists with significant direct experience in the assessment, research, stewardship, and recovery of species at risk (SAR) in Ontario and Canada.
WCS Canada is a national non-government organization with conservation science programs in Ontario since 2002, with a particular focus on the far north. We have active research programs on wolverine, caribou and lake sturgeon, in close collaboration or in partnership with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF). One of the signers of this letter (JR) served for nine years as terrestrial mammal co-chair of the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) and for four years as a member of COSSARO. She has also been a member of several federal and provincial technical/science advisory committees related to caribou critical habitat and recovery and was on the Ontario wolverine recovery team as well as co-author of the 2013 provincial recovery strategy. In addition, she served on the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Review Advisory Panel for MNRF through to the passage of the Ontario ESA in 2007. The other signer (CO) is a current member of the freshwater fish specialist sub-committee for COSEWIC, and leading an active research program on lake sturgeon in northern Ontario.
After reviewing the discussion paper, our general recommendation is to focus the review on improving implementation of the ESA, rather than on changes to the legislation. To that end, we have a number of detailed responses to the challenges and discussion questions in the paper, and include specific recommendations for each of the four focus areas in this letter [see attached file for the complete letter].
Overall remarks:
While the discussion paper begins with statements that emphasize upholding the ESA’s intent to protect and recover SAR in Ontario (e.g., providing “stringent protections”), the deeper one reads into the paper the clearer it becomes that the underlying impetus for this review is finding efficiencies for proponents seeking permits is. Although the high-level criticisms the Ontario government has heard are described in the introduction from the perspectives of both effectiveness for species and economic development, challenges and possible approaches described in the body of the paper focus on economic efficiency alone.
The ESA was put in place in 2007 to provide extra protections to species for which other policies and legislation were inadequate (as indicated by the growing list of species on the SAR list). It set out a process for elevating the needs of SAR in decision-making, particularly around habitat protection. It raised the standard of protection from doing less harm to benefitting species. This meant two things:
1) permitting activity does not equal recovery unless it benefits a species; and
2) other protections tailored to the recovery needs of individual species, particularly habitat protection, must be implemented.
There is no indication in either the “challenges” or “discussion questions” of the paper of any consideration by Ontario of why problems are arising. What is at the root of the complaints the government is receiving about the ESA’s implementation? Are the “challenges” described in the paper about the language of the legislation, the policies or regulations, or the implementation (i.e., sufficiency of capacity, whether the organizational structure is resulting in sound delivery, etc.)?
In fact, this current process should be much more than a review of the ESA – it should be a review of the ESA regime in Ontario. Yet, the discussion questions posed by the paper focus primarily on the legislation itself, rather than where and how implementation could be strengthened.
The discussion paper also seems to take it as a given that any economic development project will be able to benefit SAR through mitigation or restoration. However, there are a growing number of circumstances where authorizations are not going to be appropriate for meeting the recovery objectives of SAR, bringing about very difficult decisions. SAR and other environmental values cannot always be dealt with through mitigation (i.e., doing less harm) after the project is already approved. In some cases, proactive planning and denial of certain activities may be required to ensure that populations of SAR in Ontario are maintained or recovered. This is a reality that must be acknowledged, if the current government is genuine in its intentions to protect and recover SAR.
Finally, there is no mention of the fact that streamlining already happened, quite dramatically in 2013, when a 91-page amendment to Regulation 242/08 was introduced that brought about profound shifts to the practice and system of caring for our SAR. There is no evidence that the Ministry has looked into the consequences of these changes, either for the species themselves, or for any improvements in processing (i.e., did the streamlining succeed?). It is only thanks to investigations undertaken by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario that we have any inkling of some consequences to this regulation, which included dramatic increases in authorizations of harmful activities, no routine compliance monitoring, and little tracking of the species themselves and how they were faring.
Our overarching recommendation is to make no changes to the legislation itself. Instead, the government should focus on better using the full suite of existing tools in the ESA, and improving implementation to provide more meaningful protections for SAR in Ontario. We detail our advice for improving implementation in our 13 specific recommendations below.
We contend that more strategic implementation of the ESA can be accomplished without significant additional expenditures, and that failure to invest appropriately now in species at risk conservation will lead to escalating costs in the future as biodiversity deteriorates.

22108,/comment/22108,"The City of London supports ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk as the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) reviews the Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA).
Protection, management and enhancement of the environment is central to all of the planning that we do in London. Consistent with the environmental policies of our new Official Plan, The London Plan, we support upholding the current law for positive outcomes for species at risk, including:
•	science-based listing that includes Indigenous Traditional Knowledge,
•	mandatory habitat protection, and
•	legislated timelines for planning and reporting.
Area of Focus 1: Landscape Approaches
A landscape approach is already in place in some instances, for example when two or more species are represented within a single recovery strategy to improve efficiency and address the needs of multiple species at risk.
•	Morris, T. J. and M. Burridge. 2010. Recovery Strategy for the Northern Riffleshell (Epioblasma torulosa rangiana), Snuffbox (Epioblasma triquetra), Round Pigtoe (Pleurobema sintoxia), Mudpuppy Mussel (Simpsonaias ambigua) and Rayed Bean (Villosa fabalis) in Ontario. Ontario Recovery Strategy Series. Prepared for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Peterborough, Ontario. ii + 4 pp+ Appendix viii + 76 p.
•	McCracken, J.D., R.A. Reid, R.B. Renfrew, B. Frei, J.V. Jalava, A. Cowie, and A.R. Couturier. 2013. Recovery Strategy for the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) and Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) in Ontario. Ontario Recovery Strategy Series. Prepared for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Peterborough, Ontario. viii + 88 pp.
Agree that landscape approaches are important for species recovery noting more could be done to address (and remove barriers for other groups and levels of government to address) invasive species across the Province. Ontario’s Biodiversity Strategy, 2011 identified that after habitat loss, invasive species are the second biggest threat to biodiversity in Ontario.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process and protections for Species at Risk
A different or alternative approach to automatic species and habitat protections could delay implementation of the recommendations of COSSARO, and the posited approach of “longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat…” would not be consistent with the stated desired outcomes of the ESA review to both provide certainty and make the process more efficient while enabling positive outcomes for species at risk.
Prefer that COSSARO’s current species listing process is retained, “based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge” (ESA, section 5 (3)).
Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
The stated desired outcomes of the ESA review to both provide certainty and make the process more efficient while improving outcomes for species at risk could be improved by reducing the timelines for developing Recovery Strategies after species listing. Many Recovery Strategies are already delayed (as of June 13, 2017, recovery strategies for over 40 species have exceeded the timelines in the Act) and do not meet the current timelines set out in the Act. As the Government Response Statements are to be published up to 9 months after the development of Recovery Strategies, the timelines are in effect already extended, and extending them further would cause additional delays and increase the uncertainty in implementing the recommendations of COSSARO.
The development of a habitat regulation for each species that is endangered and threatened already aligns with the desired outcomes of the ESA review (to both provide certainty and make the process more efficient while improving outcomes for species at risk) as it “provides a more precise definition of a species’ habitat and may describe features (e.g., a creek, cliff, or beach), geographic boundaries or other unique characteristics, and may be smaller or larger than general habitat.”
Area of Focus 4: Authorization Process
The 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper identifies that; “Under the Act, the government can issue different types of permits or other authorizations for activities that would otherwise not be allowed. There are a variety of different provisions under the Endangered Species Act that would enable activities otherwise prohibited by the Act.”
The discussion paper identifies 8 current provisions including a “Significant social or economic benefit permit” that allows activities otherwise prohibited by the Act, noting Section 57 (1) 1 of the ESA already provides a number of exemptions. It is unclear how adding additional authorization tools or approaches to authorizations could further enable economic development while also providing positive outcomes to species at risk.
The stated desired outcomes of the ESA review to both provide certainty and make the process more efficient while improving outcomes for species at risk could be improved by reducing the timelines for processing authorizations, while also enhancing the consistency of inspection and enforcement powers.

re:  Ontario's Endangered Species Act
I am positive there are many dedicated and informed and qualified civil servants in the province who must be just as devastated as the many members of the public regarding the apathetic, uninformed and unqualified elected officials and/or appointed board members who have the gall the take such an arrogant stance on the future of this province regarding the environment.
the environment supports life on earth. have politicians missed absorbing this message because of their inadequate thought processes? all species, including man (because we are just members of a species), can be damaged or destroyed when the environment is allowed to be changed drastically (or even slightly in some cases, i.e., think of the Arctic) and/or intentionally/unintentionally harmed. Are we not witnessing climate change that is beyond control because of man's neglect of the warnings that scientists have provided for many decades?
why wouldn't the province want to set an example to the rest of Canada and other countries by acting responsibly and facing the fact that expansions of industry and destruction of flora and fauna will not provide future generations with: food, water, or breathable air. Sustainability of all life in Ontario requires everyone in Ontario to think and act intelligently when it comes to the environment.
change can begin with individuals, families, or corporations planting a tree(s) and reusing, recycling, reclaiming the environment for every endangered species. let's begin educating in earnest all (all ages, all old comers, all newcomers, all businesses, all schools, all levels of government) to become committed to sustainability.
I am speaking as a citizen. I care about the environment. I believe man must support other species who cannot defend themselves against man. I believe the Niagara Region is being raped and plundered by greed. I believe we must do a 180-degree turn - now, in order to protect what we have left in this blessed region.

22119,/comment/22119,"As a constituent of the Ontario government, I take issue with the suggestions in this review. The Endangered Species Act was created for the purpose of protecting the threatened, endangered, or otherwise at risk wildlife of Ontario. It was not created to see how far businesses could push the boundaries of habitat protection in the name of ""economic development"".
Here are the particulars of the review that I, as a member of the body which the government is supposed to represent, do not agree to:
First, I do not agree with the suggestion of an alternative to automatic species protection, nor the further proposal of ""ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat."" This sounds too much like making room for businesses to encroach on the protections of both land and species by removing their threatened or endangered classification.
Secondly, I do not agree with the suggestion of requesting "" an additional review and assessment in cases where there is emerging science or conflicting information."" This is in direct conflict with the opening preamble of the Endangered Species Act:
""The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity takes note of the precautionary principle, which, as described in the Convention, states that, where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat."" - The Endangered Species Act, 2007
Thirdly, the assertion that habitat regulation is not needed because of general habitat protection. Habitat regulation, in the Endangered Species Act, outlines a) specific boundaries of the [habitat], b) describes features in that [habitat] and c) describes the [habitat] in any other manner. The removal of these details would allow for boundary ambiguity of what businesses can and cannot infringe upon. As put in the review: ""improve certainty for businesses and others about the scope of habitat that is protected."" The Endangered Species Act is meant to determine what we should prioritize in protecting, not how much we're allowed to destroy.
Finally, in ""Area of Focus 4"", the challenges and discussion questions can be interpreted as looking for permission to create ways or loopholes for businesses to speed up their developments on protected lands. The review mentions ""the requirements that applicants must fulfil to obtain an authorization can be extensive, creating barriers to economic development."" What the review calls a challenge, I would call the entire purpose of the Endangered Species Act: to create barriers to economic development to protect those who cannot protect themselves.
The Endangered Species Act is not an invitation for the current government to create loopholes for economic development, and yet this review seems to imply just that. As a member of the government's constituency, I am not happy with their constant attempts to undermine the environmental protections we already have in place for the benefit of businesses (e.g the Bill 66 fiasco). Businesses will come and go, and to cater to an ephemeral customer at the cost of our environmental health and it's species is not only unwise, but it is also morally wrong. I know that environmental protection isn't easy, and will require sacrifices. But just because the right thing isn't easy, doesn't mean it's not right.

To comment on the ESA review discussion paper, I am writing to strongly support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, but the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.

It is essential that competent scientific, ecological, and environmental expertise is used to assess species at risk and to make decisions related to protecting the species and find approaches to mitigate risks.
We shout not lengthen notification processes. Species are at risk currently and any lengthening of processes will only serve to put those species into more risk and harm. If anything, we should shorten processes so that we can apply  protection to species at risk on a more timely basis.
Yes, we need to account for emerging science but we should always error on the side of increased protection to species. Scientific experts need to be engaged to analyze information without political interference.
We should not use an excuse of economic or social benefit to lessen the protection of species at risk. We should not allow exemptions for activities that may harm species at risk.

If the intent of this review is to truly look at making improvements to the Act, that sounds like sound decision making. However, if the intent is to actually allow proposals - which will in fact, either short-term or long-term, have a detrimental effect on the species covered within the Act or the environments in which they inhabitate - this is not a course of action that I support nor that current or future Canadians support. I recognize that it has been written that one of the priorities of the review is to ensure the best outcomes for the species covered under the Act.

Thank you for the opportunity to add my voice to the public consultation on the ESA review discussion paper.
The science is clear that business-as-usual development and industrial activities continue to threaten the survival and recovery of wildlife in Ontario. What is needed is not greater efficiency for industry but, rather, greater efficiency to recover the province’s at-risk species.
We urge you to:
•  Focus on habitat-protection measures that are effective for the listed species and that simultaneously improve outcomes for multiple species at risk.
•  Work with other ministries to ensure coordination to limit cumulative impacts on the lands and waters that provide wildlife habitat.
•  Repeal the long list of exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development, approved by cabinet in 2013.
•  Amend the law to set a higher bar for creating exemptions through regulation by ensuring they cannot jeopardize the recovery of threatened or endangered species.
•  Ensure local communities benefit from activities to maintain and restore endangered species and their habitat, including rural and northern communities.
•  Support the continued leadership and critical role of Indigenous Peoples in conservation initiatives.
Thank you.

We typically don’t do this because obviously the environmental consulting company hired is going to pay attention to the party who is paying their bill. While this makes it difficult to protect endangered species, it is far more problematic when the government simply sends signals and takes actions to show it doesn’t care. The rules related to development in areas of endangered species actually need to be tightened and not relaxed. Knowing what we know about environmental issues today and the perils of climate change and its implications for all plant and wildlife species in the province, it is hard to fathom a government wanting to relax rules and only because they will curry favours of the business community. We should be setting the bar high. It would be embarrassing to think that after years or hard work, study and lobbying efforts on the part of many organizations to put the environmental protection on the government agenda, that this could be so quickly unravelled. Respect for all - including the achievements of past individuals, organizations and governments should be first and foremost - when a government begins its term. Respect for the environment and the efforts of scientists who determined what would constitute the comprehensive list of endangered species should also be a primary goal because these standards are so easily abandoned by shortsightedness and greed. Don’t be the government that appeases those with other interests.

Businesses come and go, boom and bust and new ones come in to take their place. It's the natural ebb and flow of progress and most business go bust due to their own fault (not making a product the market wants, not knowing who they are marketing too, irrelevant merchandise, incompetent fiscal management, etc.) and  not because of environmental protections.
It should be government's responsibility to grow emerging technologies so we get the jump on establishing ourselves as the go-to-people and products for the world, and that would generate massive employment in R&D and end point employment.

Instead, what every responsible, democratic government should do is ensure that the natural resources it governs are left better, not diminished, for the next generation of Ontarians to observe and enjoy.

A review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act could be exactly what wildlife need, but the government’s emphasis on creating “efficiencies for business” could make it even easier for industry to disturb and pollute nature where at-risk species need protections most.
Ontario is home to 243 species at risk of extinction. Already, routinely granted exemptions to the Act make it far too easy for development and industry to tear up and cut through critical habitat.
Please consider - for you, me, and our children, grandchildren and future generations:

If we can not not protect the species that have no say, we should not expect that we will have a say unless we belong to the rich and powerful either. Democracy goes beyond letting the mighty dollar determine what gets done and what doesn't when it comes to keep our planet viable for all and for many generations to come. If we can not get better at protecting other species against extinction, we'd better realize that we are unlikely to be the last species alive.
Evolution is a very slow process. If we get extinct, most other mammals, probably all of them will be extinct too. But there are other species which might survive and eventually reach a level of development similar to ours, in millions or billions of years, but under another form, one that might not rely on oxygen or water to the extent we do or not at all.   That species may be as alien to our species as the fantasies of aliens from outer space.

We are all aware that profit, in general , is derived from the exploitation of labour forces, consumers, or the environment.  In simple terms that the exchange value of goods is less than the production cost.  The current government appears to be suggesting that it would actively consider taking measures to ensure that businesses were able to further exploit the environment to ensure profitability rather than offer protection to species who are at risk/endangered as a result of human activities.

To open the seasons for a species that is threatened with extinction, the government had to punch a hole in the Endangered Species Act that undermines its intent by allowing hunters and trappers to kill the wolves anywhere outside of the 4 closures.

Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks
FRi Ecological Services Comment for Submission
to the Environmental Registry
February 27, 2019
AREA OF FOCUS 1: LANDSCAPE APPROACHES
Problem – Threats Not Homogeneous Across the Province
Threatened and endangered species' threats are not homogeneous across the province. Regional and landscape approaches could benefit many species.  The landscape approach is equally important for the projects or development – looking at them in isolation for their impacts or avoidance to species at risk is short sighted.
Solution – Landscape Approach
A landscape approach for most species and habitats is the best approach.  Need to start with sound science, a defensible position and always the understanding that species and habitat protection are nothing without a balance considering social and economic as well.
Problem – Case by Case Approach
An example where a case-by-case and species-specific approach clearly does not work is the Eastern Whip-poor-will.  In the Sudbury District of the MNRF this species is relatively common and widespread. The historical overharvesting of white pine coupled with the acid precipitation from the nickel smelters has created patchy deforestation across the landscape which is a very favourable habitat for this species.
There is very likely a greater supply of habitat than is needed for this species at the district level.  However, because of how the ESA is structured and administered, any impacts to even a portion of one Whip-poor-will territory requires the creation of two new territories to achieve Overall Benefit.  Two territories is about 18 ha or 50 acres. This requires that a proponent find or purchase patent lands that do not currently have the species residing and manage the habitat to favour the species.  The management action to achieve overall benefit is to remove forested areas to create more patchwork.  The City of Greater Sudbury has been struggling for over 40 years to re-establish their forests and yet the ESA may be forcing even more removal of forests to create habitat that is not in short supply in this area.
Solution – Regional Landscape Approach
Rather than the present one-off approach to ESA considerations, a landscape/municipal or other manageable or size-sensible approach should be undertaken.  A provincial ecosites habitat based approach makes sense.
Solution – Stewardship Fund
If habitat is not needed at the district or regional landscape scale, the creation of a Stewardship Fund that an applicant for an Overall Benefit Permit can contribute to when territories or habitat are impacted. The fund can be used to create habitat in districts that lack this habitat in the historic range of this species. This will contribute to restoring healthy populations in all ranges instead of creating an oversupply of habitat in one district that is not being. This does not create overall benefit for the species.
Solution - Consider the Whole
Wetlands are a great example where ‘considering the whole’ is sensible.  Wetlands provide complex and important habitat for a range of species at risk.  Wetlands are critical, but without adjacent upland and connectivity of the same, protecting pieces or project specific wetland and upland areas won’t matter without considering the whole.
Problem – Multiple Layers
ESA authorizations have multiple layers of approvals and unclear timelines associated with the same.  Inconsistency and uncertainty for proponents does not foster responsible growth and development.
Solution - Strategic Approach ESA Considerations at the Municipal Level
We believe under municipal purview; most ESA considerations can be effectively addressed and certainly in a timely manner compared to the present ‘black hole’ that is MNRF.
Planning Act processes often run parallel at the municipal government level; perhaps this is a way to better integrate at the municipal level?  Municipal level also understands the need for a balance as they serve the larger community.  This would need to come with specific funding to support the extra workload to be effective.
Most organized medium and large municipalities have delegated authority from the Province under the Planning Act to undertake things like subdivision approval and other planning act considerations.  WITH APPROPRIATE support, the province could support municipalities taking on this role as they already look at a number of coincident decisions and processes along the path of development/project approvals.
Planning Boards could function similarly in unorganized/rural areas while some municipalities may have their own ecologist/biologist or other experts on staff (Conservation Authority) or they may choose to outsource the work.
AREA OF FOCUS 2: LISTING PROCESS AND PROTECTIONS FOR SPECIES AT RISK
Problem – Lack of Communication, Inconsistent Communication
It’s our impression that the communications are typically out of date and don’t follow a consistent schedule.  For example, it’s mid-February 2019 and the cossaroagency.ca website notes that the next meeting is Fall 2018.
Can there be a more collaborative approach?   It’s not clear how the small team (COSSARO) gathers adequate information for all the species assessed in a 6 month period and provides a report for the committee.  Who is tasked with this and is there a clear process for stakeholder input?
Solution – Clear Communication
The Province should set out clear timelines and communicate these to stakeholders – when species are considered for listing, when they’re listed and receive ESA protection and finally, clearly define and provide platforms and mechanisms for engagement, participation, and feedback.
Problem – Unclear ‘Rules’
Presently, it’s really difficult for landowners/project proponents to understand the seemingly inconsistent expectations of the administering agency in order to reach a mutually agreeable and balanced solution.  The rules keep changing, they’re confusing, time consuming and costly.
Solution – New Species Listings
For new species listings, they should not be considered ‘retro-active’ that is to say, a species listed as threatened receives automatic habitat protection from the listing date.  For developments or other projects ongoing when a species is listed, the availability of ‘grandfathering’ or other clear options for processes already underway should be made clear.
Problem – Species Present and Habitat Used?
Automatic species and habitat protection is fine.  The problem is that species presence/absence and habitat suitability is generally unknown or very unclear for most of the province.  For example, Blanding’s turtles are listed as threatened and their habitat is protected.  No problem.  Except what is considered habitat?  All suitable wetlands regardless of use?  Only wetlands used in the last 5 years?  Does use matter?
Solution – Invest in Understanding Species and their Habitats
In order for species and habitat protection provisions to actually work, the Province needs to know where the species and habitat exist.   Presently, it’s our opinion that on the whole, the Province knows very little about where species and their habitats are.
Problem – Primary Threats not Related to Habitat Loss
Bats and trees are a good example here.  The threat to bats is not habitat loss, it’s a disease called White Nose Syndrome (WNS).  However, to ignore habitat would be foolish – long-term habitat availability is important for bats e.g. trees, caves etc.   But the focus on habitat protection while WNS is decimating bat populations seems off-point entirely.
For example, the current bat habitat survey protocol is a very expensive undertaking to identify potential maternity roost trees and protect them. The cost to survey a 40 ha (100 acre) parcel is about $100,000.  However, since the disease has depleted the population as much as 90% in some areas, it is very unlikely that anybody is going to find an active maternity roost tree. In fact we are only aware of one in the entire province that has been detected using this protocol.
When maternity roosts are not confirmed, that clears the way for a proponent to remove these habitat components where the very reason they may not be used is because populations have dipped so low from the disease. The current Overall Benefit practice is to create artificial maternity bat boxes even though the real problem is the disease.
Solution - Clear Definitions: Clear definitions of species habitat are needed.  A clear understanding and communication of the species use of habitat is needed.  These definitions most importantly need to be based on science and be defensible - not best guesses.  If there is not enough information, the province needs to be clear and have a process for arriving at an ecologically, socially, and economically acceptable end point.
Solution - Non-Habitat Threats Approach
There would be circumstances where the threats to species aren’t related to habitat loss where a different approach might be more appropriate.  Perhaps a focus on ‘threats’ as a group is more appropriate –  for example road mortality or disease, which aren’t really related to habitat loss.
Solution - Species Specific Example Solution
It seems that it would be much more beneficial for bat species to achieve avoidance by maintaining a certain number of potential maternity roosts per hectare. If this could not be done then the proponent would contribute to a Stewardship Fund that is earmarked to solve the disease issue for these bats so that they can recover.
Requiring proponents to waste their money on surveys that yield no results seems counter-productive when that money could be better spent on providing long-term species benefit and population stabilization and improvement through research thereby improving the quality and amount of information that informs decision-making.
 
AREA OF FOCUS 3: SPECIES RECOVERY POLICIES AND HABITAT REGULATIONS
Problem - Government Response Statement Non-Committal
In our opinion, government response statements are often very non-committal from the government perspective.  They don’t lead many concrete actions, rather they ‘support’ others who’d like to take up the cause.  The government should be supporting (read $$) stewardship initiatives as well as leading the science/on the ground investigations required for many species and habitat.  In short, the timelines associated with these aren’t the issue – the issue lies with the apparent lack of commitment from the agency responsible for the ESA.  In general, the government-led actions listed in Government Response Statements are rarely or very slowly actioned.
For example, the Government Response Statement for the Eastern Foxsnake was issued June 15, 2011.  It listed eight (8) government-led actions.  The only action that seems to have been completed is a habitat regulation for this species.  It refers to items such as encouraging the submission of Eastern foxsnake data to the Ministry’s central repository at the NHIC.  The difficulty is that the Ministry itself does not submit their data into the NHIC reliably, so how would they encourage or expect the general public to do so?
The GRS also states that MNRF will, “encourage and communicate annually priority actions for government support in order to encourage collaboration and reduce duplication of effort.”  We  have never seen anything remotely like this for any species. A really important item was the development of a survey protocol to detect the presence or absence of Eastern foxsnakes. This is a very fundamental component, yet it has not been done in the 8 years since the government response statement was issued.
Problem – Review of Progress
A review of progress toward protection and recovery makes sense when there has been some measurable progress.  From our perspective, there are little to no concrete metrics in place to both assess the individual merits of a project and it’s ESA approval (e.g. overall benefit permit) and the sum total of all positive actions for a species.
Problem – Lack of Resources &/ Leadership to Implement
It is unclear whether the MNRF has the resources available to administer the ESA in its entirety. They have been unable to meet deadlines for recovery strategies and government response statements. Habitat regulations have also been slow to proceed. While general habitat descriptions are helpful, they are subject to a dramatic range of interpretations which compounds confusion and drags out approvals.
Solution – Habitat Regulations Needed
Where it is possible to create a habitat regulation it may be better than relying on subjective general habitat descriptions.  A regulation provides certainty to everybody involved.  It’s our opinion that regulated habitat with a well-defined explanation based on the best available science provides greater certainty for business and others on the scope of protected habitat.  This will also serve to provide a gauge for measuring success of protection and recovery efforts.
Solution - Science-based, Clearly Communicated and Government Supported
Recovery strategies, government response statements and habitat regulations need to be based on peer-reviewed scientific research and meta-data science-based, clearly communicated to stakeholders and supported both in principle and financially by the government.  A stewardship based approach to actions is likely the best path to success for the species, their habitat and business in Ontario.
 
AREA OF FOCUS 4: AUTHORIZATION PROCESS
This is perhaps the area that will require the most work. There are multiple problems with the authorization process.
Problem – Inconsistency
Inconsistency is a huge problem under the ESA.  This is somewhat related to the previous problem where if there was a formal formula or process to calculate Overall Benefit, outcomes should be consistent and repeatable.  This is not the case currently.  In some cases, there are MNRF staff (Management Biologists and District Managers) that take it upon themselves to determine what they feel is adequate.
In one case a District MNRF Management Biologist decided unilaterally that a Whip-poor-will territory was 40 ha based on a single article that he read and then boasted that he was a ‘road block’ and didn't care about his impact to the process. This was imposed on a proponent even though the provincial general habitat description indicated that a territory was 9 ha.  After months of negotiation, the biologist conceded to reduce the size of the territories to be created from 40 to 13 ha; still 4 ha larger than the general habitat description.  The fact that there is no appeal process and no accountability or oversight of MNRF staff, unnecessarily cost this proponent months of negotiation time and additional cost for unnecessary overall benefit that was not consistent with the general habitat description.
Solution – Timely, Consistent Process
First and foremost business needs tools and authorizations with clear timelines and expectations.  Timelines and expectations that the Province upholds, no exceptions.  We think the most important change is a timely and consistent process.  Proponents need to know what the process is and what to expect from it.  The ‘overall benefit’ concept is a good one in theory, but what it fails to do is consider the ‘whole’, the landscape and its inherent connectedness.  To achieve a ‘benefit’ for one species, it’s often at the expense of another.
If a proponent requires an authorization, the government must provide a clear understanding & offer an opportunity/platform for local knowledge, advisors, consultants to fine tune expectations using local/regional/ site-specific knowledge  – measurable impacts and commensurate outcomes - that are needed to meet the overall benefit threshold.  e.g. Whip-poor-will in Sudbury – do not need more habitat and in fact, habitat creation in the municipality is contrary to the City’s regreening efforts.
Problem – No Transparency
The Overall Benefit review process by the MNRF is not transparent. They are unable or unwilling to share the formula or process that they use to weigh impacts and determine what Overall Benefit is required.  This is disadvantageous to the proponent and potentially the species in question.
In our experience, the following example represents a typical ESA approval process:
A project proponent submits what they feel is adequate Overall Benefit without the advantage of knowing what process is being used by the MNRF to assess both impacts and required overall benefit.
The MNRF reviews the application and indicates if the Overall Benefit is adequate or not.
If it is deemed not adequate, MNRF does not provide reasons for this nor do they proposed possible options for achieving adequate overall benefit.  Instead, it is up to the proponent to adjust their proposal with additional overall benefit actions and resubmit.  This is an iterative process that can take over 10 submissions until the proponent achieves Overall Benefit in the eyes of the MNRF.  The review of each submission regularly takes MNRF staff months before they provide any feedback; resulting in a process that spans years with final approval sometimes 3 – 5 years in the future.
This is absolutely inefficient and unfair to the applicant.  Project proponents are forced to ‘play the game’ but the MNRF refuses to share the rules which causes a great amount of unnecessary expense, lost time and incites great frustration and loss of faith in the process from proponents who want to comply.  This is further compounded by the fact that there is no appeal process or accountability oversight.  Proponents are stuck with little to no recourse.
Solution – Measurable, Transparent Overall Benefit Assessments
The MNRF must share the formula or process they use to calculate impacts and Overall Benefit so that proponents know what is expected and so that there are consistent and repeatable results.  If MNRF demonstrates that they are not following the process, there needs to be an appeal process that ensures accountability.
The MNRF should create a formal record that documents the impact assessment process used for a project and justify how they arrived at the recommended Overall Benefit. If the MNRF wants people to come to the table willingly, proponents must be treated fairly with consistent outcomes. If proponents were provided with the formula or process used, it should significantly reduce the number of resubmissions required to achieve Overall Benefit and reduce the effort of both the proponent and the MNRF.
Problem – Lack of or Inadequate Pre-Consultation
The MNRF purports that pre-consultation prior to undertaking an activity is critical to achieve compliance with the ESA and they highly recommend pre-consultation. However, there is no formal process for pre-consultation.  In some cases, the available information is not disclosed to the applicant, pre-consultation meetings are not formally documented and since they are often not recorded in any way, when there are staffing changes, the pre-consultation discussions move with the staff member rather than being retained with the file.
Solution – Mandated Pre-Consultation
Pre-consultation is a very important process. Project proponents make financial decisions based on the outcome of these pre-consultation meetings. There needs to be a formal process that is recorded with minutes that are circulated to all attendees and a consensus that the minutes are accurate and complete. Those minutes stay with the file regardless of staff changes in the future.
Problem – No Access to Relevant Data
Background information about threatened and endangered species observations are not kept in a transparent/accessible repository. The public has access to the MNRF Natural Heritage Make-A-Map. This can be used to identify known observations within a 1km square surrounding the area of interest.
This information is often incomplete and/or out of date, and because it does not give precise locations, it is often impossible to produce mapping based on the habitat descriptions since they are often based on distances from a known observation. The Lands Information Ontario and Natural Heritage Information Centre also has a database of threatened and endangered species observations.
The MNRF is supposed to update this information regularly.  It’s our perception that this is not happening consistently and therefore it is an incomplete data set and cannot be totally relied upon.
It is our experience that individual District Offices and even individual management biologists often have their own ""stash"" of documented observations that are often withheld and inaccessible.  So even if an applicant asks for all known data, there is no guarantee that they will receive a complete data set making it impossible to plan for and ensure compliance with the ESA.
The MNRF offered Data Sensitivity Training to those consultants that require more detailed information. However, there is no central repository of those that have received the training and there appears to be no benefit to those trained since there is no elevated level of access afforded.
Solution - Targeted Open Data
The MNRF wants people to comply with the ESA. The data that they control is crucial to ensure compliance. They must set up a central repository for this information that is updated on a regular basis (at least quarterly). The general public will have access to general locations within a 1km square.
Those that have had the Data Sensitivity Training will be granted further access to point data or at least restricted access sufficient to create the required mapping in support of a project application. If the data does not appear in this repository, then it should not be referred to at a later date. It is not fair to ""hide"" data in various locations only to spring the information on a proponent after they have completed studies.
Problem – No Accountability
There is a common theme underlying many of the problems with the ESA – administrative accountability.  If decision makers with the MNRF follow a transparent process with repeatable and defensible outcomes and achievable, timely conclusions, it would vastly improve efficiency and consistency and future proponent compliance and attitudes towards MNRF/the process/ESA legislation.  The agency as a whole need to clearly understand that developers make financial decisions on the information that MNRF provides to them. When the information is inaccurate or incomplete, the proponent incurs an unnecessary cost and sense of mistrust.
Solution – Mandated Accountability
Proper and proponent-accessible documentation of the Overall Benefit process including pre-consultation, Overall Benefit calculation, full proponent review of draft Overall Benefit permits, and a functional and effective appeal process would vastly improve the efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of the ESA.
Solution - Authorization Tracking Online
The MNRF previously (~2011) operated a Permit Tracker web site.  This site contained an interactive map that identified all locations with permits or other instruments under the ESA. Details about each of these approvals could be accessed publicly.  This was a useful tool which also encouraged consistency because the Overall Benefit actions were available and could be compared for similar permits.
The MNRF only used this for a very short period of time and then discontinued to use it consistently even though they continued to list it in their EBR notifications. In 2013, the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario released the report, Laying Siege to the Last Line of Defense.  It was a somewhat scathing review of MNRF's handling of the ESA and one of the specific recommendations was to reinstate the Permit Tracker and the MNRF had committed to doing just that.  Regional MNRF staff confirmed with us in 2014 and again in 2015 that they were working on this. To date, nothing has been done 5 years after that review.
Problem – Inconsistent Application of ESA
The ESA is a self-regulating type of legislation that is proponent-driven. This means that there is no requirement to always obtain a permit or to check if a project needs a permit to proceed. It is the responsibility of the proponent to determine if their project may need a permit and then engage MNRF to provide a formal assessment of the same.
Although there is no requirement to check with MNRF to determine if a permit is needed, and not all projects need an ESA approval, the MNRF is encouraging developers and municipalities to treat the legislation as if it was prescriptive.  They are requiring proponents and municipalities to consult with them in every case; they have essentially inserted themselves into plan review – a role MNRF has not formally been responsible for since the 1990’s.
Presently, there is no formalized link between the Endangered Species Act and the Planning Act.  Similarly, there is no consistency across the province how that informal link is administered.  Some municipalities will consider the project and decide, while others will not proceed with municipal approvals until MNRF provides their blessing.
The lack of a formal role for MNRF in this ‘plan review’ means that MNRF staff are not held to any timelines or guidelines with respect to their review.  Through this review, MNRF is enabled to request additional information or requirements from project proponents.  The absence of a structured role for MNRF in plan review means that proponents are essentially held hostage until MNRF gives their sign-off.
Solution – Link Planning Act and ESA Considerations
If it is the government's intent that all planning applications are required to clear ESA requirements prior to final approval, then a standardized process should be well-established for the linkage between the Planning Act and the ESA. To avoid lengthy delays for MNRF to review applications, they need to have all the resources to administer the Act in a timely fashion and must have staff that are also thoroughly familiar with the Planning Act and the implications of their recommendations.
Problem – Lack of Coordination
There is a genuine lack of coordination with other provincial policies and legislation. For example, The Growth Plan for Northern Ontario  emphasizes the concept of concentrating growth in the serviced core of communities. It also purports that the Province shall implement a co-ordinating role in the implementation of the plan. Yet the identified serviced settlement areas of most northern cities contain significant portions of habitat for threatened and endangered species.
The province did not exercise a coordinated plan in implementing the Growth Plan with regards to the ESA.  The areas identified for future growth are crippled by the implementation of the ESA in many cases.  In order to achieve avoidance of impacts, a project proponent is either halted in many areas or they are forced to relocate to areas outside of the settlement area which is contrary to the Northern Ontario Growth Plan.
Solution - Settlement Boundary Authorization
The province should provide a guidance document on how to assess ESA habitat at a regional landscape scale so that a municipality can apply for a special single Overall Benefit permit or other approval to provide space for growth on lands designated under the settlement boundary while maintaining a supply of ESA habitat across the landscape and meet the intent of both the ESA and the Northern Ontario Growth Plan.

GENERAL COMMENTS
Focus on Realistic and Positive Outcomes for Species
Overall benefits or similar provisions should focus on fixing existing issues.  For example, cutting trees likely has little to no impact on species at risk bats if the trees are cut during the winter when bats aren’t using them.  But WNS is a very real and very serious threat to bats.  Rather than ‘save trees’, perhaps a monetary donation to ongoing research for protection and recovery e.g. cure for WNS.
Stewardship
Stewardship is one of the three ‘pillars’ of the ESA.  It is one of the three stated purposes of the legislation (Section 1(3) of the ESA).  Stewardship means working with land owners and proponents to achieve the goal of species and habitat protection while balancing social and economic needs of Ontarians.  This is what responsible growth could look like.
Enhanced Enforcement Not Needed
Additional inspection and compliance powers don’t seem like a particularly proactive approach.  Rather, a front end, proactive approach to species and habitat protection = stewardship.  Not beefed up enforcement.  Make it clear and easy for compliance at the outset; help proponents through the process; give a suite of biologically feasible options for moving forward. The Province (MECP or MNRF) needs to provide a service to Ontarians by facilitating the balance between social, economic and environment.
Authorizations should have a focus on the front-end; promote stewardship and collaboration, with little to no need for enforcement.  It is presumed too late for species and habitats typically if enforcement is needed.  From our perspective, species and habitat protection are commensurate with many other values that Ontarians hold dear.  For example, people have the same desire and love for natural spaces e.g. parks, conservation areas, trails etc.  The spaces and places that people like and want to preserve for people, are typically overlapping with the wild spaces that species at risk need and use.
Changes to Authorizations
Permitting - Section 17(2)(d) permits are and should remain the exception.
Exemptions – Broad exemptions generally defeat the purpose of protection and recovery in our opinion and come across as very unfair – e.g. favouring one industry over another.  Exceptions should be exceptions to the rule, not the norm.
Other Legislative Framework
For most of the projects that FRi is involved with, the Planning Act and its processes are the logical framework.  There are other similar legislation with review processes e.g. Aggregate Resources Act, where more efficient review is possible.

22445,/comment/22445,"It is crucial that the Ontario government prioritize species at risk when making changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act. Companies have too much ability to gain exemption from the act; commerce should never take precedence over the wildlife with which we share our province, and whom the Ontario government has a duty to protect. All life should have equal opportunity to thrive, and the insatiable pursuit of wealth to the point of the destruction of habitats is both short-sighted and irresponsible. What Ontario's Endangered Species Act needs is to firmly state areas of protected habitats which companies cannot overstep. This will also lead to increased efficiency. It is necessary that the government cease allowing exemptions for companies whose activities are leading to the extinction of numerous species of wildlife. Regarding landscape approaches, I believe it is important invest in areas central to the sustainability of ecosystems, such as pollinator gardens. This would promote the growth of pollinator species which are essential to the survival of all lifeforms. I would suggest a holistic approach regarding implementation, so that, rather than species preservation being an isolated effort, it is integrated into other aspects of legislation. This would move toward greater environmental sustainability, and create jobs in long-term sustainable fields. This is not a political matter, but a fundamental environmental crisis: Ontario wildlife populations are declining with alarming speed, and soon this damage will be irrevocable.

22448,/comment/22448,"I greatly look forward to the revisions to this act. Whereas in the past environmental issues have been so often at odds with economic and social policies, it is most certainly true that our environmental objectives lie inseparably with all other political ones. As endangered species rely on healthy environments in order to recover, I believe that the issue of environmental practices overall is relevant and pressing. Scientists have recently come forward with research showing that if we do not act now, in twelve years we will be past the point of sustaining this planet (and the number of natural disasters, like California's wildfires will be far greater and more devastating). Evidently, then, it is necessary for Ontario to make dramatically more progressive changes to environmental policy. Although on a provincial scale our ability to mitigate climate change is small, it is important for us to be leaders. We need to step up and make large scale changes because they will provide the framework and successful precedent necessary to prompt further environmental responses nationally and globally.
There are many institutions, businesses, and other organizations that everyday are developing greener technology that is increasingly competitive with established ones. Funding for this work and the implementation of these innovations is something worth consideration. Supporting environmentally responsible businesses is especially important to dispel the myth that the economy must compromise the environment.
Instead of proliferating the oil and gas industry, the government should keep the economy strong and unemployment rates low by generating jobs in the environmental sector - this can be anything from paying workers to plant, restore, and survey forests to investing in building more infrastructure for green technology like electrical cars.
In terms of preserving species on a smaller scale, it is equally important to create and maintain ecosystem throughout the province. Many animals die crossing highways even though there is the technology to make safe overpasses for them to cross, such as those seen across Canada. Investment in constructing more of these would be useful. More green spaces in the city would mean that species, especially pollinators, would not have to travel such long distances to find enough nourishment. Gardens and parks can benefit both wildlife and humans in providing important habitats as well as the green space proven to improve the mental health of those living in urban areas. Vertical farming is another area wherein the government can invest; it reduces the amount of space needed for farmland, meaning less deforestation, takes less water and other resources, employs locals, replacing the importation of expensive produce (that is often frozen and thus low-quality when it arrives), and cuts down on emissions used in transportation. These are but a few of the many solutions that are already feasible.
Thank you for taking the time to take these ideas into consideration.

However, Individuals need to change their views and start realizing that each person must take responsibility for their own actions in preserving the environment.

It's up to each person to take care of their environment, their children, their elderly, and their neighbours, and to let governments know what is expected.  However, Governments and Insurance companies should not be relied upon.  The grassroots level is where the biggest changes come from.  I think there are way bigger issues at play than just species at risk.  If some of the larger issues, ie. climate change related, can be addressed at both small and large scales, that will help species at risk.

-Son réexamen n’aidera pas les espèces menacées s’il omet la question des exemptions, qui encouragent la destruction des habitats par les activités des entreprises.

22536,/comment/22536,"I am strongly opposed to the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Not one revision outlined in this document will improve the protection of Species at Risk in Ontario and their habitats. When read thoroughly, it is clear that the only intent for this review is to make the development process easier for developers and businesses so they can continue to make large profits. If the suggestions in the review are approved, this can be devastating to the Species at Risk (SAR) in Ontario. Studies show that 60% of global wildlife populations have declined since 1970; this is a time to strengthen our protection strategies, not loosen laws. I am a Terrestrial Ecologist with knowledge and experience in this subject, and I feel that my comments should be considered. I will include comment on some examples pulled directly from the review.
In regards to “The Landscape Approach”, the Review states: ""The case-by-case and species-specific policy approach to implementing the Endangered Species Act can sometimes limit the ability to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk.""
Although it is true that a landscape approach could be beneficial to protecting SAR habitat, it is absolutely necessary that we evaluate local and immediate areas where development projects will take place. If a SAR or their habitat is present at a proposed development site, the area should be protected regardless of habitat outside the project area. We cannot dismiss the case-by-case approach and replace it with a landscape approach, they need to be used collectively. The entire purpose of the ESA is to protect SAR species from becoming extinct, and if we don't protect them in every case, how can this be successful?
For changes in regards to the Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk, the Review states ""In some cases, automatic species and habitat protections can contribute to high uncertainty and costly impacts to businesses and the public.""
Once again, this review is favouring short-term economic gain over the long-term protection of our species. The decision to list a new at-risk species needs to be based on the expert knowledge and experience of scientists, not politics.
Currently, the first purpose in the ESA is “To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge."" Delaying the listing process would go against one of the main purposes for the ESA.  The public does not need to be notified when a species becomes listed; a plant or animal that is at-risk of becoming extinct simply does not have time to wait. We must take immediate action so we can begin working on recovery strategies and action plans.  Remember, these species are at risk of becoming extinct.
Protecting species at risk and their habitats can have enormous value to human beings as well. For example, wetlands that are habitat for many SAR turtles provide many ecosystem services that humans take for granted. Wetlands filter water, prevent floods, store carbon, provide educational and recreational opportunities, etc.
In conclusion, this proposed review will be detrimental to humans, and plant and animal species residing in Ontario. Humans repeatedly exploit our resources at a rate that is not sustainable, and only once when situations are past the tipping point do we try to correct it. Let’s make the right choice and protect our species at risk while they are still with us and it is possible. Many people in this province value our natural areas and wildlife, and we are very lucky to have such a wide diversity of species. Their extinction should not be made in the favour of a few large corporations.
Thank you. I beg you to please reconsider this proposal.

22537,/comment/22537,"ESA 10th Year Review Comments
The following provides comments on the Endangered Species Act (ESA) Discussion Paper and also illustrates how an ESA Permit was used by a developer during an OMB Hearing for a 450 000 ft2 big box retail development.  The development lands themselves host 4 endangered and threatened species, represented by 100 individuals.  It is also less than 40 m from a globally endangered Tallgrass Prairie ecosystem.  It hosts 4000 species, 160 Ontario species at risk, a wetland, and  has 21 endangered and threatened species.  If the ESA failed here, it illustrates improvements are needed.
Area Focus 1 Landscape Approaches
The ESA Discussion Paper’s landscape approach to species protection is very innovative. Tallgrass prairies used to cover 23% of North America and today, less than 0.1% remains.  It is a globally endangered ecosystem. Since 2009, the number of endangered and threatened in Ojibway have increased from 13 to 21. It achieves many goals of the ESA review’s desired outcomes.
Area Focus 2 – Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
The ESA Discussion Paper’s suggestion that current species’ listing is unclear, causes uncertainty, or not transparent is inaccurate.  Developers are required to complete an environmental report within most municipalities the development takes place. These reports include identifying species on development lands.  Information for endangered and threatened species is readily available at https://www.ontario.ca/page/species-risk. The process is clear.
Sometimes a developer is responsible for delay.  During the noted OMB Hearing above, the developer did not report 4 endangered and threatened species represented by over 100 individuals on development lands in 20-year field studies.  The species were discovered by appellants, attending an approved OMB site visit, just prior to the hearing. As one expert stated “it is disturbing that so many native wetland and rare prairie species were missing. The erroneous reporting and subsequent actions of the developer caused delay.
Area of Focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
The ESA Discussion Paper’s suggestion of longer time lines for species recovery policies will further hurt species.  Since 1970, over 70% of vertebrates and 83% of freshwater habitats have been wiped out respectively. We are simply running out of time. Also, the discussion paper states habitat requirement is not necessary, however, planning processes i.e. OMB and/or tribunals, may only consider regulated habitat, not general habitat.
In the OMB case, the developer was aware of species recovery polices but pushed to alter the ESA permit boundary lines, stating “snakes have not been observed in the small area”.  Species were found in this area but it will now serve as a truck entrance.
Area of Focus 4 – Authorization Processes
The ESA’s Discussion Paper’s suggestion of adding more approval tools (8) for development will further weaken the ESA and further species’ extinction.  One of the biggest dangers with the current Endangered Species Act (ESA), is the ease developers receives an ESA Permit.  During the past decade, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) has denied very few, if any, ESA Permit applications, yet our endangered species list continues to grow.  ESA Permits should be held to higher scrutiny and not approved in every case. In addition, ESA Permits should never be granted when a development is under appeal at an OMB or a Tribunal Hearing.
The ESA Permit provided to the developer above and prior to the OMB Hearing, likely assisted in OMB approvals. A Freedom of Information (FIPPA) request showed that up until April 2014, MNRF was not going to approve an ESA Permit prior to the OMB Hearing as “it would be premature”.  On June 10, 2014, an email from MNRF states the developer threatens to “go political” after the June provincial election if she doesn’t get her permit.  The ESA Permit was granted two months later.
The ESA Permit considers the 4 species on the developer’s lands from construction and roadway improvements.  It does not address traffic, one of the biggest impacts from the development, on these 4 species nor the grasslands additional 17 endangered species.  The FIPPA request also shows MNRF stated this to the developer “For further clarity, this permit process has not considered any impacts to SAR by proposed activities on City owned lands, or lands to be conveyed to the City for road widening as they are external to the lands for which a permit has been applied.”
The developer did not inform the OMB of ministerial considerations, but instead requested a Motion Hearing to quash any Ministerial considerations for its ESA Permit i.e. traffic impacts on endangered. The Board Member, in his final approval states “The Board finds that the Minister of MNRF has determined that the development proposal will provide an overall benefit to the populations of the Butler's Gartersnake and Foxsnake, and outweighs any potential negative impact of snake deaths due to road mortality”.
The quashing of ministerial considerations also caused a very limited use of species recovery plans, even though the developer attempted to quash those too.  This development has been passed without any consideration to the development’s future traffic on endangered species due to premature approval of an ESA Permit and quashing of Ministerial considerations.
The developer’s actions may have caused further delay by ignoring and quashing evidence from MNRF’s Species at Risk Branch Assessment Team Policy for Delayed or Indirect Effects of Roads on Species at Risk Reptiles  “where it is suspected that a proposed activity is likely to result in increased traffic volume …increased traffic volumes should be considered an indirect or delayed effect” and “failing to consider the likelihood of delayed or indirect effects of an activity could increase the risk of the Minister not meeting the legislative requirements”.  As traffic has never been considered, a second ESA Permit is required to provide an Overall Benefit for endangered species from traffic.

22542,/comment/22542,"Good morning -
We have just been reading about potential threats to the Endangered Species Act, about the possibility that a pending review will further weaken its protections for wildlife in the great province of Ontario. We are disappointed that this may be the case and strongly encourage you to consider what this may mean for the current generation and those to come.
Countries around the world are coming to a deeper understanding of the need to balance progress, which has often been measured by further development of business, with protections for resources of all kinds. Progressive nations consider this both in terms of the immediate and the long-term and creative and progressive business models work in concert with these goals and requirements.
Catering to 18th and 19th century styles of doing business dictates that we squander our natural resources because, 100 years ago, these resources seemed as unlimited and the business opportunities to exploit them. These approaches have more than proven themselves not just antiquated in their design but dangerous in their outcome. Business 'progress' should be monitored closely by our governments and considerate protections for our natural resources should preclude development.
The protections we now have in place deserve to be strengthened, not weakened. Business and development is important, to be sure, but creatively and mindfully. New ways of generating growth are modelled for us by those who have been thinking progressively for years. Clearly disqualifying areas that contain threatened wildlife to construction or intrusion is crucial as is protecting areas that may be threatened in the future in this way.
It does not take an excess of brain power to understand - and to fully comprehend - that human expansion, in its post-industrial form - must end. We have to find ways to coexist, peacefully, with the other species and our shared habitats. This is, interestingly, a much easier task than peacefully coexisting with each other.
But we should work on that, too.

Farmland purchased by developers should be the only land allowed to be made into residential, commercial, or industrial development. Farmlands are already pesticide ridden mud-baths which make more sense to develop over, rather than forested lands which house endangered species and maintain a healthy environmental balance to the land we live in. Not to mention our percentage of forested land in SW ontario is FAR below the ideal 30% coverage.
There are even larger impacts of unhealthy watershed from hard-surface (developed) areas and pesticide riddled farmlands. All of these areas drain contaminants into our storm system and ditches then eventually get released into the Great Lakes. If we had a healthier balance of forested lands (30% coverage) our watershed would be much cleaner due to native vegetation acting as natural filters as well as erosion control.

Is a review of the Act necessary?  Absolutely.  According to the David Suzuki Foundation, exemptions from the rules laid out in the Act have been granted to industry ...

22610,/comment/22610,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the review of the Endangered Species Act.
Overall, the City of Kitchener supports provincial efforts to conserve our natural heritage and biodiversity through legislation such as the Endangered Species Act. Comments have been categorized in terms of strengths, challenges, opportunities, and in response to specific questions from the discussion paper.
1. What is Working Well?
Municipalities require the scientific and technical expertise provided by provincial staff in identifying and dealing with Species at Risk (SAR). Provincial ecological and biological expertise regarding individual SAR is critical to problem solving the changes to landscape and habitat inherent to running a municipality (infrastructure projects, land development, ongoing maintenance etc.). It is recommended that this continue to be a service provided by the province, as municipalities are not resourced to provide such specialized expertise at a staff level.
In addition, the development and maintenance of lists of Provincial Species at Risk (SAR) customized to municipalities has been extremely helpful as a screening tool to help us scope what species are of concern in any given part of the province. Overall, MNRF staff are approachable, available and responsive in providing advice and/or direction on SAR in Kitchener.
2. What are the Challenges?
The City of Kitchener has been involved in this process since the first permit was issued under the legislation. In our experience, extended timelines for approval and associated increases in technical study costs are generally happening when new SARs need to be addressed as part of a project. Once the province and the City or private sector project managers have experienced several years / iterations in dealing with a particular species subject to particular types of potential impacts (e.g. urban land development, stormwater management facilities maintenance), approval procedures / processes are developed and become more predictable, quicker and less costly.
In addition, approval timelines can be a significant concern. These should be minimized as much as possible without compromising the intended protections. It is understood, however, that to get the intended protections longer approval timelines may be required. In such cases, clear review and approval timelines or deadlines need to be established up front and adhered to by the province to help municipalities in tendering projects.
While provincial scientific and technical support for Endangered and Threatened species has been appreciated, the same type of advice and guidance should be provided by the province for species that may not be Endangered or Threatened, but have been nevertheless identified by the province as ”Special Concern.” Again, municipalities are not resourced to provide such specialized expertise at a staff level.
There needs to be greater clarity and certainty when provisions of the ESA seem to run counter to other aspects of provincial legislation. For example, in Kitchener some stormwater management ponds are considered habitat for a Threatened turtle species. However, under the Ontario Environmental Protection Act, the Environmental Compliance Approvals (ECAs) stipulate performance and maintenance requirements. These ECA conditions require disturbance to the habitat. There needs to be clear direction as to which legislation takes precedence so that the municipality can confidently plan maintenance activities.
3. Opportunities for Enhancement of Legislation, Procedures and/or Transparency
It is recommended that the province continue to provide easy to understand information for public consumption. The website that identifies which species are protected is great for this and this should be maintained.
In addition, a better communications strategy regarding Ontario SAR and this legislation would improve general public and landowner support for species protection. Communication should be in common language and also create literacy as to what activities are permitted in regulated habitat, as opposed to the common assumption that all activities are prohibited.
As part of an enhanced communications strategy, monitoring of the effectiveness of any efforts to protect species and/or create an overall benefit should not only be undertaken (by proponents, permit holders), but the results should be communicated to citizens in common language as well.
More frequent opportunities for training re: procedures under the ESA should be offered. Municipal staff could be offered training separately, as could particular industries and private landowners. This would be particularly valuable on an on-going basis to address construction practices that do not anticipate SARs properly, and result in construction delays. For example, Bank Swallow nesting in servicing trenches, topsoil piles and municipal sand storage areas have created delays and inefficiencies in recent years.
4.	Landscape Approaches
Landscape and/or multi-species approaches are likely not implementable at the relatively small, often property-by-property scale at which municipal activities occur. This would be more applicable to potential impacts such as forestry or mining, which occur over much larger natural areas inhabited by communities of diverse species.
5.	Listing Process and Protections for SAR
The listing process should remain the responsibility of impartial species experts. It is not a process that can involve non-expert stakeholders or lobby groups. However, better notification of stakeholders (e.g. municipalities) and more notice would be helpful. This may involve better public communication of COSSARO’s Reports to the Minister regarding the classification and any new evaluation of species, as well as considering how, for example, the Ontario Environmental Registry could be better utilized for this type of notification or to provide appropriate notice. This would help proponents of municipal undertakings with long timeframes plan ahead better.
In addition, something other than automatic listing may be appropriate in instances where disease is the main factor imperiling a species, such as in the case of Butternut and myotid bat species, where habitat is clearly not limiting.
6.	Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
Government Response Statements should take advantage of any data / studies that can be provided by landowners / permit holders, especially non-government private landowners, or any approaches to species protection (avoid, mitigate, compensate) that could be piloted by permit holders under provincial oversight. Therefore, taking advantage of this opportunity would likely be impossible within the nine months from the publication of the province’s Recovery Strategy for a particular species.
Longer timelines to permit a review of progress on recovery may be advisable when species are long-lived, cryptic and/or elusive.
Monitoring of the effectiveness of any efforts to protect species and/or create an overall benefit (i.e. 5-year review after Government Response Statement) should not only be undertaken (by proponents, permit holders), but the results should be communicated to citizens in common language.
7.	Authorization Processes
To date, the City’s experience has been primarily with Overall Benefits Permits—especially in connection with urban land development and new road / bridge / sanitary sewer building in greenfield communities. In recent years, we are more regularly involved in requesting regulatory exemptions or a health/safety permit. The Overall Benefits Permit (s. 17(2)(c)) process can indeed be unpredictable and onerous in terms of delays and increased costs.
A potential opportunity would be for better harmonization with other provincial permissions such as those under the Environmental Assessment or Conservation Authorities Acts, or for more routine municipal activities, the Environmental Protection Act / Water Resources Act (Environmental Compliance Approvals).

It is difficult to know how best we can act for the future.  Bearing in mind that the economy is also of extreme importance both now and in the future.  I think though, that a strong economy on a horribly degraded planet is not the right path, better to suffer a measure of material deprivation on a healthy planet.  I am not arguing for poverty by any means.  I know there is more than enough money and food for everyone on this planet.  We just aren't sharing enough and we aren't clear on how best to curb wasteful consumerism and rampant pollution.   Modes of transportation need to change or perhaps we need to travel internationally less frequently, work toward an  end to the use of fossil fuels, and an end to mass agriculture and such a heavy reliance on meat as protein.  I definitely enjoy meat myself, but I see the huge problems that it creates with carbon release and pollution - more than transportation.  I think my boomer cohorts need to buckle up and prepare to sacrifice a few of the luxuries that we expect and take for granted. We boomers in the western world have enjoyed the highest standard of living ever in human history and we need to stop being so greedy. The future of everything rests on the decisions that we make right now.  Time is up boomers, rein in our collective greed.

Ontario is home to 243 species at risk of extinction. In 2013, the province passed an amendment that exempts a broad suite of industrial and development activities from the rules against harming endangered and threatened species and their habitats. In other words, the ESA is already failing to effectively safeguard the habitat wildlife needs to survive.
Changes to the Endangered Species Act should improve protections, not water them down even further. Changes the government should make include:
•  Working with other ministries to ensure coordination to limit cumulative impacts on the lands and waters that provide wildlife habitat.
•  Repealing the long list of exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development, approved by cabinet in 2013.
•  Amending the law to set a higher bar for creating exemptions through regulation by ensuring they cannot jeopardize the recovery of threatened or endangered species.
•  Ensuring local communities benefit from activities to maintain and restore endangered species and their habitat, including rural and northern communities.

22714,/comment/22714,"Toronto Zoo Response to the ESA Review
The conservation of Canadian Species At Risk is a critical focus of the Toronto Zoo. The Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) has thus been instrumental in guiding and supporting our local activities to help species in need. While we agree that in its current form the ESA is not sufficiently protecting species from harm, the MECP’s Discussion Paper focuses on areas that are not likely to improve protections for imperiled species.
Area of Focus 1:
It is not clear what is meant by “landscape approaches”. The current act already stipulates that recovery and management plans can be prepared using an ecosystem approach. How is a landscape approach intended to differ? To what is “landscape” intended to refer? Our concern is that the phrasing of the first area of focus is simply too vague to solicit the relevant feedback required to guide any associated revisions that may be under consideration. Please clarify if landscape approaches are aimed to replace species-specific approaches.
The only challenge to species protection that is clearly articulated in this area of focus is that two Species At Risk could theoretically face conflict if requiring opposing actions but, in our experience, this situation has been rarely encountered. The second challenge presented in this section implies that a solution is being sought to permit potentially harmful activities at a broad scale, which is alarming. Greater clarity on this area of focus is needed.
Area of Focus 2:
We do not agree with the suggestion to lengthen the timeline to listing species strictly to improve the notification process of newly listed species. It would be more effective to focus on communication strategies, such as developing a targeted communication structure that identifies the critical audience and creates appropriate notification channels to ensure that affected members of the public are informed of changes in a timely fashion. Additionally, approaches (e.g. public awareness campaigns) could be considered that would highlight the species that are under consideration for listing, since cases of ‘emergency listing’ are rare. This would provide the public with greater foresight into upcoming changes.
The automatic species protection is an invaluable element of the 2007 Act and removal of this approach would weaken species protection, threatening the persistence of imperiled wildlife in our province. The current ESA stresses the importance of timely action and cautions against delaying the implementation of protective measures. Lengthening transition periods will leave Ontario species at risk.
Area of Focus 3:
We question whether it is actually time or rather resources (e.g. funds to support research) that are the limiting factors impeding development of Government Response Statements. We suggest that providing additional resources to support research and community engagement activities would be more effective in supporting the preparation of these statements.
While species recovery efforts tend to require long-term commitments, based on our experience, we do not feel that a five-year time period is too short to require a progress review. While additional data is likely to be available over longer timeframes, waiting too long to perform a progress review could result in wasted resources in cases where implemented actions are not demonstrating effectiveness. We recommend no changes to timelines.
Habitat regulations offer an important avenue for protecting areas to support the future growth and security of populations of species at risk. Eliminating these in select cases is likely to decrease future recovery prospects.
Area of Focus 4:
There is inherent danger in creating an opportunity to pay into a conservation fund in lieu of activity-based requirements, as this does not necessarily pose equal benefits to Species At Risk. For example, while funds are badly needed for basic and exploratory research on at risk species, these activities do not offset the harm caused by habitat loss. It is essential that activity-based requirements are limited to those with demonstrated effectiveness. Replacing these with a financial option increases the threat to Species At Risk and makes the endangerment of our native wildlife simply a cost of doing business.
Permit requirements outlined in the ESA are comprehensive in nature to ensure that the effects on Species At Risk are carefully reviewed from multiple points of consideration, including not simply survival but also the recovery of species. Simplifying these requirements is likely to lessen positive outcomes and protections for species.

Please stop killing our wolves!
In 1995, wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone; this gave biologists a unique opportunity to study what happens when a top predator returns to an ecosystem. They were brought in to manage the rising elk population, which had been overgrazing much of the park, but their effect went far beyond that. They found that their presence actually benefited the environment around them. ... In Yellowstone, researchers saw that open fields became more vegetated when they reintroduced wolves. Wolves are causing a trophic cascade of ecological change, including helping to increase beaver populations and bring back aspen, and vegetation.
Wolves prey primarily on large ungulates, hoofed mammals such as deer, elk and moose. By preying on the most vulnerable (diseased, young, old, weak or injured) individuals, wolves help keep prey populations healthier and more vigorous (Carbyn 1983).

22729,/comment/22729,"The ESA is not meant to be an economically easy thing to do. The ESA's purpose is to protect species at risk and so it shouldn't be an easy thing to gain access to destroy potential habitat for species at risk. The people of Ontario value the biodiversity and abundance of different species in our province, but over development in Southern Ontario and significant logging and mining projects in Northern Ontario are destroying our pristine natural regions.
Biodiversity and having a well rounded natural ecosystems is vital for natural processes in nutrient cycling, water purification, and improving air quality. excessive development causes many issues with pollution and ecosystem degradation. This can be seen throughout the world in regions that have been overly developed and now choke on smog and pollution. Ontario and Canada is a key immigration destination for many people and part of this is because we have clean air and water (mostly). The ESA is part of the protection that keeps our land clean and desirable, but if we over develop and make it easier for big industry to destroy the landscape, there will be nothing worth staying for.
The ESA is already a well rounded document. The greatest flaw and the only thing that really needs addressing is the implementation of the Act. It needs to be better funded so that people can use the Act the way it was meant to be used. The issues being presented in terms of difficulty in applying the Act and lack of clarity come primarily from poor implementation and use of the Act. If the ESA was to be better funded and if it could be implemented properly, this would fix the issues presented in this revisionary process. It would be cheaper and a better use of time to fund the Act properly than it would be to pay people to rewrite the document. It will also be cheaper in the long run to maintain our natural environments than it will be to develop the land and pay for the consequences down the road.

My comments to the 'WWF Species-at-risk habitat shouldn’t be open for business!"" can be related to the Provincial Government's February 20, 2019 News Release entitled ""Ontario’s Government for the People Hosting Summit on Aggregate Reform""  from John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry.  (https://news.ontario.ca/mnr/en/2019/02/ontario-committed-to-promoting-e…)
My comments from this news release is as follows: (sentences in quotation are direct excerpts from the News Release )
1. ""Ontario's Government for the People wants to hear directly from industry leaders on how the province can cut red tape, create jobs and promote economic growth within the aggregate industry"".
      -  ""Government for the People"" - shouldn't the Government always be ""for the people, by the people""?
      -  ""Ontario Government's Summit on Aggregate Reform on March 29, 2019, to gather feedback from major industry stakeholders""   but blatantly absent is the feedback from affected residents.
      -The previous government had been working on ‘modernizing’ the  Aggregate Resources Act RSO 1990    (May 9, 2017 - Ontario passed legislation today that will modernize the province's resource ... https://news.ontario.ca/mnr/en/2017/05/ontario-passes-legislation-to-mo… ).  Quite sure the industry has already submitted comments to the  MNRF.
2.""Our government is committed to creating the conditions that will help unleash the resource sector's potential.  We want to work with industry leaders on how we can tear down barriers to create an environment for growth and a sustainable resource sector.""
    -The terms ""unleash"" and ""tear down barriers"" will likely result in aggregate anarchy; more dust, more noise, more truck traffic, and further relaxed operating conditions within the Aggregate Resources Act.  Local aggregate pits in and around Erin  are required to protect  the activities  of the Barn Swallow, Bobolink and Eastern Meadowlark, as per the Endangered Species Act (ESA), will this government roll back these protective measures as well?
3. ""Ontario's aggregate industry contributes almost $1.4 billion to Ontario's economy and supports almost 20,000 direct and indirect jobs.  Aggregates ….. create high-quality, well-paying jobs,""
   - a quick Google search  shows about 6 million fulltime jobs and a GDP of some $850 Billion for our province.  The aggregate business represent a mere 0.34% of the work force and less than 0.20% of the GDP.
   - the aggregate jobs, primarily truck drivers, would not constitute "" high quality, well paying jobs"".
Aggregate mining will continue to have a direct affect on our environment, our landscape and our endangered species, especially that aggregate mining is permitted within the Green Belt.   With the already understaffed MNRF coupled with the self-regulated aggregate Industry, relaxing the rules is regressive and somewhat short sighted when it comes to building our future roads,  schools, hospitals and bridges.
I think we can do better!

22740,/comment/22740,"The ESA, in its current state, does not require any changes; these proposed changes, however, weaken the protections provided by the Act. For example, the current Act already considers landscape planning, so there is no need to replace the current species-specific approaches. Also, when dealing with species with declining populations, we must consider the individual effects of management actions. Species, particularly those that are at risk, can have very different habitat needs, and they often vary in their responses to human-induced landscape changes. Thus, shifting to landscape approaches, over ones that are species specific, can result in changes in land management practices that leave numerous at-risk populations even more vulnerable.
Yet another way that the propose changes weakens the act is that it allows the Ministry to apply discretion for automatic listings. Listing species is science-based, which ensures that the scientific rigor used to list all species are near equivalent. By allowing ""discretion"", which is seldom every based in science, can allow this process to become politicized.
Another concern is the change to allow GRSs beyond the 9-month deadline. This failure to meet deadlines is not because the Act is too stringent, it is because of poor implementation.
Generally, poor implementation is what plagues the ESA. One example of this is the suggested change to make it easier for industry to proceed with harmful activities. There’s already an authorization process that can allow industry to proceed with activities, if there is a net benefit to the protected species. Since the act already allows for companies to commence activities when species may be harmed, any issues with current authorizations (e.g., speed, scope) is not a failing it the Act. It is likely because of poor implementation (not enough human resources, for instance).

22744,/comment/22744,"I am writing to address the potential changes to Ontario’s Endangered Species Act.  As a citizen of this province I am gravely concerned with the proposed changes to the ESA, an act which by its nature is designed to protect one of our greatest resources, our ecosystem and our biodiversity.  Our natural systems, including endangered species, are an interwoven web that sustains life in Ontario, including the lives of the people that live here.  Allowing for the encroachment on endangered species and their habitat does a great disservice to the people of Ontario and their children who will inherit a landscape altered by the choices being made today.
The notion that the loosening of environmental regulations will favor business and boost the economy is a short-sighted fallacy.  History is replete with examples of environmental regulations being sacrificed for economic gain, only to result in severe, long-term environmental issues that will affect citizens for generations.
As written, the current ESA is a scientifically sound tool for classifying the species in our province that are at the greatest risk of extinction.  The proposal to shift away from a scientifically based approach to endangered species classification and protection sets a dangerous precedent going forward in Ontario.  Our environment is one of the greatest resources in our province, not for what we can take from it, but how we can live with it.  Our Ontario wilderness and biodiversity is a source of pride for many citizens of the province, and nature itself provides its own direct revenue (in the form of tourism, be it skiing in Blue Mountain, or camping in Algonquin Park) and indirect revenue.  It is this indirect revenue that needs the most protection.  Preserving habitat not only preserves the homes of species at risk, but also protects the pollinators that keep our farms and orchards in production, the birds and bats that control pest populations, the plants that purify our air and water, the wetlands that store carbon and prevent flooding, and the spaces that people use for hiking, boating, fishing, hunting and camping.
The changes proposed to the ESA are signalling that the government is willing to sacrifice the future of our province, and Ontario’s greatest asset, in order to push forward an agenda that serves to enhance the lives of a few at the expense of the many.  Responsible thinking should, instead, push a policy that supports environmental protection and fosters job growth in the environmental sector.  Responsible government is one that accepts the necessity or protecting the environment and adapts an environmental that works with industry and business to move forward in a sustainable direction that allows growth without sacrificing the very thing that makes our province special.
Keep science in policy.
Actually implement and enforce policy, don’t give industry a free pass at the expense of nature.
Hold industry and business accountable for the impact they have on the environment.
Don’t ignore climate change.
The decisions you make today will have a lasting impact on the children of tomorrow.  The environmental well being of our province is of growing important to the people of Ontario.  Listen to the people!  Protect the environment that we all love and cherish.

I am a member of a wetland ecology research lab at an Ontario university, though more pertinently I am a concerned citizen. I am concerned that the revision of the ESA will result in politicization and loss of protections for endangered species in Ontario. Protecting species diversity, including those currently endangered, across Ontario is vital to the protection of our ecosystems which not only provide ecosystem services like groundwater quality but also represent the identity of Ontario. After consulting literature produced by the Environmental Commission of Ontario, I have a few points I would like to bring to your attention:
Changing the law to allow ministerial discretion in automatic protections of species is not necessary.
	- Listing of species as endangered by COSSARO should and already does result in automatic protection of the species under the ESA; no changes in the listing for protection of species are necessary. Listing of endangered species should remain based on science and not politics, and there is already a system in place for review of a listing if ""credible scientific information"" exists.
Existing protections should be enforced and the permit process does not require revision.
	- There already exists flexibility in the ESA permit authorization process; new legislation is not necessary for an efficient authorization process. However, proper implementation should be exercised in the future. Permits that do not in fact meet requirements must be denied. To date, the MNRF has never denied a permit.
New legislation is not necessary for effective protection of endangered species, only the proper implementation of existing laws within the ESA. Please, consider not damaging the effectiveness of the ESA by allowing business to circumvent the laws already in place and harm endangered species and out environment as a whole.
Thanks you for your time.

22746,/comment/22746,"The Endangered Species Act (ESA) already covers all necessary fields to effectively protect and assist in recovery of species at risk. The main issue with the ESA currently is lack of implementation, not lack of regulations or guidelines. The length of time it takes to list a species at risk and develop a recovery strategy is part of the problem. Improvements should be made on equipping agencies that write recovery reports with enough people to shorten the time it takes to assess species and begin the protection process. Providing more funding to the implementation and creating more jobs for scientists to research recovery strategies would help make the ESA more successful as it is currently written. There is no need to change the ESA.
The ESA already covers a multi-species approach which is ultimately a landscape approach. There is no need to change the ESA in this regard. Science-based evidence of decline and recommendations for recovery are vital along with automatic protection of species and their habitats.
The role of COSSARO and the ESA listing process should remain the same. The ministry should have no say once the science shows that a species is at risk, those species should be automatically protected including their habitat.
The recovery policies and habitat regulations that are currently in the ESA are effective and should remain untouched. The current issues in this section, again, are related to implementation, and there is no analysis that explains why these timelines are not currently being met.  The government should be legally responsible to create the Government Response Statements on time. Again, this issue could be solved with an increase in the number of people tasked at writing these statements and reports.
The ESA currently provides enough authorization tools, and challenges should be handled by improved implementation. Paying into a conservation fund to conduct harmful actives is not a fair compensation. Ecosystems take a long time to reach their stable state and once they are disturbed, it can take decades for them to recover.
In general, I feel that without a healthy, thriving natural environment, industry will collapse eventually in the face of anthropogenic climate change. We need healthy natural environments for the ecosystems they provide. Permitting industries to destroy species at risk habitat should be made more difficult as it is very rare that companies can restore those habitats to the same quality of habitat function and services. The ESA is not the place to put industry first. There is no need to weaken the law but rather a need for better implementation. We are not seeing species recovery because we are not actually following the laws already in the ESA and ensuring that once a species at risk is located, their habitat is then protected. The purpose of the ESA should first and foremost be to protect species at risk and their habitats, not encourage business development.

We should not allow landscape approaches ""instead of"" species-specific approaches, because this adds unwanted additional risk for species already in peril.
Changing the law to allow ministerial discretion about automatic protections will politicize the listing process for species at risk, making it more controversial. The laws surrounding the CASSARO listing process should not be changed! This should be a science based process!
There is already a lot of leniency surrounding the authorization process. Challenges should be addressed through better implementation of laws. Do not simplify the exemption process!
Paying into a ""conservation fund"" rather than on the ground conservation and restoration action is ambiguous and makes harmful activities more likely to occur.
Species biodiversity is important for ecosystem service function. Intact natural areas with species diversity are important for ecotourism, getting people outside, and improving mental health.

22749,/comment/22749,"The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a critically important piece of legislature, recognizing the value of species diversity and ecosystem integrity. A significant amount of time, effort and expert knowledge went into creating the legislature, and little to no changes are required to the laws themselves in order for the government and the province to see positive effects for both the environment and our population. Below are several comments on the proposed changes stemming for the ESA Review from the perspective of career professional with post-graduate education in ecology, as well as a member of the community from a farming background.
1)	The law should NOT be changed to allow ministerial discretion in the listing and classification process. Science-based species listing is a critical component of the evidence-based ESA system, that is stronger for not being subject to short-term political pressures. Alternatively, efforts could be focused on improved communication of upcoming and current listings through multiple channels to potentially interested or affected parties. This would minimize any perceived negative impacts and provide more time for accommodating action.
2)	The existing timelines for providing response statements and reports on progress are reasonable and important for transparency and accountability to government and policy makers, as well as tax payers and community members. This is important for encouraging effective and efficient use of time and resources to achieve the goals of species and habitat protection. Furthermore, timely reports on effectiveness of the implemented changes allow for adjustments if changes are not effective. There are already options in place for circumstances when longer periods are necessary.
3)	The most important feature of the ESA that needs to be maintained is the regulatory framework and authorization process. The entire point of the ESA is to protect species and their habitat – and this can most effectively be done by preventing future loss of habitat. Intact wildlife habitat provides many ecosystem services beyond the habitat for the respective species at risk. For example, wetlands, streams and healthy riparian zones reduce flooding risk and intensity, maintain water flow during dry periods, remove excess nutrients and harmful pollutants from water, the vegetation contributes to cleaner air, in addition to the socioeconomic benefits we enjoy from experiencing these environments. There are numerous examples from Canada and around the world demonstrating: large economic costs associated with the destruction of these types of environments due to loss of these ecosystem functions, and the costs and challenges associated with trying to rebuild or restore these systems. The most effective strategy is protecting and maintaining these habitats in the first place.
There should be NO changes to the law making applications and approval of permits easier.
Implementation of habitat protection on land that is already privately owned could be improved, with incentives and long-term planning to protect essential habitat in such a way that farmers are not negatively impacted in the short term.
The beauty and diversity of the natural environment have been described as an identifying feature and source of pride for Canadians. Citizens care about the protection of our natural environment, both for it’s own sake and because of the numerous health benefits it provides in the form of numerous and varied ecosystem services.

RE:  10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143
To whom it may concern,
On behalf of Lavern Heideman and Sons Limited, thank you for the opportunity to comment on ERO number 013-4143. As a member of the OFIA we look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
We are in full support of the OFIA’s recommendation of permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), through a perpetual Section 55 Regulation.
On our own licence we see our harvest operating window continue to shrink and this has a direct impact on our work force and log deliveries. It is our understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. It is our hope that we can work with the MNRF to improve restrictive prescriptions regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Sincerely,

22803,/comment/22803,"I do not support the current 'open for business' approach we are seeing in Ontario environmental policy, particularly in the ESA. Deregulation to make it easier for industry and development, at the expense of irreplaceable habitat and species, it not something I support for Ontario's future.
The ESA, as it currently is, needs to be more strongly implemented - the MNRF should more often deny permits for activities that harm or harass endangered/threatened species or threaten their habitat. Too often a lack of implementation makes our laws weak, and in the face of climate change and accelerated habitat destruction we can not ignore the synergistic effects this has on our natural world. The law should not be changed to authorize harmful activities at a broad scale, as this doesn't allow for site- or species-specific assessments and leads to unnecessary additional risks for species that are already endangered.
Further, there should not be a change to science-based listings and automatic protections. There should be no change to the ESA regarding the listing based on a consideration of the best available scientific information. There should not be an alternative to automatic species and habitat protection, especially not through ministerial discretion to remove or delay protections.
Species listed as endangered are already in considerable peril and require immediate action to reverse their decline. There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce Government Response Strategies within nine months of the Recovery Strategies, or the five-year reporting requirement. There should not be a change to the legal provisions for habitat regulations. Protecting areas where the species has previously or is capable of living strengthens our capability of recovering populations of endangered species, and should be strongly enforced.
Intact ecosystems provides thousands of free benefits (i.e. pollution regulation, food, tourism, nutrient cycling) that already provide a benefit to business, industry, and society at large. Species are an integral part to ecosystems and they should be protected. The priority of this act should be on protecting and recovering species at risk. There is no room to make it easier for development or industry to circumvent regulations, or conduct harmful activities. There is ample evidence that paying into a fund in exchange for conducting harmful activities does not lead to species recovery or habitat protection. Protecting species and preventing habitat loss should be the main priority of this act.

22804,/comment/22804,"Re:  ERO # 013-4143, MECP’s 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act
February 23, 2019
I have been involved in studying, monitoring, writing about, advocating for and actively protecting species at risk for more than 40 years.
During the ten years since the implementation of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act (ESA), I have noted numerous occasions during which the implementation and enforcement of the act fell far short of actually protecting and recovering specific species at risk.  A careful reading of the current discussion paper reveals that, rather than improving matters for species at risk in Ontario, the proposals are likely to make them worse.  The proposals, which appear to be strongly focused on facilitating avoidance of compliance with the spirit of the ESA, seem to be aimed at advancing business and economic interests through increased deregulation.
I therefore urge the government to commit itself to using the ESA for the actual protection of species at risk.  The set of proposed changes to the act appear geared to making a public show of pretending to improve protection for species of risk while actually moving towards authorization of increased harm to such species.
The focus of this legislation and its implementation must be the interests of species at risk, not economic interests.  Instead of making changes to the legislation, I urge the government to provide sufficient resources to implement and enforce the act as actually intended, for the benefit of species at risk.
Here are some specific comments:
Focus 1:  Landscape approaches
Many species at risk have very specific requirements that would be detrimentally served by a landscape approach that grants broad-scale permission over a wide geographic area for actions harmful to species at risk in order to facilitate business interests.  Many species at risk, if they are to be successfully recovered, need to have their issues addressed individually.  The legislation should not be changed to fast-track detrimental actions and apply them over wide areas.  This very much goes against the purpose of the act.  Retain existing legislation and use enforcement tools to focus on actions of actual benefit to species at risk.  If a landscape approach is used, it must be to set aside large tracts of land in order to benefit one or more species at risk.
Focus 2: Listing process and protections
The listing process is well established and has been working well for many years.  A big problem lies in the implementation of protection and recovery for listed species, after they have been listed.  Some threatened species still do not have a recovery strategy ten years after listing.  The legislation does not need to be changed; rather the government needs to make an actual commitment to the spirit of the legislation and to allocate adequate resources to ensure protective actions are taken on behalf of listed species.  When some listed species have been sitting on the shelf for as much as ten years waiting for a recovery strategy it is disingenuous to suggest that changes need to be made to build in further delay before species and habitat protections are implemented.
Focus 3: Recovery policies and habitat regulations
There is no need for changes to legislation here.  Instead there is great need for the government to put resources towards implementing the provisions of the act to carry out recovery and enforcement in the interests of species at risk.
Focus 4: Authorization process
What is needed is more consistent commitment to benefit species at risk.  What is not needed is increased opportunity for political decision making that would negatively serve species at risk while favouring business and political interests.  There is no need for legislative change, only better implementation and enforcement.  The focus of the act must be the protection of species at risk, not the facilitation of business interests.  The concept of payment into a “penance” fund should not replace the requirement to provide truly meaningful benefit to the particular species that is actually harmed.  Currently, some of the mitigation required is worse than useless (as it does no benefit to the species at risk and wastes money).  Authorization to carry out activities that harm a species at risk should never be allowed unless there is mitigation implemented that actually benefits the harmed species.

    As a citizen of Essex County , I am   very dismayed with our Endangered Species Act, in that it has  apparently failed to  save   Endangered Species in  our  County (Essex ).There has been an ongoing battle to stand up for all the  Species at Risk in one of our  significantly  endangered   areas in our county. The  Ojibway Nature   Reserve and Prairie in the Windsor , Ont . area    has over 4000 species, 160 are at risk and  21 are on the endangered list. Why are we allowing a Big Box  complex next to it if we care about these endangered and   at risk species? What is the  Endangered Species act doing to protect these?  I really don't get it. The   increased traffic on   Matchette  Road will be one of the biggest threats,  why cannot this road be closed if the  Big Box store is going ahead?   Why is this being ignored when  our Species are slipping away every single  day.   Please do  more to protect these rare   plants, animals and amphibians. They will be all gone in a few years if this continues. I see other Provinces making  Turtle crossings and many concessions to help protect  nature-what is Ontario doing?    I urge you to look at this area again. We need your help, we need a stricter  Ontario Endangered Species Act, not. a more lenient one.  Sadly, this Big Box store could go in  areas where  empty stores are sitting , already on empty  concrete lots. Since  the first of this year Windsor has lost the  following big name stores, Bombay, Home Outfitters,  Bowrings,  and many smaller retail outlets. Sears went last year Many are on the verge of closing  due to the impact of on line shopping.. Why are we endangering our wildlife, plants and  reptiles when there is a downtrend on retail outlets?.

City staff is supportive of protecting and recovering the province’s species at risk. The 10 year review is an opportunity to further Ontario’s commitment to protecting species at risk and their habitat.
Our comments are:
“Area of Focus 2 – Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk” identifies “ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for threatened or endangered species, or its habitat.” Currently, an independent committee of experts called the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) assesses species and classifies them appropriately on the Species at Risk in Ontario List. The Endangered Species Act provides automatic species and habitat protection for species listed as endangered or threatened. To allow ministerial discretion to remove these protections for threatened or endangered species is counterproductive to the expert opinion provided by COSSARO, which takes into account the best available scientific information, including community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge. Applying, removing or temporarily delaying protections for threatened and endangered species should remain science-based, not discretion-based. There is already flexibility in place through habitat regulations and permitting on a case-by-case basis such that ministerial discretion should not be required.
“Area of Focus 4 – Authorization Process” identifies developing a conservation fund in lieu of activity-based requirements for species at risk to reduce burdens and delays in the process. Currently, when activities that harm a species at risk or their habitat are undertaken, an on-the-ground direct benefit to the species that is being negatively impacted, ideally in the same watershed, is the requirement. Recommendations for these requirements are often identified through subwatershed studies and/or environmental impact statements prepared in support of the project and the developer/proponent is responsible for providing the ‘end product’ (e.g., restored or created habitat) regardless of the cost. It is unclear how a conservation fund would be administered, who would administer it, if enough money would be secured from the proponent/developer, or how such a fund could ensure that on-the-ground direct benefit to the species being negatively impacted would be achieved within the same subwatershed if it was administered across a large geographic area. If this fund is pursued, clear requirements would need to be developed.

22862,/comment/22862,"The St. Clair Region Conservation Authority is located in southwestern Ontario and includes the Sydenham River watershed and smaller watersheds draining directly into southern Lake Huron, the St. Clair River and northeastern Lake St. Clair. Our position in the Carolinian Life Zone means we have a high percentage of Ontario’s species at risk. This area also has a highly modified landscape with limited protected area, so it is essential to maintain and protect existing natural heritage features and the species at risk that inhabit them.  All species, including species at risk, depend on functioning, resilient ecosystems to survive. The primary cause in most species’ decline in the province is due to habitat loss and degradation. The ecosystems which provide habitat to all of our species provide numerous irreplaceable benefits such as air and water purification, soil stabilization, flood prevention and climate change mitigation.
SCRCA supports the Ontario government’s reaffirmation of “its commitment to protecting species at risk and their habitats” (Ontario government’s January 18, 2019 press release, https://news.ontario.ca/ene/en/2019/01/ontario-taking-steps-to-improve-…) and we look forward to a clear conservation-based mandate for the ministry and increased communications and resources for landowners with respect to species at risk.
SCRCA supports the application of the precautionary principle to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). As noted in the ESA R.S.O. 2007 preamble: “lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat.”  We are in support of science-based assessments of the current status of species, and proposed actions to assist with their recovery. While all of the desired information may not be immediately available for all species, delays in listing species and initiating recovery actions will only result in further imperilment of the species. Once more information becomes available, the ranking of species can be changed, or removed from the SAR list altogether.
The government should increase support to SCRCA to undertake activities to protect and recover SAR through funding, agreements, permits (including conditions) and advisory services. SCRCA is uniquely positioned to help support the goals of the Endangered Species Act by implementing actions outlined in Recovery Strategies and Government Response Statements. In many cases, goals and objectives of SCRCA’s existing programs and expertise align well with priority actions identified in Government Response statements. As watershed-based resource managers, SCRCA staff are able to contribute local watershed expertise in a cost-effective and efficient manner. Since the Authority is organized on a watershed basis, projects sites are always relatively nearby, meaning that travel costs are minimal. SCRCA also leverages funding from private and public sources at all levels of government towards projects. SCRCA owns 1,600 hectares of land and manages over 2,696 hectares.  Much of this property, is conservation land containing many Endangered and Threatened species at risk occurrences.  In the past, SCRCA’s species recovery actions have been supported through the Species at Risk Stewardship Fund. Increased funding to SCRCA and other on-the-ground partners will have meaningful impacts to the recovery of species at risk in Ontario.
The Provincial Policy Statement dictates that natural heritage systems shall be identified, and that the diversity, connectivity and long-term ecological function and biodiversity of the systems should be maintained, restored or, where possible, improved. Through natural heritage advisory agreements with our 17 member municipalities, SCRCA is supportive of a landscape-based approach for protecting the remaining habitat for species at risk in our watershed. The Province can provide support to municipalities to update their natural heritage mapping and strategies to help retain natural heritage features to support species at risk populations.
The concept of conservation banking has been proposed as a potential strategy for offsetting impacts to species at risk. This should only be considered as an option after steps have been taken to eliminate and minimize potential negative impacts. The province should carefully examine and provide direction on conservation banking, with input from Indigenous communities, municipalities and stakeholders. If it decides to enable conservation banking through law and policy, it must address such issues as governance and oversight, limits to offsetting, equity, transparency, the mitigation sequence, establishing equivalence, monitoring and enforcement.

Protections to species should be made to help the recovery of already endangered species and protect others from falling down that path.

22871,/comment/22871,"For the past decade, the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 2007, has provided formal means of protecting Ontario’s 243 at-risk species and their habitats. At the Huron Stewardship Council (HSC) we work to recover populations and protect habitat for several species at risk, in a manner that promotes long-term resilience. Since the inception of the ESA, we have provided valuable information that has assisted with listing decisions and the development of recovery strategies for multiple species. While we support ongoing and unbiased review of any legislation, many of the questions presented in this discussion paper strongly imply that the ESA is a burden and point to weakening protections as the way forward. We urge the reviewers to uphold their mandate to protect Ontario’s land, air, and water, as a means of building “healthier communities and economic prosperity” and maintain a science-based approach to assessing species at risk.
Area of Focus: Landscape Approaches
We agree that adopting a landscape approach is a reasonable means to obtain multi-species benefits. However, this should be seen as a compliment to existing recovery strategies and habitat protections rather than an alternative, as a landscape approach requires detailed knowledge of individual species habitat needs and populations. By developing a detailed understanding of habitat requirements for individual species, we can model these requirements and prioritize areas where they intersect for multiple species. If a landscape approach is adopted, it should also mandate buffering existing species at risk populations with large, well connected, natural corridors.
Recommendation: Implement a landscape approach to species protections as a compliment (rather than alternative) to existing protections, focusing on large, well connected natural area networks.
Area of Focus: Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
Increasing transparency and public notice in the listing process may benefit businesses in their ability to manage risk and uncertainty but may further imperil many species. As a worst-case scenario, this decision could potentially lead to persecution of species considered for listing in an effort to avoid future costs associated with protection. Additionally, there is no reasonable case in which a minister should have discretionary power over the application or removal of protections. To allow this would be incredibly shortsighted and would set a dangerous precedent for the ESA to only be applied where it is convenient.
Recommendation: Automatic protections for species at risk should remain, and the minister should absolutely not have discretionary power to remove or delay these protections.
Area of Focus: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
Lengthening the time for species listings with no formal protection in the interim would hamper recovery efforts. We know that monetary costs for recovery efforts are often high. With longer timeframes for assessment and no formal protection in the interim, there will undoubtedly be further declines in populations. In turn, this will lead to even higher recovery costs, and in some cases, will make recovery unattainable. In all cases, additional data collected over a timeframe longer than 5 years would help with effective reviews of progress. If the province truly has interest in gathering long term data on species at risk to contribute to more thorough review, funding for species at risk research or monitoring must immediately be reinstated and expanded. We believe it is reasonable to expand timeframes if 1) funding for long-term data collection is established, and 2) protection for SAR habitat is increased to prevent further decline before a statement can be prepared.
Recommendation: Longer timeframes for statement development are reasonable, with the caveat that immediate protections should apply in the interim. Additionally, funding for species at risk research and stewardship must be reinstated and expanded to allow for effective and long-term data collection.
Area of Focus: Authorization Process
The wording of the discussion questions here indicate that this government intends to allow businesses to circumvent the ESA and be able to conduct activities with direct and measurable, negative impacts for species at risk provided they pay into a conservation fund. A conservation fund is decidedly not an appropriate alternative to protections for individual species. Setting guidelines for individual species habitat protection combined with better funded enforcement should supersede short term interests of businesses.
Recommendation: A conservation fund is not an appropriate alternative for individual species protections but could be combined with protections to create landscape-level protected area networks.
We urge you to please avoid favoring short term economic benefit over our natural environment and strengthen protections for species at risk, while establishing landscape-level network of protected spaces.

Currently, management systems such as caribou mosaics (DCHS) are forcing wood to be harvested when it should not be and reduces wood supply available. This not only deters investment, but it is inconsistent with combating climate change.
We are not creating forest management plans for generating economic activity, rather we are developing caribou habitat plans.  This is an environmentally false approach.

"" Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ESA review discussion paper. Though I support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.

22883,/comment/22883,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. I look forward in seeing improvements to the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to the forestry sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, below are other requirements that should be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is my understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. I expect that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further I am concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with impacted stakeholders and First Nations well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.

22884,/comment/22884,"The “Big Picture Protected Areas Strategy for Ontario’s Carolinian Zone” developed in 2018-2019 with the involvement of over 60 different government agencies, First Nations and NGOs would address many of the challenges identified in the “10th Year Review of Ontario's Endangered Species Act (ESA) Discussion Paper”.  The strategy’s recommendations would also help the Province of Ontario meet international protected area targets (17% protected by 2020) signed by the federal Conservative government along with 193 other United Nations members in Aichi, Japan in 2011.
Ontario’s Carolinian Zone (from Toronto to southern Lake Huron south to Lake Erie) is home to at least 165 different species at risk – that’s over 70% of Ontario’s total.  Many of these species are found nowhere else in Canada and are critically endangered.  Why are there so many species at risk in Ontario's Carolinian Zone?  Primarily because of habitat loss.  Right now only 16% of the Carolinian Zone is natural.  Widely accepted guidelines recommend 30-50% natural for healthy landscapes.
The key to reversing the trend of habitat loss and biodiversity decline in southern Ontario is to invest in expanding the protected areas network and to develop and implement changes to policies and incentives that effectively create a balanced and secure economic environment for the business sector, while protecting and conserving healthy natural assets and ecological goods and services.  The fact is: robust, healthy, functioning ecosystems (“natural infrastructure”) do much more than protect biodiversity and species at risk.  Healthy, robust ecosystems mitigate against flooding and severe weather events, sequester carbon, provide cooling in summer, reduce erosion, improve soil quality, provide clean air, clean drinking water, support a robust tourism and recreation economy, improve mental and physical health, and improve the ability of young people to learn.
If the following proactive recommendations were adopted by the Province of Ontario and integrated with an updated ESA, species at risk recovery rates would be greatly enhanced, fewer species would be newly listed, costs to effectively protect and regulate them would level off and decline, and greater clarity and reduced approval costs would contribute to expanded yet sustainable economic opportunities across Southern Ontario:
•	Undertake major financial investments (e.g., >$250M/yr, in collaboration with federal and private sector) combined with appropriate legislative and policy changes (below), to protect or permanently conserve as natural habitat at least 30% of each ecodistrict in Southern Ontario through land securement, conservation easements and/or stewardship agreements by 2035.
•	Develop legislation and establish provincial land planning policies that provide long-term certainty in land use.  Specifically, expand “Greenbelt” concept to all of Ecoregion 7E (the Carolinian Zone of Ontario), but consider re-naming and adapting the expanded plan area in such a way that is welcomed by the primarily rural Southwestern Ontario communities it impacts.
•	Establish a mechanism for tax breaks for farmers and other rural landowners to set aside portions of their properties for ecological restoration.
•	Revise Provincial Planning Statement and any other relevant legislation to allow and encourage conservation severances (i.e., simplify process to allow landowners to sell natural or restorable habitat portions of their properties to land trusts, conservation authorities, etc.). Promote the use of conservation severances to municipalities.
•	Update the Drainage Act to ensure that it does not contribute to further wetland loss, nor the degradation of habitat in protected or otherwise ecologically-significant areas.  Specifically, explore opportunities to use the Drainage Act to fund and implement ecological stream channel restoration projects in degraded or hardened systems.
•	Provide robust financial support to stewardship and restoration incentive programs.
•	Create, legislate and apply a thoroughly-researched, evidence-based, fair payment formula for Ecological Services mechanism that is revenue-neutral, in which Ecological Services beneficiaries (e.g., mostly urban residents) pay Ecological Services suppliers (i.e., mostly rural landowners).  Note:  There would be little or no Ecological Services “expense” payment for sites under public ownership (i.e., if the network of protected areas on public land is sufficiently large, there is zero Ecological Services cost to taxpayers, and everybody wins).
•	Develop and sustain a standardized accreditation program (in collaboration with private sector NGOs) that defines and monitors eligibility for payment for Ecological Services and tracks land protection and conservation programs.
•	Ensure that municipalities establish natural heritage systems in their Official Plans that conserve functioning ecosystems -- not just isolated or fragmented “environmentally significant areas” -- that are vigorously enforced through land use planning, zoning, bylaws and monitoring processes.
•	Develop and implement outreach and education strategies that are rural- and farmer-friendly.  Farmer-to-farmer outreach typically works best.
•	Support existing partnerships that are in place between the agricultural communities and conservation communities including funding programs.
•	Build on existing efforts to establish a strong, lasting partnership between the conservation and agricultural sectors that demonstrates an understanding of farmers’ perspectives, particularly in relation to difficult issues (e.g., the Endangered Species Act).
•	Promote the economic benefits of maintaining portions of a farm in a natural state. Work with existing farm-oriented groups to develop and share outreach materials.
•	Encourage agribusiness to employ precision agriculture techniques to identify unprofitable portions of farm properties, and to work with conservation groups to restore such portions to habitat that supports native biodiversity, with conservation agreements or easements in place.

Area of Focus 1-Landscape Approaches
1. Both case by case and broad approach are needed, as each life is connected.
2. Broadscale authorizing of activities could be problematic.   Ignoring ""a few"" members of an endangered species is a bad idea.  The entire habitat should be preserved.  Wildlife corridors are essential.  Bridges and tunnels under roads are needed, as are green roofs.
Area of Focus 2-Listing Process and Protections For Species At Risk
1. Post all your news on Social Media.  Endangered species is science, not public opinion.
2. Absolutely do not delay protection.  These species have little time.  People need to change behaviour.
3. People should always try to work with, not against nature.  Automatic protection is needed.  We can always build someplace else.  And if animals are ""pests"", then mitigate conflict in a no kill humane way.
Area of Focus 3-Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
1. These species do not have additional time.  Group discussions are good to create a conservation strategy.
2. Long term research is needed, but protection is needed right away.
3. Protection is always warranted.  We can build on non sensitive areas.  We can not get endangered species back.
Area of Focus 4-Authorization Process
Health or safety permit, s. 17(2)(a):  Killing ""problem"" animals only leaves more of the species to come in and create the same conflict.  Remove attractants and change human behaviour instead.
Protection or recovery permit, s. 17(2)(b):  This is tedious for licensed wildlife centres.  Permanently grant them this permit for all species as part of their rehab licence, instead of permitting licensed rehabs case by case.
Significant social or economic benefit permit, s. 17(2)(d):  Replace this permit with legislation that ensures all development must be environmentally friendly.
Regulating exemption, s. 55 There should be no loophole exemption to obtaining permits.
1. Destroying the environment can not be mitigated by giving money to a charity.  The damage is done.
2. Permits exist for a reason.  Negotiations can be made, but industries must put the environment first.
3. More rules are better for protection.  Find a way to do business with minimal to no impact,
4. Create a website that lists all the rules in a searchable Google question type way.
5. When cruelty to animals happens, when animals are injured, partner with OSPCA, wildlife rehabs, humane societies, humane animal services, and other animal protection agencies.  Work with Animal Justice to create a PAW Act (Provincial Animal Welfare Act).

22888,/comment/22888,"On page 48 of the Environment Plan the Government says:
“We will protect and enhance our natural areas, support conservation efforts, continue to conserve species at risk, develop adaptation strategies, and promote the importance of healthy natural spaces for future generations to use and enjoy.”
The previous government talked the talk, but did not walk the walk.  I trust this government will do what it says in its Environment Plan.   However, given the discussion questions in the Discussion Guide, I am not so sure that it will.
For example, page 2 of the Guide suggests there are modern and innovative ways to protect species at risk.  I am unaware of any nor does the Guide provide a source for this assertion.  This is troubling.
The Provincial Government should be promoting strong adherence to the ESA’s original purpose to protect species at risk; should be removing the exemptions to Ontario Regulation 242/08 introduced in 2013; and should be implementing the policies of the ESA in a timely fashion.  It should not be further weakening the law.  Many of the “activities” referred to in the Discussion Paper pose threats to species at risk by allowing their habitats to be damaged or destroyed.
FOCUS AREA 1
There are promising ideas behind a landscape approach to conservation.  These can be costly as they require restoration and exclusion.  It is unclear where in Ontario, particularly the heavily settled southern portion, this could take place.  It may be appropriate in the north, but the south may require a different approach.  One size may not fit the entire province.
In addition, the ESA (c. 6, s.13; and c.6, s.14) already provides for landscape-level planning, in its multi-species recovery strategies, for example.  Therefore, no change to the ESA is required.  The fine-scale of species-specific status assessments, listings, and protections is essential in the law.
FOCUS AREA 2
Regarding notice and listing it is troubling to read that there are concerns about notice.  Perhaps the issue is that in this age of distributed media, there is no one place for the government to advise the public.   All of us desire to be notified personally of matters that affect us, but at a certain point, we have a responsibility as citizens to look for information.  Having said that, perhaps when notice of license renewals are made citizens can be directed to a government web site that has public notices.  A single “411” web site might work not just for this Act but for other government measures.
Regarding the science, I am troubled to read that there is a suggestion of doubt placed in the independent scientists on the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario.  If you do not trust the independent body, why would you trust a partisan body acting on behalf of someone or an organization with a financial interest?
And if you do not provide automatic protection for a threatened or endangered species and its habitat, what is the value of the Environment Plan’s statement that it will protect and enhance our natural areas and continue to conserve species at risk?  The point of automatic protection is to avoid a situation where a delay would allow a bad actor to destroy the species or its habitat before the protections took hold.
Much of this focus area if implemented would greatly weaken the Act.
FOCUS AREA 3
Right now, species of special concern have no habitat protection and the province is years behind in developing and implementing recovery plans for threatened and endangered species.  This area of focus does nothing to improve that problem.  If general habitat protection was added for species of special concern, it would be an improvement.  However, it would still not address the lack of progress on recovery strategies.  Given very few Response Statements have been developed within nine months, a longer timeframe would do nothing to benefit the species at risk.  It would only deflect criticism that the government is not following its own rules.
•	The required five-year reporting on progress is reasonable and is needed for transparency and accountability.  It is necessary for assessing effectiveness, and contributes to learning and adaptive management.  Therefore, retain this reporting requirement.
•	Additional reporting requirements to propel ongoing action and monitoring beyond the first five years would make sense, and should be legislated.  Therefore, consider a longer monitoring period.
•	No change to the law is required to delay the development of, or to not proceed with, a habitat regulation, as the ESA permits the Minister to take these actions.
No changes should be made to the legal provisions for habitat regulations; they give extra certainty for ESA implementation and enforcement.  They afford a significant opportunity for protection and recovery efforts to be extended beyond areas where species at risk are currently found
FOCUS AREA 4
It is my understanding that exemptions have become numerous under the previous government.  If this practice is to continue, it will be difficult for the government to achieve the goal of conserving species at risk set out in the Environmental Plan.  There should be a clear set of criteria for when the Act can be overridden and when it should not be.  It would be best again if an independent panel or independent experts were consulted.  There are many at Ontario universities and Conservation Authorities.  Any action that has an adverse impact on a species at risk or its habitat must come with compensatory mitigation that will benefit the species and its habitat (Overall Benefit permit comes to mind) or the exemption should not be granted.
•	The requirements for permits for projects that “result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario” and will not “jeopardize the survival or recovery of species in Ontario” should be retained and the permits should be issued only in exceptional circumstances.  Therefore, retain the current authorization requirements for sec. 17(2)d permits.
Make the requirements for exemptions through regulation more stringent by amending the law to ensure that exemptions are based on providing an overall benefit to species at risk and cannot harm their survival or recovery.
•	Give enforcement officers the authority to inspect exempted activities routinely to ensure compliance with legal requirements.
•	Transparency and accountability need to be improved.  Therefore, amend the exemption regulation (242/08) to require all proponents of harmful activities to submit their mitigation plans and annual reports to the government, and make sure that these are available to the public.
•	The ESA does not need to be changed to to harmonize it with other legislative or regulatory frameworks as the ESA already provides a means to do this.
The government can do more by setting aside lands whether through conservation easements or through donations to the Crown that would provide landowners with a financial benefit and incentive to conserve.   More work can be done with organizations like the Nature Conservancy of Canada and with the Federal Government to make this possible.
Finally, some enforcement could be assigned to municipalities or to Conservation Authorities.  Right now, the Ministry does not have sufficient enforcement staff for a province the size of Ontario.  This could be tried on a trial basis particularly in the southern part of the province.
No protection, no securement, no enforcement is a bad recipe for Ontario.

•	I do not support increasing the timeframe for adding SAR to the ESA list; some species can become at-risk quickly and therefore need protection quickly; there are already lengthy processes in place at the federal and provincial levels before SAR are added to the ESA.
•	I believe that BOTH species and habitat protection for END and THR species are appropriate given the scientifically-proven threats to these species.
Focus area 3:
•	While I believe that increasing the timeframe for adding SAR to the ESA list, extending the Government Response Statement period when additional engagement with Indigenous peoples and conservation groups is required may be acceptable. There should be a transparent process for any extensions of the Government Response Statement timeline.
•	I do not believe that consultation with business interests is appropriate in the development of Government Response Statement to ESA recovery strategies, as businesses may be biased against the preservation of END and THR species and/or their habitat.
Focus area 4:
•	I believe that the authorization tools in general are important, however that conservation (i.e. avoidance of harm) should remain the top priority over mitigation and compensation measures.
•	I do NOT support cash-in-lieu / conservation banking / habitat offsetting approaches unless appropriate studies have been conducted to ensure that these approaches will be effective for the SAR targeted. Often SAR require specific and/or complex habitat which is very difficult to re-create, and/or individuals in a population may return to the same site every year and will not necessarily find new habitats.
•	I believe that oversight by Agency staff (MNRF / MECP) is important and should continue; self-enforcement of SAR policies (i.e. by registering an activity and then having no post-registration check-ins on projects or progress) poses too many risks of non-compliance.

22898,/comment/22898,"The Ontario government has set out an objective of reducing red tape by trimming unnecessary regulatory burdens on businesses and harmonizing regulations with other jurisdictions. The government’s 2018 legislation, Restoring Ontario’s Competitiveness Act, targeted a 25% reduction in regulations over the next four years. The government has an opportunity to build on this success and reach its target of reducing red tape through a review of The Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA).
The ESA came into force in Ontario in 2008, with the dual aim of protecting at-risk species and their habitats and promoting species recovery. Over the past decade, the ESA has been criticized for being ineffective at achieving these aims. The ESA has also been criticized for creating barriers to economic development and for being unclear, administratively burdensome, time-consuming and costly. Certainly, as it relates to American ginseng, the ESA is ineffective in both protecting the species and promoting its recovery. In fact, American ginseng is not actually endangered. There are currently 10,000 acres and approximately 3.2 billion plants of American ginseng under production in Ontario alone.
The Ontario Ginseng Growers Association (OGGA) supports the Ontario government review of the ESA. It is time, as the government notes, to improve protections for species at risk, consider modern and innovative approaches to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk, and look for ways to streamline approvals and provide clarity to support economic development. To those ends the OGGA respectfully recommends that American ginseng be removed from the ESA’s endangered list.
American ginseng is a wild perennial plant that can be categorized in four ways:
1.	Wild ginseng: ginseng that has never been planted by humans and that occurs naturally in a forest setting
2.	Wild-simulated ginseng: ginseng that results from planting seeds in a natural setting at a low (natural) plant density with minimal disturbance of the forest floor
3.	Woods-grown ginseng: ginseng that is planted in the woods using soil preparation, fertility, and pest control measures, but which uses the forest as a natural canopy
4.	Field-cultivated ginseng: ginseng that is planted in an open field under artificial shade
Because field-cultivated ginseng was established with the use of wild ginseng seed, there is no genetic distinction between wild, wild-simulated, woods-grown, and field cultivated ginseng.
Presently, the planting, harvest, trade and cultivation of wild, wild-simulated and woods-grown American ginseng is prohibited under the ESA because of American ginseng’s “endangered” status. The prohibition does not apply to “field-cultivated American ginseng”, so long as three requirements are met:
(a) it is cultivated on land in respect of which licence fees are payable to the Ontario Ginseng Growers’ Association under Ontario Regulation 340/01 (Designation — Ontario Ginseng Growers’ Association) made under the Farm Products Marketing Act;
(b) it is cultivated without the use of any material from American ginseng, such as seeds, roots or cuttings, that was taken from the wild in Ontario on or after June 30, 2008; and
(c) it is cultivated using structures that produce artificial shade.
This distinction between “wild, wild-simulated, and woods-grown” ginseng and “field-cultivated” ginseng is arbitrary and dangerous for the species. If the government is looking to enable positive outcomes for the ginseng species, as well as accept current science, reduce unnecessary red-tape, and encourage trade, it should remove American ginseng from the ESA’s “endangered” list and encourage the planting and growth of all types of ginseng.
Historical concerns that allowing wild-simulated and woods-grown ginseng production would harm existing “wild” ginseng populations by introducing threatening diseases have been entirely debunked. Up-to-date science demonstrates that more field-grown, wild-simulated or woods-grown ginseng would not introduce any added risk to the existing wild populations.  Even if infected or diseased seed is returned to a natural setting (i.e. the wild), there is no added concern to the wild ginseng population. This is because any pests encountered in the field are already native to Ontario and are therefore known to the existing wild populations.
The planting and growth of wild, wild-simulated, and woods-grown ginseng should also be encouraged in order to reduce poaching of these roots. Wild, wild-simulated, and woods-grown ginseng is more valuable and desirable than field-cultivated ginseng. There is a significant price-differential paid for wild/wild-simulated ginseng versus field-cultivated ginseng. Based on ginseng markets in the United States, the price for wild ginseng is usually 20 times that of field grown root – a clear incentive for poachers. However, with more wild, wild-simulated, and woods-grown ginseng available, the value of these ginseng roots will drop. This will lead to significantly less poaching of the plant, further benefitting the ginseng population. Presently, the ESA does nothing to reduce poaching of the ginseng root.
The ESA tries to save ginseng from extirpation, but actually hastens that exact result. By banning the planting of wild, wild-simulated and woods-grown ginseng, the ESA does more harm than good to the ginseng species. It inflates the price of wild ginseng and promotes poaching.
The legislation may have been drafted with good intent, but it imposes destructive regulations and restrictions that are simply ill-informed in view of up-to-date science and which do nothing to promote the health of the ginseng species. In other words, the ESA’s categorization of, and prohibitions on, American ginseng simply constitutes unnecessary and harmful red tape. Listing American ginseng in the ESA is a barrier to business growth without an evidence based public policy justification. This is exactly the type of ‘red-tape’ that should be eliminated.
There is an additional benefit, beyond the health and survival of the ginseng plant and the reduction of red-tape, to removing American ginseng from the ESA “endangered” list. A significant majority of Canadian-grown American ginseng is exported to Asian countries (it is believed that well less than 10% of Canadian-grown American ginseng remains in Canada; over 90% of our ginseng is exported). Due to the red tape requirements associated with importing and exporting an “endangered” species, we have seen declining market demand for field-cultivated ginseng. Recent reports indicate domestic retailers have experienced a decrease in sales at an approximate value of $36 million resulting from the red-tape requirements associated with purchasing American ginseng. Removing ginseng’s “endangered” status should result in increased demand for the field-cultivated ginseng root and increased exports.
At the same time, there is currently a global over-demand for wild and wild-simulated ginseng root. In the United States alone, the wild-ginseng trade is valued at $25 million annually. Allowing the production of wild, wild-simulated, and woods-grown ginseng will lead to a further increase in Ontario’s exports. Removing American ginseng from the ESA will therefore have the added benefit of supporting economic development and demonstrating to our trading partners that Ontario is open for business.
Allowing for the planting, harvest, trade, and cultivation of wild, wild-simulated, and woods-grown ginseng will even have positive effects beyond the ginseng industry. For example, the encouragement of an expanded wild-simulated ginseng industry will give motivation to some private landowners to keep their mature forested properties intact, rather than to allow these properties to be logged. Selective logging of forests, a common practice encouraged by foresters on private lands, has the effect of ensuring the demise of any ginseng plants in the forest, as too much light is introduced to the forest floor. Robust education programs that allow landowners to protect and multiply the species could be developed in conjunction with the removal of American ginseng from the ESA.
The OGGA is committed to the success of the ginseng species and is eager to encourage the positive outcomes outlined above. Once the prohibition on the planting, harvest, trade, and cultivation of wild, wild-simulated, and woods-grown ginseng is removed, a certain percentage of OGGA members’ annual ginseng seed could be donated to wood-lot growers or groups like Scouts Canada. This would further accelerate the repopulation of the species by making the ginseng seed more readily available.
It is clearly better for the species, for the environment, and for Ontario’s growing ginseng sector if American ginseng’s “endangered” classification is revoked. Not only are ginseng levels well beyond any threshold level of “endangered” status, but doing so will achieve many positive outcomes, including a safe, maintained, and expanded ginseng population, the reduction of red-tape, and increased economic opportunity.

22899,/comment/22899,"The Ontario Endangered Species Act was once one of the strongest legislations in Canada. It needs to be protected and applied swiftly and diligently. There are too many delays and exemptions being granted. That is what is causing the problems. It would be good for business if the act was applied quickly and clearly because businesses would understand and obey the rules and regulations and they might even get credit from the public for being eco-friendly! Wildlife and habitat conservation is good for the economy. Wildlife provide us with food. Wildlife and habitat conservation are critical for tourism. Ontario's leadership is essential in conserving species at risk such as American eel, freshwater turtles, barn swallow, monarchs, bats and many other species which are at risk of extinction. I have lived in many Ontario communities: Ottawa, Windsor, Hamilton and Kitchener. I love the diversity of the province. I have had family in Timmins, Kincardine, Barrie, Peterborough, Kingston, Toronto and Pembroke. I have driven across the province many times, visited many of the parks, enjoyed the changing landscapes and the unique range of wildlife. I love Ontario for its waterfalls, forests, lakes, rivers, plants and animals. I love wildlife. I believe that the interests of business can best be served by strong and clear commitments to wildlife conservation. Please do not water down this important legislation. We need to co-exist with the wildlife and habitats that provide us with clean air, food, jobs and so much more. Thank you in advance for saving the Ontario Endangered Species Act and the natural wonders of Ontario.

After reading through the discussion paper I believe most of the proposed changes suggest ways to remove most limits for development activities (industrial etc.), and making it easier to bypass protection of the most vulnerable species.
Biological diversity of flora and fauna is important to the resiliency of our ecosystems. Biodiversity is already under threat- from competing land uses, pollution, population growth and human activities.
The province of Ontario should be leading the way in biodiversity conservation, environmental stewardship and responsible management of natural resources for the health of future generations.

22901,/comment/22901,"I am a PC supporter and have contributed to the party in the past.
I understand the “Ontario is open for business” concept and the political importance of differentiating the current PC government from the former fiscally negligent Liberal government.  However, “open for business” cannot mean the deterioration of the environment and loss of animal species.  As a political party, if you cannot execute the “open for business” concept without destroying necessary environmental habitats and rendering extinct some animal species, then please re-think the issues and do what politicians are actually paid to do:  come up with an affordable, workable solution which, in this case, protects wildlife and doesn’t destroy our ecosystem.
There are very few things that all people in all economic brackets and all cultures can do affordably.  One of these things is to take a walk in nature and partake in the quiet enjoyment that this affords.
Please don’t be the political party that robs us of this.  Don’t make a destroyed ecosystem and extinct animal species the PC legacy.
There is only one opportunity to get this right.

22906,/comment/22906,"I have heard statements and read policies coming from this government that show an inclination to favour economic development at the expense of environmental protection — and this worries me.  I spent a decade building a small business and came to resent unnecessary red tape, but I worry about the planet that we are leaving our children and future generations and have never regarded regulations that protect the environment as unnecessary.  Most of people that I know, including many in the business community, feel the same way.  Efforts to roll back environment protections strike us a reflection of unbridled greed.
I see in the discussion paper an inclination to find ways to water down existing provisions protecting endangered species so as to facilitate economic development.  I think this is wrong headed.  Measures intended to protect of species at risk, even when stronger than absolutely necessary, testify to a commitment to a sustainable future, a future in which the planet is no less healthy than it is today - and hopefully healthier.  If you folks haven't noticed, the world is currently in the midst of an extinction rivalling the other major extinctions of the past.  The difference with this extinction is that we can choose to do something about it.  Do your jobs!

Changes to the Endangered Species Act should improve protections, not water them down further.
Your proposed review won’t help species at risk if it doesn’t address exemptions that make it too easy for business and industry to do even more harm to critical habitat.
Clearly defined no-go zones protect wildlife while creating efficiencies for business by making it clear where development won’t be permitted (no exemptions).
We want protections that lead to recovery for species-at-risk in Ontario – we don’t want changes that will drive more species to extinction.

22916,/comment/22916,"I voted for you, Ford. Don't make me regret my vote by weakening this act. The Endangered Species Act needs MORE protection, not less. I value protecting species at risk. It is more important to me than economic development and if you change this act for the worse, I will not vote for you again.
So you want to hear from folks on 4 aspects of protecting endangered species that they pose as challenges to economic development. Here's what I think:
1.   Landscape Approaches
I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2.   Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3.   Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent!

22917,/comment/22917,"Hello. I am the Chippewas of Rama First Nation’s Community Consultation Worker.  We have numerous concerns regarding the 10-Year Review of the Endangered Species Act. They are as followed:
Area of Focus 1 – Landscape Approaches
Species that have been listed under Ontario's Endangered Species Act vary greatly. They are all unique and often need special consideration when it comes to habitat protection. It is nearly impossible to create a blanket landscape approach that would successfully protect all species listed under the act. If a landscape approach is to be utilized it should only be used in the beginning stages of species protection. Certain measures can be implemented using this approach to change the way a landscape is protected. However, as previously stated each species is unique, and often each one needs special consideration when it comes to protection.  Change the way activities are done on a landscape approach but protect individual species with a case-by-case approach. Taking case-by-case protection away from individual species will not fix the act but hinder its ability to function.
Area of Focus 2 – Listing Process and Protection for Species at Risk
The Endangered Species Act lists species automatically once they have been assessed as at risk. Species that are to be potentially listed are reviewed by a panel of experts. These experts have an understanding of these species and their current status in Ontario. The assessment process is rigorous; species are only listed if they are in dire need of protection.
Alerting the public that a species is going to be listed puts that species at a greater risk. Doing this, would allow businesses or individual people time to potentially eradicate that species, in order to avoid the implications that go along with having a species at risk on their property.
""High uncertainty"" and ""costly impacts"" to businesses and the public should be of little concern. Human activity is the reason these species are being assessed in the first place. To ignore a threatened species because of cost impacts is ridiculous. If we continue to do whatever we want many species that need protection will be wiped from the earth. Businesses and the public need to adapt their activity approaches in a more environmentally appropriate way. It may be a burden but people need to be held accountable to the natural world in which we all rely.
Area of Focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
Allowing the Government nine months to create a Response Statement after a species is listed under the Endangered Species Act is reasonable. An unspecified extension to this timeline would allow the government to put species protection on a back burner, offering little protection to the species' that need it the most. A quick response is needed to ensure proper protection.
The requirement put on the Government to conduct a Review of Progress for a listed species within 5 years is also reasonable. Again species that are at risk are in dire need of protection. The review keeps the government accountable to the protection of species at risk.
The development of a habitat regulation is needed regardless of general habitat protections. General habitat is broad and often does not take all of a species needs in to consideration.
Area of Focus 4 – Authorization Process
While the authorization processes under the Endangered Species Act may create administrative burdens or delays, these processes are needed to ensure businesses and the public are approaching their activities in a responsible way. These processes ensure that businesses and the public do not do whatever they want without regard to their activities' impacts on the environment and to the species listed under the act.
The fact that businesses and the public can get authorizations at all should be good enough. The government should not make it easier to get authorizations since the proposed activities likely have detrimental impacts on Species at Risk and the environment at large. Businesses need to evaluate their activities and ask themselves if it is worth going through the processes to receive authorization.

Protect Ontario’s Endangered Species Act. Protect Wildlife. Our economy will benefit by clear regulations, swift responses and improved communications, not by delays and exemptions in applying the Ontario Endangered Species Act, which is a critical backstop against extinction.
1.   Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2.   Species Listing Process and Protections

4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

a.	As directed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) staff, municipalities are responsible for informing proponents of their obligations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).     Through the development review processes, we inform the applicants of their obligations under the ESA, but the City has we have no mechanism/and or authority to verify if they have met their obligations and have complied with ESA requirements.  Given that municipalities have responsibility for natural heritage system planning under the Planning Act and PPS,  City staff would like clarification from the Province regarding the municipal roles and responsibilities in the  ESA permitting process.   Do municipal staff need to be engaged in the permitting process with the proponents and the Ministry?  For instance, if an applicant requires to remove mature trees and there are potential for endangered bat habitat, what is the City’s role? In cases where an overall net benefit is required, can the City work with applicants to encourage that net benefit is provided within the municipal boundaries where such options exist? How do we verify that they have mitigated for any potential impacts?  Please note that there is uncertainty from municipal staff regarding accountability and enforcement of the ESA.

22927,/comment/22927,"As a Registered Professional Forest i would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. I look forward in seeing improvements to the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to the forestry sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, below are other requirements that should be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is my understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. I expect that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further I am concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with impacted stakeholders and First Nations well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.
Sincerely,
A concerned practitioner.

22928,/comment/22928,"The County of Renfrew welcomes a review of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in its 10th year.
The attached documents outlines issues we have observed and experienced, and heard from forest sector stakeholders in our area. Solutions are presented for each issue and are fully described in the document. In summary, these solutions are:
1. Evaluate species populations and determine COSSARO status geographically.
2. More research should take place on actual risk posed by forest management in species at risk (SAR) habitat, particularly Blanding’s turtle, ginseng, wood turtle, and whip-poor-will.
3. Recognize that a coarse-filter, landscape level management approach attempts to provide habitat for all species and aims to emulate natural disturbance patterns. When appropriate, site-level requirements in species at risk habitat must be science-based, evaluate risk, consider other species and values, and be subject to change when new science emerges.
4. Recognize that, in a landscape where fires are suppressed, forest management is the key to maintaining healthy, natural ecosystems. Many species at risk benefit as a result of the disturbances created during forestry activities – whip-poor-will and the Algonquin Wolf are excellent examples. Species protection measures should align with this, not restrict the ability to create or maintain SAR habitat.
5. Evaluate if COSSARO is the most transparent, meaningful and effective way of designating species at risk in Ontario by comparing to methods used for evaluating in other provinces.
If COSSARO is to continue in its current function, include more diverse representation of broader skill sets on COSSARO. COSSARO should include stakeholders such as forest practitioners (Registered Professional Foresters), Indigenous peoples, and others with knowledge and experience on the landbase.
6. Allow adequate time and resources to properly evaluate recovery strategies, complete realistic socio-economic impact analyses, and consider input from stakeholders and Indigenous peoples. These analyses and their impacts should be shared with stakeholders before policies are implemented.
7. As new population data and science emerges, regular COSSARO reviews should occur to determine if a species’ designation should change. The timeline for this should not be extended, and in some cases, may warrant acceleration.
8. Enable the CFSA to act as the legislation that manages for and protects SAR on Crown land in Ontario.
9. Sustainable forest management should be recognized as good land stewardship. Providing clear, reasonable guidance on how to manage forests in species at risk habitat could improve the public’s attitude toward species at risk in rural areas. Develop an effective, positive incentive program for maintaining habitat or potential habitat.

To comment on the ESA review discussion paper, I am writing to strongly support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, but the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.

22940,/comment/22940,"From the Forest Gene Conservation Association: We have submitted many detailed comments within the format of the discussion paper which has been uploaded here and emailed to ESAReg@ontario.ca.  Our detailed comments cover the gamut - from a landscape and species approach to effective government policy delivery to communications with the many SAR protection and recovery stakeholders. We have provided examples based on 25 years of work with the endangered butternut tree in our FGCA long term recovery program, including our experiences working with USA and Canadian researchers, forest industry, nurseries, forest consultants, thousands of landowners and dozens of ESA permit holders.  Butternut has both benefited and been harmed by the MNRF administration of the ESA.  The biggest issue is that MNRF cannot report on what the cumulative effect of 10 years of the ESA has been on butternut. This 10 year review is a significant opportunity to learn from both the benefits and the harm.  There is a need to expedite economic opportunities where real overall benefit can be provided and proven, but to also expeditiously communicate to proponents when activities cannot proceed due to SAR effects.  Overall MNRF and the public need to recognize that even an improved ESA is just one tool - not enough on its own to slow the loss of SAR and natural landscapes that is compromising the ecological services the people of Ontario need. The public need to hear this to be able to adapt their own activities and pressures on these landscapes.

If we do not have healthy ecosystems surrounding us, our species will also die out from lack of clean air, clean water and healthy soils.
The current government may believe that it doesn't matter, there's lots to spare, but in fact they are endangering the health and lives of their (and my) children, grandchildren and following generations.  Do your homework, understand the vital importance (and even dollar value) of healthy green infrastructure.  Strengthen rather than removing the ESA, and strengthen other laws and policies that will protect our environment for now and for future generations of people and wildlife.

We look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy. The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA); either through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector. Thanks.

22949,/comment/22949,"1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate. What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

It is already common for developers to ""take the easy way out"" such as providing ""compensation"" for areas they are developing, with minimal rules and regulations regarding effective this replacement habitat is, the maintenance of buildings such as nesting structures, or the overall quality of these compensations. If compensation does not occur, developers are used to receiving allowances such as reduced buffer zones around Provincially Significant Wetlands or Woodlands. If this is the standard and everyone is cutting corners, can we really say we are doing our best to protect the habitats these species rely on? As a proud Canadian and Ontarian, I am more concerned than ever about the protection of these species in the wake of Climate Change. I know I stand with 1000's of others that feel the same.

A challenge was addressed that on a case by case basis policy approach does not always have a positive outcome for the species at risk. Does this mean we are siding with economic development and destroying habitat? Why is this necessary? Economic development can occur in areas that are already developed, develop and build up instead of out. Be creative and develop buildings that help the environment not destroy critical habitat for endangered species.
In cases where species and habitat protections can contribute to high uncertainty and costly impacts to businesses and the public, this should not be an issue. We as humans need to understand what we have done to the environment and are the main cause of endangered species and should be held accountable for our actions just as we are held accountable for our actions when the issue pertains to human to human interactions. In order for our society to persist we need to have a balance between the society and norms we have developed for ourselves and preserving the environment. We only have one hospitable planet so why shouldn't we be made accountable and pay high costs to maintain species and habitat protection.
The discussion questions in area of focus 2
Longer timelines before a species gets listed should not be the direction the species at risk in Ontario list goes. That could further escalate the problem and the population could decline further. I suggest posting notices of when a species is being assessed to be put on these lists and update their status as frequently as possible (an ideal update would be daily). This way if you are investing time into knowing the species at risk in an area, you can have a general idea of what's coming down the pipeline.
Longer transition period may be a decent idea for automatic species and habitat protections but there should be no delay. There should already be a step by step process so lengthen the timeframe for business owners or the public so no one is left in the dark and everyone has the opportunity to understand what is to come. The longer transition would have to have strict deadlines and consequences for public and business who do not follow the transition for species and/or habitat protections.
I believe there should be multiple reviews from both the government and private companies that perform assessments regarding assessment and classification of a species  by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario be improved as normal practice and update assessments as emerging science and conflicting information come out.

22964,/comment/22964,"The Wilderness Committee Ontario does not approve of the Ford government’s plan to review and change the Ontario Endangered Species Act. The changes proposed were not created with species at risk protection and recovery in mind. Rather, proposed changes would only allow more discretion to the minister and provide industry with more opportunities to destroy species at risk habitat, which will further contribute to extinction. The below paragraphs address the proposed changes and why these are a terrible idea for wildlife at risk.
1. The Ontario government wants to change recovery from case by case to a more broad approach which will be extremely harmful to species at risk recovery. Case by case planning identifies exactly which activities will harm the species and which activities should be avoided and where. Without this fine detail level of planning, protection of habitat will be vague and it will allow industrial activities to destroy once protected habitat for species at risk.
2. A “landscape approach” to migratory species at risk conservation will allow more habitat to be opened up for activities. It is clear the goal of this change is to increase industry activity within species at risk ranges. But there is no way to increase habitat destruction while recovering species at risk. The entire point of an endangered species act is to recover the species. In most cases, the reason for their decline is from human activities. If projects must be rejected or moved to an area of less disturbance than that is what must happen for species to recover. There is no way to open more habitat up for industrial activities and conserve more species — this is obviously an attempt to diminish the protection of species at risk and their habitat.
3. Landscape approaches will result in more species becoming at risk because more important habitat will be opened up for development and industrial activity. In order to avoid more species becoming at risk a case by case approach which protects habitat from industrial activity is the best option. If Landscape level planning is chosen, then the critical habitat of the species at risk must remain protected from development and industrial activities. Absolutely no species at risk recovery plan will be effective if the species habitat is open for destruction.
4. The only change that should be made to the ESA are closing the loopholes and exemptions that began in 2013. The Ford government must end the exemptions and loopholes open to industry, like forestry, that came into effect in 2013 which exempts these industries from following the Endangered Species Act.
5. All species at risk should be added onto the Species at Risk List. There should be no public consultation because it must be a science-based decision. No social or economic opinions should influence whether a species is at risk or not. Anything that allows socio-economics to influence this list will result in the entire law becoming not science-based and severely flawed. Socio-economics can come into the recovery planning later, but the species at risk list must not be influenced by socio-economic considerations.
6. Automatic protection to species and habitat must remain. The government must work to create action plans and once those are implemented the automatic protections can be removed. Without automatically protecting habitat industry will have time destroy this habitat before it becomes protected under a plan. This cannot happen and will destroy the integrity and successfulness of the law.
7. The government wants to extend the timeline to create response statements for an endangered and threatened species. Nine months is plenty of time and extending the deadline indefinitely will likely result in response statements never being produced.
8. The government states that 5 years from the response statement is too soon to review species at risk progress and recovery. Species at risk do not have 5 years for mistakes. We must ensure that the effectiveness of recovery plans are being reviewed as often as possible (at the very least every 5 years) so that we can adjust them if they are not working. If the government is having trouble meeting these goals, they should hire more staff.
9. The Ford government wants to speed up the authorizations and approvals of projects, which should not happen. They also want to decrease the number of requirements for companies wanting to harm a species or its habitat, this also must not happen. They claim that it is creating a barrier to economic development. A thorough review of projects is essential to any healthy environment and to wildlife. There is no way to save species at risk if more projects that destroy habitat threaten species are approved. Speeding up the time for approval and limiting requirements of the application will allow harmful projects to be approved. It will allow companies to be careless and there will no longer be a requirement for projects to avoiding or mitigate impacts to species at risk. The review process of an applicants project must be thorough because if it is sped up and carelessly approved, species at risk populations will continue to plummet. Projects that contribute to extinction must be rejected, plain and simple.

1. Move forward with a permanent section 55(1)(b) regulatory exemption to the forest sector to continue enabling landscape approaches currently being delivered under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA).
2. Working under the section 55 (1)(b) regulation, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) must develop workable species at risk policy delivered under the CFSA that contributes to working landscapes and functioning ecosystems while incorporating socio-economic impact analysis, jointly, with practitioners, affected stakeholders, and Indigenous communities.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
3. Overhaul the membership of COSSARO to reflect more generalist professionals and Indigenous communities rather than academics with expertise in a very limited field of study. Known experts in a particular species, including local MNRF biologists and local RPFs should be invited to participate in the deliberation of species being evaluated by COSSARO at least 12 months before the committee meets to evaluate the species’ status.
4. Develop a clear process for using the “data deficient” category, particularly for species with a wide distribution and lack of data.
5. COSSARO should consider the use of regional sub-populations to account for differences in status across the province, risk to the species and the relative risk of human activities. Populations of species at the normal edge of their ranges in Ontario, outside of their core range, should be evaluated with due consideration of their global population.
6. Add an additional layer of accountability by having the responsible minister weigh scientific evidence provided by COSSARO with the socio-economic impacts before a species is automatically listed and protected.
7. Reassessment of species at risk should be considered when credible evidence has been presented to the responsible ministry beyond what is currently permitted within the ESA.
8. Enable individuals and organizations to report on SAR sightings without the perceived or real fear of being penalized for doing so.
Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
9. The current 5-year review should go beyond simply listing actions that have taken place. A biological review of the species should be included and feedback into the COSSARO listing process.

In March  of 2018 the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) warned that ""Human activity has driven animals and plants into decline in every region of the world, putting our own well-being at risk by over-harvesting and polluting"".
So the review is timely as long as it not only enhances protections of species at risk but also broadens protections of habitats for those species as well as all other species in the province.
The value of nature to our economy by way of ecosystem services needs to be accounted for in any review and this is a modern advancement to do so as it would be very highly expensive to replace those services with engineered solutions. One of the reports found that Nature’s contribution to people can be in the order of thousands of dollars per hectare per year.
“We’re undermining our own future well-being,” IPBES chairman Robert Watson said of the findings.
“Biodiversity continues to be lost across all of the regions of the globe. We’re losing species, we’re degrading ecosystems... if we continue ‘business as usual’, we will continue to lose biodiversity at increasing rates.”
Scientific American published a story on November 1, 2018 regarding the decline of insect populations. According to the article Insects provide 57 billion in US dollars of ecosystem services.
We need to strengthen not weaken or allow corporations, businesses and governments to be exempted from stronger ecosystem protections for the little remaining natural areas in the province of Ontario.
Anyone can look at the world on the Google Earth application and see how little green is actually left on this our only home. Southwestern Ontario was once covered by a massive Carolinian Forest and now very small pockets of green survive on the map....heck next Door in Michigan the map appears greener than the adjacent are in Ontario!
With ever stronger impacts to the health and well-being of every living thing on the planet due to Climate Change we need to put a moratorium on development into current green areas. Lets look at infilling our cities...Many cities and towns are in decline as populations shift from rural to large urban centres due to changes in world economies...we need to review the practice of development for the sake of development ...nature has taken thousands of years (millions in the case of oil)  to accumulate those ecosystem services and to degrade and destroy them further is to not be thinking of the future for future generations of humans and the very species we depend upon for survival.

Both a landscape and species-specific approach are often required to adequately protect species. One approach cannot replace the other. Species-specific biological and ecological knowledge is necessary to learn about a species in order to appropriately protect it. A species-specific approach is critical for assessments and reassessments of the species, understanding the individual recovery needs, and effective monitoring.
There are instances where groups of species can be effectively protected by taking a landscape approach or multi-species approach. This is broad-scale approach is already a provision in the current act. The decision to take a species-specific approach or a more broad-scale approach should be based on the best scientific evidence available provided by research, academics, practitioners and experts in the field.
Area of Focus 2 – Listing Process and Protection for Species at Risk
Automatically listing species and protecting their habitats avoids excessive time and effort on deciding whether a species should be listed or not. This allows more time and effort to be spent on the actual recovery of the species. Delaying protection of species at risk and their habitat puts them at even greater risk, which contradicts the intentions of this Act. In addition, delaying protection of species and their habitat can allow the cause of the problem to continue and therefore increase the cost of recovery.
Challenges mentioned in the discussion paper, such as transparency and public notices, can be addressed by improving communications. The listing process and protection of species at risk is not the issue. The current process of having a third party (COSSARO) assess and recommend species listings based on the best scientific evidence available, consulting academics, practitioners and experts in the field, allows for an independent and less bias assessment. Changes to the protection of a listed species should only be based on this knowledge. Improvements could be made by further inclusion of Indigenous and Traditional Knowledge during this process. However, impacts on business, human activities, and public opinion should not be considered in this decision-making process.
Area of Focus 3 – Species Recovery and Habitat Regulation
When species are deemed at risk, there is a sense of urgency to address the causes. Instead of extending timelines, perhaps the government should invest more into being able to meet these timelines accordingly that enable recovery actions to take place. Progress should be reviewed at regular intervals, however better coordination during the process of the development of recovery strategies and government response statements could be made to ensure meaningful recovery actions.
No changes should be made to habitat regulations. It has not been used long enough to determine how effective it is as it was designed to be used. In addition, there is already discretion in the current Act for the Ministry to delay or proceed with habitat regulations.
Area of Focus 4 – Authorization Process
The authorization process should not be made easier or faster for applicants at the expense of species at risk. The Act should uphold an overall benefit for species at risk and their habitat. A “conservation fund” in lieu of activity-based requirements for businesses often delays meaningful recovery actions for species at risk, therefore hindering their recovery. Activities that may impact species at risk or their habitat require careful consideration and should be able to demonstrate that the needs of these species and their habitat are met and not compromised. Lessening this requirement weakens the Act.
In summary, Endangered Species Act (2007) is a strong and well written Act that is based on the best available science to list and protect species. However, there still remain uphill battles related to the implementation of the Act – not the Act itself. Adhering to timelines, increasing funding for species recovery and enforcing the ESA are examples of where improving implementation of the existing Act should occur.
We are experiencing a global decline in biodiversity, which humans depend upon for survival. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the primary cause for the decline in global biodiversity is habitat loss and degradation. Habitat loss and degradation is caused by the very human activities that this review paper suggests should be more easily permitted. To ensure that the Endangered Species Act protects and recovers species at risk, thereby benefiting all Ontarians, habitat protection needs to be an integral part of the solution.

I am greatly concerned the government may be making it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitat for species at risk.  Any changes to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering species at risk. Please:
1. Repeal the 2013 exemptions for various sectors, including forestry, hydro, mining and development industries.
2. Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species.
3. Do not change COSSARO’s current science-based listing process. The listing of species at risk should not be a political decision.
4. Mandatory habitat protection for threatened and endangered species should remain. The minister should not be interfering with the protection of species at risk.
5. Maintain meaningful overall benefit requirements for species at risk from all development proposals. Proponents should not be able to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm to species at risk or their habitat.
Many species continue to decline across the world and in Ontario and it is our responsibility to protect species at risk. I look forward to seeing an even stronger ESA after this review process.

23010,/comment/23010,"I strongly support a clear and concise ESA that protects and helps to restore species, that through our ignorance or poor land and water management are at risk. We do need new and better ways to manage our interactions with land and waterscapes so that we protect and restore endangered species AND prevent other species from being damaged to the point where they become a new listing. Part of our problem has been our fractured and disconnected planning and management systems that lack contextual understanding of a landscape at a systems level. This was why many of use worked to develop watershed analysis and management so we understood the pathways and processes created by a landscape so we u Dre’s todo how habitat was created and maintained for species. Understanding these functional processes in turn helped to develop better ways to look at developments in a way that did not damage habitat for many species.
This approach needs to be restored and applied, not only for species at risk but also for how we manage water, nutrients, developments, agricultural activities, forests, wetlands, lakes and rivers to provide benefits to us while not damaging important habitats for animals and plants. These plans then provide certainty for how and where to develop.

23011,/comment/23011,"The review proposed of the ESA makes me very nervous. It is positioned to sound like the protection of species at risk is first and foremost, but after reading the discussion paper, it is clear that economic development and making it easier to get through ESA regulations for developers and businesses is the main goal.  We have a duty as Ontarians to protect our natural environment and species at risk. The environment has been destroyed by development in the past where loose regulations were in place, and by removing even more regulations, I fear that what is left of our environment will be degraded further. Every Ontarian benefits from the natural environment through clean air, clean water, erosion control, carbon sequestration/climate change mitigation and pure enjoyment of the beauty of nature. I am appalled to think that this government is trying to lead us down a road to make us believe that economic development and the interest of businesses will benefit us more than protecting our environment. Once species at risk are gone, we can not get them back. Do we want to leave a legacy of losing more species at risk than previous governments? Leaving regulations so weak that species and habitat are destroyed and gone with no opportunity for reversal? Be known as the government that gutted the ESA ?
There are certainly challenges with the implementation of the current ESA, but I do not believe the problems lie in the act itself. They lie in the regulation and implementation of the act. Over the years, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has been gutted to the point that they cannot keep up with the workload required under the ESA.  To me, the solution should not be to streamline processes to make it easier, but to invest in more staff resources to properly dedicate to this important job.
I worry that landscape approaches are too broad scale and will overlook specific requirements of rare species. Each endangered and threatened species has unique requirements and habits. If we take a step back and try to look at it from a landscape scale, for example looking at the whole forest rather than the specific habitat requirement of an Acadian flycatcher which requires forest tracks with open understory. If we look too broadly at a forest and simply look at tree cover, we may ignore the fact that the understory of that forest is full of invasive shrubs like European buckthorn and honeysuckle which makes the habitat unsuitable for that species. By not taking a species specific approach, we risk losing species. Especially in high quality habitats with multiple species at risk, if we do not take a close enough look at each species, there will be important criteria overlooked.
When we think about the listing processes and protection for Species at Risk, there needs to be more transparency and clarity for the public when species are listed.  It should be the governments responsibility to give public notice when species are listed. Allowing longer timelines for species to be listed is very risky and may end up being too late for the species. We do not have extra time to play around with. I am nervous about the idea that the Minister could remove protections for a species and its habitat. The decision to protect species and habitat should be based on science and field based studies. There should be no discussion around whether protecting the species will make it more difficult for businesses. I would like for protection to be based on scientific evidence from experts.
In terms of the length of time for government response statements being too short, I think the answer is clear. Hire more staff and put more resources towards creating the statements. This is a duty of the government under the Act, and finding ways to ""streamline"" the process sounds like a cop out. I do not believe that extending the response time will benefit species, since time is not on our side when it comes to species at risk. If we extend the timeline to allow for further study or if stewardship actions are likely to be completed over a longer timeframe, we risk waiting too long and not having a positive outcome for the species.
Finally I do not think that the idea of businesses paying into a conservation fund is appropriate in most cases. It seems like it will be an easy way to destroy the species and its habitat, while checking off a box to say that the paid into a fund for restoration elsewhere. There is no guarantee that the money in the fund will go to appropriate projects for the same species, or that the restoration works will be successful for the species they intended. This idea sets a bad precedent to say that habitat can be destroyed and simply installed elsewhere. It is much better to protect the habitat we already have than to make new habitat and hope that the rare species will find it and benefit from it.If anything, a conservation fund should be a last resort for cases where a project must go on and all other options for protection and mitigation on site are explored.
Overall I do believe that there are improvements needed to the ESA, but mostly when it comes to how the Act is applied and regulated. I think more staff are required to implement it and work on it. I do not like the idea of streamlining or making things easier for businesses, because this comes at a cost to the species at risk. We do not have the authority to make decisions that could ultimately mean the end of a species in Ontario.

23014,/comment/23014,"Focus 1
In many cases, a more habitat/landscape based approach would bring many benefits. This is most obvious when ones species-at-risk preys on another or when they compete for the same resources. In many cases, the needs to different species at total odds and cannot be resolved in the same physical location.
More land should be conserved for the purpose of simply making it habitat, rather than _______ habitat. If were were able to look back 100 years from now, I think we would be want ourselves to protecting more land rather than simply protecting more species, many of whom have contradictory habitat needs and/or were only common in Ontario in the first place because all the forests were cut down 200 years ago.
Focus 2
I'm not sure if the claim that there is not enough public notice prior to listings is true. The examples I can think of had plenty of time for misinformation to spread far and wide before any decisions were made. Certainly this is the case with the prominent ones. Maybe that's just my impression from being in the conservation community, but I suspect that within the agricultural or development sector, they catch wind of likely listings well in advance of any decisions being made.
The main issue I see with automatic protection of habitat is that often the habitat definitions are nebulous. This leaves too much gray area and with too much potential legislative weight behind it for anyone's good. When the habitat definitions are well defined for the species both in geographic scope and in description, then it's a good thing. There are also some species whose critical habitat cannot be defined so clearly, either before they are too broad geographically or too poorly understood. In these cases, and with proper justification, there should be the option to delay habitat projection until it can be properly researched and defined. In all cases, the habitat definition ought to be something that landowners, businesses, and residents can reasonably accommodate.
Many of the species listed actually rely on human activity, and their recent decline follows a population high that was a direct result of previous human activity (the clearing of much of our forest for agriculture, barns on small abandoned farms, etc). The listing process needs to do a better job of defining the causes of the decline (in other words, the reason the populations were higher in the past). A specific example of that is the Bobolink, which would have found Ontario's habitats extremely unfavourable until about 200 years ago when most of our forests were cleared for small-scale farming and pasturing, but who are now hurt by a shift toward larger scale cash cropping. A number of the most prominent listed species fall under this category.
Focus 3
In theory, strict time-lines for protecting of species and reporting on them is good, and in practice it often is. But there can be some big downsides. The time-line for a recovery strategy is one of these. What if there isn't sufficient information available to determine how best to recover a species? What if not enough is known about a species' habitat but yet a timeline has determined that habitat protection must come into effect? Both of these situations do occur, and often an incomplete or inaccurate habitat definition is rushed out and put into law simply to meet a deadline.
The GRS does, at least in principle, outline the government's obligations towards a species' conservation. And because the government, again, at least in principle, represents not just those most interested in conservation but also everyone else in the province—whether or not they voted for the government in power—it's not a document to rush. Nine months is probably too quick a turnaround, but there should still be a firm time-line, lest a government be tempted to use delay as a strategy for inaction.
Both the GRS and Recovery Strategies themselves should be revisited periodically and, if warranted, revised. A lot can happen in 15 or 20 years and if the guiding documents haven't been updated accordingly, that can lead to guidelines and legal requirements that are out of step with current needs.
In some cases a general habitat definition would apply in lieu of a specific one. But typically different species have different habitat needs, sometimes markedly so. This does highlight one of the downsides of shaping all protection to individual species needs, rather than a broader landscape approach. That said, I suspect that all of the species who would benefit from strong individual habitat projection have already been listed.
Focus 4
There is one glaringly obvious solution to the issues presented in Focus 4: Ensure that district MNRF offices have the staff to do the job.
The district offices have been slowly eroded over the years, but most notably within the last decade the Liberal Government severely curtailed the operational capacity and staff of most district offices. This often prevented the remaining staff from doing their job in a timely manner and resulted in businesses having to wait much longer for permitting than they should have. Simply allowing those districts the funds and staff to see through the authorizations would resolve the backlog.
The exact same root cause is at play with the inability to inspect and enforce: The districts tasked with this job simply no longer have the manpower.
Mitigating actions (Overall Benefit) should also take into consideration the resources of the company applying for the permit. Small local businesses do not have the resources available as large multi-billion dollar multi-nationals and should not be expected to mitigate at the same level. Some overall benefit strategies might also be better if they focused less on the individual species and more on habitat.
Closing comment
Lastly, one overarching piece of advice for the current government: Remember that governments change and it can be quite simple to reverse the decisions of a previous government. If you want your changes to stick beyond the next election (let alone win the next election), you need to make sure that you are adequately involving the other 62% of the electorate in the decision making process. Don't make the mistake the previous government made and assume that 38% of the vote gives you a mandate over the province. That mentality will only set you up to lose big in a backlash vote and have all your signature legislation reversed.

23017,/comment/23017,"Thanks for this chance to comment on the review of the Ontario Endangered Species Act.
My experience is that too often an endangered species occupies a battleground between people who wish to build on a piece of land and people who do not wish them to build on that same piece of land.
The result of the conflict often depends on who has the most persuasive experts and the best lawyers.
Therefore, any attempt to change the act should be closely examined by an independent judge or judges to see if the new wording would tip the result of a tribunal or court case toward the position of a would-be developer and away from protection of the species.
Also in my experience, too many developers are only interested in their own short-term profit, not in the long-term goal of sustaining the liveability and productivity of land.  They often use words like ""streamline approvals"" and ""economic development"" to support what turn out to be plans for ruining the land they covet in order to make their profit.  Unfortunately, these two phrases appear in the rationale for this review.
As a result, I am extremely suspicious of changes that might result from this review. We are already witnessing degredation of land, water and air from irresponsible development in Ontario.  I can only hope that somewhere in the minds of the people who may write changes to this Act is some notion of responsibility to future generations. For some places, it could be too late to vote out a government which supports irresponsible development.

Better protections should be the way forward not the opposite. Development needs to be carefully planned to avoid these important ecological zones that house the species at risk otherwise they will truly become extinct. This government needs to be the watchdog for such important decisions and do not let greed rule the current flavour of the government. Make solid laws enforcing regulation.

23046,/comment/23046,"1. Landscape Approaches
I support both coarse-grained (landscape) and fine-grained (species-specific) approaches to recovering species. At the landscape level we need to take action to improve habitat and protect species from harm.
Regarding landscape efforts, yesterday (Mar 1, 2019), the UN General Assembly declared the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, aiming to massively scale up the restoration of degraded and destroyed ecosystems. This initiative offers unparalleled opportunity for job creation, enhanced food and water security, climate change action and biodiversity protection including endangered species.
In situations where a species-specific approach is warranted, we need action to help meet species' individual needs.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23067,/comment/23067,"Dear Government of Ontario:
I strongly oppose any intention of the provincial government to reduce the efficacy and reputability of the Endangered Species Act in Ontario. I support its strengthening and further implementation to ensure all species at risk in Ontario are afforded stronger protection to individuals and their habitats. Southern Ontario habitat for listed species is subject to on-going disturbance, fragmentation and destruction via the authorization process for land use conversion in the name of economic growth.
In response to some of the proposed amendments:
Species-specific assessment should remain the focal point of the permitting and monitoring process, and the protection of such specific species should be considered at various landscape scales to encompass multi-species when applicable (e.g. interior woodlands, aquatic and avian species of wetlands). Landscape approach is already enabled and considered in the current Act. Further implementation of this strategy should be supported and provided increase resources.
Ministerial discretion is NOT equivalent and should NOT replace science-based and Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Ministerial discretion should not be included in amendments to this Act concerning the listing of species. Increased transparency for the listing mechanisms is recommended.
The Open for Business agenda of the current government should not have any association with the recovery and protection of Ontario's biodiversity. Flexibility for economic activity should not be further investigated.
Meaningful recovery actions need to be strengthened. Critical habitat needs further protection and authorizations for the destruction of critical habitat should not be permitted in the name of economic development or land use conversion to residential use.
Overall Benefit Permitting requiring Net Gain needs to be further implemented rather than reversion to ""minimizing harm"" permits. Compliance enforcement and monitoring needs to be increased.
A pro-active approach to Overall Benefit Permitting and habitat protection should be considered. Such an approach would include habitat compensation prescriptions, pre-determined, ready to be used when Authorizations to destroy are granted. For example, a standardized rate for SAR bat habitat loss and compensation measures (the number of bat boxes, bat condos, enhancement foraging habitat) should be established to increase the efficiency of the authorization process for both the developer, its proponent and the Ministry.
Further analysis on the effectiveness of the Overall Benefit Permitting and the status of listed species is encouraged. Case study examples from proven legislation and policies in other parts of the world, including the United States and European states, should be evaluated for efficacy and applicability.
In the spirit of the previous UN Decade on Biodiversity, Ontario has a global responsibility to conserve biodiversity. In the spirit of the next UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, habitat for species at risk needs only to be enhanced and restored, not further degraded, fragmented, or destroyed.

The endangered species act is a fundamental protection for biodiversity in Ontario. My hope as an Ontario resident is to see protections strengthened and increased. Development should happen in this province, but it should be upward and not outward. build more condos and towers to feed the housing market, not more urban and suburban sprawl. The green-belt act and the endangered species act are essential in curbing the excessive greed and wanton destruction of our natural areas by developers. The fact that the Ontario Government allowed grandfathering of property into the green-belt act did not show any commitment or support of preserving the natural spaces that protect endangered species. Do not alter this act of provincial parliament for the worse. Alter it for the better, increase protections for endangered species and threatened species or we will face increased hardships, and not just province-wide.
A healthy bio-sphere is instrumental to farmers, as pollinators are the fastest disappearing group of insects dying out. Albert Einstein famously said, if the bees die out, humanity will follow within 4 years. While that prediction is outdated and modern advancements in technology will dampen the result, due to climate-change and mass-extinction we might not be very far from the severity and dire consequences of self induced suicide, as a species.
Please do not change this legislation to favour the rich, wealthy developers that care nothing for the natural health of our ecosystems. Ontarians deserve to observe the natural world unaltered and unchanged. I am against the weakening of protections for endangered species.

23085,/comment/23085,"Focus 1 - Landscape Approaches:
Landscape approaches could help when there are multiple species within the same area that are endangered. It's usually better to deal with those cases as an interconnected problem. The rest should still be species-specific because general guidelines and one-size-fits-all never works.
Focus 2 -  Listing Processes and Protections for SARs
The government should post notices on all social media platforms to reach a wider audience. There should not be a longer wait-time, nor should there be a change to automatic listing. The faster species are listed as protected, the better the chance of them rebounding. There should also be no ministerial discretion, that defeats the purpose of doing an assessment to determine which species should be listed. It also opens the door to lobbying and political pressure.
Focus 3 - Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
There should be an ability to extend the timeline for developing a Government Response Statement when an appropriate plan cannot be created in time. It's better to take more time to create an adequate Statement than to rush and create a subpar one.
Habitat Regulations should always be created, but should have a clear scope.
Focus 4 - Authorization Process
The authorization process should not be streamlined unless there is a guarantee that nothing will be left out. Applicants filing multiple applications should still do multiple applications.
Activity-based requirements are more proactive than paying into a conservation fund, but conservation banking could be a viable option. A combination of less-stringent activity-based requirements and also participating in conservation banking would be useful. Since organizational activities are often permissible for unavoidable impacts if mitigation measures are in place, they should still have to do everything in their power to mitigate their own impacts via activity-specific requirements.
Proponents that are being regulated by other legislation along with the SAR regulations should not have a streamlined process. The needed of species at risk will not be adequately met if they are combined with other regulations.
I also support CFW's position, except where it contradicts mine as mentioned above.

23089,/comment/23089,"I am a Forestry Planner and Consultant for industry clients in the French Severn Forest. The Endangered Species Act has created many challenges. My focus is primarily on the Blanding's Turtle.
The act deals with species of Special Concern, Threatened, Endangered and Extirpated which are all bundled up into one act.
The act, at its inception, recognized the need to protect and preserve species at risk in certain areas. Those areas for the Blanding Turtle focused on decline of habitat. That habitat and numbers focused on the loss of habitat in  mostly rural farm and wetland  areas.
This particular illustration deals with southern, central and portions of eastern Ontario populations and was from a report in 2017, but illustrates back to 1800.
http://cossaroagency.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Accessible_COSSAROEv…  Page 7 Wetland Loss by Habitat
Species such as the Blanding's Turtle,  were put on Species at Risk, but the population distribution varies throughout many areas of Ontario. I'm not sure that full consideration was or is given to more heavily populated areas.
""The total Ontario population is estimated to be < 50,000 mature individuals, based on data from the Ontario Reptile and Amphibian Atlas. This is an increase from the estimate used in the previous assessment (10,000), reflecting increased survey efforts, rather than a genuine increase in population size. There has also been an increase in reporting from forestry companies and private individuals, both through the NHIC system, the Ontario Reptile and Amphibian Atlas (Ontario Nature 2017) and through submissions made directly to COSSARO.""-
http://cossaroagency.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Accessible_COSSAROEv… page 5
In the Cossaroagency Report it mentions an increase in numbers is due to better reporting rather than an increase in the population itself. I find this  statement hard to comprehend. If the numbers for the Act were based on the 10000, was this is a fair and measured threshold to base a Species at Risk?
I work in the French-Severn Forest (Muskoka-Parry Sound) and this graph from page 7 does not illustrate our current situation.
The Forest Management Planning process, which is not exempt from the Endangered Species Act,  provides the framework and preservation for these species though their identification and guidelines. However, when a situation goes beyond the scope of the guidelines and is not in the plan, it is subject to the environmental assessment process, which is subject to additional costs.
As a result of timing restrictions and habitat concerns related to the Endangered Species Act, many forestry operators, logging contractors and saw mills have been forced to harvest their compliment of wood requirements in a very short window from December 1-March 31.With this shorter window of opportunity, we have essentially created a seasonal work environment. This is contributing to a worker shortage already present in the forest industry.
I believe that the Georgian Bay (French-Severn) area has a healthy population of Blanding's and the population is stable. There will be  contributing factors that will play a role in its survival, but those factors are not based on conversion of wetlands or forest management activities.

23090,/comment/23090,"1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate. What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23091,/comment/23091,"The purpose of Ontario's Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA) is to protect and support the recovery of at-risk species and their habitats. If the government's review of this act finds that it is 'ineffective' then the ESA should be strengthened. It should not be weakened. Thorough administrative process and comprehensive applicant submissions are required for an effective and robust ESA. These aspects of the act should not be analyzed as 'administratively burdensome, time-consuming and costly for applicants'. It is important to have a well defined regulatory framework so businesses know what is expected of them. Weakening the framework would only serve to further threaten our at-risk species.
In Ontario there are already 243 species at risk. The very densely populated Carolinian region of southern Ontario is home to the highest concentration of endangered species in Canada. It is not surprising that habitat loss and degradation is the main reason for the decline of many of these plants and animals. Protecting these fragile species and what remains of their habitats cannot be viewed as 'barriers to economic development'. The endangered species cannot relocate. Their options have been removed by us. Fortunately, the planed economic projects do have options.
With thoughtful and responsible leadership we do not have to compromise our protections of the endangered species to have a healthy economy. Do not weaken the ESA by making the regressive changes implied by the 'Discussion Paper'.

23099,/comment/23099,"These comments pertain to ERO proposal 013-4143.
I am concerned that a landscape approach for managing species at risk within specific geographic areas or ecosystems may allow the erosion of habitat quality for some SAR species that operate at smaller geographic scales. A landscape approach might be used to rationalize development that negatively impacts species habitat at smaller spatial scales by suggesting there is a large supply of a specific habitat type at the landscape scale, when in fact, site specific habitat could be critical to a species population. For example, one hibernacula (habitat complex supporting many hibernation sites) might be critical to a meta population of massasaugas within a landscape that has many potential hibernacula complexes. If that particular hibernacula is not protected, there is a high level of risk that that meta population will be severely reduced or extirpated. Some species have very strong fidelity to specific habitats and limited ability to find, or adopt new habitat serving the same function.
It is not clear what is meant by a more strategic approach supporting a proposed activity while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk? I believe that a strategic landscape approach must not assume that a sufficient supply of habitats at the landscape scale can be relied upon to serve multiple species well when the spatial ecology of each of the species involved is not well understood at the appropriate spatial scales. Strong habitat protection policies and legislative requirements applicable to all spatial scales will be necessary. There is also high risk that fragmented landscapes will result over time, thus creating barriers to movement and limiting species survival and dispersal.
One existing tool or process that supports managing for species at risk at a landscape scale that could be recognized under the Endangered Species Act is comprehensive natural heritage habitat mapping and protection. Existing habitat regulations under the Act do this for single species. To map habitat comprehensively at a landscape scale is prohibitively costly and time consuming, and would primarily be a cost for the government to bare. Now, proponents of developments bare this responsibility for private lands, or when permits are required by utilities for activities on crown land, although many of these have now been exempted. If the government is looking to be cost efficient and effective at conserving SAR species, habitat must be protected now. The risk to species persistence, the cost of habitat rehabilitation and the cost of other types of intervention (repatriation, translocation, rescue, captive breeding, reintroduction, etc.) is much greater later on. The efficacy of recovery actions cannot be compared to good conservation practices in the first place.
I agree that in some cases the time to develop the Government Response Statement for an endangered or threatened species is too short. However, if a decision is made to allow an extension of this time frame, it must be restricted to a reasonable period of extension, i.e. no more than 6 months, and it must be restricted to a one time only extension.
I disagree that  conducting a review of progress towards the protection and recovery of a species within five years of the Government Response Statement is too soon. This time period holds the government to account, to ensure that actions are being taken before it is too late. Extending this response period might relieve the pressure on government allowing it to defer action.
I disagree that the development of a habitat regulation is not needed for each species that is endangered and threatened. General habitat descriptions are not sufficiently detailed to ensure protection applies to specific habitats that need protection. There would be too much room for dispute.
Enabling paying into a conservation fund dedicated to species at risk conservation should never be used as an option to authorize the destruction of habitat or the harm, harass or killing of an individual.
Using a conservation agreement in place of the appropriate permit required under the Act would only be acceptable if it ensured that sufficient information on potentially impacted species was known (collected) in advance of development plans being formulated,  these plans being reviewed and endorsed by qualified government staff and approvals granted. The agreements would have to be enforceable under the SAR Act. In other words a permit by another name. There is no substitute for the requirement of species and habitat protection if the government intends to meet it's obligations to protect species at risk.
If the government hired a sufficient number of inter ministry expert ecological assessment teams containing staff which would work with small and medium sized developers to assess properties, map habitats and analyse plan options, conditions of agreements could be developed and approved with minimum cost to developers and minimum delay. However, the government would have to bare additional costs in staffing and support. This approach could also promote more efficient review and approval for activities subject to other legislative or regulatory frameworks.
Enhanced enforcement powers should be authorized for any high risk files or developers with history of offences. All large developments potentially impacting multiple SAR species and any files flagged by the governments team of ecological experts.

23102,/comment/23102,"I do believe that Ontario needs a strong and comprehensive Species at Risk Act. In order to service the needs of species at risk and aid in their recovery, sufficient dollars must be allocated from General Revenues to assess and implement recovery strategies. Assessment must also include regular reviews of changes in status and reports on how successful (or not) recovery efforts have been. Upon the development of a recovery plan, there must be a time frame identified to express when it is expected that recovery will be achieved and the specific species can be delisted.
The current use of landscape level coverage for species at risk is too broad. Regulating restrictions across the province, including areas where there are self sustaining and viable populations is unnecessary. Funding constraints often dictate where the best bang for the buck should be focused. With that in mind, that should also be where protection strategies should be applied. No remedial action is required where localized populations are healthy. It seems that most species designated under the act are found within urban or other developed regions of the province. Recovery planning must also include a prescription for readily adopting it on private property. Recovery of isolated pockets of the species at risk solely on Crown Land will likely result in that species never achieving full recovery and becoming successfully rehabilitated.
In those cases where a species is at the most outer edge of its range, consideration as a species at risk should be undertaken with heightened scrutiny. Climate change, in and of itself, may be the determining factor as to whether or not that species might be realistically expected to survive over its entire historical range in perpetuity. Even with the best of intentions, there will be instances where it is futile to develop a plan for recovery that is doomed to failure from its very beginning.

2. Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species.

4. Mandatory habitat protection for threatened and endangered species should remain. The minister should not be interfering with the protection of species at risk.

Based on the discussion paper, it sounds as though the government would like to weaken the legislation instead of strengthening it.

23145,/comment/23145,"My comments on the SAR review concur with those of the Ottawa field-Naturalists Club, which you have, and of Ontario Nature -
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.
Personally, my interactions with SAR in Ontario, as an independent natural historian and museum biologist, have been, besides discovering previously unknown SAR populations, mostly from citizen groups' requests for reviews of proposed habitat destruction in their areas. The revisions to SAR practice which these experiences suggest include:
1) Independent surveys for SAR. There are real epistemological problems in allowing a firm hired by the proponent of a habitat-destruction project to do the search for SAR, which, by definition are rare and easy to miss. This gives the searchers every incentive to do a slipshod job (such as listening for spring-calling frogs only when the temperature is below freezing). In every case the methodology of the EA's I have reviewed have been inadequate to find the SAR that were being ""looked for,"" and in one case all the SAR were found by us from the periphery of a tract we were not allowed to enter, while the consultants didn't find any of them in the tract itself.
2) Disallow EAs that do not consult the peer-reviewed literature, local natural history groups and their journals, provincial and other online atlassing projects, and museum collections, to find current and historic records of SAR. There is often a complete disjunction between these traditional repositories of natural history knowledge and the ""grey literature"" referenced by consultant-authored EAs. In one case I published a first record of a species in eastern Ontario in the sole local natural history journal, only to find that the article wasn't found by the consultant preparing an EA for the destruction of the site where the species was found.
3) Instruct the Ministry of the Environment that it is their job to protect the environment, not to pander to the interests of proponents of habitat destruction. Every proposal and EA must be considered an hypothesis that can be accepted only after rigourous testing, and with the expectation that it will be falsified and the proposal rejected.
4) Require that projects which are undertaken to mitigate destruction of an SAR's habitat are adequately followed-up by monitoring paid for by the proponent, and that, if there isn't a net increase of the mitigated species after an appropriate lapse of years, the proponent, or their heirs & assigns, undertake further habitat creation - on the basis of accrued knowledge of the species' requirements - to remedy the failure of the first effort.
5) Ensure that newly created - anthropogenic - habitat patches which could support local SAR are colonized by the species (plural), either naturally or with human assistance. If the Eastern Pond-mussel is endangered by Zebra Mussels in its natural lake-shallows habitat, it should be introduced to every new pond in its historic range which supports its host fish species, so that it can persist in each region where it formerly occurred.
In general, the presence of SAR should be a trigger to protect and expand natural habitats. It's clear than humanity has an excessively large ecological footprint, so the goal of all planning should be to retract human intervention from the landscape, if only so that expanded wetlands and forests can sequester carbon to help stabilize the climate (the habitat of grassland SAR can be moved towards native prairie, where the large root biomass also sequesters carbon).
I hope this review can help Ontario take SAR seriously as an emblem of, and trigger for, sustainable human habitation of the province.

Comments on  10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper
Congratulations to the provincial government for inviting the public's input on the Endangered Species Act , R.S.O. 2007. As temporary custodians of this planet we have an obligation to preserve the natural world regardless of any perceived economic benefit.
Currently our landscape is strewn with the destruction and the waste that has been the result of certain industry activities, those industries that operate within our forests, on our fields, and in or on our lakes, due to bad practices committed in the past. While we now know better, and have so for decades, I have reason to believe they continue to this day.
These  industries have operated in areas without concern for the habitat of the animals and plants that have lived or grown there. Mining and milling is one major example with their tailings and slurry ponds  as are forestry companies that use the 'clear cut' method of harvesting, is another. Both have a devastating effect on the land and animal habitats. Lakes, rivers, and streams have been polluted by industries including agriculture, and not excluding the public at large.
The question and concern that I have is If businesses and/or industries were required to take a more sustainable approach in their operations could they be granted an exception to any regulation that would, if implemented, be considered to have a negative effect on a company's viability. Would these activities that would be considered to be increasing their operating costs and thus reducing their profits, be allowed to continue without compliance with the regulations?
I am sure that I am not the only one that is concerned that with this provincial government’s mantra of being ‘open for business’ we would see further erosion of our environmental protection laws. Laws that have been cancelled with the mistaken idea of it being positive for business while ignoring environmental concerns. You know the ones, cancelling environmentally sustaining power generation and the ‘Cap and Trade’ system, no matter how flawed, designed to reduce the negative effect of burning fossil fuels. Regardless what they say, this is not an environmentally progressive government, it is more focused on reducing the deficit regards who or what gets hurt.

23152,/comment/23152,"Thank you for providing this opportunity to comment on the 10-year review of the Endangered Species Act.  I have had direct experience with the legislation, both as a professional and as a volunteer.
1. Landscape Approaches
The legislation should not be changed to promote landscape approaches in place of species-specific approaches.  Species-specific status assessments, listings and protections are essential.  The ESA already provides recognition for landscape-level approaches when appropriate.  No change to the law is required for this purpose.
With respect to the suggestion of issuing authorizations for harmful activities at a broad scale, this approach is not appropriate for endangered and threatened species.  Working at a broad scale would not properly address site-specific or species-specific concerns.  Such an approach therefore, would present unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.
2. Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
Science-based listing and the automatic protection of designated species are essential aspects of the ESA.  These requirements must remain fully in effect.  There should be no change to the listing process and the role of COSSARO. The law sets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of “the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.” (sec. 5(3)).
In its listing process, COSSARO is required to consider species listed by the federal Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.  There thorough notice requirements built into this process, from the release of COSEWIC status reports to the listing by COSSARO.  The process leading to designation is already lengthy enough.  No further delay is required.  Ministerial discretion would not improve the process.
3.  Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
It is not necessary to change to the legal requirement to produce Government Response Statements (GRS) within nine months of the release of Recovery Strategies (sec. 11(8)).  Rather than changing the legal requirement, the province should provide the resources that would enable staff to meet the necessary dates.
The required five-year reporting on progress is reasonable and ensures transparency and accountability. It provides an impetus for action, ensuring that effectiveness is assessed, and contributes to institutional learning and adaptive management.  Furthermore, the government should legislate additional reporting requirements (e.g., every five years) to drive ongoing action and monitoring for periods beyond the initial five years.
The ESA already allows the Minister to delay the development of a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)b) or to not proceed with a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)c). Therefore, it is not necessary to change this part of the act.
There should be no changes to the legal provisions for habitat regulations, which describe specific boundaries or features of areas deemed to be habitat and provide enhanced certainty for ESA implementation and enforcement. They can include areas where a species “used to live or is believed to be capable of living” (sec. 55(3)b), presenting a significant opportunity for protection and recovery efforts to extend beyond places where species at risk currently persist.
4. Authorization Processes
It is important to note that the legislation under review is the Endangered Species Act.  One of the purposes of this legislation is “To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.”  Protecting species at risk must remain the top priority during the current review process.
The current legislation provides sufficient authorization tools.  The authorization process must be taken seriously, as the overall intent is to protect species at risk.  The province should allocate sufficient resources so that staff may conduct their reviews in a timely manner.
It is not appropriate to simplify the requirements for a permit under s. 17(2)d.  These permits are intended only for projects having significant social or economic benefit, and that will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario.  Current requirements ensure that such permits are issued only an exceptional basis.
It is not appropriate to introduce new exemptions.  The current review should strengthen protection for species at risk by repealing the sweeping exemptions for industry and development that were approved by Cabinet in 2013.  These exemptions are allowing harmful activities to proceed, contrary to the purpose of the act.
Where exemptions are granted, transparency and accountability must be enhanced by amending the exemption regulation (242/08) to require all proponents of harmful activities to automatically submit their mitigation plans and annual reports to the government and to ensure that these are publicly available.
As previously recommended by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, the ESA should be amended to give enforcement officers the power to conduct compliance inspections.
The ESA (sec. 18) already provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. No legislative change is needed. This is an implementation issue.

We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23156,/comment/23156,"10th year Endangered Species Act review discussion paper
The comments below are listed under each of the 4 areas of focus in the discussion paper.
1)   Landscape Approaches
Where recovery approaches for individual species conflict with one another, a landscape-level approach can be effective in some cases as a compliment, but certainly not as a replacement.
The act already includes the tools needed to apply a landscape approach. No changes to the legislation are needed to implement this.
Existing landscape connectivity modeling tools based on circuit theory (e.g. circuitscape) have been successfully used by ontario university researchers and by research scientists in the ministry of natural resources to model the movements or gene flow of specific species or species guilds.
2)   Listing Processes
The discussion paper cites the challenge of not enough public notice before listing, and that automatic listing may result in delays or cost to development projects.
Evidence from the federal Species at Risk Act and former ESA legislation suggests that “political listing” often results in delayed protections or no protections at all. Longer timelines for listings  and delayed protections serves only the developers who stand to experience complications from listing, it in no way serves the species that are in dire need of protection and recover.
Many improvements could be made with regard to COSARROs process of assessment and classification. COSARRO members are not paid for their work. With compensation they would be able to do much more in terms of communications/notifications with stakeholders. To increase transparency, they would also be able to invest in monitoring of recovery effort effectiveness (to improve the scientific basis of assessments).
3)   Recovery Processes & Habitat
There is no benefit to changing the legislated timelines of the GRS and progress reviews. Evidence suggests that the most effective way to help species recover is by protecting habitat, and therefore that habitat regulations are extremely valuable and necessary.
More attention should be devoted to coordinating the process of GRS and recovery strategies by creating recovery strategies and GRS for multiple species sharing particular geographies or facing similar threats (i.e. landscape approach).
4)   Authorization Processes
A habitat banking system (I.e. paying into a conservation fund) in lieu of activity-based requirements is not sufficient as there is no assurance that direct compensation for impacts will be completed. Instead, the focus should be on habitat protection measures that are effective for listed species and benefit multiple species, and addressing the needs of species as early as possible in development activities (i.e. at the planning stage). The more protection is deferred, the more complicated and expensive it becomes to address recovery needs.

The purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to protect species at risk, and it is a valuable piece of legislation. Species at risk need protection from rampant development and other human activities.  Here are my comments on your Discussion Paper:
-	 Desired Outcomes: If the government’s desired outcome includes increasing “efficiencies in service delivery for authorization clients” and “streamline processes”, I conclude that you wish to weaken environmental protection for species at risk and make it easier for business to proceed unfettered with projects that may be harmful. This is contrary to the intention of the legislation. Authorizing exemptions and streamlining processes to allow development should never be among your “desired outcomes” because it decreases the level of protection for species at risk.
-	Focus 1 Landscape Approaches: Unfortunately “landscape approaches” is never defined, but the Discussion Paper says “[it] enables planning and authorizing activities at a broad scale…” That sounds like dilution of environmental protections at a broad scale.  The current legislation already covers ecosystem approaches, which are broad, and for some species to be considered together.  The key word in this section is  “authorizing activities”. Do not weaken protection by designing changes to “authorize activities”, by which it appears you mean development and land exploitation without a full and robust examination of its environmental impact.
-	Focus 2 Listing Process: The “ministerial discretion” you propose is contrary to the scientific, fact-based process by which species are listed. You say habitat protections can contribute to costly impacts to businesses and the public. That is precisely why we need legislation protecting species at risk – because protecting species at risk means development and exploitation of the environment should not always come first. If there are costly impacts to business, then that is all the more reason to protect species at risk as steadfastly as possible. Do not politicize the protection of species at risk, and do not add “ministerial discretion” to weaken the legislation and give power to big corporations to lobby politicians. Such a change would make a mockery of the Act.
-	Focus 3 Government Response Statements and reviews of progress: If it takes more than 9 months to develop a government response statement, you are not providing adequate funding for staff. As for a review of progress toward the protection and recovery of species, an assessment after 10 or 15 years instead of 5 may be too late. Species at risk can’t wait.  Do not lengthen the time it takes to evaluate whether protection plans are working. If there is no progress in 5 years, something is wrong and stronger action needs to be taken. It’s important to know in a timely manner, not in a decade.
-	Focus 4 Authorization: This section is also devoted to making it easier to bypass protective legislation for corporate convenience. You appear to want new tools to sacrifice some vulnerable species, suggesting companies can pay money to a conservation fund to atone for harm done to one vulnerable population or species by helping another. No! A donation or fee paid to a conservation group is no substitute for legal protection for any population. You complain that the authorization process can create barriers to development. Yes, and that is what environmental protection can require! Protecting species at risk requires having barriers to development or other human activities.  As for overlapping regulations, harmonization of regulations is already possible,
The thrust of the Discussion Paper appears to be to weaken protections for species at risk. An “Open for Business” mantra should not apply to this crucial Endangered Species Act. Environmental stressors are worsening. Pesticides are killing off our pollinators, the atmosphere has already reached dangerous levels of CO2 bringing extreme weather and disrupting bird migrations, fish in places like Lake Erie are toxic, harmful invasive species are replacing native species. The stressors are mounting, and under these circumstances it makes no sense to add to the stressors by weakening the Act. The Act should be strengthened, not weakened.

23162,/comment/23162,"INTRODUCTION
Canada’s cultural identity is tied closely to our magnificent natural heritage. Like a unique work of art, our biodiversity is irreplaceable, and needs to be afforded the protection it deserves. Government plays an important role in protecting and maintaining the health of our natural environment. Ontario was the first province in Canada to pass legislation to protect endangered species in 1971, and has been making improvements since. In 2007, recognizing the harmful impacts of habitat loss, the new Endangered Species Act (ESA) placed importance on a science-based approach to protecting species under law with the automatic protection of their habitat; something many provinces have yet to implement. To maintain balance while still preserving species at risk (SAR) and their habitats, the legislation allowed flexibility for socio-economic development. Furthermore, this legislation has created laws that necessitate action rather than discretionary decision-making, making it a benchmark among provinces for SAR protection. Here we address the four areas of focus outlined in the ESA discussion paper and provide specific recommendations on improving the Act and its implementation (MOECP, 2019), summarized in Table 1 provided as supplementary material.
RECOMMENDATION I
Positive aspects of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act
(Areas of Focus 2 & 3)
We would like to address the strong points in the Act that should remain unchanged, and how Ontario’s Act supports the values for which it is mandated. The 10th Year Review of Ontario’s ESA Discussion Paper states that “the Act has been criticized for being ineffective in its aim to protect and recover SAR.” However, many of the challenges addressed in the discussion paper were not in regards to species protection but rather from an economic development perspective (MOECP, 2019, p.2). In response to Area of focus 2: Listing process and protections, we believe that the automatic habitat protections currently in place for listed species is a great strength in Ontario’s legislation and one of the many reasons that it ranks higher than other provinces. If the Ontario government is earnestly interested in “improving protections for SAR” (which is the first priority in reviewing the ESA) then automatic species and habitat protections should remain unchanged in the Act.
Similarly, suggestions for lengthening the time periods for listing SAR should be dropped. SAR protection is an extremely time-sensitive issue, because the longer we wait to act, the more challenging recovery actions become. Additionally, it is important to recognize that return on investment decreases over time in the context of conservation plans, implying swift action is most cost-effective (Robillard & Kerr 2016). There are many other ways of streamlining processes which can potentially make the Act less “administratively burdensome, time consuming and costly”, which will be mentioned in the following recommendations. We also believe that the ‘Protection and Recovery of Species’ section of the Act, as it is, provides strong protection and should not be changed, namely section 11(3) (the Precautionary Principle). Listed SAR species are in need of quick strategic protection and therefore we cannot reasonably delay action with the purpose of collecting more data (e.g. if we are uncertain of exact critical habitat requirements; Kareiva & Marvier, 2015). To summarize, postponing measures further, and extending deadlines for recovery strategies and ministerial responses summarizing government actions, will not “improve protections for SAR”.
RECOMMENDATION II
Keeping everyone in the loop: Open-access data and mapping
(Areas of Focus 1 & 2)
To provide more transparency for the public, we recommend two tools to provide information about development risks due to the presence of SAR prior to permit applications. The first tool is a “risk” map that provides information about potentially challenging areas to develop based on SAR presence. Risk maps would show the difficulty of obtaining a permit for development based on known SAR distributions, critical habitat, and probability of occupation. The map could be created for each species at the listing phase when habitat requirements and species distributions are defined. The Act could require all permit applicants to consult a risk map prior to submitting the permit application. The Act should encourage anyone purchasing or developing land to consider the presence of SAR in the same way they would consider any economic or environmental risk, like developing on a floodplain. A risk map also improves a developer’s sense of the endangered species present in the area. The risk map would provide a broad landscape approach to the permit application process that would help generalize case-by-case decisions.
The second tool would be an open-access database of all previous environmental assessment reports that could be used to provide information about SAR distributions. The database would help reduce the costs for many permit applicants by reducing duplicate reports, providing more accurate SAR information, and further reducing red tape for developers. Environmental assessment reports could be standardized and required by the Act to be publicly available, which would reduce the number of poor-quality, industry-biased environmental assessments.
Both tools would help generalize the permit application process, while also providing clarity to the public about SAR listings. While the initial gathering of information and development of the map and database may be intensive, in the long run it could greatly improve the efficiency of both species protections and permit applications.
RECOMMENDATION III
Replacing habitat with habitat, not dollars
(Area of Focus 4)
We strongly oppose the idea of simply paying into a conservation fund instead of ensuring the quality and quantity of critical habitat for SAR. We are concerned, and rather disappointed, with the first discussion question (Area of Focus 4) suggesting that to help businesses achieve benefits for SAR they may pay into a conservation fund in lieu of activity-based requirements. Critical habitats, as defined by the ESA, are specific geographic areas essential to the conservation of an endangered or threatened species. These critical habitats include, but are not limited to, reproductive and/or spawning areas, nursery habitats, and feeding grounds. For many reasons, it is extremely difficult to reconstitute or reproduce such habitats where they did not occur, and to then transfer SAR to such reconstituted habitats. The track record of attempts to do so is one of almost universal failure. No amount of funding can change this. Among the variety of anthropogenic threats to SAR, our greatest challenge is stopping habitat loss and degradation. It is of utmost importance that the Government of Ontario does not develop new authorization tools to help businesses at the expense of SAR habitat protection.
In scenarios where permits are issued for development, we advise at minimum a 1:1 replacement ratio of SAR-specific habitat so there is no net habitat loss. This method is essentially a “win-win” scenario: the Act requires developers to take actions to create new SAR-specific habitat to replace what was lost, while still allowing development on the land. Creating new habitat to replace what has been lost is feasible for some species, especially for species with small home ranges, such as the bank swallow (Riparia riparia). If creating new SAR-specific habitat is not possible, an alternate (though less favourable) option is to protect its existing habitat elsewhere. Any new SAR habitat created or protected must be monitored to ensure SAR persist successfully. In summary, we recommend replacing habitat with habitat so there is no net loss, as conservation funds are incapable of helping SAR if there is no habitat left.
RECOMMENDATION IV
Broad-scale approach, but species-specific protection
(Areas of Focus 1 & 2)
A multi-species approach can be incorporated in recovery action plans for species that cohabit the same area, ecosystem, or landscape, but each unique species must be listed and protected individually. Granting species automatic protection without delay is absolutely required, and we believe it is the backbone of the Act. If the Ontario government is serious about conserving species, there is no better alternative than to afford appropriate protection for each species and its habitat. As far as delaying listings or actions until we have enough information to act efficiently and effectively, we emphasize that SAR often cannot afford to wait. It is far riskier and typically more expensive to wait than to act despite uncertainty.
Section 13 of the ESA states that a recovery strategy or management plan be prepared using an “ecosystem approach”; however the practical application of this approach is neither defined nor described. Section 14 of the current Act also outlines that recovery strategies and management plans be prepared for more than one species, when appropriate. We feel that both Section 13 and 14, though they require more clarity, should be considered as a solution to concerns outlined in Area of Focus 1 regarding the suggestion of a ‘landscape approach’ rather than a species-by-species approach. If the Act is determined to manage SAR via an ecosystem approach, we suggest the legislation provide a clear definition of their interpretation, and incorporate adaptive management techniques that can be changed as new information comes to light.
CONCLUSION
In summary, we believe that the ESA should keep automatic species and habitat protection and retain or shorten current time periods for implementation. We recommend the mandated creation of “risk” maps, made accessible to the public in an open-access database to inform future developers of potential barriers to development. We suggest that businesses should be required to replace habitat with habitat rather than paying into a generic conservation fund. Finally, we strongly recommend that species still be listed individually but that multi-species and/or ecosystem approaches be taken to manage multiple species where their habitats overlap.

We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.
What you can do

I am concerned that the Discussion Paper is a thinly veiled proposal to remove existing protection for the growing number of species at risk in our province and is intended to make it easier for industry to continue to degrade and destroy habitat and species-at-risk directly.
The ESA exists to protect and recover species facing extinction in Ontario. Therefore, I support only the direct strengthening of this ESA by:
- Maintaining that every species gets assessed by COSSARO (Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario), and if necessary receives a science-based Recovery or Management Strategy, a Government Response Statement and a Progress Report within existing mandated timelines. Any ""landscape approach"" must exist over and above species-specific regulations.
- Maintaining science-based listing by COSSARO, and abandoning the idea of allowing ministerial discretion regarding habitat and species protection under section 9 and section 10 of the ESA
- Preventing any appeal process to COSSARO assessments and subsequent listing on SARO (Species at Risk in Ontario)
- Requiring all proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground, monitored and enforced overall benefit to impacted species and abandoning your proposal to create an option for such proponents to pay into a conservation fund to compensate for conducting activities that are harmful to species at risk
I ask that you commit to actual strengthening the ESA by:
- Repealing the exemptions created in 2013 to permit forestry, hydro and mining industries to conduct harmful activities to species at risk
- Repealing the exemption created in 2016 to allow hunting and trapping of the Threatened Algonquin wolf
- Amending section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and/or recovery of Endangered and Threatened species
- Affording section 9 and section 10 protection to any species that has been assessed as Special Concern in two consecutive assessments by COSSARO until such a time when the species' assessment results in down listing to Not At Risk

1. intended to promote industrial and development activities that will further harm the habitats of species already found to be at risk and result in increases to that list
2. call for further delay of listing species at risk and further delay of implementing protections for them
3.suggest ministerial discretion is necessary when decisions should be based on scientific evidence,
4. suggest industry and developers can simply pay into a fund to allow them to harm the habitat of species at risk.
Rather, to be effective to protect species at risk, protect their habitat and add in the recovery of the many species at risk in Ontario, this act should be amended to :
1. Repeal the 2013 exemptions as those industries are the major contributors of activities that harm the habitat of endangered species in Ontario
2. Authorize  enforcement officers to inspect exempted activities to ensure compliance
3. Require applicants for harmful activities to submit to the government and the public their mitigation plans and report annually on them.
Many of the suggested amendment to the act are not need as the flexibility exits in the act as it is and are implementation issues .These proposal will weaken this act and contribute to further decline and extinction of species at risk. The people of Ontario love and respect nature and its diversity and expect our government to protect species at risk and not enact  laws and regulations that contribute to their extinction.
The approach to assessment, listing and protection needs to be species specific to be effective and not changed to a landscape approach. Where this is appropriate already exists in the act.Species at risk cannot survive broad scale harmful activities, which should be obvious.This act must continue the process of scientific based listing and automatic protection of listed species and they habitat, not only where they currently exist but also where they could or have existed if that area was protected. There cannot be a continual decrease of habitat and this happens every time an exemption occurs to enable an activity harmful to their habitat.
The current act allows enough ministerial review if credible scientific information suggests an inappropriate listing. To increase ministerial discretion politicizes this endeavour and reduces transparency and delays protection of species at risk.
Permit process and exemptions already exits in the law for the limited circumstances they may be necessary. Remember this law is about protecting and  the recovery species at risk, not about promoting activities harmful to the habitat! Habitat destruction and degradation is the greatest contributing factor to putting species at risk. There should be no change to the listing and automatic protections nor to the role of COSSARO whose approach is transparent.
Better communication can improve notice provisions.There is no need to lengthen the time for government to produce ERS, these are implementation issues, not a need to change the legislation.
The 5 year reporting is appropriate and reasonable to provide for transparency, ensure action, and need for adjustments in action etc.. Reporting should be every 5 years.
There is no need to change habitant regulation as the ministry can delay development of habitat regs.
There is enough flexibility in the ESA. The suggestions options are clearly intended to make it easer for industry and developers to undertake harmful activities which is not the purpose or intent of this act.There is no need to change the authorization process.
The proposal to pay into a conservation fund to enable proponents to proceed with harmful activities is
 an affront to this legislation, the people of Ontario and certainly to the species at risk who should be protected.
Do not simplify the section 17(2)d permits exceptions.
Do not simplify exemption requirements through regs. Section 57 should be more stringent so exemptions provide a benefit to species at risk and not jeopardize their protection and recovery..
Section 18 does not need to be changed.
Rather, repeal the broad 2013 exemptions for forestry, hydro,mining, aggregate extraction etc., as their activities harm the habitat. Over 1800 exemptions in the 5 years since 2013 have violated ESA protections.
To protect the current species at risk and their habitat and to reduce the listing of more species and to have any hope for their recovery industrial activity has to be limited. The fallacy of a ""balanced"" approach allows more destructive activity further reducing the habitant species need to survive and thrive . We cannot allow this to continue to happen on our watch. We and future generations deserve the diversity of nature we are meant to have.

The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA); either through a perpetual Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, it must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and
        First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
The sector will continue to operate under the CFSA which, by law, requires, forestry operations to follow an approved forest management plan. Guides delivered under the CFSA include operational prescriptions and conditions, which may include reserves, modified operations, or specific conditions on road use and construction in the area near a species at risk and their habitat.
Once a permanent Section 55 Regulation has been passed, or other legislative change made to the ESA recognizing equivalency between the two acts, more work must be done on species at risk policy currently being delivered under the CFSA. Overly precautious timing restrictions on forest operations for wood or Blanding’s turtle, for example, is currently putting people out of work for weeks to months at a time; this is while the sector operates under an existing regulation and through the CFSA.
It is my understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. I would like to see that unworkable prescriptions, such as the turtle example provided above, will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
In order to avoid catastrophic socio-economic impacts, there should be a permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.

A full cost accounting regime is one in which costs externalized onto society, ecosystems, or individual citizens via industries are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that causes the harm.

Consultations with affected communities are cursory and often appear to be insincere and ultimately ineffectual.
This should not happen with a government ""for the people"".

23235,/comment/23235,"1. Landscape Approaches
I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause of species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species, while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which it must operate. What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat pose considerable risk, and so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23236,/comment/23236,"I support increasing the strength and protections embedded within the endangered species act. Of the myriad threats to Ontario's species, the two that concern me most are : economic development impinging into natural spaces, and the pressure rapid climate change is having on ecosystems.
Please resist any moves to place development and developers ahead of ecosystems. Once a natural place is lost it can never be reconstituted. Ontario's remaining natural places, especially those in southern Ontario are too precious to be sacrificed in the name of economic development.
I hope part of your strategy response will include and acknowledge the role climate change is having on our ecosystems.  The Ontario government needs to do much, much more. Instead of battling the Federal government in court over the carbon tax, please initiate a constructive dialog with the feds to figure out how Ontario can further reduce GHG emissions. As Canada's most powerful and most influential province, Ontario is in a position to take the lead in the move toward a non fossil fuel based economy, rather than appearing as a laggard.

Loosening environmental standards for the sake of short-term economic gains (and associated political gains) is a form of selective cost-benefit analysis that deflates long term irreversible costs to make the net benefits of the policy seem larger than they really are.
The economic case for government intervention in cases of environmental damage from private actions arises because private firms do not take social costs or benefits into account when making decisions focused on market competition and shareholder value. In such circumstances we require the government to create and maintain legislation that maximizes net social benefit not only for current but for future generations. Current proposed changes by the Government of Ontario do not meet this requirement. Instead, the proposed legislative changes position the government to be an agent of and partner with  private profit-seeking firms to the lasting detriment of Ontario citizens.

23247,/comment/23247,"We are writing to express our concerns with the current 10-year review of the Ontario Endangered Species Act.
The Sault Naturalists Club is a group of about 100 people from all walks of life. The club objectives are to provide members with a common meeting ground for exchanging ideas and for broadening their knowledge and understanding of natural science and to promote the appreciation, preservation, and conservation of our natural heritage. We live in the north and we are well aware of the importance of resource-based industries to the provincial economy.
Our interest in species-at-risk is not a casual one. Members are currently actively doing field work toward the study and protection work for 4 species of threatened turtles, 2 species of dragonflies, and Chimney Swifts. For over 50 years we have contributed to citizen science studies of bird populations and we have recently added reptiles, amphibians and butterflies.
Much of the Endangered Species Act review process appears to be a thinly-veiled attempt to ignore the needs of threatened species while favouring industrial and economic development. Our members support economic development, but not at the cost of further eroding protections for species that are already “on the edge”. There is no reason for economic development and sound environmental stewardship to be mutually exclusive.
Among our concerns:
1)	It is imperative that the long list of exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development, approved by Cabinet in 2013 be repealed.
2)	If scientific bodies such as SARPAC and COSSARO conclude that a species is at risk it is at risk and it needs immediate protection, period. To have politicians deciding whether this really matters, or anything should be done about it is simply absurd. It also blatantly contradicts the first stated outcome of this review, to “Enable positive outcomes for species at risk”.
3)	Removing or extending timelines for planning and reporting of mitigating activities would absolutely work against the species at risk.  Without timelines planning is meaningless, and without reporting how are the people of Ontario to know that appropriate actions are being taken?
4)	Allowing industries or developers to simply pay money in to a fund in lieu of protecting the species-at-risk is again, simply absurd. Species at risk do not need money in a bank account; they need protection on the ground. To allow these payments would certainly speak of a government that lacks both common sense and even the most basic understanding of natural processes.
5)	While it may seem intuitive that streamlining environmental legislation and related guidelines will increase industrial productivity, this is certainly not the case. These policies not only protect biodiversity but also enhance the image of Ontario industrial products with respect to Sustainable Development. Regressing on these policies can negatively affect environmental certification of Ontario products leading to loss of markets and subsequent negative impacts for industrial profits and employment.
In conclusion, we ask that your government renew Ontario’s commitment to sustainable development of all industrial products by maintaining and enhancing environmental legislation to ensure the protection of biodiversity and economic prosperity of this province for present and future generations.

23249,/comment/23249,"I am writing to voice concerns I have with some of the general priorities and specific actions set out in the current review of Ontario's Endangered Species Act. The overall impression of the review suggests an inappropriate priority on loosening regulations in a manner that favours irresponsible economic development and is fundamentally antithetical to the intended goals of this legislation (i.e., the protection of at risk and endangered biodiversity). These priorities are evident in three of the four focus areas outlined in the review document (Areas of Focus 2, 3, 4), including proposals to alter authorization, listing processes, and habitat regulations in a manner that would be preferred by business interests.
I find the overall tone of the review and the recurring theme of loosening regulation in favour of economic development distressing and at odds with the intended goals of the Endangered Species Act.

• Should there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections? (e.g., longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat.)
No, it is important that species and habitat protections be enacted as quickly as possible. The postponement of protections yields no benefit to wildlife.
• In what circumstances would a different approach to automatic species and habitat protections be appropriate? (e.g., there is significant intersection between a species or its habitat and human activities, complexity in addressing species threats, or where a species’ habitat is not limiting.)
Automatic protections are always the appropriate action. It is better to protect first, then evaluate the situation and make changes carefully. If there is a “significant intersection between a species or its habitat and human activities” there is more reason to have the protections come into effect quickly. It is easier to prevent ecological damage than it is to repair it.

23264,/comment/23264,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10 year review of the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA). I strongly support the ESA and it’s aims, though I also have observed situations where improvements are needed and efficiencies may be found. I have included comments on the 4 Focus Areas specifically highlighted by the ministry, and general comments follow those.
Focus Area 1
A more strategic approach may well be more effective in defined landscapes with a high concentration of species at risk, such as Pelee Island. However, when not using a species specific approach, it should be clear that the landscape approach is actually more effective for all species involved. Also, the two approaches need not be mutually exclusive. A landscape approach may be highly effective for a suite of bird species but useless for a tree species in the same landscape that is declining due to an invasive pathogen. Species specific activities will likely still be required in addition to an effective landscape level approach.
Furthermore, the goal of a more strategic approach should foremost be improving outcomes for species at risk. It should not be to “support a proposed activity while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk.” Supporting a proposed activity is secondary to ensuring outcomes for species at risk.
Focus Area 2
The notification process related to species listing is already long enough for anyone to comment. What is lacking is awareness of proposed listings by people who are not already engaged in the process. The only way to fix this would be to increase spending on promotion and/or notification. Lengthening the process is unlikely to help, and will likely delay recovery efforts. This will not help improve the outcomes for species at risk.
Uncertainty and cost impacts to businesses are a risk of doing business and these are often involved when businesses are not diligent or are overly confident that species at risk are not present. The current approach is adequate.
I do not see anywhere that the assessment and classification of a species is not transparent enough. Adding additional reviews due to “emerging science or conflicting information” would likely cause considerable abuse. If such reviews are added, the listing should be implemented normally and the species should remain listed while such additional reviews are conducted.
There may be limited circumstances where automatic habitat protection is not appropriate. A different approach may be useful when habitat is not related to the reasons for a species being listed. For example, protecting the habitat of Little Brown Bat, which is declining precipitously due to White Nose Disease, is likely not a useful recovery tool, and potentially causes unnecessary and unhelpful complications for many landowners.
Focus Area 3
It may be appropriate to extend the time limit of 9 months for the development of a GRS. However, such an extension should not exceed another 9 months, and the allowable reasons for an extension should pertain to the potential benefit of awaiting incoming information, or that a species is unlikely to suffer harm in the interim (i.e. a species found only within a protected nature reserve), as opposed to a simple lack of resources. Developing a GRS is essential to deploying funding for recovery actions. It need not be the definitive document on the recovery of that species, as it can be amended if necessary.
Similarly, a review after 5 years is helpful to determine if actions are being taken and progress is being made. If additional data is available over a longer timeframe, great. That can be added into the next review. There is no reason not to provide a 5 year review, however brief.
With respect to habitat regulation, more flexibility would be useful since there may be newly listed species that do not require habitat regulation, as described above in Focus Area 2. More flexibility would allow for choosing to prioritize which species would benefit the most. Habitat regulations are very useful even though general habitat protection applies, as they can clarify what is or is not habitat instead of this causing conflict between stakeholders. Such clarity is of great benefit for all parties, and results in more efficient processes.
Focus Area 4
I would agree that authorization processes can create significant delays. These could be partly addressed by providing more staffing resources so that applications can be processed faster. However, new tools could certainly help. One that seems obvious is a streamlined process for activities that will actually be beneficial for species at risk, such as population monitoring, etc. Ministry staff must spend time reviewing and approving annual applications for multi-year projects, or new projects by parties that have a long history of conservation work. This time could be reallocated to reviewing applications that are more likely to have negative impacts, thereby reducing the administrative delays for all applicants. There should be a process that approves qualified individuals (i.e. university researchers, NGO staff, etc.) for a 5 or 10 year period to conduct an agreed upon set of activities for the benefit of species at risk, without requiring an annual review. An annual report could still be provided, with an option to address any concerns. Such a process would also prevent a scenario that occurs all too frequently- that beneficial work gets delayed by the approval process to the extent that the work is compromised. This sometimes also results in less than optimal results from whatever funding was involved. I’ve included more on this below in the general comments.
Any effort to streamline or reduce the need for approvals for activities that benefit species at risk will improve the results for these species, and allow Ministry resources to be better allocated towards activities that may be detrimental. As such, any effort to improve the process for activities that may be detrimental for the species should be greatly exceeded by efforts to improve the process for beneficial activities.
A singular improvement would be the elimination of authorization duplication between the ESA and the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (FWCA). An authorization under the ESA should automatically preclude the need to obtain another authorization for the same activity under the FWCA- including for species not listed under the ESA (but listed under the FWCA), if the circumstances and methods are similar. For example, if a researcher obtains a permit to conduct a population estimate of spotted turtles (Endangered) in a wetland, that permit should allow for the same researcher to also include painted turtles (Not at Risk) in the same wetland in their work without having to obtain another authorization under the FWCA for the painted turtles. However, at a minimum, regardless of the painted turtles, the researcher should certainly not also need to obtain an authorization under the FWCA for the spotted turtle work already permitted by the ESA.
Such approval processes could also be co-ordinated better between districts, and the regions. Some activities require approvals from more than one district, or an ESA approval from a district but an FWCA approval from the region, for the same activity. This is especially true when activity in one district spills over slightly into another district (or two, etc.). The district that is most involved should review and process the application, with input from the others if useful, and issue any required authorizations. This currently occurs if proposed activity touches two districts, but not more than that regardless of how slightly the other districts are included. If an applicant is unfortunate enough to work at the nexus of multiple districts, this process currently becomes needlessly complicated. There are easy policy changes that could make this all much more efficient.
Enforcement, and species protection, may be improved by requiring compliance inspections for activities that are detrimental to species at risk. Such inspections could be performed by conservation officers, but this should not necessarily be required as there are already too few conservation officers for the tasks they are required for. Seasonal staff could routinely check compliance, and forward any issues to conservation officers for follow up if the situation cannot be readily resolved. Third party experts, agreed upon by both the Ministry and a proponent, could also be appointed to fill this role.
Additional Comments
In general, habitat protection for threatened and endangered species already seems to suffer in the face of development, despite the ESA. All too often, development proceeds with merely a nod to mitigation efforts that have no long term monitoring or evaluation of success, or with overall benefit agreements which feature few or questionable benefits to the species in the long term. There must be a robust mechanism that allows for the refusal of development applications which would be detrimental to threatened or endangered species. Mitigation efforts, while laudable, should be required to be monitored, and also maintained. Overall benefit agreements should err on the side of creating more benefit for the species, and that benefit must be sustained perpetually, if they are to be approved.
However, such strong habitat protection should also recognize that many activities do not disrupt habitat in any significant way, and that landowners should have some ability to do such things without an onerous process to receive authorization. For example, even where habitat protection is important for a species, if a landowner builds a garden shed out back, that’s not likely to be detrimental and there should be no authorization required for this. Encouraging good stewardship of private lands is critical to species recovery efforts, and landowners are more likely to be positive about species at risk if they do not cause day to day interference in their lives. More effort could be spent on generating classifications of what is, and is not, allowed within species at risk habitat (and this might be species specific) so that landowners would know where they stand.
On the subject of encouraging stewardship, landowners should be eligible for better incentives related to providing habitat for species at risk. The existing Conservation Land Tax Incentive Program (CLTIP) is inadequate and often inappropriate. I am a rural landowner with provincially significant wetland within my agricultural property. The property tax rebate I would receive annually for this wetland under the CLTIP is barely worth the time to complete the paperwork. Further, this property tax rebate comes out of the budget of my municipality. In areas with significant concentrations of species at risk habitat (i.e. Pelee Island, parts of Essex and Norfolk counties), if all eligible landowners applied for this program, the local municipal budget could be significantly affected by a provincial program that the municipalities have no control over. Not surprisingly, some municipalities have reasonable concerns about the ESA because of this. Therefore, the CLTIP program should be immediately reworked so that incentives under it originate from the provincial budget, not municipal ones.
The Managed Forest Tax Incentive Program (MFTIP) results in a property tax reduction for qualifying landowners only if their land is classed as residential. This program should also work for agricultural landowners, and provide benefit to them if their land qualifies. The same criticism above of the CLTIP would apply with respect to the rebate coming from the municipality instead of the province.
Incentives for landowners should be based on the quantity and quality of species at risk habitat involved (i.e. more incentive if multiple species are involved), and they should be significant enough to actually result in protection or restoration of habitat in the face of other economic uses of the land. For example, farmers that protect species at risk habitat on their lands should benefit from this, rather than having to absorb an economic loss from it. The Alternate Land Use Services (ALUS) program, operating in several regions in Ontario, is a good model for this.
The Species at Risk Stewardship Fund (SARSF) has been a very successful tool for enabling recovery actions for species at risk since its inception in 2007. However, this fund rarely has sufficient resources to cover all proposed activities that pass the review process. Support for this program should be increased. However, more money is not the only improvement necessary for this program to be even more effective. A significant issue for applicants is that approvals are frequently announced so late, due to budgetary processes, that proposed work either cannot be completed or must be highly modified and less effective. Species recovery activities need to happen when the work can best be done (i.e. early spring, good weather, etc.) and not when the wheels of bureaucracy and politics decide. Therefore earlier approvals, and more multi-year agreements, would be more efficient and allow for better outcomes for species at risk with the same amount of funding.
Furthermore, such improvements need to be combined with streamlined permitting for recovery activities as mentioned above in Focus Area 4. It is a ludicrous situation to be waiting for funding approval to do recovery activities in the spring, finally get notification of funding approval, and then still be awaiting permit approval to begin the work in question which has now been awarded funding. This puts people in the untenable position of deciding to a) not do the work at the appropriate time (or at all) or b) start the work without a required permit, and risk being charged with contravention of the ESA or FWCA. Both of these are bad outcomes. Even though the proposed work has been reviewed and approved for provincial funding, and may be the same activities as approved in previous years, it ends up being compromised in many situations. Any system that defines priority recovery actions (i.e. through a GRS), then reviews and funds an organization to undertake activities to address those (i.e. through SARSF), and then inhibits them from doing so effectively by not authorizing said activities in time for them to actually occur and punishes those who proceed while awaiting the authorization, is a system that needs to be improved upon. I have made some suggestions for improvement here, and would further suggest that this area should be examined by a group that includes ministry staff, NGO and academic recovery personnel, and landowners for additional opportunities for improvement.

23279,/comment/23279,"1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

There is too much ambiguity in this and it can easily be abused. What is the definition of significant social benefit? Who decides this? I can't agree that the idea of trading SAR protections because of a vague promise of social or economic benefit is in the spirit of conservation or in the spirit of the species at risk act. This clause undermines the whole purpose of the act and allows profit hungry businesses skirt the law. Maybe instead provide incentive for business models that aren't damaging to habitats.
Also it would be beneficial to many meadow dwelling species of birds that are currently listed as species at risk (I'm thinking Bobolink, Eastern Meadowlark, etc) if we implemented more regulation to farmers as to when they can plow their fields. They're literally destroying nesting and breeding bird territory DURING breeding season, and no one does anything about it because farmers are such a protected group of people. If we provide more oversight on these environmentally unsound farming practices, we might be able to help mitigate some of the massive ecological damage farmers cause (without even touching on how important it is to subsidize the diversification of crops).

23281,/comment/23281,"I am very concerned by this proposal.  We are at a time when biodiversity loss is increasing, and threats to our ecosystems are continually increasing as well.  We need to take action now to prevent further degradation and to actually start to recover from past uses.  This is particularly true for species at risk.  As we teach our children - extinction is forever.  We have the social and moral and economic need to protect our species, particularly those affected by our actions.  Yet this proposal weakens the current legislation, rather than increasing it and providing more protections.
I respect that some businesses may feel that environmental reviews cost them money and/or time, and I believe that businesses have the right to try and survive and grow, but this should not come at our environments cost.  Indeed, if we destroy our environment businesses will suffer too.
We need to preserve our independent assessment of species health and population status.  Having untrained individuals, like our minister, be able to have final decision power as to whether a species is in decline does not make sense, and does not favour the species recovery.  This is particularly true when the politician wants to win ""votes"" and bows to political pressure.  A business can pressure a decision change much better than a plant.
While regulations and reviews can be cumbersome, the solution is not to scrap them.  While regulations may prohibit or inhibit some development, the solution is not to scrap them.  There needs to be some give and take, a due process, and in some instances, yes, the survival of that frog or plant does need to take precedence.  It's not all about maximizing extraction from an area.  Yes, e.g. aggregates are needed, but lets try to limit the damage, and not increase it.  So the recent changes to the bill that waived most of the ESA's protections/regulations in the case of e.g. mining and forestry, should be repealed.  Exemptions do happen, and can happen, but it should be a rarity and not a common occurrence.
When development/impacts do take place, we need to increase our restoration activities, and make them count.  Have them targeted for different species recovery when possible - maximize the work.  Habitat regulations are there for a reason - you can't protect the species when it's habitat is at risk.  You can't protect the species when something it feeds on, lives on, sleeps on, moves through, etc. disappears or is degraded either.  Putting money into a big restoration money pot doesn't help species either - it needs to happen on the ground, in the same area, with linkages that make ecological sense.
Please, don't be short sighted.  We need to protect and strengthen the ESA, not dismantle it.

23282,/comment/23282,"To the OMNR and the OMECP,
My name is Thomas McCay.  I am an RPF and the Forestry Manager for Haliburton Forest & Wildlife Reserve.  Haliburton Forest is a private landowner in Ontario who pursues sustainable and multi-use forest management as a business.  We directly and indirectly own and manage ~250,000 acres of Forest in Haliburton, Muskoka, and Timmins.  I am happy to respond to the ER posting as a representative of Haliburton Forest, as a Professional Forester, and as a concerned citizen.   I'll provide my feedback as direct responses to the discussion areas highlighted in the posting.
1.  A species-specific approach focusing on individuals and habitat makes sense when there is a highly threatened group facing specific and highly localized threats.  It does not makes sense when those species needs are part of a broader landscape dynamic, and where the a marginal benefit to a threatened species results in negative implications for other wildlife communities.  I advocate for integrating endagered species protection with landscape level plans wherever feasible.  This could involve Crown FMP's and direct CFSA-ESA integration (or a section 55 solution), it could also involve other landscape level plans such as a Conservation Authority/Municipalities management plan, or a MFTIP plan which covers some minimum number of acres.  These other solutions could provide relief through a section 18 or section 55 approach.
2. Having observed one COSSARO meeting, I was surprised by the general lack of committment or engagement by its members and supervisors.  I have seen more active discussion at a university seminar.  This raised concerns for me that the listing process was not being taken as seriously as it should be.  Perhaps more compensation or other rewards are due to the members to encourage more careful review.  Diversifying the membership of the committee to include individuals called in specifically for a species which is there specialty might also be appropriate.   I think a lack of data can affect the committees decisions:  Blandings turtle is a great example where the population estimate has exploded after it's listing, due to a higher search and reporting effort.   Blandings turtle also highlights a geographic difficulty, where the species is really threatened in southern ontario, not in central ontario, but the listing wrongly restricts activity across its entire range.
Finally, I believe that the listing process should be impartial and apolitical, but the decision on  how to respond to species threats should consider the all aspects of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental.  Ministerial review of how to apply the listing decision or habitat description is appropriate.
3.  I support the development of habitat protections which will help a species recover.  But too often the precautionary approach means that a under-developed habitat description is rolled out which a) fails to truly help the species and b) is unnecessarily restrictive.   American ginseng is a good example of an at-risk plant with a poor habitat description.  In indepedent research, I have found that ginseng can tolerate mild disturbance and the disturbance can even help it expand it's range.  But the habitat description follows a complete avoidance approach.  On top of this, it is well known that the real threat to ginseng is poaching.  In Mazinaw-Lanark, I have heard that technicians do not actually implement the buffers required under the habitat description, because it simply signals to poachers where there is ginseng to be found.  They implement no buffers and the ginseng has not been experiencing any negative results.  A better habitat description - and better policing - is needed for this species.   There are many examples of this failure to properly identify the real threats, and how current listing, recovery plans and habitat description do little to help while imposing other costs:  Blandings Turtle - Road mortality, Ginseng - poaching, Whip-poor-will - predation, fast traffic, loss of open area habitat.  There are many other examples.
A more complicated examples involves woodland caribou.  I had the privilege of watching a presentation from a senior MNR biologist on how the MNR arrived at the 35/65 disturbance threshold.  I was left confused and unconvinced that this properly applied to Ontario's herds.  And yet this approach may still form the cornerstone of the species recovery strategy.  More time and better data are clearly needed.
4.  My primary concern is Forestry.   Because Forestry a) operates with a view to the entire landscape and all species, and b) provides site-by-site concern for individual species in management plans (CFSA FMP's, MFTIP, 3rd party certified plans) and guidance documents (such as the stand and site guide), and c) does not convert habitat away from Forest, and in general renews habitat rather than degrading or destroying it, I believe crown Forestry should have a permanent section 55 solution, and that other plans should be eligible for a Section 55 or Section 18 solution.    This could be adapted where individual species have extremely specific requirements that Forestry does degrade or destroy.
In Summary, the ESA program needs:
A more rigorous listing process with enhanced membership, with the ministerial oversight of protections for listed species.
Habitat descriptions and recovery plans which target the true threats to a species, with better data and science to inform how to save a species.
Increased enforcement or policing of a species true threats.
A landscape level approach wherever an inidvidual species can tolerate it, and utilizing Section 55 regulations where possible for forest management.  Section 18 solutions may be feasible for 'niche' forest managers.

23290,/comment/23290,"I am strongly opposed to the direction that the discussion paper for the 10th year review for the Endangered Species Act is taking.
Business and industry cannot be allowed to proceed regardless of the ecological costs. Once habitat is fragmented or destroyed, we cannot bring it back. Many species depend on well-established, large expanses of mature forests, wetlands, tundra, or grasslands. Once that habitat no longer exists, species that are unable to adapt or migrate are destined to go extinct.
It is not possible “to improve protections for species at risk” and “streamline approvals and provide clarity to support economic development”. A Species at Risk instrument must fully prioritize species at risk.
Area of focus 1:
“protection and recovery approaches for individual species can limit or conflict with one another.”
When species naturally coexist, protecting habitat for multiple species cannot possibly conflict. When a conflict occurs, such as between wolves and woodland caribou, it is the fault of human interference in the form of resource exploration and extraction.
Area of focus 2:
“There is not enough public notice before a new species is automatically listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List.” That is not true. Providing notice without first protecting species provides a warning that allows individuals, business, or industry with an intent to develop land the opportunity to destroy habitat and remove the species. Once the species has been removed, there remains little reason to prevent the development from going forward.
“In some cases, automatic species and habitat protections can contribute to high uncertainty and costly impacts to businesses and the public.” There should be no uncertainty; habitat preservation must come first. Worrying about costly impacts to business is short sighted. Consider the valuable ecosystem services provided by intact habitats over long time frames.
“longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat.” This appears to give a minister license to ignore the scientific studies in favour of whatever development the government chooses to favour. Would you delay protection until there is nothing left to protect?
Area of focus 3:
9 months to develop a response statement and reviewing progress within 5 years is not too short a time frame. If it is legitimately a challenge to respond within 9 months, consider hiring more staff who have expertise in the required areas. Reviewing progress within 5 years allows further changes to be made to respond to continued declines, stability, or growth in populations. The sooner successful strategies are recognized, the sooner they can be duplicated in other areas.
Area of focus 4:
“in lieu of activity-based requirements enable paying into a conservation fund dedicated to species at risk conservation.” It needs to be recognized that after some development, there is no amount of money that can replace what has been lost. Alberta has discovered this with their huge sacrifice zone of the oil sands. There has been no evidence put forward that demonstrates companies have any ability to remediate any of the region, yet developments are approved with the promise of unproven rehabilitation. Large-scale developments such as the Ring of Fire have the potential to create a widespread sacrifice zone in Ontario. Many smaller developments together contribute to significant ecological declines. Allowing companies to pay into a fund without being directly responsible for action planning allows them to profit and walk away. Clearly governments, conservation authorities, and private organizations are not funded well enough to make up for this negligence.
In conclusion, please prioritize the species and habitats that are at risk. The legislation should not be seen as burdensome roadblocks. It should be seen as a safeguard for our collective future.

23291,/comment/23291,"Dear Public Input Coordinator,
I am very concerned about the difficult circumstances faced by species-at-risk in Ontario. Our province is home to 243 species that are at risk of extinction. Endangered and threatened species in Ontario have already been deprived of protections due to widespread exemptions for industry which were enacted in 2013. These exemptions have made it far too easy for critical habitat to be developed and/or fragmented, and for species-at-risk to not be adequately protected.
The Ontario government is proposing to further streamline approvals. A review of Ontario's ""Endangered Species Act” (ESA) is necessary, but the Conservative government’s emphasis on creating “efficiencies for business” will likely enable industrial activities that will imperil those at-risk species (and their habitats) that required the most stringent safeguards.
The government should focus on improving implementation of the ESA, as follows:
1. Any changes to the ESA should improve protections to vulnerable species and their habitats, not weaken them.
2. The government must withdraw the 2013 regulation that exempts industry from the core protection provisions of the ESA. It must fulfill its promise to protect at-risk species by enforcing all components of the ESA. Thus, clearly-defined zones which prohibit industrial development, resource extraction, or other activities that may disturb or harm vulnerable species or their habitats should be created. This would actually be more efficient for industry, as it would then be clear where their activities are forbidden.
3. Decisions on which species should be classified as “extirpated”, “endangered”, “threatened”, or those of “special concern” (and the subsequent conservation mechanisms that are required) should be science-based and made by scientists who work in the field. Politicians should have no involvement in this process.
I strongly urge you to ensure that the ESA is implemented as it was originally intended – with a focus on protecting and recovering species-at-risk. This legislation must lead to recovery for vulnerable species in Ontario rather than changes that will drive more of them toward extinction.
Thank you for your consideration.

I urge the government to repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries; maintain the current science-based listing process; maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted,  with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm. Any landscape approach, if adopted, must build on and improve the species-specific requirements set out in the ESA.
A short-sighted fixation on environmental deregulation would not serve anyone's long-term interests, not even those of business. A healthy economy depends on a healthy environment.  I urge the government to be part of the global push to protect species at risk and shoulder its responsibility in protecting the natural world which enriches the quality of life for present and future generations.
Thank you.

23304,/comment/23304,"I have read the discussion paper that claims to be about protecting endangered species in Ontario.  It is apparent that this government is not interested in protecting species at risk but rather is planning to destroy what beneficial legislation currently exists so that developers and businesses can trample all over our wildlife and endangered species.  The government is putting the interests of developers and businesses ahead of the interests of the people of Ontario and future generations - not to mention the species that are endangered.  Ontario already has a dismal record in this regard. Please don’t make it worse.

23308,/comment/23308,"Dear Government of Ontario,
Thank you for the opportunity to add my voice to the consultation on the Endangered Species Act (ESA) review and discussion paper.
I am very concerned at the number of species in ON that are currently listed as ""endangered"" and the even greater number that are already ""at risk"".  With the effects of climate change growing, stress on all these species can only be expected to increase.
My understanding is that the current ESA legislation would be much more effective if the enforcement of it was improved.  The science is clearly showing that business-as-usual development and industrial activities continue to threaten the survival and recovery of wildlife in Ontario.  What is needed is not greater efficiency for industry but, rather, greater efficiency and an increased effort to recover the province’s at-risk species before they are gone.
Therefore, I urge you to:
•  Focus on habitat-protection measures that are effective for the listed species and that simultaneously improve outcomes for multiple species at risk.
•  Work with other ministries to ensure coordination to limit cumulative impacts on the lands and waters that provide wildlife habitat.
•  Repeal the long list of exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development, approved by cabinet in 2013.
•  Amend the law to set a higher bar for creating exemptions through regulation by ensuring they cannot jeopardize the recovery of threatened or endangered species.
•  Ensure local communities benefit from activities to maintain and restore endangered species and their habitat, including rural and northern communities.
•  Support the continued leadership and critical role of Indigenous Peoples in conservation initiatives.

Re: 		10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper
Enbridge Inc. (“Enbridge” or the “Company”) is North America's premier energy infrastructure company with strategic business platforms that include an extensive network of crude oil, liquids and natural gas pipelines, regulated natural gas distribution utilities and renewable power generation. The Company safely delivers an average of 2.9 million barrels of crude oil each day through its Mainline and Express Pipeline; accounts for approximately 62% of U.S.-bound Canadian crude oil exports; and moves approximately 22% of all natural gas consumed in the U.S., serving key supply basins and demand markets. The Company's regulated utility, Enbridge Gas serves approximately 3.7 million retail customers in Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick. Enbridge also has interests in more than 1,700 MW of net renewable generating capacity in North America and Europe.
Enbridge is pleased to provide the Ministry Environment, Conservation and Parks (“MECP”) with comments on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act Discussion Paper.  Enbridge has reviewed the Discussion Paper and respectfully submits these comments for MECP’s review and consideration.
AREA OF FOCUS 2 – LISTING PROCESS AND PROTECTIONS FOR SPECIES AT RISK
There is not enough public notice before a new species is automatically listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List;
In some cases, automatic species and habitat protections can contribute to high uncertainty and costly impacts to businesses and the public.
•	Enbridge agrees with the above statements and would support longer timelines before a new species is listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List.  Longer timelines will allow for assessment of the potential impact of newly listed species on existing operational sites or in-flight projects and development of a monitoring/mitigation plan for the newly listed species, if required. In some circumstances, such as operating wind power facilities, protections for newly listed species could be costly and time-consuming to develop.  Longer transition periods and consultation with the MECP on the required protections for newly listed species would be appropriate in these cases.
AREA OF FOCUS 4 – AUTHORIZATION PROCESSES
Authorization processes can create significant administrative burdens and delays, in particular for applicants filing numerous authorizations or registrations under the rules-in-regulations for routine activities.
•	Enbridge agrees with this statement and would actively engage in an opportunity to create a letter of understanding or a conservation agreement with the MECP that would support routine construction, operation and maintenance activities with defined mitigation and conservation activities to fulfill the intention of the Ontario Endangered Species Act (the “Act” or the “ESA”).  Enbridge currently holds a similar agreement with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans with respect to routine watercourse crossings, which has significantly streamlined the approval process, administrative activities and provided the scheduling certainty required for effective project execution.
•	Where overall benefit activities are required, Enbridge would welcome additional authorization tools that are not tied to the specific activity or project location.  Enbridge suggests that the MECP consider the concept of a conservation fund dedicated to species at risk or conservation banking which would enable a proponent to address species at risk requirements prior to the start of a project however Enbridge would like the opportunity to review any proposed plan. Such tools could add clarity to the process by creating known available options for overall benefits, and also create certainty on the timelines for obtaining permits.  This would benefit construction projects that are subject to multiple approval and permitting processes.  The establishment of a conservation fund could potentially allow for broad scale, multiyear overall benefit programs and could include a landscape approach to species and habitat protection.  A landscape approach is typically beyond the scope or scale of beneficial activities in the current individual overall benefit project approach.  A conservation fund also has the potential to save significant resources for both the proponent and the regulator by reducing the number of small, project specific overall benefit programs developed and reviewed.
The requirements that applicants must fulfill to obtain an authorization can be extensive, creating barriers to economic development (e.g., in some cases achieving an overall benefit to a species as required under a s. 17(2)(c) permit can be long, onerous, and unpredictable).
Enbridge agrees with this statement and has experienced significant delays in the authorization process leading to construction schedule impacts and considerable added costs, both to Enbridge and the ratepayers of Ontario. To improve the authorization process, Enbridge recommends the following be considered:
•	A commitment from the MECP to engage in pre-consultation.  This would involve meeting  well in advance (1-2 years) prior to construction to review  project timelines including when decisions are required in  order to achieve a committed in service date established through a regulatory process, such as an Ontario Energy Board (OEB) Order. Regular discussions and understanding is needed to ensure the ESA and other regulatory requirements can be met. A commitment from both parties is needed in the early stages of a project.
•	Identification by MECP of different mitigation strategies for linear projects to ensure mitigation is effective and consistent. Past permitting experiences have resulted in requested mitigation appropriate for contained site development, which when applied on a linear project is often ineffective, infeasible and costly. Enbridge welcomes the opportunity to share our experience and knowledge on typical pipeline construction activities and project timelines.
•	Standardize, as much as possible, the mitigation measures applied for a specific species both within the district and across the province.    Increased standardization will assist in streamlining the authorization process as well as the effectiveness of the implementation.
•	Enbridge recommends that overall benefit projects are focused on the recommendations of the recovery strategies and/or government response statements, rather than being tied to a specific project and geographic location. It has been Enbridge’s experience that the selection and acceptance of overall benefit projects associated with authorizations has been subjective, where local initiatives have been championed over projects in other regions that may be of more immediate and/or greater benefit to the species of concern. Overall benefit projects would benefit from being implemented separately from pipeline construction projects, where they are not subject to the competing priorities, and timelines of pipeline construction. With these past experiences in mind, Enbridge may support in lieu activity-based requirements such as a conservation fund, or conservation banking as a way for both parties to agree on an overall benefit project that can proceed at a later date on its own schedule, not impacting the primary project.
•	Enbridge recommends a one window approach, and a service standard or guarantee for review and approval of authorization requests.  A one window approach would eliminate confusion around who to contact for status updates as the application passes through various offices for review (Local, Regional, Peterborough and Toronto).
•	Enbridge recommends a service level agreement as currently there are no definitive timelines for reviews and approvals and Ministry response times can vary from one day for a simple question to months for an authorization.  This adds significant uncertainty in the project planning process.  The proponent needs assurance that the file is moving and remains on an agreed upon schedule.
The Act adds duplication and delay for activities that are subject to other legislative or regulatory frameworks, like forestry under Ontario’s Crown Forest Sustainability Act.
•	Enbridge agrees with this statement and has experienced delays with respect to the federal Species at Risk Act (“SARA”) and the Fisheries Act in combination with the ESA for the protection of aquatic species at risk. In many cases a species listed under SARA is also listed under the ESA and requires both federal and provincial permitting and approvals.  This creates duplication of time, effort, and cost and in some cases conflicting mitigation requirements, all resulting in significant project delays.  The ability to exempt, defer to or harmonize the ESA applications and approvals with the SARA process would benefit all proponents navigating these processes.
•	Consideration should be given to removing the requirements to receive a permit under s.17(2)d for projects that have been approved through another regulatory process such as the National Energy Board Act or the Ontario Energy Board Act and that have already considered the social or economic benefit of a project to Ontario. If such projects could be exempt from section 17(2)d, this would help to reduce uncertainties and duplication associated with review and approval timelines for projects that  have regulatory approval and have been deemed to be a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario.
Are there other approaches to authorizations that could enable applicants to take a more strategic or collaborative approach to address impacts to species at risk?
•	Enbridge would like to suggest a risk-based approach to defining and categorizing activities and the corresponding requirements, rather than outlining specific rules in regulation for species or activities.  The risk-based approach could follow a similar approach to class environmental assessments where there is a standardized process for classes or groups of activities.  This would be extremely beneficial for projects that are routinely carried out and have predicable environmental effects that can be readily managed, such as operations and maintenance activities on pipeline infrastructure.
To accommodate the diverse range of projects, it has long been recognized by many federal and provincial ministries as necessary to provide several levels of planning and decision making. We suggest that projects/activities can be better categorized to expedite planning and provide increased certainty with respect to requirements and schedule as we continue to invest in building Ontario.  Categories can be as identified using pre-determined criteria, as currently done for many Environmental Assessments, including those described in Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's Class Environmental Assessment document to determine potential for impact.
An example that Enbridge routinely faces is installation of pipelines using trenchless techniques where records of Redside Dace exist.  Trenchless techniques such as directional drilling have long been viewed as a routine construction practice with well-known and documented best practices and mitigation measures.  When using the registration process (Notice of Activity), this activity should be viewed as low risk, and should be subject to the same requirements as activities undertaken for non-imminent threats to health and safety (i.e., Section 23.18 of Ontario Regulation 242/08), which includes the requirement to have an appropriate mitigation plan (i.e., a contingency plan for frac-outs), but does not require long term monitoring or a commitment to provide overall benefit.
We would be pleased to coordinate a meeting with the MECP to discuss these comments further. We appreciate the MECP’s main objectives of protecting and recovering Ontario’s species at risk and preserving and protecting our environment for future generations. Our comments were thoughtfully considered to balance the importance of protecting species at risk while ensuring that our project activities remain practical, feasible and cost-effective in their implementation.  It remains Enbridge’s objective to safely and reliably deliver natural gas to our customers throughout Ontario, in a manner that respects the environment and communities in which we operate.

23312,/comment/23312,"1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

World renowned wildlife scientists predict that since 1970 and by 2020, 2/3 of the world's wildlife will be gone. Ontario is not immune to this. We need wildlife to keep the ecosystem healthy.
Ontario MUST provide strict protections for species at risk. The proposals being considered will not accomplish this. These proposals would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitat of unprotected animals and plants.
The ESA's purpose is to protect wildlife and to help at risk species to recover.

-Repeal the 2013 exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and development industries
-Amend section 57 (1)1 so exemptions are only allowed if they will not jeopardize survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species
-Maintain COSSARO's current science based listing process
-Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion
-Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to  species impacted, with absolutely NO OPTION to pay into a fund to compensate for harm.

23323,/comment/23323,"Endangered species are already facing enough pressures, hence why they are endangered. They need what habitat they have left to be in such condition that it can continue to support them and be resilient in the face of changing conditions, not whittled away for the sake of a few extra GDP dollars. By protecting endangered species we also protect some of our most valuable ecosystems and special places as a whole for the future. Automatic protection for species is in line with the precautionary principle, and is necessary for the careful considerations in decisions affecting their habitat. If this government wants to protect species, they ought to be removing exemptions, not keeping them or adding new ones.
Most striking, is the the government's option to allow an industry do bypass protection as long as they pay into a fund. The assumption here is that the value of that money can be traded for the equivalent value of the ecosystem. This is patently false, as no species or ecosystem can be simply brought back onto the landscape. While certain technologies and practices exist to help restore habitats, they cannot magically bring species at risk back into these environments, as there are often barriers to their spread. These natural heritage components may not even have the same value as money per se, such as enjoyment or existence value. Even supposing that a given species or ecosystem can be translated into monetary terms, how does paying into a fund compensate for the ongoing  services they would have provided?
Exemptions should only be provided if the activity can be shown to a sufficiently high degree on confidence not be impact the endangered species or species at risk in question. Otherwise, the act doesn't really help endangered species at all since the biggest threat to them is precisely because of economic activities, the main thing that is and increasingly would be exempt.

23328,/comment/23328,"ESA - Ten Year Review of the Endangered Species Act – Comments
In what circumstances would a more strategic approach support a proposed activity while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk? (e.g., by using a landscape approach instead of a case-by-case approach, which tends to be species and/or site-specific.)
I agree that in order to have success protecting and restoring species at risk a landscape approach has to be considered. This would include landscape habitat targets, determination of minimum viable habitat for species. Ultimately success can only be achieved through stewardship programs. The reality is that most SAR are found on private land in southern Ontario. You need private landowner buy in. Since the ESA was introduced in 2007 the list of species at risk has grown alarmingly. Very clearly the current system is not working.
Are there existing tools or processes that support managing for species risk at a landscape scale that could be recognized under the Endangered Species Act?
There are tools such as safe harbour agreements, but programs such as the Alternate Land Use Services (ALUS) program are probably the best avenue for success. The key is to encourage and enlist willing landowners and to look at development proposals as an opportunity for restoration.
What changes would improve the notification process of a new species being listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List? (e.g. longer timelines before a species is listed.
Yes a longer time period. Also perhaps a quarterly list of species being reviewed and considered that could easily accessed by the public. There should always be opportunity for comment.
Should there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections? (e.g., longer transition periods or whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat.)ministerial discretion on
Yes, in some cases. For example, the greatest risk to Butternut is a disease (canker). The best hope for Butternut is to find trees that show signs of resistance to the canker. Private landowner cooperation and buy in is essential. Currently many private landowners are apprehensive and are fearful of restrictions to the use of their property because of the ESA (rightly or wrongly). Some landowners are even quietly removing their Butternut. A different approach that enlists the support of private landowners without any fear of restrictions would benefit Butternut more that the current approach.
How can the process regarding assessment and classification of a species by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario be improved? (e.g., request an additional review and assessment in cases where there is emerging science or conflicting information.
Currently COSSARO does draw on outside expertise to review status reports and provide input. Unfortunately everyone involved in the process currently tends to be like-minded quite often making the case for the greatest protection they can rationalize with the information they have. There are often huge data gaps. Some species being assessed simply have not been inventoried. The rational for some high level of protection is often very circumstantial. Currently there is a lack of objectivity. There absolutely needs to be a review by an independent, objective review team of the data and rationale for listing a species prior to a species being listed. This review team doesn’t have to be experts but should have science backgrounds or be able to draw on science. They would take an objective look at the data and determine if they feel there is sufficient data and evidence to support a recommendation for listing or if more information should be collected before listing. This approach would also increase transparency. A review team might also offer an opinion on whether listing a species would actually be the best approach for protecting and restoring a particular species. For example. Butternut. The issue with butternut is canker, generally not habitat loss. The best hope for butternut is to find trees that have resistance to canker. Most butternut are found on private land where landowner cooperation is needed to find butternut. The ESA has created mistrust and apprehension. Most landowners are not inviting government officials to look for healthy butternut and some are even cutting butternut out of misguided fear that having an endangered species will impact the use of their land.
In what circumstances is the development of a habitat regulation warranted, or not warranted? (e.g., to improve certainty for businesses and others about the scope of habitat that is protected?
In my opinion in most circumstances it is not warranted.
Area of Focus 4
Currently there are some tools under the ESA that can encourage stewardship of species at risk.; i.e.
Stewardship agreement, s. 16:  An agreement may be entered into under this section for activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species at risk.
Protection or recovery permit, s. 17(2)(b): A protection or recovery permit may be issued for an activity that is meant to help a species at risk or its habitat, but the activity may involve actions that are otherwise prohibited under the Act (e.g., capturing or possessing the species).
Overall benefit permit, s. 17(2)(c): An overall benefit permit may be issued for an activity that would have an adverse effect on species at risk or their habitat, as long as an overall benefit is provided to the species in Ontario through conditions of the permit. Providing an overall benefit to a species means undertaking actions that contribute to improving the circumstances for the species.
However these tools are not widely used. There should be dedicated staff available to promote and assist landowners with these tools.
In addition, new programs should be implemented to expand stewardship efforts through partnerships with organizations such as the Ontario Woodlot Association who have direct links to private landowners.
For example, programs such the Alternate Land Use Services (ALUS) program is an excellent model to encourage private landowners to restore habitat for SAR.
In my opinion too much staff time has been spend on the development of habitat regulations which have been largely been ineffective over the southern Ontario landscape where about 90% of the land is privately owned. Not enough time has been spent working with private landowners to build trust and to initiate programs and projects to restore SAR to actually make a positive difference.
The following is a paper written in 2012. It was based on the proceedings of a workshop attended primarily by farmers, woodlot owners and people from the forest industry. At that time the Ministry of Natural Resources was the lead for the program. The paper I believe is still pertinent.

The only area that is clear is how the review of the ESA will streamline paper work, and that it will only weaken an already insufficient Act. Although the objectives include better protections for species at risk, none of the suggested ""improvements"" would  accomplish this goal.
The landscape approaches suggested in Area of Focus 1 already exist. Areas of Focus 2 and 3 exhibit a disproportionate focus on changing the listing processes and timelines involved in arriving at the implementation stage, rather than how recovery action is actually done. Even if longer timelines, greater transparency and an altered listing process do constitute a better system, they're superficial changes that won't do anything for species without the assurance that the government will put time and resources into recovery action.
But if anything, the proposed changes will negatively impact protections for species at risk. Please do not politicize the process by introducing ""ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat."" (p. 4). An endangered species is an endangered species whether politicians find it convenient or not.
The process of listing species as at risk, developing a Recovery Strategy and a Response Statement and then implementing it is disconnected enough without the added complication of ministerial discretion; nor do we have the time for extended deadlines. We want to see action now, because the longer we wait the more expensive and time consuming it becomes to clean up our mess, not to mention the money spent paying ministers to sit and discuss the matter and stall.
I am not comfortable with how the lack of improvements for species at risk balances against the heavy-handed efforts to lessen the ""administrative burdens"" on businesses, aka. make it easier for them to destroy ecosystems. We have already taken so much from the ecosystem that some species just can't afford to be sacrificed for economic benefit any further. Please do not make it even easier to achieve authorization for permits as suggested in Area of Focus 4, or allow businesses to get away with destroying biodiversity by paying a sum of money.
Instead, reduce the number of permits available for authorization and take action now to preserve our pollinators, our wetlands, and other species and natural habitats.
Thank you.

23342,/comment/23342,"1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23343,/comment/23343,"""I strongly oppose any intention of my provincial government to reduce the efficacy and reputability of the Endangered Species Act in Ontario. I support its strengthening and further implementation to ensure all species at risk in Ontario are afforded stronger protection to individuals and their habitats. Southern Ontario habitat for listed species is subject to on-going disturbance, fragmentation and destruction via the authorization process for land use conversion in the name of economic growth.
In response to some of the proposed amendments:
Species-specific assessment should remain the focal point of the permitting and monitoring process, and the protection of such specific species should be considered at various landscape scales to encompass multi-species when applicable (e.g. interior woodlands, aquatic and avian species of wetlands). Landscape approach is already enabled and considered in the current Act. Further implementation of this strategy should be supported and provided increase resources.
Ministerial discretion is NOT equivalent and should NOT replace science-based and Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Ministerial discretion should not be included in amendments to this Act concerning the listing of species. Increased transparency for the listing mechanisms is recommended.
The Open for Business agenda of the current government should not have any association with the recovery and protection of Ontario's biodiversity. Flexibility for economic activity should not be further investigated.
Meaningful recovery actions need to be strengthened. Critical habitat needs further protection and authorizations for the destruction of critical habitat should not be permitted in the name of economic development or land use conversion to residential use.
Overall Benefit Permitting requiring Net Gain needs to be further implemented rather than reversion to ""minimizing harm"" permits. Compliance enforcement and monitoring needs to be increased.
A pro-active approach to Overall Benefit Permitting and habitat protection should be considered. Such an approach would include habitat compensation prescriptions, pre-determined, ready to be used when Authorizations to destroy are granted. For example, a standardized rate for SAR bat habitat loss and compensation measures (the number of bat boxes, bat condos, enhancement foraging habitat) should be established to increase the efficiency of the authorization process for both the developer, its proponent and the Ministry.
Further analysis on the effectiveness of the Overall Benefit Permitting and the status of listed species is encouraged. Case study examples from proven legislation and policies in other parts of the world, including the United States and European states, should be evaluated for efficacy and applicability.
In the spirit of the previous UN Decade on Biodiversity, Ontario has a global responsibility to conserve biodiversity. In the spirit of the next UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, habitat for species at risk needs only to be enhanced and restored, not further degraded, fragmented, or destroyed.""

23344,/comment/23344,"The Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA) is an effective species-at-risk management tool as it is, however it could benefit from certain updates. That being said, the ESA has many strong points that should remain as they are in order to benefit both Ontario’s species-at-risk and its citizens. I will go through each of the Areas of Focus outlined in the Discussion Paper and comment on some of the proposed changes.
AREA OF FOCUS 1: LANDSCAPE APPROACHES
The ESA’s current focus on protecting species-at-risk has its merits, however the process could be made more efficient by focusing on landscapes-at-risk.
When developing a conservation strategy for a species-at-risk, predator population control is often considered. However, when two species in a predator-prey relationship are listed as at-risk, then their individual recovery strategies can conflict. In these cases, listing an ecosystem or landscape type as at-risk would conserve both species, as well as others occupying the same habitat. A landscape-level approach would replace the implementation of separate conservation strategies, which would lower costs and administrative burdens. This strategy would be especially effective at lowering costs when two recovery strategies work against each other, such as in a strong predator-prey relationship.
Conserving a landscape rather than an individual species would keep special concern or not-at-risk species population levels healthy, reducing their probability of needing individual ESA protection in the future. Conserving landscapes would also promote a variety of ecosystem services to be enjoyed by all Ontarians, such as clean air and water.
AREA OF FOCUS 2: LISTING PROCESS AND PROTECTIONS FOR SPECIES AT RISK
The ESA’s current listing process has some aspects which are crucial to the viability of listed species and should remain untouched.
Automatic species/habitat protection without ministerial discretion is one of the strongest aspects of the ESA which some other legislation in Canada lacks (e.g. Species At Risk Act, 2003 (SARA)). By implementing automatic protection to listed species, the population is being protected while discussion surrounding the social or economic drawbacks of listing are being discussed. It provides emergency protection while a more effective strategy is being developed for the Response Statement. Time is crucial for a rapidly declining species, making automatic protections all the more necessary.
It is suggested in the Discussion Paper to extend the timeline for the Government to publish a Response Statement. Extending the timeline for developing a comprehensive recovery strategy may result in further population declines. It would be better to act sooner rather than later when making conservation decisions to avoid incurring irrecoverable losses to the population.
AREA OF FOCUS 3: SPECIES RECOVERY POLICIES AND HABITAT REGULATIONS
The species recovery policies and regulations have some room for improvement, however there are important regulatory aspects that should remain as they are.
Increasing the progress review timeline from five to 10 years after releasing the Response Statement may be a beneficial use of resources. For some species, especially long-lived organisms, population-level changes may not become noticeable within five years.
The development of a species-specific habitat regulation to replace the automatic general habitat regulation is a key aspect of the recovery process for a species listed under the ESA. General habitat protection is meant to be a temporary conservation strategy while a more thorough and highly-researched habitat regulation could be defined. Moving away from well-researched conservation strategies to vague, ‘good enough’ strategies risks changing the ESA from a strong piece of legislation to an empty framework which only gives the illusion of conserving Ontario’s species-at-risk.
AREA OF FOCUS 4: AUTHORIZATION PROCESS
Although the current authorization and permitting process under the ESA can be burdensome, it is a necessary step in ensuring the viability of the listed species. Permits and authorizations are necessary to maintain an appropriate balance between nature and development.
Contrary to what many people believe, it is possible to have development which results in a win-win situation for both the economy and nature. Achieving this requires a compromise on both sides. Extensive regulation is the trade-off for economic development, and habitat loss is the trade-off for nature. Reducing the number of permits needed for development risks tilting the scales in favour of development, which would have costly impacts for not only nature, but for the health of present and future Ontarians.
In conclusion, the ESA as it currently stands is effective at conserving species-at-risk in Ontario. However, there is always room for improvement as discussed above. Unfortunately, some of the proposed changes outlined in the Discussion Paper would harm the effectiveness of the ESA and would be doing a disservice to Ontarians. The decision to revamp the ESA should not be taken lightly, and the various legal issues associated with the SARA should act as a cautionary tale for Ontario’s government. Ontario is rich in beautiful, natural landscapes which many Ontarians consider part of their identity. These natural areas and their species-at-risk should be conserved for future generations to enjoy.

Landscape Focus
•	I think that a landscape approach could work for species that make use of large areas.  However, you better think it through very carefully as to what that looks like in terms of on the ground implementation.  For example, the approach to habitat management for woodland caribou appears to have adversely affected marten, moose and wolverine populations since very large clearcuts are promoted. You had better watch that your efforts for one species don’t cause other species to end up on a threatened or endangered list.
•	You need to recognize, in a landscape approach, where your prescription for the target species may not work.  In other words, it isn’t a one size fits all prescription.  Again, caribou are a fine example of this.  In the Trout Lake Forest Unit a large percentage of the unit is more conducive to the production of moose yet we have applied habitat management prescriptions for woodland caribou.  The result is that you have degraded moose habitat and this has resulted in a significant population decline.  We are also seeing a significant impact on furbearer populations all in the name of woodland caribou. This in turn has had significant social, recreational and economic impacts on indigenous peoples, local residents and the tourism industry.  We seem to get tunnel vision and forget that these other species are valuable ecosystem components!
•	We need to recognize the influence of climate change on the outcome that we would like to achieve in the future.  If the future outlook for a portion of the landscape that you want to manage for a species is not positive don’t implement management actions that a/ ultimately won’t work and b/ have adverse effects on other species.
Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
•	In my opinion COSSARO and SARPAC do not function effectively.  I would submit that their recommendations are based more on personal opinion/agendas and political expediency than on scientific evidence.  A very real example of this is the case of wolves in Southern Ontario.
•	The recommendations made by COSSARO/SARPAC do not instill confidence that decisions are science based.  If there needs to be an advisory body then it should be concerned with the scientific basis for recommendations and not politics. This is an opinion held by myself and a large number of other members of the public.
•	Is a review body needed to make recommendations to government? I think that one is probably needed but let’s review and revise the membership and mandate so that a/ decisions are science based and b/ the process of decision making is much more transparent.  At this point COSSARO/SARPAC doesn’t appear to have to make public any of the discussions that they undertook to get to a recommendation or to describe the science that was considered.  Again, this doesn’t add to public confidence in COSSARO/SARPAC or the process to place species are on the various protection lists.
•	If we have an independent body to make recommendations to government then the public needs to be able to see the science that was used in making a recommendation, how it was interpreted and, the minutes of discussions by that body.  In addition, the public needs to have the ability to comment on a recommendation and there needs to be a dispute resolution mechanism.
•	If we want public review and input and a dispute resolution process is implemented then we need to increase the timeframe before a species is added to the Species at Risk list.
Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
•	The time limit of 9 months to develop a response statement is too short in my opinion.  Perhaps for some species this might work but probably not for all species.  If you try to jam, what needs to be very thoughtful work, into a relative short timeframe you won’t get a good product.  There needs to be more time for public review and input.
•	The recovery strategies that have prepared to date for some species are problematic in my opinion. It would appear to me that these strategies don’t adequately consider the impacts to other species or to social and economic values.  For example, the habitat management activities related to caribou have adversely affected moose, American marten and wolverine habitat.
•	I also submit that recovery strategies create “tunnel vision” in government so that the species in question is all that they see. Again, a good example is woodland caribou.  In forest management planning all we hear about is the habitat needs for woodland caribou and why we can’t do something innovative for other species.  When you mention other species considerations the response is caribou are the priority and the other species will receive “consideration”. I have yet to hear and understand what “will receive consideration” means.
•	Lastly, if you want to garner public support for managing some of the species that are threatened or endangered then don’t establish management actions that appear to trade one species off for another.
•	I am also concerned about the review process.  Firstly, I don’t think that a robust review or monitoring process is in place.  Secondly, the impacts of management actions intended for an endangered species on other species doesn’t seem to be considered important.  If you want to look at impacts on other species beside the target species then monitoring that begins within 5 years would seem appropriate.

23349,/comment/23349,"Hello,
I submit this comment from the perspective of approx 50 000 hours experience: owning and running a Forest Management Company who has employed up to 30 people;  being a shareholder and president of a small land development company; sitting on the Board of Westwind Forest Stewardship, the French/Severn SFL, in the Independent Logging seat for 8 years; having been a director of the Near North Chapter of the Central Almaguin Chamber of Commerce; sitting as the secretary-treasurer for the Ontario Woodlot Assoc. Near North Chapter for nearly 10 years; and lastly as the newly elected Mayor of Joly Township who sits on joint municipal committee's such as the Central Almaguin Planning Board, the Sundridge Medical Center Committee, and the Central Almaguin Economic Development Association.
Note to context,
A) the Parry Sound-Muskoka District's that I serve is made up of mostly small villages nestled within vast undisturbed natural areas of predominantly rugged hardwood and mixed forests, and have been categorized as a jurisdiction in a population crisis and in economic disparity.   I am confident that these issues are synonymous to other Southern Region Districts such as Bancroft/Minden, Lanark/Mazinaw, Kawartha Lakes, the Ottawa Valley and numerous others (Kenora, Dryden, Fort Frances area), and and I would argue that these areas are suffering among the worst in Ontario from nearly 2 decades of the past governments reign of political tyranny on rural Ontario.
B)  Small rural villages, dispersed in nature and away from supply routes, do not attract large business like one horse towns or urban centers do.
C) These are not extremely economically diverse areas, nor are they ""one horse towns"".  Cottaging, recreation, retirement, forestry or farming (depending if the land is forests or fields) and the public sector are the main industries, and almost exclusively driven by small business.  That is relevant, because in the north in ""one horse towns"" lead by large corporations, they have one autonomous voice, compromises can be made and socio-economic crisis can be more easily managed.  In extremely economically diverse areas, as are a high proportion of large urban centers, one one sector fails creative-destruction occurs, and other sectors see a benefit from a failing sector.   In places such as the ours, where autonomy is all but stripped from municipalities by southern-urban influence, mostly by (often radically) left leaning professions (such as the legal, municipal planning profession, engineering, biology and to a lesser (but some) degree foresters ect. who originate, at least in education, from urban centers where universities exist), and whereas conflicting land uses strongly exist, communities are failing.
While recreation is important and does support local economies, its success is highly dependent on weather, and as we have seen steadily over the past few years fails constantly on account of varying degrees of:  bugs and rain in the early cottaging season; (last year with) fire during the mid-end cottaging season; the existence (or lack thereof) of snow during the snowmobile season; lack of large game tags during the hunting season, ect. ect. ect..  Regardless, even if the recreation industry boomed all the time, these jobs (gas stations, recreation tour guides, giftshop employee's) are seasonal at best and don't support housing, nor would they if housing was remotely affordable in the area.
Our retirement industry, again an important contributer to local economies, has limitations as well, and I am following this closely on certain committee's.  A lack of ability to develop retirement housing is one limiting factor, but not the only.  We have a difficult time attracting to the area health care providers from home care professions all the way up to doctors.  Partly, its that these are one spouse jobs, and there is no other well paying jobs in the area.  But also, in the absence of new home starts, if we had retirement housing developments this would free up single family units for working families.  Neither is happening fast enough.  Lastly, urban culture is who is retiring here excepting a small proportion of people who have moved away for their working lives and are returning to their home towns to retire.  Urban culture does not understand, nor do they make efforts to understand, rural industries.  They are blinded by the decimation of natural areas (such as the Carolinian forest) in the south, and have an unfounded fear that it could happen to our areas, what they don't realize is that north of Orillia they enter the Canadian Shield which is a vast and largely impossible-to-develop area in the swamps and on the rock of the Canadian Shield.
The cottagers, with the same urban culture views, want their playground and nothing else to happen there.  Again, the jobs associated with cottaging, with the exception of construction and building professionals, are low paying.  All jobs are seasonal and overlap and/or are similar to the recreation industry i.e. cottage maintenance, food service, grocery store, hardware store's, walmart ect..  Again, these jobs don't support housing.
Looking superficially at the public sector (and crown corporation) compensation packages - including municipalities, at first glance it would seem to suggest that these jobs are good for our particularly areas i.e. jobs that support families/housing, however, if these jobs are regulator type jobs, these areas end up with an abundance of people with nothing but time to regulate business.  This condition drives business away. The less business activity, the more time regulators have, the more time they have the more frivolously they can be with regulating.  They are good jobs, so subconsciously if not consciously, they tend to justify their jobs by interpreting regulations in a way that ensures they are needed.  Regulation, including species at risk, bodes well for these regulator type jobs as well as professions such as the Municipal Planning profession who have legislated through the Planning Act and in the PPS assurance that they will succeed.
The above industries, while affected slightly negative, or in the public sector's case positively, are much less affected by Species at Risk then farming, forestry and land development.  Legislation such as Species at Risk is often used for other ideological based purposes, such as gentrification.  And its happening.  Our towns and small villages are overwhelmed in the summer months, and practically ghost towns in the winter.  While it may somewhat work for retiree's, cottagers, and recreationalists who come to the area, and as well for certain for people working in the public sector, this does not bode well for local hard working Ontarian's or ultimately the Province.  The past provincial government created a welfare state in the North, then look up with disdain and call the North a cost center.
Especially forestry is failing, and in the small business portion of it.  The only real year-round well paying in-house jobs that could exist (in the absence of the few factories who could afford to be away from shipping routes) have been made into seasonal, mostly winter, jobs by species at risk.  Timing restrictions caused by load restrictions and cottaging seasons on forestry related activities are difficult enough for the industry, but exacerbated to the point of extremely damaging by Species at Risk.  Species at Risk is the 'straw that broke the camels back'.   Timing restrictions on road building, hauling, and harvesting have made it so difficult that the forest industry is at the point of giving up at all times of the year except winter.  In the spring, timing restrictions on cutting trees due to bird migration, bats, and nesting seasons lead into the summer with restrictions due to turtles leading into the fall when any stream remotely resembling somewhere speckle trout spawning could occur stymie the best attempts are managing forestry operations.
But the dynamic of how Species at Risk legislation goes much further then its direct affects on forestry.  Forestry currently has an exemption through the Crown Forest Sustainability Act, otherwise it would not exist, for other local economic activities such as land development the Species at Risk legislation does not manifest itself so relatively kindly.
While Municipal Planners are certainly not, quarries, farmers, and proponents of land development and the general public are paying the cost, and dearly in some instances.  Page 22,  the Provincial Policy Statement for Municipal Planning speaks to 2.1 Natural Heritage, and particularly 2.1.5 ""Development and site alteration shall not be permitted in e) significant wildlife habitat"".  Municipal planners are arbitrarily recommending, almost by default, Environmental Impact Studies (EIS) for nearly all land development applications i.e. consent for severances and sub-divisions, re-zoning.  They are interpreting the PPS to mean that it is not exclusive to known significant wildlife habitat or species at risk sightings, but that the PPS direction is to search all properties for significant wildlife habitat or species at risk thus requiring an EIS.  Blandings turtles nest under cottagers decks, snapping turtles on new gravel roads, peregrine falcons on sky-rise buildings, rare owls in barns ect. ect. ect.  So if species at risk and their habitat could occur anywhere including developed areas, every application must endure a a very costly and time consuming environmental impact study, and at a great risk.  A proponent must spend what could be a great deal of money to get an EIS that might be in many cases the demise of their proposed development.   This is keeping the price of land down, which intuitively seems like a good thing to attract people to the area, but the Building Code has made building un-affordable to working families*.   Even if the Building Code was made reasonable, without the ability to severe or subdivide, the price of land would skyrocket because demand would surpass available building lots.
Every economic development association in these regions have identified lack of jobs and lack of housing as primary causes of disparity in their communities.  You can't have housing without good jobs that will support the cost, you can't have jobs without affordable housing.  Species at Risk is impacting both.
In closing, the species at risk legislation is by and far the most corrosive legislation that exists in terms of the sustaining our local economies, development, and subsequently population in rural Southern Region areas.  An entire book could be written on the subject and how it pertains to Southern Region.  Farming also faces its challenges, as do quarries, but I do not have the experience in those sectors to comment.

23350,/comment/23350,"The Ontario Hawking Club was founded in 1984 and represents falconers in the province of Ontario. We have work closely with governments, primarily the Ontario MNRF, and others on matters of falconry policy and raptor conservation. We have participated in peregrine falcon recovery projects and have donated young birds to various peregrine falcon release projects for over 20 years.
We would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment on the review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act. We strongly support the need for effective legislation and adequate funding to protect and recover populations of species at risk, and we believe that Ontario should be a leader in these endeavors. Nevertheless, we believe that the legislation and Ontario’s approach to the management of species at risk could be improved in important ways.
Under the current legislation all species are treated the same regardless of their historical abundance or distribution in the province. This has resulted in the listing of wide-spread species, such as the Acadian flycatcher and prothonotary warbler, that historically occurred only very peripherally at best, in Ontario.
Furthermore, the legislation has resulted in the development of a large number of status reports and government response statements, but much less action on the ground. There are few meaningful efforts to recover most species.
After 10 years it is clear that listing a species is much easier than recovering or protecting it, and it should be equally clear that treating each species one by one will never be effective. Habitat loss is one of the most common reasons for species decline. Often this habitat is spread out over a wide area and often it is home to multiple at-risk and declining species. A landscape approach has the potential to be far more effective for protection and recovery.
In addition to the ESA, there are other pieces of legislation, such as the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (FWCA) that can have a very positive impact on biodiversity and species recovery. Some of the greatest recovery successes have been species, such as wild turkey and peregrine falcon, that had a long history of use by humans. In these cases, hunters, falconers and conservationists, motivated by their direct stake in the outcomes, contributed heavily to widespread and sustained efforts that resulted in success. A listing under the ESA is incapable, on its own, of generating these types of successes and in fact, can potentially stand in the way.
In summary, we would like to see ESA legislation that does a better job of prioritizing and directing efforts to have a more positive affect “on the ground”. It needs to combine efforts on a landscape basis where possible. It needs to focus on species that had a historically significant range or population in the province. It needs to incorporate innovative ways to mitigate negative impacts and reverse declines, including working with conservation partners and stakeholders, as well as agriculture and industry.

Area of Focus 1 - Landscape Approaches & Existing Tools/Processes - A landscape approach can be beneficial not only to a Species at Risk but also for the overall biodiversity and health of our natural heritage systems.  There are opportunities within the existing municipal land use planning process to improve integration of a landscape approach earlier into higher level studies.   Earlier integration would also help with the coordination of various agency approvals and streamline the overall process for proponents.

23355,/comment/23355,"I am writing on behalf of the Greenspace Alliance of Canada's Capital regarding the 10 year review of the Endangered Species Act.
First, we would like to signify our support for the submission made by Ontario Nature, available on their website (see link below).
We also support the submission made by the Ottawa Field Naturalists' Club (see pdf document attached).
From our own experience in working to preserve and protect greenspace in and around Ottawa, our main exposure to the ESA has been through the Overall Benefit Permit. In general, we have found these to be not at all beneficial for wildlife, and extremely destructive of habitat. We are not alone in coming to this conclusion. The Environmental Commissioner of Ontario dedicated a whole chapter of her 2017 report to this subject; “With each passing year, the extent of this failure becomes more clear — the ministry has reduced what should have been a robust system for protecting species at risk to what is largely a paper exercise,” her report says. “The MNRF is failing to not just protect species at risk as intended under the law, but also to lead effective recovery programs. In the best case, the MNRF has created a system that leaves itself with a minimal role to play; in the worse case, it has a created a system designed to fail.”
The Overall Benefit Permit allow proponents, in the actual wording of the permit, to ""kill, harm and harass"" a species at risk ""as well as damage and destroy the habitat of the species at risk for the purpose of the development"", in exchange for things like putting up fencing, building alternative nesting sites and contributing to research on the species at risk. The ""overall benefit"", if measured at all, is computed over the entire Province of Ontario. So a species can well be extirpated and its habitat destroyed in its native range on the theory that somehow the actions taken will improve the SAR population overall. This is pretty much a fiction and real habitat protection is required.
The presence of SAR should be a trigger to protect and expand natural habitats, not lead to its destruction. As we are facing a climate emergency, a climate lens should be applied to these applications instead,  with a goal of expanding wetlands and forests as carbon sinks to help stabilize the climate.
To achieve this aim, we would propose that the Overall Benefit Permit be renamed to reflect what what it really is, the SAR Habitat Destruction Permit, and to severely restrict their issuance, maybe even invoke a moratorium, while we try to deal with the climate crisis that is hard upon us.

I have observed a number of problems with the implementation of the Act.
The current regulations and laws appear to be focused on major developments and other process driven developments but have little effect on the vast majority of private lands and activities. This leaves the current regulatory regime ineffective at protecting listed species.
Due to the lack of research, I question if the current mitigation methods are working as few listed species populations have increased significantly in the past 10 years. New science-based mitigation or species introduction programs need to be implemented. By using the project HST and money spent on mitigation, a fund could be created for activities that would increase the population of listed species, not just regulation.
With few incentive or enforcement in the act, I believe the current law encourages private lands to do the wrong thing. If incentives were made available, many flora listed species could be planted on privates lands, increasing the population so the listed species would not be at risk anymore. A safe harbor regulation for private lands would be required for lands that listed species were reintroduced.
I thought the spirit of the act is to encourage the population growth of listed species but just to protect the existing listed species.
In the past 10 years, I have not seen any listed species population significantly increased, but I have seen many listed species added and overall population diminish.

There are portions of the endangered species act that are currently misguided and does not make logical sense.  It is way to restrictive to development, and if anyone says it isn’t, they don’t understand what is happening in the real world.
For example, I am in the process of trying to build a cottage on my own property in an area that is surrounded by cottages and was zoned as a building lot.  But now I am facing expensive multiple assessements on property that should be understood what species are in the area or not.  Under the current rules there is an assessment for snakes, and that it is to be assessed if there is a potential for a snake habitat.  The whole area is rock and moss, etc.  Does this mean that nothing can be built in the area and specifically on my building lot?  How did it get originally zoned as a building lot?  These rules should apply to new severances and not existing zoned areas for development.  It should make sense.
There is assessments needed for birds and yet I don’t want to cut down trees or the fact that there are acres of trees outside of my property that can host thousands of birds.  I am fine to build bat houses or anything like that to facilitate the growth of their population.
At the end of the day, whatever the rules are, they need to be logical, not just a blanket rule that makes no sense.  The current rules do not reflect what is going on in the real world.  I have heard of other developments that have stalled out because of the rules that are being enforced without flexibility to specific situations.
There is apparently also a fisheries assessment even though I am not touching the waters edge but will be within 30 meters of the shore.  I’m sorry but I can’t get my head around this logic.
If I sound a bit frustrated, it’s because I am.  I have been trying to get a building permit for a year and a half to just build a basic cottage on a cottage lot near a river.
Thanks for your consideration.

23360,/comment/23360,"Creating Suburban Sanctuaries
Scientists have sounded the alarms that we:
Have 12 years to avert  climate change catastrophe
Are currently experiencing the sixth mass extinction
And are in the midst of an insect apocalypse
As a parent, this strikes fear in my heart for the world we are leaving
our children and future generations.
If they are to have any chance of a safe and healthy future, it is
imperative that we overcome our environmental myopia and act now. We
must drastically reduce our emissions and sequester all the carbon we
can in ecosystems. The most effective carbon storage occurs in
ecosystems that are healthy and biodiverse. Every native species has
evolved with a variety of interconnected relationships and functions and
they are all needed for the system to work as a whole.
A number of years ago, the British Beekeepers Association published a
statistic which indicated that; if they were to lose the bees, nearly
50% of the population would be required to hand pollinate. Consider the
cost of food if this were to occur and the large number of people who
would not be able to afford to feed their families.
Add to this that approximately 90% of the plants in the wild require
pollinators.  Without pollination services, and insects in the food
chain, whole ecosystems will face collapse.
So, what needs to happen?
Our house is situated in a residential neighbourhood, filled with lawns
and non-native garden plants. On just over a 1/4 acre, we have
transformed it into a suburban sanctuary. We removed the front lawn and
replaced it it with a wildlife garden, organically grown and filled with
numerous native plants and ones which host butterflies. This cost next
to nothing as, other than adding pickup truck loads of organic compost,
the garden was primarily created through the addition of plants I had in
other gardens and sowing seeds I collected. In our organic wildlife
garden we have now documented 26 bird species, 35 butterfly species and
11 bumblebee species, some of which are rarely seen in the province of
Ontario. In addition to this, are the usual collection of urban
wildlife, rabbits, ground hogs, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons and
skunks, which all play their part in providing balance. For people who
do not garden with nature, it sounds like it would be a lot of work, but
it could not be further from the truth. Because I shun chemicals, my
plants are healthy and disease free. The natives crowd out the weeds. I
know when pest species, such as aphids or Japanese beetles arrive, as I
will see the birds, spiders and lady bugs move in and they take care of
my pests’ control for me.
In an effort to increase wildlife habitat, I garden with and educate the
children at some local schools, give away hundreds of seedlings and
seeds yearly and advocate for others to do the same. All over the
province, recognizing the dire threat of pollinator loss, there are
people doing the same. From the Mayor's Monarch Pledge to Bee Cities,
there are innumerable resources and people engaging, willing and able to
provide guidance, assistance and resources.
If you do not believe that people are ready to transform our ecosystems,
you have only to follow the Monarch butterfly migration movement.
Millions of people, across North America, have joined together to ensure
the 4 generations have the host plants, food and habitat needed to
complete their journey north and back to Mexico in the fall.  It is a
movement that gives me hope for the future.
The last two summers, we had a male Monarch that chose our garden as his
territory. From morning until evening he was there; nectaring, resting
or soaring around the garden while he waited for females to visit the
milkweed.  Being able to step outside your front door into a world of
butterflies, bees and birds is a wonder I wish every person on earth
could experience. The neighborhood children have free rein in our garden
and I will often look out the window and see them upside down looking
for caterpillar eggs or sitting on the bench observing the wildlife
activity.
Even with all the habitat we have created, I have still noted declines.
When the bee balm was in bloom, a mere 4 years ago, standing near it
was like being in the middle of a bumblebee super highway. The plants
were covered with a multitude of bees. The past three years, when the
bee balm is in bloom, I generally see 0-3 bumblebees on it at any one
time. Of the 11 bumblebee species I have recorded, there are a number
I have not seen in between 2 and 4 years. I have also not seen lace wings,
nor fire flies in a number of years and the only lady bugs I find are the
non-natives from Asia.
The average home owners generally only walk on their front lawn to mow,
seed, water and weed. Front lawns are wasted, high maintenance spaces
which could be transformed into thriving gardens which feed both people
and wildlife, akin to the victory gardens during the war.
We cannot talk about creating and improving habitat without discussing
the impacts of invasive plants displacing natives. Many plants such as
burning bush, Japanese barberry, miscanthus, periwinkle and goutweed are
not only still prominently used in both private and public gardens, they
are still being sold in garden centres. Public education and restriction
on the sale of invasive species is sorely needed.
We need to seriously address our pesticide use, which is impacting the
health of all species, including those upon which we rely to pollinate
our food crops. Chemical free soil has been demonstrated to store more
carbon, there are more species observed on organic farms and gardens,
and there are a multitude of studies linking pesticide use with a host
of human medical conditions including autism, cancer and Alzheimer’s.
Summarily, as you consider approving ecosystem destruction to facilitate
business enterprises, I would ask you to reflect upon our children. If
you have ever seen their joyous looks of wonder when engaged with
nature; be it planting flowers for pollinators and searching for
caterpillar eggs, or observed those bright, shining, earnest little
faces as they plant trees or clean up shorelines, convinced they are
saving the planet, you would know in your heart that we must make their
beliefs a reality.

23364,/comment/23364,"The protection of species at risk is important to me.  the change in species listing from threatened to endangered,  or special concern to threatened, indicates that for many SAR, even the current habitat protection under the Act is not working, in many cases because of habitat loss.  I do not want to see the Act weakened further so that development rights cause further threats to SAR.
Any landscape approach must recognise that the GTA supports some of the highest biodiversity in the province - the diversity of fauna and flora becomes greater as you go further south.  Provincial parks and national parks are rare in this part of the province so protection of biodiversity is accomplished in large part through policies and legislation that protect specific habitat.  The ESA plays one of the most important roles in protecting habitat for SAR, as habitat for SAR also provides habitat for other species.  Protection of habitat for species in the GTA is a critical part of conserving biodiversity in this province.
The listing of SAR at the time when the evaluation is completed by COSSARO increases certainty that the species will be protected.  I would not want to see the delays between evaluation and listing that are typical of the federal listing process, and I would be afraid that this would result from increased time allowed following the evaluation.

23367,/comment/23367,"Hello,
I implore the Ontario Government not to weaken the Endangered Species Act (the Act) by making revisions to it. Species-at-risk are at risk in large part due to habitat loss and the Act needs to improve habitat protection, not weaken it to development.
The Government should instead focus on how to better protect the species-at-risk by improving how the Act is implemented and enforced. More focus should be on protecting these species-at-risk and their habitat and ensuring their recovery. If any changes were to be made to the Act, I would only request that the exemptions for major industry groups like forestry, mining and agriculture be removed.
My other comments as they relate to the 10th Year Review Discussion Paper are as follows:
This discussion paper does not provide much information in the review process that's transpired over the past 10 years nor does it provide context or evidence as to why and where the 'Challenges' have derived from.
Area of Focus 1:
The landscape approach is not explained well.
Habitat of species-at-risk can be interconnected and a landscape approach with broad-species focus would be helpful for habitat and species. These tools are already included in the Act, but should not replace a species-specific focus.
Area of Focus 2:
There should NOT BE a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections. Listing a species at risk or their habitat should be based on sound research, scientific evidence and as informed by COSSARO's review. A species/habitat, if deemed 'at risk', should always be listed and the listing should have nothing to do any other outside influence. This Act is FOR species-at-risk, if anything, improving the communication with affected stakeholders that may be impacted would be beneficial.
Allowing Ontario Scientist to sit on COSSARO is encouraged.
Area of Focus 3:
The Act is for the protection and recovery of species-at-risk. If a species is listed, already they are in peril and there should be no extension to the timelines. Changes to the legislation timeline will not improve the Government Response Statement challenges.
The Government Response Statement and the development of the recovery strategies should better be coordinated and recovery strategies should be created for multiple species that share similar geographic areas or which face similar threats. Again, coordinated efforts in how the current Act is implemented would be more beneficial than changing the Act itself.
Habitat regulations should not be changed.
Area of Focus 4:
The Act should only focus on the protection and recovery of species-at-risk and their habitat.
There should not be conservation banking or paying into a conservation fund or anything to that affect. These species and their habitats are at-risk likely because their habitat is already compromised. Habitat needs to be protected and allowing activities to be conducted where there's critical habitat in lieu of a payment is backwards and is unacceptable. Instead, there should be the focus on habitat protection for species-at-risk which in turn would also benefit the rest of the ecosystem.
As a species declines, the more an effective strategy is require and the more this may cost. It would be beneficial to ensure appropriate protection at the onset of a species being listed. There should be no delays.
Early identification of the needs of the species that may be impacted during the planning phases of development should be discussed with the stakeholders and expectations of how best to protect them and their habitat should be communicated and understood.
If changes are to be made to the Act, removing the regulatory exemptions for activities that can have the  most negative affects on species-at-risk should be considered.  As well, how the Act is implemented and communicated could improve species and economic outcomes, but the protection and recovery of species and their habitat should not, in any way, be sacrificed for economic benefit.

23369,/comment/23369,"Dear Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks:  Rod Phillips
We, the members of Quinte Field Naturalists, are deeply concerned about the Discussion Paper reviewing the Endangered Species Act (ERO #013-4143).  Preservation of species and natural habitats is vital to maintaining biodiversity, which in turn is essential for the maintenance of the stability of ecosystems.  All living creatures deserve to be protected, both for their own sakes and for the roles they play in ecosystems.  Weakening of ecosystems by neglecting to protect the species in them will be seen by future generations as a failure on our part.  Failure to protect species at risk means failure to protect critical habitat, which in turn means that species that are more common now may become at risk.  It is a downward slide.  Listing of species at risk is based on good science.  Many of our young people are learning this science in increasingly popular courses in environmental science and conservation biology, in our colleges and universities.  They are full of enthusiasm for a bright future with healthy, functioning ecosystems, clean air to breathe and clean water to drink.  They are basing their careers on this positive outlook.  Let’s not disappoint and discourage them.
The Endangered Species Act, 2007 was seen as gold standard by jurisdictions around the world but subsequently was weakened.  We ask the Government not to weaken the Act further, but to strengthen and maintain it.  We urge the Government to repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development industries and to amend section 57(1)1 of the Endangered Species Act, so that any future exemptions cannot jeopardize the recovery of endangered and threatened species.  We plead with the Government to maintain mandatory habitat protection for endangered and threatened species and to continue COSSARO’s current species listing process.  This process is based on good science and is strongly informed and imbued by community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge {ESA section 5(3)}.  Furthermore, we urge the Government to require compensation that results in a direct overall benefit to affected species, where harmful activities have been permitted.
A strong Endangered Species Act is essential to the preservation of biodiversity, and maintaining all of the links in the web of life, is critical to the continuance of a healthy, prosperous future on this planet.  Please demonstrate your care and concern for people living in Ontario now and for generations to come by making strong commitments to the ecosystems that support life.  Ontario needs a gold standard Endangered Species Act.

23371,/comment/23371,"1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23372,/comment/23372,"Hello,
I deal with the ESA daily in the consulting sector in southwestern Ontario, including field research to determine presence/absence of species protected under the ESA through to the crafting of Overall Benefit Permits and their implementation.  I have the following comments.
Landscape Approaches
I think that landscape scale approach would likely be beneficial to improving outcomes for protected species in the long-term, as habitat fragmentation is an issue for many species, especially in my area of focus.  Many of my own Overall Benefit projects have been spatially scattered with no cohesiveness or adherence to a long-term natural heritage strategy.  I would like to see municipalities or counties have some type of Natural Heritage/Endangered Species habitat framework or larger plan that Overall Benefit actions could participate in.  Some NGOs are developing these plans, but they require municipal support to move forward successfully.  This strategy would also be useful for consultants to “tap into” to provide proponents with options for Overall Benefit, rather than have the proponents responsible for locating and securing appropriate lands.
Listing Process and Protections
I have no concerns currently with the listing or assessment process.  I do not support longer transition periods for the implementation of species protections.  I think the Ontario.ca web pages should include a bit more information in the “What threatens it” section of the page and a link to the COSSARO assessment might also be helpful.  I could not locate the COSSARO assessment for Eastern Foxsnake when I recently searched for it.  For many of the species that we know little about or are still relatively common (Eastern Hognosed Snake and Barn Swallow), I often face resistance from clients and supervisors when considering these species.  Providing concrete numbers related to population declines and amount of habitat lost would be helpful for the public relations side of the ESA.  If the government doesn’t have these numbers, then they should work to obtain them.  Suspicion of the motives of the ESA in light of the previous government is high in certain populations and I feel that easily obtained, concrete facts may help ease some of that concern.
Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
I am generally unsupportive of extended timelines for response statements.  However, if nine months is insufficient to draft a quality response statement, then the government should, as it nears the nine-month mark, post the amount of extension required through the EBR, the reason for extension, and carry the process forward.
I am generally supportive of the habitat regulation process over the general habitat protection process, as the former seems to be more protective than the latter.  However, the regulated habitat process can get difficult to navigate when small areas of likely marginal habitat are impacted.  This is exacerbated when there is limited knowledge of the species and how it may use these small areas of habitat.  For example, if connectivity is the issue and loss of a hedgerow is the impact, then there should be a process whereby as long as the habitat function is maintained (connectivity), the feature can be replicated in the local area to ensure the function remains.  If this can be accomplished outside of a permit, then this would increase efficiencies.  However, this cannot be done without an increase in enforcement to ensure these activities ACTUALLY OCCUR.
Authorization Process
In lieu activities is an option worth considering, however, it should be very carefully considered on a case-by-case basis.  My experience is that the development community aggressively resists the ESA and is suspicious of its motives.  As such, the process cannot become viewed as a “money grab” or similar activity, so in lieu activities must be extremely transparent and justifiable.  As the Overall Benefit process focuses on habitat compensation, this process would require a larger-scale natural heritage strategy for protected species on a regional basis to guide it.  This strategy would include highlighting areas of known or potential high densities of species at risk and work to secure these lands, and lands that would connect these areas together.  Additional in lieu activities could support captive breeding programs, habitat improvement programs, large-scale population monitoring of species, etc.  I would like to see the Ontario government, either through the ESA or other processes, support research on species habitat use and populations to triage Overall Benefit processes.  In some cases, OB is a “best guess” on what will be beneficial for a species when impacts are difficult to calculate.
I do not support existing or additional exemptions under the ESA.  Simplification to the process would be beneficial, but simplification may reduce effectiveness of compensation.  Perhaps a formulaic approach could be considered (area x # of individuals x other ecological parameters = compensation required) similar to the Wetland Evaluation System.
Enforcement
The enforcement of the ESA has, in my experience, been exceedingly poor, both for contraventions and monitoring of Overall Benefit permit outcomes.  I am aware of both private landowners and municipalities whose contraventions of the ESA have gone unprosecuted, even when reported to the District either through formal permitting paperwork or a direct complaint.  I am also aware of anecdotal information that some municipalities/counties generally ignore or are ignorant of the ESA and advise landowners to contravene the Act, though not framed as such.  I have also experienced charges under the ESA being dropped if the defendant is able to complete an Overall Benefit permit prior to the court proceedings being completed.
Furthermore, of the few convictions I know of, specifically related to reptiles and amphibians, the fines are not sufficient to compensate for the impacts.  In my opinion, these low fines act more as permission slips, rather than deterrents.  And the overarching lack of enforcement supports the proliferation of this type of behaviour.  Landowners talk, and as soon as one is able to beat the system they all follow suit.   In order for the ESA to be effective, those that contravene it must be held accountable, and the punishment for a successful conviction must be significant enough to deter others.  On the ground, we require more Conservation Officers with expertise on the ESA and municipal planning to keep the ESA effective.  The Overall Benefit permit process is only as good as its enforcement, which is currently almost nil.  I completed the implementation of the second permit issued in the province, and not only were the prescribed works not carried out fully, but there was no requirement to complete additional works to make up for that which was not completed, and, as far as I am aware, the final annual report for the permit was never submitted.  Multiple other permits I have crafted have never been fulfilled with no enforcement from MNRF that I am aware of.  Finally, I also feel that withholding locations of species at risk or impacts to habitat in a professional context (eg. as a consultant, forester, drainage superintendent, etc.) should be a contravention of the act and punishable.
Municipal Planning
With regard to the implementation of the ESA, municipalities are left to their own devices, with no provincial support for this provincial legislation.  It has been my experience that many municipalities are either uninformed, mis-informed or ignorant of the ESA.  In some locales, essentially all unmaintained lands in the municipality are habitat for species protected under the ESA, which has significant economic implications.  With no provincial support or regional framework to look to, municipalities are left on their own to deal with these issues.  This results in an incentive for municipalities to dismiss the ESA, and makes it difficult for developers to move forward with projects, since there are few lands suitable for Overall Benefit that are not already suitable habitat or are available for purchase.  Municipalities require provincial assistance to implement the ESA, through training and education regarding the act and the implications, as well as funding to support the establishment of a municipal or regional natural heritage/endangered species habitat strategy.  This strategy would highlight areas of known or potential high densities of species at risk and work to secure lands that would connect these areas together.  This would not only support Endangered Species initiatives, but could also support larger conservation efforts.  This framework would also allow potential developers to build onto or improve habitat through Overall Benefit actions.  It could make the process more streamlined and predictable for developers, which is a major issue at this time.  Proponents can’t budget financially or temporally for the ESA, which impacts their planning process.
Additional Thoughts
I think the province needs to support regional and local governments in the implementation of this legislation.  I often face resistance from local government when it comes to habitat for protected species, mainly regarding lands set aside for Overall Benefit.  Many Overall Benefit permits hinge on creating habitat that is intended to persist in the long-term, but municipalities and conservation authorities do not seem to want the responsibility of the ownership and maintenance of this habitat.  I suspect this is mainly due to the associated costs and liability.  These habitats, especially prairies/meadows, require some form of long-term management to maintain the habitat and ensure it is not being encroached upon or otherwise impacted.  Perhaps downloading these lands and their care to NGOs/stewardship groups is the way to go, and the province supports them in kind, possibly through the ESA?  Or the province could support staffing to help municipalities care for these lands?
Additionally, the creation or protection of habitat as part of Overall Benefit actions can be rather random, based on what lands might be available for purchase or can be retained within an area of proposed impacts, rather than strategic to support a larger conservation goal.  I would like to see some type of long-term, regional habitat plan that aims to connect existing populations and habitats of protected species and highlights important areas for conservation if they are not yet protected, and it should be incorporated into municipal planning documents so that it is readily available.  Then at least those of us dealing with the permit side can preferentially direct efforts to these areas, possibly encourage owners of key lands to release the lands, etc.  I know that municipalities often have Natural Heritage strategies that include corridors, but they don't seem to hold a lot of weight in the planning process.  There are NGOs working on landscape-scale initiatives, but I don't know if, or how well, their projects are connected with local governments.  If they aren't, couldn't they be, possibly using the ESA as the mechanism?
Summary
I feel that the ESA can be an effective piece of legislation that can continue to assist protected species and be made more efficient.  The registration process for some species is an example of this efficiency, however, without enforcement it is nothing more than a “greenwash.”  There are certain species which are not well understood, which makes protecting them and their habitat difficult and ineffective.  More research into these species is required to create better Overall Benefit permits and to triage the potential effects of development proposals.  Additionally, we require better/more support for monitoring existing populations and conducting initial site assessments.  Many of our protected species are cryptic/difficult to survey for, which discourages investment in surveys by proponents to invest in surveys.  Combined, this results in false negatives for species presence or sites that are simply unsurveyed, which in turn makes it difficult to determine what effective overall benefit actions should be.  Including NGOs in the development of landscape-scale strategies and monitoring would be beneficial, but it must go hand-in-hand with municipal support.  Finally, enforcement MUST BE INCREASED to make this legislation viable.  It is unfair for landowners that follow the rules to go through the expense of the Overall Benefit process, while their neighbours impact the same habitat and species and simply pay a small fine, or are not reprimanded at all.
Thanks for your time and consideration.

23376,/comment/23376,"Question: In what circumstances would a more strategic approach support a proposed activity while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk? (e.g., by using a landscape approach instead of a case-by-case approach, which tends to be species and/or site-specific.)
- Species-specific policies and landscape approaches should not necessarily be regarded as an “either or” situation. These could be considered together as an integrated approach, which may be especially useful for migratory species or those with a large individual range.
Question: What changes would improve the notification process of a new species being listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List? (e.g.,longer timelines before a species is listed.)
- A lengthy public notice about new listings of Species at Risk can produce problems of its own. When announced well in advance, these notices can instigate a “last minute opportunity” mentality for unscrupulous hunters, fishermen, developers or others who may not respect environmental ethics. In this regard, longer timelines for advanced notice are not a feasible solution.
Question: Should there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections? (e.g., longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat.)
- The option of allowing ministerial discretion to “to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat” would inevitably leave the Ministry at odds with its own SARPAC and risk compromising its own mandate to protect Species at Risk. The Ministry would further risk the public perception of pandering to private interests.
Question: In what circumstances would a different approach to automatic species and habitat protections be appropriate? (e.g., there is significant intersection between a species or its habitat and human activities, complexity in addressing species threats, or where a species’ habitat is not limiting.)
- There are no ethically sound alternatives to automatic species and habitat protection.
Question: How can the process regarding assessment and classification of a species by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario be improved? (e.g., request an additional review and assessment in cases where there is emerging science or conflicting information.)
- Anyone with basic knowledge of habitat and Species at Risk would likely regard this question as manipulative and self-serving, designed to pander to private interests. Situations of “emerging science or conflicting information” are something that are best left to the professional discernment and shared consensus of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario.  In terms of accountability, having the names of those serving on this committee and their meeting minutes available to the public upon request could address this matter. Otherwise, additional reviews and assessments would not be recommended, since they would only serve as a delay tactic for those with opposing views, thereby denying timely protection to key species.
Question: In some cases, the time limit of nine months to develop the Government Response Statement for an endangered or threatened species is too short, and there is no option under the Act to extend this timeline when needed. In what circumstances would a species and/or Ontarians benefit from additional time for the development of the Government Response Statement?
- Requests for additional time to develop the Government Response Statement could be accommodated in the Act, but only with respect to the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) or the Species at Risk Program Advisory Committee (SARPAC). Requests for extensions from any other committee or government body would be regarded as self-serving, foot-dragging or pandering to private interests.
Question: In many cases, conducting a review of progress towards the protection and recovery of a species within five years of the Government Response Statement is too soon. In what circumstances would a longer timeline improve the merit and relevance of conducting a review of progress towards protection and recovery?
- Much like my response to the previous question, requests to conduct a review of progress beyond the standard 5 year period could conceivably be afforded a two year extension (essentially 7 years in total), but only at the request of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) or the Species at Risk Program Advisory Committee (SARPAC).
Question: The development of a habitat regulation is not needed for each species that is endangered and threatened since general habitat protection applies and can be clarified through the use of general habitat descriptions. In what circumstances is the development of a habitat regulation warranted, or not warranted?
- This appears to be another question skewed in favour of private interests. If this statement were actually true and general habitat protection for a species could indeed be clarified through the use of general habitat descriptions, then how did that species become at Risk in the first place? Regardless of whatever habitat regulations that are or are not developed for a species at risk, they should be developed by the Species at Risk Program Advisory Committee (SARPAC).
Question: What changes to authorization requirements would better enable economic development while providing positive outcomes and protections for species at risk? (e.g., simplify the requirements for a permit under s. 17(2)d, and exemptions set out by regulation.)
There are no changes to authorization requirements would better enable economic development while providing positive outcomes and protections for species at risk. Stop this nonsense of framing a narrative that inevitably serves private interests at the expense of our Species at Risk. If investment is important, then invest in your own government and stop the budget cuts to the ministries that regulate and enforce these laws.

1. Landscape Approaches
I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23387,/comment/23387,"Hello,
This feedback pertains to the Ontario Government’s review of its Endangered Species Act.
This review process is of concern as there seem to be two conflicting reasons for undertaking this review.  First main reason stated is that the legislation is ineffective at protecting endangered species.  This is a valid reason for conducting a review - if provincial biologists are documenting poor recovery of species with the tools available to them.
The second main reason the government has put forth to justify this review is that the act is slowing or somehow preventing economic development.  To say that the two are not correlated would be untrue.  A healthy environment means residents of this province are healthier and can better contribute to our economy.  Our economy is thus inextricably linked to our natural environment.  Loosening regulation would thus impact the economy so this reasoning for a review seems quite flawed.  In addition, it seems that our economy is performing quite well based on the Ontario Ministry of Finance’s website....
I urge the government to not water down this Act, but to strengthen it if the data shows that endangered species are not being adequately protected.  All of us in the province will be better off in the long run with a healthier environment!
Thank You.

23393,/comment/23393,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the discussion paper about the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The following comments represent the official submission of the Canadian Herpetological Society, a community of amphibian and reptile biologists, and conservation professionals.
Many species are declining across the world and in Canada; species in Ontario are not immune to these declines. There are now more than 200 species at risk (SAR) in Ontario. The main purpose of the ESA is to protect species, not to expedite development. Any changes to the ESA must be made with great care, as without diligent conservation of our SAR there is a significant risk of further loss of populations and their key habitats. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extinct (extirpated) from Ontario. Multiple SAR, such as Eastern Fox Snake and Wood Turtle, have a large portion of their global range in Ontario. Therefore Ontario has the disproportionate responsibility for the conservation of these species and their habitats.
Area of Focus 1 – Landscape Approaches
	Recovery activities focusing on specific landscapes or ecosystems can be beneficial for many species. Activities, for example, which aim to reduce forest fragmentation, and increase forest connectivity and the amount of core forest area in the Carolinian Zone would benefit many species. However, many recovery activities must be focused on individual species given the threats facing certain species (e.g. Butternut canker). There should be a mix of ecosystem and species-specific recovery actions. At the same time, an ecosystem focus on SAR recovery should not be used as a justification to “support a proposed activity” (p. 3). Too often development proposals argue that a species is widespread in an area and therefore the loss of one habitat patch will be inconsequential to the species’ long term survival. This kind of thinking is ecologically unsound and furthers the notion that populations can persist in small isolated patches of habitat, when really long term survival requires many connected populations across a landscape. Changes to the ESA should not make it easier to destroy habitat for SAR. Development proposals should be reviewed on a site specific basis. Determining what is an appropriate overall benefit should be based on the magnitude of the effect of each project.
Area of Focus 2 – Listing Process
	Currently the COSSARO review process is slow. Timelines before new listings of a SAR should not be made longer. If the government wishes to provide more advanced notice about potential additions to the list of SAR, then the species to be reviewed by COSSARO should be made public as early as possible. This would let the public know which species may be listed after the review process.
	We strongly disagree with any change to the automatic listing of SAR after review by COSSARO. The decision regarding whether a species is at risk is not a political decision, but a science-based decision and this should not change. Removing the automatic listing of new species at risk would undermine the ESA and weaken the protection for declining species. Similarly, we strongly oppose any change to the automatic protection of habitat for newly-listed Threatened and Endangered species. Without habitat protection, there can be no true protection for SAR.
We do not believe that the COSSARO review and assessment process should be changed in such a way that would further delay species evaluations, listings, and protective action. If anything, the review process should be sped up. Most species assessed by COSSARO have already been assessed by the federal government through the COSEWIC assessment process. No actions should be taken to prolong the already lengthy COSSARO assessment process. New information is always becoming available but this should not prevent making decisions based on the knowledge that is currently available.
Area of Focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies
	Modest delays in the production of Government Response Statements (GRS) are not a significant cause for concern. This, however, is not the central issue, given that the government of Ontario has frequently been late in preparing Recovery Strategies or GRS documents. According to a recent analysis, fewer than half of the GRS documents for birds and mammals, and fewer than 60% of the GRS documents for plants, have been prepared on time (Ontario Nature 2019). A GRS is not prepared until a Recovery Strategy has been published, and many species still lack a Recovery Strategy several years after listing. The ESA specifies that a Recovery Strategy should be produced within 1 year of listing for Endangered species and 2 years for Threatened species. The Spotted Turtle was already assessed when the current ESA took effect in 2008 and yet there is still no provincial Recovery Strategy for this species, more than 10 years later. Such inaction is entirely unacceptable. Rather than trying to delay the release of GRS documents, we strongly encourage the government to publishing Recovery Strategies and other recovery documents in a timely manner.
	Conducting a 5-year assessment of progress on recovery of SAR is a vital part of the recovery process and should not be changed. Recovery for many, and perhaps most, species will take decades, but that does not mean that a 5 year review is not worthwhile. Each 5 year review provides valuable information on the status of recovery. Without the 5 year review, it would not be apparent if species are continuing to decline despite recovery actions, and given development pressures across much of southern Ontario, a 5 year review provides ongoing “snapshots” of the current status of each species.
	Habitat regulation may not be required for all Threatened and Endangered species, but this should be addressed on a case by case basis. General habitat descriptions are adequate for identifying the core areas used by SAR but only regulated habitat “may include areas currently unoccupied by the species, such as areas where the species formerly occurred or areas where there is the potential for the species to become re-established” (Government of Ontario 2012). Hence, at a minimum, regulated habitat is required for those species that need to expand their current range to become down-listed. Habitat regulation should also be mandated for those species with limited current distributions in the province to ensure that the current habitat, and adjacent potential habitat, is protected. Species with few populations left in Ontario are the most vulnerable to any future habitat loss or the negative effects of development pressure. We also recommend that habitat regulation be mandated for all species found in the Carolinian Zone given the lack of natural habitat left in this area.
Area of Focus 4 – Authorization Processes
	A variety of permits currently exist under the ESA. The most common permit is the C permit, or Overall Benefit Permit, and obtaining one can be a time consuming process. We encourage the government to develop standard overall benefit actions to compensate for specific activities for particular SAR. These compensatory actions should provide tangible benefits to the species in question and clearly provide an overall benefit to the species on the ground, not just funding for research. Furthermore, it is not enough to simply stipulate compensatory actions in a permit and leave this responsibility in the hands of the proponent. Rather, a monitoring regulatory framework is necessary to ensure that permit stipulations (i.e., an “overall benefit”) are properly undertaken. It is necessary that the responsible ministry (Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks) follow-up with the proponent to ensure that satisfactory “benefit” has been achieved, as outlined in the proponent’s permit. For long-lived species, such as trees and turtles, monitoring commitment by the proponent needs to truly reflect long-term assessment. Finally, it is encouraged that monitoring/overall benefit reports be made publically available (an exception being for location-sensitive species/populations) so that evaluations of “benefit” can be tracked and critically evaluated. To date, there has been no transparency about how overall benefits are being undertaken or have been achieved despite a sizable number of Overall Benefit Permits being granted across Ontario. This had led many to question the effectiveness of Overall Benefit Permits.
	We strongly oppose changes to obtaining a D permit, or Significant Social or Economic Benefit Permit. D permits were never intended to be a common tool to allow development to over-ride SAR. D permits should only be considered in rare cases where there is overwhelming social benefit. They should not be granted for draining a wetland to build a parking lot for a strip mall. Even in the cases when a D permit is granted, the mitigation efforts expended on SAR should also be significant, such as the example of the Herb Gray Parkway in Windsor which has created habitat for SAR and improved connectivity of habitat patches. Obtaining a D permit must never become a rubber-stamp process under any circumstances.
Other issues
	Forestry under Ontario’s Crown Forest Sustainability Act should not be exempt from the ESA. The ESA should be fully enforced on Crown Land with regards to any destructive or commercial activity. Crown Land should protect habitat for species while also permitting public access to these natural areas.
In indigenous communities throughout Ontario, animals and plants have various cultural and spiritual values. The ESA recognizes these beliefs and works with First Nations communities in order to protect these species and the habitats they live in. The strength of the current ESA allows for this and any changes to lessen the protection of SAR would negatively affect the species themselves and the First Nations communities that rely heavily on them for medicines and food sources and their cultural and spiritual values.
In addition, the habitats SAR occupy provide economic benefits to the province of Ontario. As an example, wetlands prevent major flooding, filter water and indirectly provide food sources because species such as bear, waterfowl and moose rely on wetlands as food and water sources (EPA 2006).
	Other changes to the ESA should also be made to truly strengthen the protection of SAR in Ontario:
1)	It is time to repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries. These exemptions allow the widespread destruction of SAR habitat.
2)	Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of Endangered and Threatened species.
3) 	Proper enforcement of the ESA must also occur. Too often there is no government monitoring of development projects, which can lead to violations of ESA permit conditions, and especially a lack of follow-through on required overall benefit activities. Even when charges are laid under the ESA, the penalties have often been lax. Fines simply become the price for doing business, rather than a deterrent.
	Based on our experience with many SAR across many areas of Ontario, it is clear that the ESA does not currently provide adequate protection for the habitat of these species. Key habitats for SAR get developed with only a token effort at a meaningful “overall benefit.” If the ESA is going to be changed, then habitat protection for Threatened and Endangered species should be strengthened, not weakened.
	Protection for SAR also requires stable, long-term funding. We strongly encourage the government to continue to fund the Species at Risk Stewardship Fund, and the Species at Risk Research Fund. Both of these funding programs leveraged a significant amount of funding from the private sector, providing valuable extra funding for protecting SAR, and making the investment from the provincial government very cost effective. Cutting these funding programs would greatly harm the recovery of SAR.
	In summary, we strongly support the current ESA. It is a powerful piece of legislation that can protect Ontario’s rarest species, and the province should be proud of this gold standard of SAR protection. We strongly disagree with any proposed changes to the ESA that would weaken protection for SAR and their habitat, delay the production of Recovery Strategies or Government Response Statements, or reduce the obligation of developers to genuinely provide an overall benefit to SAR in their permits. We implore the government to continue to uphold the core values of the ESA and ensure the continued protection of Ontario’s many SAR that play vital roles in the province’s ecosystems.

Working under the section 55 (1)(b) regulation, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) must develop workable species at risk policy delivered under the CFSA that contributes to working landscapes and functioning ecosystems while incorporating socio-economic impact analysis, jointly, with practitioners, affected stakeholders, and Indigenous communities.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
3. Overhaul the membership of COSSARO to reflect more generalist professionals and Indigenous communities rather than academics with expertise in a very limited field of study. Known experts in a particular species, including local MNRF biologists and local RPFs should be invited to participate in the deliberation of species being evaluated by COSSARO at least 12 months before the committee meets to evaluate the species’ status.
4. Develop a clear process for using the “data deficient” category, particularly for species with a wide distribution and lack of data.
5. COSSARO should consider the use of regional sub-populations to account for differences in status across the province, risk to the species and the relative risk of human activities. Populations of species at the normal edge of their ranges in Ontario, outside of their core range, should be evaluated with due consideration of their global population.
6. Add an additional layer of accountability by having the responsible minister weigh scientific evidence provided by COSSARO with the socio-economic impacts before a species is automatically listed and protected.
7. Reassessment of species at risk should be considered when credible evidence has been presented to the responsible ministry beyond what is currently permitted within the ESA.
8. Enable individuals and organizations to report on SAR sightings without the perceived or real fear of being penalized for doing so.
Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
9. The current 5-year review should go beyond simply listing actions that have taken place. A biological review of the species should be included and feedback into the COSSARO listing process.
10. Habitat renewal should not be considered habitat destruction.
Area of Focus 4: Authorization Processes
11. Remove the July 1st, 2020 expiry found in O. Reg. 242/08 (22.1) to forest operations on Crown land giving the sector and government greater certainty.
12. Replace the term “overall benefit” within sections 17(2)(c), 18(1)(e)(iii)(A), and 18(2)(f)(iii)(A) with “positive outcomes” to species at risk.
13. Equivalency through section 55, not harmonization through section 18 is required for future success and is well supported by legal precedent.

Time is what allows for a smooth flow of operation, making sure all ""t"" 's are crossed, and ""i"" 's are dotted.

This process was a devastating failure of the Ontario Government to respond to science and community knowledge of species at risk. Despite the importance of this piece of legislation, there certainly are some important issues to revise in the 10th Year Review of Ontario's Endangered Species Act. Specifically, it is in the best interest of Ontario citizens and environment to revisit the ability of development approval to override the protection of species at risk. Indeed, this report by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario reveals: ""The MNRF has never denied a permit to harm a threatened or endangered species. And, the permit-by-rule system only requires proponents to minimize (not eliminate or compensate for) harm to affected species at risk; the MNRF also turns a blind eye to whether proponents comply with these weakened rules. Making it worse, the ministry keeps the public in the dark about what activities it allows. The ministry must overhaul its approach to managing the Endangered Species Act approvals program, including enhancing monitoring and enforcement"" (2017). I support the need to revise the Act, but I am very concerned by the values and priorities revealed thus far.

23414,/comment/23414,"Biodiversity around the world, including in Ontario, is threatened by habitat loss and climate change. This species loss is so extensive that many scientists believe we are currently undergoing a sixth mass extinction. This loss of biodiversity affects our lives in countless ways - from endangering the key ecological processes that keep our air and water safe and healthy, to reducing the beauty and wonder of the natural world for our children.
Many scientists have dedicated their careers to understanding how to ensure the survival of our remaining species. In line with their recommendations, the Endangered Species Act was created in 2007 to give vulnerable species a chance. We have an opportunity now to strengthen these protections for wildlife.
However, the current proposal would weaken the Endangered Species Act. The proposed changes make it easier for industries to damage critical wildlife habitat - placing the plants and animals that live there under further threat.
This critical wildlife habitat is not “red tape”. It is essential for wildlife survival, and consequently our own health and wellbeing. I strongly believe independent science and evidence must take precedence over political motivations in the implementation of the Endangered Species Act. Along these lines, I support the thorough feedback submitted by the ‘Wildlife Conservation Society - Canada’ regarding the strengthening of the Endangered Species Act. I urge you to take their suggestions under consideration.
I write these comments as an ecologist by profession, and as a Canadian citizen who grew up exploring Ontario’s wild spaces. I am writing on behalf of the Boreal Caribou, Algonquin Wolf, Barn Swallow, Blanding’s Turtle, Monarch Butterfly, and so many more who cannot comment for themselves.

23415,/comment/23415,"As a registered professional forester in northwest Ontario, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. We look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, we must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is our understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. It is our expectation that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further, we remain extremely concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with us well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.

23417,/comment/23417,"RE: ERO #013-4143 Review of the Endangered Species Act, 2007
Focus 1: Landscape approaches
-	The law should not be changed to allow landscape approaches “instead of” species-specific approaches.  The fine scale of species-specific status assessments, listings and protections is needed.
-	Regarding landscape planning, the ESA already provides for this. No change to the law is needed.
-	 With regard to authorizing harmful activities at a broad scale, such an approach is inappropriate for endangered and threatened species. It doesn’t lend itself to addressing site-specific or species-specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.
Focus 2: Listing process and protections
-	Science-based listing and automatic protections provide certainty.
-	There should be no change to the ESA regarding the listing process and the role of Committee On the Status of Species At Risk in Ontario (COSSARO). The law sets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of “the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.” (sec. 5(3)).
-	 Improving notification is an implementation issue which should be addressed through better communications. In its listing process, COSSARO is required to consider species listed by the federal Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) (sec. 4(2)a); there are years of notice embedded in this process, from the release of COSEWIC status reports to the listing by COSSARO.
-	 There should be no alternative to automatic species and habitat protections (e.g., through ministerial discretion to remove or delay protections).
 Focus 3: Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
-	There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce Government Response Statements (GRS) within nine months of the release of Recovery Strategies (sec. 11(8)). Failure to meet the legislated deadline is an implementation issue.
-	 The required five-year reporting on progress is reasonable and ensures transparency and accountability. It provides an impetus for action, ensuring that effectiveness is assessed, and contributes to institutional learning and adaptive management.
-	The government should legislate additional reporting requirements (e.g., every five years) to drive ongoing action and monitoring beyond the first five years.
-	The ESA already allows the Minister to delay the development of a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)b) or to not proceed with a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)c). No change to the law is needed.
-	There should be no changes to the legal provisions for habitat regulations, which describe specific boundaries or features of areas deemed to be habitat and provide enhanced certainty for ESA implementation and enforcement. They can include areas where a species “used to live or is believed to be capable of living” (sec. 55(3)b), presenting a significant opportunity for protection and recovery efforts to extend beyond places where species at risk currently persist.
Focus 4: Authorization Processes
-	This is the Endangered Species Act so the priority must be on protecting and recovering species at risk.
-	There are already sufficient authorization tools. No new tools are needed. Challenges should be addressed through improved implementation.
-	Proponents of harmful activities should NOT be allowed to simply pay into a conservation fund - an easy way out that reduces accountability and facilitates harm to species at risk and their habitats. Retain the current requirements to provide an on-the-ground, overall benefit to species harmed.
-	Do not simplify requirements for sec. 17(2)d permits. These are intended to be available only for projects that “result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario” and that will not “jeopardize the survival or recovery of the species in Ontario.” These are appropriate requirements and ensure that such permits are issued only an exceptional basis.
-	Do not simplify requirements for exemptions through regulation. On the contrary, make the requirements more stringent by amending the law (sec. 57) to ensure that exemptions are premised on providing an overall benefit to species at risk and cannot jeopardize their survival or recovery.
-	 Strengthen protections for species at risk by repealing the sweeping exemptions for industry and development (forestry, hydro, mining, aggregate extraction, and more) approved by Cabinet in 2013. The 2013 exemptions have become the primary means for allowing harmful activities to proceed. As of October 11, 2017, there had been 2,065 registrations for exemptions and about 85 percent of these were for activities that violate ESA protections for species at risk and their habitats.
-	Enforcement officers have no authority to routinely inspect exempted activities to ensure compliance with legal requirements, and consequently no inspection takes place. Implement the recommendation of the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario to amend the ESA to give enforcement officers the power to conduct compliance inspections.
-	 Enhance transparency and accountability by amending the exemption regulation (242/08) to require all proponents of harmful activities to automatically submit their mitigation plans and annual reports to the government and to ensure that these are publicly available.
-	The ESA (sec. 18) already provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. No legislative change is needed. This is an implementation issue.
Thank-you.

-Government is still allow mining to do as they please, while the forestry side has to pay the penitently for total disturbed area on there forest.
-Such a long cut cycle end up losing more wood because of the fact different species have different cut cycle.
-Leaving so much old growth, there is less planting of new tree which have a stronger benefit to carbon reduction.

We are constantly being forced by MNRF to implement reduced / modified harvest to protect species that are not found on large tracks of our Forests.  We will work with the MNRF for areas they have solid evidence that the species of concern is present and work with the MNRF to expand the species range but just forcing a blanket harvest reduction on the entire forest is not the answer.  The First Nations that live and work in these forests have not been consulted or had their views considered.  The MNRF continues to implement more restrictions without community engagement every time a new forest management plan is being created.

23429,/comment/23429,"My reactions to the discussion paper are mixed. I agree that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) could be improved; I do NOT in any way support changes to the ESA or its administration that result in reduced protection for Species at Risk (SAR). I agree that the administration and implementation of the ESA’s policies and regulations is sometimes slow; I do NOT believe that the way to improve review times is to make the review process less comprehensive, but rather that more staff should be hired to facilitate. If there’s a wait time at your garage for getting your winter tires put on, would you suggest they expedite things by only installing two out of four tires, or only tightening the lugnuts halfway?
My overall impression of the discussion paper is that its authors have little interest in improving protections to SAR in Ontario, no matter how much lip service is paid to that goal, and that the focus is instead on making it easier for businesses to circumvent protections in order to make money. But financial gain is never sufficient reason to compromise the survival of a species or the health of the environment. “Efficiency” should not be used as an excuse for cutting out vital steps in a system that provides protection for the most vulnerable parts of our ecosystems.
I find the statement that “the Act has been criticized… for creating barriers to economic development” frankly absurd. What the Act does is ensure that developers and businesses cannot destroy or irreparably harm SAR and their habitat in the pursuit of higher profits, and yet somehow that is being spun that as a bad thing.
With respect to some specific discussion points mentioned in the document:
-	P.3, re: utilizing a “landscape approach instead of a case-by-case approach”. Firstly, as a general rule, environmental assessments in Ontario are already required to look at both the landscape-level and the site-level in order to assess connections and trends. It is disingenuous to present “landscape approaches” as a new tool to be introduced as an improvement. Secondly, SAR frequently require very specific habitats – often, part of what makes them rare in the first place is a dependence on uncommon habitats or site conditions. Even those that require large tracts of habitat on a landscape level can also have site-specific requirements. Therefore, I do not believe it’s possible to only look at a landscape level and still provide appropriate protection.
-	P.4, re: the suggestion of longer timelines before a species is listed. What benefit would increased timelines provide to SAR? If a species has been designated a SAR, it is in danger and protection is appropriate; in some cases a rapid response may be necessary. Providing more advance notice prior to listing would, quite frankly, just allow businesses or people with conflicts more time to conveniently erase those conflicts without fearing legal consequence. I’m not against a certain amount of “grandfathering” for projects that are near completion (although I still believe these should be reviewed and that ways to minimize impact should be incorporated), but a broad blanket policy to delay listing is not an improvement to the ESA.
-	P.7, re: the suggestion of creating a conservation fund. I wholeheartedly disagree that this should be allowed. Firstly, money coming out of a “conservation fund” has no guarantee to address the specific site or species that is being affected. And secondly, putting a set dollar value on compensation simply makes habitat destruction a line-item cost that gets added in to the project budget as a first choice rather than a last resort. Avoidance should always be the first choice – per your own document, “avoiding impacts to species at risk and their habitat is an integral part of protection and recovery”. Compensation – i.e., the idea of enhancing or creating habitat elsewhere to replace what is lost – should always be the last option (as it is often ineffective) and should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if is it even feasible from a conservation standpoint, and if so then how best to go about it.
The discussion paper as a whole is filled with leading questions and economic-based spin that does not lead to productive discussion regarding actual improvements to SAR protection in Ontario. For example, discussion question #3 on pg. 7: “what changes to authorization requirements would better enable economic development while providing positive outcomes and protections for species at risk?” Economic development should not be the driving factor in determining what is appropriate for SAR protection. Improving economic development should not be the focus of legislation (or the 10-year review thereof) pertaining to SAR. Rather, the focus should always, first and foremost, be on the PROTECTION OF SAR AND THEIR HABITAT.

Significant social or economic benefit permits should only be allowed in the rarest of circumstances. Ontario has a lot of open space that can be used for social or economic purposes. A progressive approach to land planning should be enforced (e.g. single-family subdivision development should be prevented if it risks the degradation of valuable habitat)
Follow the advice of environmental scientists and land planning experts (not cherry picked consultants).
As an Ontarian I expect our government to move far away from the models of post war developments.
It's difficult to separate the issues at hand: global warming & climate change, and habitat degradation. The issues go hand in hand - protecting valuable habitat for not just endangered species but most species is very important in 2019.

23435,/comment/23435,"Firstly, I believe maintaining a healthy and diverse environment across Ontario and Canada is extremely important. As a child, I have very fond memories of my father taking me to all the fishing spots his father showed him. I was shown different trees, plants, animals, lakes and all other aspects of our environment. I will continue to pass down this knowledge to my own children as will many other Canadians. To be sustainable, that is to utilize the resources we have without diminishing it for future generations, is an important battle we all fight. By conserving the environment where these resources are extracted, we are in turn protecting the diversity of habitat and wildlife. The endangered species act is one attempt to protect the element of species abundance and diversity. However, certain aspects of the endangered species act are either not successful or fallacious in a sense. Below are some of my opinions regarding the four areas of focus of the discussion paper.
Regarding the landscape approach, it is important to assess the difference between jurisdictional rarity and species at risk at a more broad scale. With the ever changing climate, species are likely to move their habitat range slowly over time. Understanding these patterns will assist in determining which species at risk to focus conservation efforts on.  For example Gibson et al. (2009) estimated that approximately 75% of Canada's terrestrial species at risk are located at their northern range limits. The topic of caribou conservation is perhaps one of the most controversial issues in regards to species conservation. This is a prime example of jurisdictional rarity as woodland caribou are located at the northern periphery in Ontario. The fact that woodland caribou and barren ground caribou are genetically identical is widely unknown by the public. The only difference is that barren ground are a little smaller due to their extensive migratory patterns which in turn, gives them a higher survival rate. The widespread panic of the destruction of caribou habitat can therefore be greatly misunderstood and is turning large tracks of productive forest into a preserved old growth forest. While certain amounts of these forest types are necessary, the caribou blocks are large and extensive which is not only causing job losses and a decrease in economic development, but is also adding to climate change as these forests become carbon sources over time. Proper knowledge and information of species can allow for a more focused approach for species at risk(SAR) which allows for better time management for the listing process and protections of SAR.
I believe a longer review period of the SAR is essential in providing the public and other groups/organizations with proper and accurate information about the habitat, range, life and migratory habits of the species which is being evaluated. Having more extensive research on a species will allow for proper classification of the species. With more species at risk, comes more research, more cost, and a reputation for not conserving habitat properly. The lack of research and automatically putting an ""at risk"" label on a species is a problem which must be addressed. It must be explained that conservation does not happen instantly, but is the result of collecting reliable data over time in order to streamline conservation efforts towards the species which are in direct need of protection. Additional public hearings where people give their own inputs or traditional knowledge are important. However, responses in these hearings are just as important and must be based on science and real data collected in order to better inform everyone about the true details of the SAR (i.e. caribou).
In regards to the third and fourth areas of focus, I believe it is imperative to first focus efforts on the first and second area as they all go hand in hand. The loss of productive forest land based on data which is either insufficient or unreliable should be seen as a failure in preserving the integrity of forest conservation in Ontario. Taking away the rights of trappers, losing the ability to utilize large tracks of land for public use by destruction of roads and taking away opportunities for people like myself who want to work for the forest sector in a responsible and sustainable manner, is not humans coexisting with nature. It is simply laying down and allowing all preservation methods to occur without sufficient or accurate data.  In conclusion, before more negative impacts occur, a more strategic approach to broaden the SAR listing must occur to eliminate unnecessary cost, efforts or loss of economic development due to the immense loss of productive forest land due to mis-aimed conservations efforts.

23439,/comment/23439,"Here’s what I think:
1. Landscape Approaches
I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23442,/comment/23442,"I am taking the position that the government is interested in consulting on this matter in good faith for the benefit of our democratic ideals (See Arnstein’s Ladder of Degrees of Citizen Participation (1969). As outlined in the purpose of the review – the enabling of positive outcomes for species at risk – I offer the following comments for your consideration.
The current status of endangered species in Ontario is not good. The necessity to strengthen existing provisions respecting legislation/regulation for species at risk are found in numerous indicators:
- Provincial government papers documenting the challenges confronting the protection of SAR – see the Biodiversity Council’s strategy paper (2010), and then 5 year monitoring report (2015) i.e., increasing numbers of species on the list.
- As documented by the federal government, there is poor performance overall of our system to protect SAR. The Ontario landscape has a diversity of ecosystems where SAR are found – forests, grasslands, wetlands, lakes (most notably the Great Lakes) and rivers; and costal areas. See
http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_cesd_201311_e_38658.html
- Poor overall ecological condition circumstances are found in many of the watersheds of southern ON as detailed in Watershed Report Cards compiled by Conservation Ontario.
- the ECO has documented extensive issues with the current SAR regulatory system, and these are spelled out in the Annual Report to the Legislature in 2017.
There are currently 248 species (and species populations) that are listed as being at risk under the ESA of ON. The government needs to do its part to protect the rich biodiversity of our province and not let individual species slowly die out for the sake of short term economic interests.
To this end, I support amendments to the ESA that are intent on improving the protection and recovery of at-risk species. To accomplish this, the government should enact the following mechanisms:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.
The commenter acknowledges there are challenges with the current system, and adjustments are required dealing with regulations/procedures. My suggestions outlined above are directed towards this endeavour. In addition, more concrete actions can be derived by implementing findings from research that protect endangered species with targeted programs and financial incentives to implement environmental stewardship, e.g., ALUS program in agriculturally-dominated landscapes. In addition, new employment opportunities are available in areas of research and environmental stewardship to understand and then implement improved protection mechanisms for SAR. Landscape-wide studies should be supported and implemented, e.g., Carolinian Canada’s Big Picture strategy for connecting natural heritage areas together in southwest Ontario.
Thank you for offering me the opportunity to comment on this important topic on behalf of my family and future generations. The value of nature is often taken for granted or not placed in a central place of our society. I am very worried with the general emphasis of the current government in thinking short term economics over long term societal/environmental sustainability. I offer the following quote as a summary thought on this:  “it’s important to practice environmental stewardship but not at the cost of our economy (Andrea Khanjin, parliamentary assistant to the ON Minister of the Environment), Source: Town of Erin's Mayors Breakfast Meeting, January 31, 2019.

These aspects should not even factor into this discussion. The preservation of our planet and the many already endangered species listed should be the most important job for this government.
The fact that you even list barrier to economic development is an affront to all.
There are many ways to develop the economy without impacting negatively on our fragile eco-system.
Renewable sources of energy, electric cars, and carbon neutral buildings are just some of the ways to improve our economy and our eco-system at the same time.
Please put your time and attention to more positive changes that we need in this province and stop undoing all of our previous ones.
Do not change the protections already in place. Do not further endanger our environment and the species that live within it.

We are a crew of 50 people, half are employees of TFL and the other half are subcontractors working for TFL and their employees. We are very much committed to saving endangered species at risk within our forests and surrounding area. unlike Urban sprawl forestry has stick guide lines that are monitored on a daily bases by TFL supervision, employees and government technicians. Therefore it with this strict monitoring I feel that forestry operations should be exempt from ESA and resulting rules to which some are hurting my business as in time of certain work or if any work is allowed which can and does result in much time lost for the people who work within the forest and or relies on the products of which we produce. Birds, plants, animals, amphibian, wet lands and water ways already receive protection through strict forest policy rules and guide lines that we follow strictly  monitored by MNR, SFL, Industry and world agencies such as FSC and CSA. We have been working with and around these endangered species for many years and they are still alive living within our cut blocks and protected by the men and women who work within the forest.

23456,/comment/23456,"Concerned Citizen. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. I look forward in seeing improvements to the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to the forestry sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, below are other requirements that should be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is my understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. I expect that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further I am concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with impacted stakeholders and First Nations well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources

23459,/comment/23459,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ESA review discussion paper.
As the owner/steward of a small private wetland in southwestern Ontario, I cannot stress enough the urgent need to maintain the ESA’s stringent protections for Ontario’s endangered wildlife. We are losing numbers of animals/reptiles/amphibians/birds/insects at an alarming rate in this province. Anyone on the front line of conservation and protection can bear witness to the loss and decline of species due to habitat fragmentation through development and human encroachment. As subdivisions push at municipal borders, centuries-old wildlife crossings and migration paths are intersected or destroyed.
My woods are increasingly silent and empty.
Therefore, any amendments to the ESA must support its original and founding purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species.
I do not see how your proposals can accomplish that goal, frankly. Making Ontario “open for business” should not be done by closing the door on threatened species. We can find intelligent solutions to growth and development without further endangering habitats that support key species in the critical and interdependent web of life, from predators to pollinators.
It takes political will, however, and I urge this government to now be intelligent, wise and constructive. Ontario’s ESA was hailed as an achievement around the world. This is a precious legacy you should not be violating. I ask you not to proceed with proposals that, for the most part, would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
To that end, I urge the following:
1)  Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
2)  Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
3)  Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
4)  Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
5)  Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.
In short, science, not politics, should dictate species recovery.
Furthermore, if business is indeed the key driver for this government, then allow me to remind the decision makers that a tremendous asset to the Ontario economy is, in fact, nature tourism. From birders to paddlers, visitors from all over the world come to see and enjoy our province’s wild spaces. Allowing the wanton destruction of habitat will also eventually destroy what tourists pay to experience.
Finally, I am sure that every member of the government and every politician would like to leave behind, for their children and grandchildren, not only a prosperous province but one that is environmentally healthy and able to continue to support human life through intact ecosystems that provide oxygen and clean water and are teeming with biodiversity.
Please, do the right thing for the future and uphold Ontario’s Endangered Species Act.

  - This review won’t help species at risk if it doesn’t address exemptions that make it too easy for business and industry to do even more harm to critical habitat. Clearly defined no-go zones protect wildlife – while creating efficiencies for business by making it clear where development won’t be permitted.
  - We need protections that lead to recovery for species-at-risk in Ontario– we don’t need changes that will drive more species to extinction.

23461,/comment/23461,"I am writing to inform you that I, a person of the people the ""Government of the people"" is supposed to represent, whole-heartedly opposes opening up the endangered species act for the purpose of streamlining development. You list slowing down development as the problem but that is one of the main positives of the act in question. Slowing down development for no reason is, of course, a negative but the reason many of these species are endangered in the first place are habitat loss caused by rampant unregulated or minimally regulated development. Once these species are gone they will not be coming back. Many species support ecosystems as a whole and losing one can have unforetold consequences as many other species often are interdependent and we as humans know so little about how the interdependencies work. This review is trying to label a feature as a bug.
If the government would like to speed up regulatory processes I would recommend allocating more funding to the resources involved in environmental assessments and regulatory paperwork. A larger workforce and/or more streamlined back office processes would speed up the process. Perhaps look at implementing an office to guide companies through the process to help make it easier for developers to fill out the necessary applications if they are finding it to difficult.
Developments will last a few generations but the environments they change are lost forever. There is no reason to be rash and possibly lose what cannot ever be recovered for companies to make a few extra dollars which the majority of Ontarians will never see.

23462,/comment/23462,"In general, I support strong, effective protections for listed species and their habitats.
1. Landscape Approaches
I support looking at the entire landscape if Species at Risk (SAR) specialists believe it is an appropriate method of improving habitat and protecting species.
2. Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
I believe that the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) is doing an excellent job of determining which species should be listed. Improved communication and transparency is warranted.
3. Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
Priority should be given to expediting Policies and Habitat Regulations in order to be effective and remove uncertainty for businesses and individuals.
4. Authorization Processes
I am not in favour of permits except in unusual circumstances where there are no alternatives. The current system where developers can devise a short-term ""overall benefit"" are nothing but a licence to destroy important habitat of SAR. The current process also has a total lack of transparency. Permits should not be issued unless supported by an independent expert.
",comments-66.json
23463,/comment/23463,"1. Landscape Approaches
I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23464,/comment/23464,"Area of Focus 1: Landscape Approaches
1. Move forward with a permanent section 55(1)(b) regulatory exemption to the forest sector to continue enabling landscape approaches currently being delivered under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA).
2. Working under the section 55 (1)(b) regulation, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) must develop workable species at risk policy delivered under the CFSA that contributes to working landscapes and functioning ecosystems while incorporating socio-economic impact analysis, jointly, with practitioners, affected stakeholders, and Indigenous communities.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
3. Overhaul the membership of COSSARO to reflect more generalist professionals and Indigenous communities rather than academics with expertise in a very limited field of study. Known experts in a particular species, including local MNRF biologists and local RPFs should be invited to participate in the deliberation of species being evaluated by COSSARO at least 12 months before the committee meets to evaluate the species’ status.
4. Develop a clear process for using the “data deficient” category, particularly for species with a wide distribution and lack of data.
5. COSSARO should consider the use of regional sub-populations to account for differences in status across the province, risk to the species and the relative risk of human activities. Populations of species at the normal edge of their ranges in Ontario, outside of their core range, should be evaluated with due consideration of their global population.
6. Add an additional layer of accountability by having the responsible minister weigh scientific evidence provided by COSSARO with the socio-economic impacts before a species is automatically listed and protected.
7. Reassessment of species at risk should be considered when credible evidence has been presented to the responsible ministry beyond what is currently permitted within the ESA.
8. Enable individuals and organizations to report on SAR sightings without the perceived or real fear of being penalized for doing so.
Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
9. The current 5-year review should go beyond simply listing actions that have taken place. A biological review of the species should be included and feedback into the COSSARO listing process.
10. Habitat renewal should not be considered habitat destruction.
Area of Focus 4: Authorization Processes
11. Remove the July 1st, 2020 expiry found in O. Reg. 242/08 (22.1) to forest operations on Crown land giving the sector and government greater certainty.
12. Replace the term “overall benefit” within sections 17(2)(c), 18(1)(e)(iii)(A), and 18(2)(f)(iii)(A) with “positive outcomes” to species at risk.
13. Equivalency through section 55, not harmonization through section 18 is required for future success and is well supported by legal precedent.

23466,/comment/23466,"1. The overall direction of the ESA review appears to be environmental deregulation, which is counter-productive to the very core of the act and what it intends to achieve.
2. The options under consideration undermine the very cornerstones of the law. We required a robust and enforced ESA, including: science-based listing of species at risk (including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge), mandatory protection of threatened and endangered species and their habitats, and legislated timelines for planning and reporting.
3. Do not compromise the science-based process for listing species at risk is in jeopardy by allowing alternative based non-scientific decisions to alter the survival of species.
4. Please do not allow the protection of species at risk and their habitats to be left up to the Minister.
As shown over the years, our governments are heavily influenced by wealthy lobbyists. Such changes would leave  our most vulnerable plants and animals subject to political whims and the influence of powerful industrial lobbyists. Conservation cannot be political.
5. Do not weaken requirements for authorizations to undertake harmful activities. Economic development can continue without compromising conservation.
6. Do not replace harmful permitted activities with the proposed “conservation fund” as this could be an easy-way-out for proponents. This option would make it easier and more likely for harmful activities to occur and will do nothing to protect our at-risk species and habitats.
7. Do not permit broad authorizations for harmful activities. Landscape-scale authorizations for harmful activities may replace project-specific authorizations.This sweeping approach doesn’t lend itself to addressing site-specific or species-specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.
8. Provide for greater implementation of the ESA instead of rewriting the law. According to the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario’s 2017 report, the government “has utterly failed to implement the law effectively.” Challenges should be addressed through improved planning and investment in communications, program development and staffing, not environmental deregulation.
9. Implement many of the more innovative aspects of the ESA including stewardship agreements and ecosystem or multi-species approaches to recovery planning. Putting these tools into practice offers much more promise for species at risk than streamlining approaches to damaging and destroying their habitats.
10. Ontarians have a global responsibility to conserve biodiversity - show us that you are apart of this community of conservation by making the right decisions for species at risk and their habitats. We are now in the throes of the largest mass extinction since the disappearance of the dinosaurs more than 65 million years ago.

I have worked in the forest industry for 20 years in various capacity's including forest management planning and forest renewal
I have a few comments to share regarding the 10th year review of the ESA:
The Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) has proven to be very effective legislation to regulate forestry in Ontario as it strives to balance social, environmental and economic outcomes associated with the management of SFL's.
The Endangered Species Act (ESA) however does not seek to achieve this same balance, instead it requires individual threatened or endangered species to be protected at the expense of all other forest management outcomes.
I would recommend the following;
-  a permanent ESA Section 55 regulatory exemption for the forest sector.
- continue to manage for at-risk species through the CFSA, in balance with other social, economic and environmental objectives
- ensure species prescriptions are developed with input from forest practitioners, affected stakeholders and rights holders, to ensure they are workable
-complete socio-economic impact analysis and share with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented.

During my undergraduate degree, I worked for twelve months with the Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators group of Environment Canada where I built and analyzed the Species at Risk Populations Trends Indicator. I have become very familiar with the processes and data behind Ontario and Canada's species conservation efforts, and I can say with much authority that these efforts are pivotal to the viability of Ontario's economic, social, environmental, and political livelihood. A diversity in species creates resiliency in our ecosystems and thus our societies. Therefore, it is in the best interest of Ontario citizens and environment to revisit the ability of development approval to override the protection of species at risk. I am very concerned by the values and priorities revealed thus far regarding revisions. While there are ways of economy and environment to work together, the Endangered Species Act' purpose cannot be purely 'economic development'. The health of our environment is a direct reflection on the health of our society. Eliminating diversity in our ecosystems will limit our society's capacity of health, viability, and progress.

23470,/comment/23470,"Focus area 1, Landscape approaches: I note the lack of mention of corridors despite the critical importance of those to many species. Any broader approach to the assessment would be invalid without ensuring contiguous corridors rather than isolated areas. Also, the critical areas for the species under consideration must be preserved no matter how much those might be desired by developers or potential country estate or cottage owners.
Focus area 2. Listing process: The ""costly impact"" to businesses primarily occurs when developers are trying to build on land that should never have been open to development in the first place. With a more measured and careful approach to development permits, that prioritize access to EXISTING public transit, water and sewage lines the situations you describe won't happen.
We need affordable housing not mansions, and shopping and places of employment that can be reached WITHOUT A CAR. Besides, since in almost all cases we don't even know the potential value of the species in terms of future health of our own species, the long term balance of costs cannot be reasonably estimated.
Also, if there is a need for additional review or assessment to improve the scientific basis for a decision, the habitat MUST be fully protected during that time. Sensitive habitats cannot simply be restored; they are often gone forever. For species that have different summer and winter habitats, efforts must be made to preserve both.
Focus area 3: Nine months should be FAR more than enough time for engagement and a statement based on the science available at the time. It can always be amended for new knowledge.
I also see no merit in waiting more than five years for a progress review. Increasing the time might allow the government to do nothing for longer and that's not at all desirable.
I am OK with scientists and only scientists figuring out when to use a general or specific habitat regulation. There should be no business or government representation on any committee that makes such decisions or recommendations.
Focus area 4, Authorization: Conservation agreements are a good approach that could be used more extensively. Overall, this section of the paper reads like a pro-business approach to destroying species at risk because they don't matter. A general fund won't help a species that had only a limited habitat that is now gone. The government can reduce the number of forms to be filled out and the length of time it takes to process them without reducing the protections needed by species at risk.
What seems to be missing is large fines for corporate leaders as well as corporations if they proceed with actions that damage the habitats of species at risk, including barring such corporations from future permits for development in Ontario and from Ontario and municipal government contracts.
General Comments
a) It is critical that other government initiatives such as Bill 66 and plans to increase housing be brought in line with the requirements to protect endangered species. Lately it appears as if the Ontario government is using a multi-pronged approach to destroy critical environmental protections.
And the frequent references to the impact on businesses in this discussion paper strongly reinforce that perception.

If anything should be done to the Endangered Species Act, the laws should be strengthened to protect the habitats of Species-at-Risk and more funding allocated to scientific research, stewardship programs, habitat restoration, and the protection of important areas like wetlands and watersheds against development and industrial disturbance. Once the flora and fauna is gone, it's gone. We should never allow it to get to that point, and creating ""efficiencies for business"" sounds to me that Premier Ford's government is listening to certain stakeholders who are more concerned with the economic development than they are with the state of the environment.

If we do not take care of Ontario plants and animals we will be creating a bleak and uncertain future for generations to come.

On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.

- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process (the list should be maintained by scientists and politicians should have not input into this process);

The Honourable Rod Phillips

Government of Ontario
Toronto, Ontario
Dear Minister Phillips:
RE: 	10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act -- ERO 013-4143
	Kingston Field Naturalists Submission
The Lennox and Addington Stewardship Council (LASC) is a community organization that has been working towards ensuring a healthy and sustainable natural environment in the county of Lennox and Addington.  Ours is a county blessed with diverse natural surroundings. From Lake Ontario in the south, to the Canadian shield in the north, woodlands, wetlands, rivers, grasslands, and alvar landscapes provide habitat for abundant biodiversity.  The members of the LASC are from diverse backgrounds but they are united in their desire to protect this natural heritage for present and future generations.  The LASC promotes education, awareness, conservation and restoration of many ecosystems in the interest of preserving this biodiversity. However, like many other like-minded organizations, we are aware of the growing number of species that are designated “At Risk.”
We, the LASC embrace the Ontario Government and Parks’ (MECP) desire to improve protection for species at risk in Ontario through a revised, enhanced and effective. ESA. We are pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) Discussion Paper: “10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act” (the “Discussion Paper”). We are encouraged by the Ontario Government’s indication that it wishes to “consider modern and innovative approaches to achieving positive outcomes for species at risk.”  The Government of Ontario has the responsibility to the citizens of Ontario to protect diversity of species for present and future generations. To achieve positive outcomes in a revised ESA, the protection of each species at risk must always be the focus in the implementation of modern and innovative approaches.
In response to each focus we offer the following comments.
 Focus #1 Landscape Approaches:
•	The law should not be changed to allow landscape approaches instead of species-specific approaches. The existing law already provides for this. No change is necessary.
•	The authorization of harmful activities at a broad scale, such an approach is inappropriate for endangered and threatened species. It doesn’t lend itself to addressing site-specific or species-specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.
Focus #2 Listing Process and Protection:
•	There should be no change to the ESA regarding the listing process and the role of COSSARO. The law sets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of “the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.” (sec. 5(3)). There should be no alternative to automatic species and habitat protections (e.g., through ministerial discretion to remove or delay protections).
•	Improving notification is an implementation issue which should be addressed through better communications. In its listing process, COSSARO is required to consider species listed by the federal Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (sec. 4(2)a); there are years of notice embedded in this process, from the release of COSEWIC status reports to the listing by COSSARO.
Focus 3 Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations:
•	There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce Government Response Statements (GRS) within nine months of the release of Recovery Strategies (sec. 11(8)). Failure to meet the legislated deadline is an implementation issue. The required five-year reporting on progress is reasonable and ensures transparency and accountability.
•	The government should legislate additional reporting requirements (e.g., every five years) to drive ongoing action and monitoring beyond the first five years.
•	There should be no changes to the legal provisions for habitat regulations, which describe specific boundaries or features of areas deemed to be habitat and provide enhanced certainty for ESA implementation and enforcement. They can include areas where a species “used to live or is believed to be capable of living” (sec. 55(3)b), presenting a significant opportunity for protection and recovery efforts to extend beyond places where species at risk currently persist.
Focus 4 Authorization Processes:
•	This is the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act. The priority must be on protecting and recovering species at risk. There are already sufficient authorization tools. No new tools are needed. Challenges should be addressed through improved implementation.
•	Do not simplify requirements for exemptions through regulation. On the contrary, make the requirements more stringent by amending the law (sec. 57) to ensure that exemptions are premised on providing an overall benefit to species at risk and cannot jeopardize their survival or recovery
•	Enhance transparency and accountability by amending the exemption regulation (242/08) to require all proponents of harmful activities to automatically submit their mitigation plans and annual reports to the government and to ensure that these are publicly available.

23478,/comment/23478,"The Endangered Species Act is designed to first and foremost protect species that are at-risk and that absolutely must remain the sole focus of this act. These are our must vulnerable species and they must be protected no matter what. All species have value, and play an important role in maintaining ecosystems. The loss of one species means the loss of interactions with other species, loss of ecosystem services and the loss of ecosystem functioning. When ecosystem services and ecosystem functioning are lost it ends up costing us in environmental damage and economically as it will cost us more to provide the functions that wildlife provide to us for free. Almost all species are at-risk due to human actions, therefore, it is up to us to protect these species and, not under ANY circumstances remove ANY protections. Rather, these protections should be strengthened, and species should be more rapidly listed, more enforcement of the law is needed, and more funding needs to be provided to protect these species and fund projects designed at studying the best way to protect these species.
Ministers should not be allowed to interfere with listing of a species. This needs to remain a science-based listing project. The requirements for listing a species are already quite detailed and require experts to complete intensive study. This process cannot be undermined by politics. The experts - the scientists and conservationists - know best which species need protecting. Full stop.
Habitat protections are a basic need for species and protections for a species habitat need to be included without delay. A habitat contains all the resources necessary for a species to survive. Without habitat protection you cannot protect a species. So this MUST remain a part of the ESA and habitat protections must be strongly enforced and based on the best available science. This also must be weighed against the costs of inaction - if a species is declining rapidly and threats to the species are large we must protect habitat even if there is some uncertainty about the exact nature of a species habitat. This is a basic step to conserving species and this requirement CANNOT be weakened at all. Ministers should absolutely not be allowed to comment on this aspect. Scientists and conservationists are the experts and would be able to provide the best input in this area.
Nobody should be exempt from protecting endangered species. Under no circumstances should anyone be allowed to obtain a permit to undertake activities that are directly or indirectly harmful to any at-risk species.
Species-specific needs and requirements must still be considered. A broad or landscape approach will not suffice to protect species. Individual species may have distinct needs that cannot be ignored.
Poor implementation of the ESA is the problem, not the law itself. According to the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario’s 2017 report, the government “has utterly failed to implement the law effectively.” Challenges should be addressed through improved planning and investment in communications, program development and staffing, not environmental deregulation.
It is the government's responsibility to protect our most vulnerable species and the residents of Ontario (including myself) will not stand for any weakening to the endangered species act. Work on strengthening and bettering this act for the species it is designed to protect.

Forest Sector Requires Permanent Regulation Followed by Workable Species at Risk Policy After 10th Year Review of the Endangered Species Act
To Whom it May Concern:
As a Registered Professional Forester, conservationist, and outdoorsman, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. I’m glad for the opportunity to work with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has proven to be very difficult to apply to forestry, in particular because it does not seek to achieve balance through forest management; instead it requires individual threatened or endangered species to be protected at the expense of all other forest management outcomes (including at the expense of other species) at the Landscape scale as well as the stand and site scale. Many attempts by government over the last few years have failed to find a way to make the ESA work for forestry without creating serious legal risk, crushing regulatory burden, and catastrophic wood supply reductions.  Despite involving policy makers, lawyers, forest practitioners and stakeholders, the only implementable solution has come through the use of an ESA Section 55 Regulation.  That is why the sector is currently operating under its third ESA Section 55 Regulation, which expires next year.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA); through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector and renders both processes unachievable if implemented simultaneously. The Section 55 Regulation does not 'exempt' forest managers from providing for species at risk; it merely achieves these protections in a different, more efficient, practical and balanced way. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk.  By implementing the CFSA this provides a more holistic and all-encompassing approach where all aspects of a healthy ecosystem are accounted for.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, we must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Implement a permanent ESA Section 55 regulatory exemption for the forest sector that recognizes the CSFA as an equivalent legal tool for implementing species at risk protections Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy.
2.	Continue to manage for at-risk species through the CFSA, in balance with other social, economic and environmental objectives- which allows for a balanced landscape management approach.
3.	Ensure species prescriptions are developed with input from forest practitioners, affected stakeholders and rights holders, to ensure they are workable.
4.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented.
Furthermore; also of extreme concern is role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with affected stakeholders well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, Ontario needs permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.
Thank you for the opportunity to work with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
Kind Regards.

23481,/comment/23481,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ESA review discussion paper. Though I support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.
Thank you for your attention.

23482,/comment/23482,"It is important that scientific knowledge is applied to recovering species at risk to return them to safer levels of population in their natural environments. Reacting politically to pressure groups can be counter productive to survival of species at risk. Pressure groups are too often motivated by well intentioned individuals, who have their own unrealized biases, that blind them to the real needs of that which their group aspires to promote, of protect.
I am a retired professional forester who for 60 years has been dealing with such well intentioned, but too-often, wrongly informed organizations. Starting 60 years ago I witnessed and helped revive an endangered woodland caribou population return to near carrying capacity in all of its former range on the Island of Newfoundland. The methods used were based on the best science of the time and the cooperation of government, industry and citizens. Cooperation and good science were the key ingredients in that success. In my opinion, since then poorly informed pressure groups, with their own selfish interests, have prevented the application of good science to management of the herd. As a result, populations have been in sustained decline for the past two decades. I believe Ontario's woodland caribou are suffering from the same pressures and until rational science is applied there will be little hope for their recovery to sustainable populations.
My reading of the science suggests that Ontario's forest dwelling caribou require large areas of even-aged forest stands with a mixture of stands of different single ages. This can only be achieved by large fires and/or large clearcuts. Research elsewhere has shown that caribou move to the more desirable habitats as natural trends and depletions change habitat. The only restrictions appear to be a need for secure calving grounds, and avoidance of wolf infested small stands derived from small fires and, or, small clearcuts.  Small cuts were, and are, a result of pressure on government to improve the appearance of the forest, and also, to enhance moose populations.
Other species than caribou could also be in decline because they are being ""loved to death"". The environment reacts without passion to disturbance. If doesn't matter if that disturbance is a natural or human caused event. If we get the cure wrong we may wipe out a population, to the benefit of whatever is capable of replacing that population, and the new natural trend will continue. That said, continuing loss of species is detrimental to our own survival. Let's get it right!

23483,/comment/23483,"Here’s what I think:
1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate. What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23485,/comment/23485,"Dear Premier Ford, Minister Phillips, and Minister Yakabuski,
In response to EBR Posting 013-4143, 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act Discussion Paper, I ask you consider the following comments.
For over 17 years I have worked in silviculture, forest management planning support, and forest certification programs. As a forest sector worker, I have witnessed, over this time, the proven effectiveness of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) to provide balanced landscape scale as well as stand and site scale management of Ontario’s Crown Forests.  The CFSA enables a management framework to consider and address social, economic and environmental values across the landscape.
A balanced ecosystem management approach that addresses multiple objectives is only possible on Ontario’s Crown Forests by continued implementation of the CFSA as an equivalent legal tool for implementing SAR protection through a permanent ESA Section 55 regulatory exemption.  This Section 55 ‘exemption’ does not ‘exempt’ forest workers from protecting SAR, it binds us to achieving these protections through a different, more efficient, practical and balanced way through the CFSA. Authorization provided under the CFSA, rather than the ESA, would enable better economic development while providing positive outcomes for all species, not just species at risk.
Landscape scale management addresses all species, including those at risk and is the only scale appropriate for Ontario’s Crown Forests to address habitat for many species, including the many at risk.  Case-by-case and species-specific approaches do not work across landscapes.  Landscape management that regulates a range of natural variation of landcape classes is a strategic approach providing the best chance of positive outcomes for all species, not just those at risk (refer to the Forest Management Guide for Boreal Landscapes MNRF 2014).  This landscape approach is best implemented through the existing tool, the CFSA for Ontario’s Crown Forests.  Forest Management Plans, manage at landscape scale but also provide for stand and site level management for conserving and protecting biodiversity, including species at risk: refer to the Forest Management Guide for Conserving Biodiversity at the Stand and Site Scales (MNRF 2010).
In Southern Ontario, where landscape approaches are limited due to urbanization, land ownership, infrastructure needs, land use variety, and other factors, the ESA permitting system, and habitat regulation is best implemented.
Positive outcomes for species at risk are possible only through policy that balances the three pillars of sustainability:  social, economic and environmental.  Please include complete socio-economic impact analysis before releasing SAR policy; and then effectively consult, and listen to, impacted stakeholders, including forest workers, Metis and First Nations prior to any SAR policy being implemented.  This economic analysis is not only needed for changes to the framework and content of the Act and Regulations as proposed in this 10 Yr review, but is required before listing species, developing recovery strategies, defining general habitat descriptions and regulating habitat.  To include these items, it would be appropriate to extend timelines for development of government materials, such as response statements etc.
The best available science is only useful when a wide range of input from forest workers, affected stakeholders, Metis and First Nations are consulted on 1) the interpretation of the science and 2) the resulting habitat prescriptions.  Such consultation will ensure protection prescriptions are workable (socially, economically and environmentally).
Finally, it should be noted, that forest management does not ‘destroy’ or ‘damage’ habitat. The environment is always changing, whether those changes are managed or left to random change of the fire cycle. There is no static environment. The ESA has been ‘now’ focused to the detriment of long-term provision of habitat.  A managed forest that creates through harvest and renewal, a wide range of landscape classes, provides habitat over time for all species, not just those at risk; and, does this through the CFSA that enables a management framework to consider and address social, economic and environmental values across the landscape. References to forest operations, done in compliance to the CFSA, should be noted in government documentation as having long-term benefit to habitat.

Re: EBR Registry Number 013-4143
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the 10th Year Review of
Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper. Attached with this covering letter
are staff comments developed in consultation with the Region’s Local Municipalities.
These comments are subject to ratification by Niagara Region Council.
As you are likely aware, the Niagara Region is one of the most biodiverse areas in
Ontario and home to a large number of species deemed by COSSARO to be at risk of
extinction. Balancing the protection of these species with changing land use patterns
requires defendable policies supported by scientific research which can be applied in an
efficient timeframe.
Stakeholders in Niagara have raised concerns over timelines associated with reviewing
authorizations and receiving feedback from the MNRF. The current process is not
consistent, and applicants face delays which have implications on development
schedules, especially when season specific monitoring is required. Expediting the
process with efficient and clearly communicated timelines is necessary to resolve this
problem.
Regional staff are supportive of the MNRF’s discussion paper and are encouraged by
the Government’s process for consultation on this critical topic. We look forward to
reviewing and providing feedback on draft changes to the Endangered Species Act.
If you have any questions about the content of this submission, please don’t hesitate to
contact the undersigned.
Sincerely,

Response to: 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act
Question
Response
Landscape Approaches
The Province asked:
In what circumstances would a more strategic approach
support a proposed activity while also ensuring or
improving outcomes for species at risk? (e.g., by using a
landscape approach instead of a case‐by‐case
approach, which tends to be species and/or sitespecific.)
Niagara Region staff are supportive of using the
Provincial and/or Regional Natural Heritage System to
inform protections for species identified on the Species
at Risk (SAR) in Ontario list and the habitat that
supports them; however, further guidance is requested
regarding how a “landscape approach” may be used.
Moving to a landscape approach that uses the natural
heritage system for protecting the habitat of SAR could
be an effective method, but it should be clear to the
development community that this could translate into
additional protections that do not currently exist.
If changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are
implemented, training for municipal staff should be
prioritized.
Consideration of applications currently in the middle
of the ESA permitting process is also recommended.
The Province asked:
Are there existing tools or processes that support
managing for species risk at a landscape scale that
could be recognized under the Endangered Species
Act?
Niagara Region uses a Natural Heritage System
informed by Ecological Land Classification System (ELC)
mapping which could be used to support SAR
identification at the landscape scale.
Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
The Province asked:
What changes would improve the notification process
of a new species being listed on the Species at Risk in
Ontario List? (e.g., longer timelines before a species is
listed.)
Niagara Region staff suggest that the use of automated
notifications (such as an electronic mailing list) is
recommended to notify stakeholders (e.g., municipal
staff) when new information becomes available.
The Province asked:
Should there be a different approach or alternative to
automatic species and habitat protections? (e.g., longer
transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether
to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a
threatened or endangered species, or its habitat.)
Niagara Region staff caution that decisions about
species protections should be based in science without
the influence of ministerial discretion. Niagara Region
staff encourage the continuance of having Committee
on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO)
assess species.
It is further recommended that the Province strengthen
species protections for species identified as ‘special
concern’ in the ESA. This could be done through the
provision of guidance that defines the habitat
requirements for ‘special concern’ species, which
would offer better protections to the species and
would also give stakeholders information related to
future habitat protections if the species get up‐listed to
‘threatened’ or ‘endangered’ status.
The Province asked:
In what circumstances would a different approach to
automatic species and habitat protections be
appropriate? (e.g., there is significant intersection
between a species or its habitat and human activities,
complexity in addressing species threats, or where a
species’ habitat is not limiting.)
While Niagara Region staff support the continuance of
the current approach, staff agree there may be
opportunity to refine habitat protections where species
habitat is not limiting.
The Province asked:
How can the process regarding assessment and
classification of a species by the Committee on the
Status of Species at Risk in Ontario be improved? (e.g.,
request an additional review and assessment in cases
where there is emerging science or conflicting
information.)
Niagara Region staff support the continuance of the
current approach used for species and habitat
protections. It is staff’s opinion that COSSARO is a
transparent committee of experts which twice annually
produces a ‘priority list’ that identifies species whose
populations are in decline. Using a scientific approach,
they assess what is known about the species and make
a decision on whether additional protections are
warranted. The public is notified of any proposed
changes and given the opportunity to submit
comments on the Environmental Registry. This process
is transparent and scientifically defendable.
If changes are proposed to this approach, Niagara
Region staff request the opportunity to further
provide comments.
Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
The Province asked:
In what circumstances would a species and/or
Ontarians benefit from additional time for the
development of the Government Response Statement?
(e.g., enable extending the timeline for the
Government Response Statement when needed, such
as when recovery approaches for a species are complex
or when additional engagement is required with
businesses, Indigenous peoples, landowners and
conservation groups.)
Niagara Region staff suggest that the current time
requirements prescribed by the ESA related to
developing the Government Response Statement is
reasonable. Any further delay could create uncertainty
for stakeholders. If additional time is authorized, the
process for doing so should be well documented,
transparent and based in science.
The Province asked:
In what circumstances would a longer timeline improve
the merit and relevance of conducting a review of
progress towards protection and recovery? (e.g., for
species where additional data is likely to be made
The Region can not think of any circumstances where a
longer timeline would be warranted.
available over a longer timeframe, or where
stewardship actions are likely to be completed over a
longer timeframe.)
The Province asked:
In what circumstances is the development of a habitat
regulation warranted, or not warranted? (e.g., to
improve certainty for businesses and others about the
scope of habitat that is protected.)
A habitat regulation specifies the habitat required by a
species to fulfill its life processes. According to the ESA,
“it provides a more precise definition of a species’
habitat and may describe features, geographic
boundaries or other unique characteristics. Regulated
habitat may be smaller or larger than general habitat”.
Thus habitat regulations provide a greater level of
certainty to stakeholders as they identify individual
species’ precise habitat needs.
Niagara Region staff recommend that the Province
focus on expediting this process.
Authorization Process
The Province asked:
What new authorization tools could help businesses
achieve benefits for species at risk?(e.g., in lieu of
activity‐based requirements enable paying into a
conservation fund dedicated to species at risk
conservation, or allow conservation banking to enable
addressing requirements for species at risk prior to
activities.)
Changes made to the ESA permitting process in 2013
(i.e., incorporating self‐registry for specific SAR)
provided more leeway for industry, so analysis of those
changes would be beneficial to determine the best
approach moving forward.
A mitigation hierarchy (e.g., avoid impacts, minimize,
mitigate, compensate), based in science, is
recommended if a ‘conservation fund’ is considered. It
is staff’s opinion that this approach has high potential
to be misused via treatment as a ‘first option’ by
stakeholders.
The Province asked:
Are there other approaches to authorizations that
could enable applicants to take a more strategic or
collaborative approach to address impacts to species at
risk? (e.g., create a new authorization, such as a
conservation agreement.)
Applicants should be advised on the process and
associated timelines for receiving an authorization like
a s.17(2)(c) Overall Benefit permit. An alternative
approach could include providing incentives for
stakeholders who avoid needing an authorization.
Stakeholders should also be informed that an ‘overall
benefit’ is not always achievable and so avoidance
should take precedent.
The Province asked:
What changes to authorization requirements would
better enable economic development while providing
positive outcomes and protections for species at risk?
(e.g., simplify the requirements for a permit under s.
17(2)d, and exemptions set out by regulation.)
Expediting the time it takes to review an authorization
would likely provide the most benefit to stakeholders.
This could be achieved by ensuring there are staff and
expertise in local district offices.
The Province asked:
How can the needs of species at risk be met in a way
that is more efficient for activities subject to other
legislative or regulatory frameworks? (e.g., better
enable meeting Endangered Species Act requirements
in other approval processes.)
The Province asked:
In what circumstances would enhanced inspection and
compliance powers be warranted? (e.g., regulations.)
The ESA on‐line registry was developed to expedite
approvals for specific species deemed eligible by
COSSARO. These applications should be audited
regularly to ensure the ESA is being applied fairly and
consistently across the Province. There is currently an
incentive for applicants to use the self‐registry process
improperly, which could be remedied with enhanced
inspection and compliance powers.
Other Comments:
From a policy implementation standpoint, Niagara Region requires a clear set of directives related to the
implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Any changes proposed by the Province should include a
detailed strategy for educating municipalities and other stakeholders on any new requirements or processes. This
should include direction on who is responsible for ESA authorizations in the interim.
Currently, one of the largest complaints received from industry involves the time it takes for developers to receive
feedback from the MNRF on information requests submitted to local district offices. This becomes especially
problematic for species with specific timing windows. For example, bats may require acoustic monitoring that can
only occur in the month of June. If an applicant submits an information request to the MNRF in April/May and
does not receive a response until July, this can have implications on development schedules.
It would be helpful to have species‐specific experts available to help guide ESA applications. The current process
requires working with local district offices that may not have the internal expertise for every potential species at
risk in their jurisdiction. Staffing changes also can cause delays. Having experts available would help alleviate
some of the back and forth that occurs which results in delays.
A science‐based review of the ESA’s capability to protect species over the past 10 years would be helpful for
informing the proposed update. Knowing how effective the legislation has been at protecting species and
removing them from ‘imperiled’ status would be a good first step for informing the legislation updates.
Consideration of climate change on habitat should also be incorporated into the ESA update, as should
consideration of cumulative impacts.
The ESA is complex because it deals with many different species each with unique factors contributing to
population decline. A ‘one shoe fits all’ approach is likely not practical and therefore a case‐by‐case approach may
be warranted for many species. For instance, not all species are at risk due to habitat loss. This distinction needs
to be understood and considered against development proposals.

3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is my understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. I expect that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further I am concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with impacted stakeholders and First Nations well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.

I am part of the Ontario constituents who CARE deeply about protecting the environment. I can read between the lines to see what ‘efficiencies’ and making things easier for business might mean in terms of protecting species that are currently known to be at risk and helping them recover, and also, to identify and protect those that are nearing at risk status. Do NOT loosen regulations to allow developers to skip environmental assessments which will further endanger wildlife - plants, animals, insects, birds and micro organisms — ALL OF WHICH are vital to maintain a healthy balance. Protecting nature is paramount to our own survival.  Increase protections now. Sure, if you can make it simpler and easier, do that, but not at the risk of skipping or cheating on rules that protect Ontario’s wildlife. Business can look after themselves, just fine. We must voice our desire to protect those with no voice to protect themselves.
Please also take note that you had no mandate for this and your policies with regard to the environment will be your undoing.  You have been vocal in your disregard for our water and environment. Either that or you just do not have the education to realize the connection between the two. Perhaps consult experts, or even a group of ten year olds.

I am an RPF, working in Thunder Bay, Ontario. I have been employed as a forester with a private consulting company for the last 6 years in various capacities, including compliance, silviculture, and planning.   I would like to provide a comment for the 10th year review of the ESA: (EBR posting 013-4143).
I feel that the CFSA has been effective legislation in forestry and  provides a balanced approach  with regards to forest management.  The ESA does not take into consideration the social, and economic outcomes required to maintain a balanced landscape management approach, as it focuses on individual or endangered species protection at the expense of other objectives.  Operating permanently under an ESA Section 55 regulatory exemption for the forestry sector is the only way to continue without serious  reductions in wood supply.   This exemption still recognizes the CFSA as an equal legal tool for protection of threatened or endangered species and other objectives. The CFSA already  provides detailed direction for managing and protecting these species  at the landscape, stand and site level. Furthermore, species prescriptions are developed with input from forest practitioners, affected stakeholders, and rights holders, to ensure a balanced landscape management approach is implemented.
THANK YOU

23492,/comment/23492,"This memo is written from the perspective of the forest industry in attempts to address the limitations of the current Endangered Species Act framework.
While the protection of endangered species is a crucial component in natural resource management, the implementation of policy and regulations stemming from the Endangered Species Act are disconnected from the realities on the ground.  The integration of policy with other forest values and considerations is an intricate task that involves a great deal of consultation with both forestry stakeholders and First Nation communities. It seems as though this facet of endangered species protection and habitat conservation has been overlooked, which has led to numerous social and economic repercussions. If implemented, the ripple effect of unprecedented habitat conservation strategies will further restrict the ability to carry out sustainable forest management.
The clearest and most pertinent example of the issues stated above is the caribou policies being forced onto forest management entities without any regard for the social and economic ramifications. The extent to which caribou management has evolved has the potential to cripple the forest industry by restricting the ability to properly conduct forest management. Large deferral areas and timing restrictions only decrease the amount of timber available for harvest, which forestry companies at all levels rely on, and also has a number of ecological consequences (i.e. over-matured stands, loss of merchantable species and increased fire risk).
It was alarming to learn that the governing bodies for endangered species items do not actively include Registered Professional Foresters (RPF’s). RPF’s are the only provincially recognized professionals in natural resource management and also the individuals directly affected by the decisions made by organizations comprised of biologists and specialists.
The extent of First Nations involvement needs to be emphasized moving forward. The incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge is consistently mentioned throughout the various MNRF guides that govern forestry activities in Ontario, however, it seems like the groups affected by these decisions are not well informed or educated. During the Jan. 24th webinar it was stated that there is a “measured approach” for including First Nations who are affected by the implementation of ES regulations, however, when these regulations are raised at various stakeholders’ meetings I’ve attended, none of the communities are aware of the rationale, impacts, etc. of decisions.
Opening Ontario for business is an emerging theme. Therefore, decisions should be made to benefit the province as a whole instead of solely focusing on single species. The disconnect noted above results in sloppy mixing of endangered species regulations and forestry objectives.
In summary I am proposing the following revisions to the Endangered Species Act:
1) Improved notification and implementation processes for new endangered species protection
    regulations (i.e. specific detail on timing, potential impacts on forestry, etc.)
2) Enhanced industry and FN engagement on decision making
3) Inclusion of RPF knowledge
Thank you for your consideration,
Ryan

23493,/comment/23493,"I recommend that no changes be made to the ESA itself, but rather that the focus should shift to improving implementation. This would involve increasing the use of the full range of tools already in the Act, improving communications with stakeholders, Indigenous peoples and knowledge holders, and improving the implementation and tracking of recovery, especially with respect to habitat protection.
Some efficiencies could be realized by taking more of a multi-species approach where appropriate (e.g., in cases where multiple species at risk are affected by the same threats or inhabiting the same threatened landscape). However, it is important to be realistic about the need to also maintain species-specific measures.
Finally, it is very important to note that a drive to achieve simple cost-cutting or to make habitat destruction ""easier"" for proponents of development projects will only result in higher costs down the road as we worsen biodiversity loss and weaken ecological systems that we depend on, jeopardizing access to clean air and water, and jobs related to tourism, recreation, and resources. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

23494,/comment/23494,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Ontario government’s Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act (ESA).
The ESA is intended to safeguard endangered species. As such, the ESA must accord top priority to the needs of species at risk. I accept that effective efforts to conserve species are challenging – scientifically, ethically, and economically.  However, all who are alive today have an ethical and practical responsibility to conserve the web of life which underpins our well-being, our security, and our survival.  Given this truth, I vehemently oppose the crass attitude, the tacit objectives, and the proposed changes put forth in your ten-year review of the ESA.
Today we witness a human-induced biological crisis: global mass extinction of species at 1000 to 10,000 times the evolutionary baseline. Yes – worldwide, and even in Canada, wildlife is in alarming decline. I urge you to fortify the ESA according to the insights, concerns, and solutions put forth by countless conservation experts: scientists, technicians, and organizations. Moreover, I urge you to support the ESA with the necessary clout: power, funding, and staff.
-	Reinstate the ESA, as legislated in 2007.
-	Eliminate the changes of 2013 that introduced exemptions for certain industries and broad regulations to permit diverse destructive activities (that could entail killing, harming, harassing, capturing, taking, possessing, selling, trading species, as well as degrading and destroying habitat), and to accept intent to minimize harm rather than require precluding and compensating for harm.
-	Reinforce science (objective evidence, logic, and critical thinking) as the cornerstone of the ESA:
1) science-based listing of species at risk (including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge),
2) mandatory protection of threatened and endangered species and their habitats, and
3) legislated timelines for science-based survival and recovery plans, actions, and reporting.
-	DO NOT politicize the ESA by giving the minister the power to remove or delay species protections.
-	We must use the precautionary principle – err in favour of conservation! Protecting species at risk and their habitats must be automatic, immediate, and not subject to the whims and discretion of the minister or the influence of lobbyists.
-	Protect existing species and habitats. Substituting this with payments to a conservation fund is an inadequate, unacceptable alternative because we have no known, effective way of recreating natural capital.
-	Landscape-level authorizations for harmful activities increase risk for vulnerable species because it eliminates opportunity to discover or address site and species-specific concerns.
-	Reinstate and provide copious support to the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario. How else can we confirm that our actions are effective and match our intent? Our survival depends on this.
Though the Ontario government claims that it wants to improve protections for species at risk, the options under consideration would clearly make it easier for industry and development proponents to damage or destroy the habitats of species that get in the way of business. Endangered species are not a bureaucratic burden that impede economic development. Good grief! Our very lives depend on the vulnerable diversity of species that blesses Ontario today. We have moral and practical obligation to effectively stewarding this web of life. This obligation critically outweighs the supposed value of maximizing short-term economic opportunities for anyone alive today. As noted by Ecojustice …
Intact ecosystems regulate our climate, pollinate our food, enrich our soil, underpin the processes that provide clean air, water and land that we need to survive. Natural systems are critical drivers of the economy, supporting vital industries like forestry, fishing, and tourism. Species are the engine that keep these natural systems running.
As stated in 2013 by Gordon Miller, the success of the ESA ultimately relies on effective, consistent, and transparent implementation in line with the intent and purpose of the Act.
Poor implementation of the ESA is the problem – not the law itself. Invest in planning, communications, program development, and staffing. Do not consider, let alone proceed with environmental deregulation.
I hold you accountable for protecting the long-term interests of all Ontarians – human and otherwise.

23495,/comment/23495,"10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper.
EBR Registry Number: 013-4143
IFAW, with approximately 22,000 Ontario supporters, thanks you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, EBR 013-4143 (hereafter referred to as “the Discussion Paper’).
Founded in Canada in 1969, IFAW is a global non‐profit organization that protects animals and the places they call home. We believe that individual animals matter to species conservation, and our work seeks to link the value of individual animals to the health of the population and ecosystem at large.  IFAW works to protect habitat and combat wildlife trafficking with a focus on long-term survival of populations and species.
We are now in the midst of the sixth mass extinction even on earth, with species disappearing at an alarming rate.  Globally, almost one in eight birds, one in four mammals, and one in three amphibians are in jeopardy. Habitat loss and degradation, climate change, invasive species, pollution and overexploitation of natural resources are driving the decline.
In Ontario, there are over 230 plant and animal species that are at-risk of extinction or extirpation, a number which is growing every year. Their loss or decline affects the functioning and resilience of food webs and landscapes, and jeopardizes the well-being of all living things, including humans.  A healthy and vibrant Ontario requires healthy, functioning ecosystems
In this context, we welcome the commitment of the Government of Ontario, as stated in the Introduction to the Discussion Paper, to ensuring stringent protections for species at risk. However, the Discussion Paper raises some concerns, which we would like to comment on.
Notably, the issues identified in the Discussion Paper are concerned with implementation of the Act, not the Act itself.  To improve outcomes for species at risk (which is the intent of the Act) we need to improve implementation, not weaken legislation. The ‘activities’ referred to throughout the Discussion Paper are, largely, harmful activities currently prohibited by the ESA.  We are greatly concerned that the overall direction of the options being considered is deregulation, facilitating activities that harm species at risk and their habitats.
Focus 1: Landscape approaches
We sympathize with the Ontario government’s concerns about the lengthy process of getting through the steps in the Act, and agree that assessing and recovering species is a complex and often time consuming matter.  The notion of a landscape approach to recovery is a positive one, and a broad-scale, multi-species approach may be appropriate when there are multiple species sharing similar threats and geographies, and where individual species are wide-ranging and sensitive to cumulative impacts.
However, landscape / multi-species approaches have been considered in Ontario for years. The mechanism and tools to implements a broad scale, strategic, landscape approach are already provided for within the ESA and thus no change to the existing legislation is required. The species remains the most appropriate focus for effectiveness monitoring, and landscape approaches should augment, not replace, species-specific approaches which are required for assessments and reassessments, and for understanding individual species’ recovery needs.  The ESA should not be amended to authorize harmful species at a broad scale.
Focus 2: Listing processes and protections
The science-based listing of species at risk by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO), and automatic protection of species and their habitats, are cornerstones of the ESA and must remain intact. Again, the challenges described in the discussion paper involving listings are implementation issues, and not issues with the legislation itself.
The premise behind automatic listing is to avoid spending excessive time and effort deciding whether a species should be listed, and to allow focus on recovery.  We know from experience that that the longer we wait to begin recovery efforts, the more time consuming and expensive these efforts become.   Improving notification is an implementation issue which should be addressed through better communications with stakeholders and proponents.
Ontario must recognize the difference between scientific concerns and stakeholder concerns regarding the basis of listing a species in a clear and transparent manner. Science based listings and automatic protections provide certainty and clarity.  Changing the law to allow ministerial discretion on automatic protections will politicize the process, fuel controversy and weaken protections for species at risk. The ESA currently provides sufficient flexibility through permits and exemptions.  Legislative amendments to the ESA are not required, nor will they address the problems outlined in the Discussion Paper.   The challenges described can, and should, be addressed through better implementation.
Focus 3. Recovery processes and habitat
We are sympathetic to the difficulties in meeting mandatory timelines for production of documents, and obviously this is a cause for concern.  However, there is no analysis provided as to why timelines are not being met, nor of the potential consequences of lengthened timelines. As noted above, the longer the delay in endangered species recover, the more time consuming, expensive, and less effective it becomes.
There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce Government Response Statements (GRS) within 9 months of the release of Recovery Strategies, nor the 5 year reporting on progress. Clear timelines for action ensure that effectiveness is monitored, and that increased costs – to both species at risk and the Ontario taxpayer - are not being incurred through delays.  More attention on coordinating the process of developing recovery strategies and GRS, creating recovery strategies and GRS for multiples species when appropriate (for example when they share a particular geography or facing similar threats), and understanding and using the provisions which currently exist in the ESA are likely to be more beneficial measures that could be adopted.
Focus 4: Authorization processes
There currently exist sufficient flexibility mechanisms in the ESA; more are not needed.   The facilitation of harmful development activities is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the ESA.  The priority must remain on protecting and recovering species at risk.  There are already sufficient authorization tools in the ESA that should not be simplified. Proponents of harmful activities should not be allowed to pay into a conservation fund in lieu of meeting requirements to provide tangible benefit to species that they negatively impact.
Conclusion: The “challenges” identified in the Discussion Paper concern implementation of the ESA, not the Act itself.  They therefore will not be remedied by amendments to the ESA – the Act does not need to be changed, it needs to be better implemented.
The challenges identified should be addressed through improved implementation by focusing on effective habitat protection measures that simultaneously improve outcomes for multiple species, by taking a strategic and holistic approach to developing recovery plans and measures, including proactively addressing and incorporating species needs into provincial processes such as land use planning, cumulative effects assessments and decisions about annual allowable cut and prioritization of geographies. The earlier a species’ needs can be addressed, the less expensive and more effective it will be, as meaningful protection is deferred, the more the condition of a species deteriorates, and the more complicated and expensive recovery becomes.
Species are at risk because of habitat loss and degradation.  To improve our efforts for species at risk, we need to improve habitat protection, not make it easier for habitat to be destroyed, and harmful activities, as referred to throughout the paper, should not be facilitated.
Improved planning, implementation, and investment in outreach to stakeholders, program development, and staffing would benefit not only species at risk, but Ontarians through job creation and ecosystem restoration. Healthy ecosystems are integral to a vibrant and healthy Ontario economy, and play an important part in the quality of life and enjoyed by Ontarians.

23499,/comment/23499,"These are my comments on the10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper.
ERO number. 013-4143
1. BACKGROUND:  Ontario’s Endangered Species Act was severely weakened by the enactment of O.Reg. 176/13 in May of 2013.
Ontario’s Endangered Species Act (ESA), as originally enacted, allowed proponents to carry out activities that could harm species at risk or their habitat if they obtained authorization from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF).
On May 31, 2013, despite over 10,000 mostly negative comments posted on the Environmental Registry, the amendments to the ESA were made with the enactment of O.Reg. 176/13.
https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/R13176
Prior to the enactment of O.Reg. 176/13 in May 31, 2013, the ESA required project proponents for projects with a negative impact on endangered species, or species at risk, to obtain a specific permit from the MNRF.  In 2013,  O.Reg. 242/13, shifted the authorization process to a “permit-by-rule” process. This means that proponents can carry out many harmful activities as long as they follow a series of rules that are set out in regulations under the ESA.
O Reg 176/13 included amendments to 58 different statutes, including the following acts prescribed under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993:
the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997 (FWCA) the Kawartha Highlands Signature Site Park Act, 2003 (KHSSPA)
the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act (LRIA) the Niagara Escarpment Protection and Development Act (NEPDA)
the Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act, 2006 (PPCRA)
the Public Lands Act (PLA).
O.Reg. 176/13 exempt almost all industrial projects from the core protections of the Endangered Species Act. None of Ontario's more than 150 endangered or threatened species now have the full protection they originally had under the Act.
2. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL in ERO-013-4143 references a Discussion Paper “10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act”
AREA OF FOCUS 1 Landscape Approaches in the above referenced document states:
“The case-by-case and species-specific policy approach to implementing the Endangered Species Act can sometimes limit the ability to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk.  For species that depend on habitat across wide ranges, a landscape approach (my emphasis) that enables planning and authorizing activities at a broad scale may be preferred.”
MY COMMENT: For the sake of this discussion, I have assumed that “landscape approach” means a broader ecosystem approach.  This would include nesting, perching or denning  habitats.  This would also include foraging or hunting habitats and the travel corridors used to move between nesting/denning habitat and foraging habitats.  For migratory avian species, the North American migratory corridors are of critical importance, and must also be considered in any ecosystem approach.
The Discussion Question in the Area of Focus 1 Landscape Approaches section asks:
“In what circumstances would a more strategic approach support a proposed activity while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk? (e.g., by using a landscape approach instead of a case-by-case approach, which tends to be species and/or site-specific.)”
MY COMMENTS ON THE ABOVE DISCUSSION QUESTION:
Both approaches have merit, and could be used in combination.  The chosen approach depends on the species and the level of risk faced by that species.
For critically endangered mammal or avian species, or a species in danger of extirpation, the best approach would be a case-by-case approach with site-specific habitat conservation in addition to protection and monitoring of individual population groups.
For critically endangered plant species, the best approach would be site-specific habitat conservation combined with an ecosystem approach.
For critically endangered invertebrate species, the best approach would be site-specific habitat conservation.
For threatened or at-risk animal or plant species, the best approach would be an ecosystem protection.
If a species is at risk due to fragmentation of habitat, then an ecosystem approach, with consideration of establishing and protecting travel corridors would be the best approach.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THE LANDSCAPE OR ECOSYSTEM APPROACH:
One area of the ecosystem that has been ignored  by project proponents and the MNRF are the shorelines of the Great Lakes.
A report by the US Fish & Wildlife Service “Great Lakes Avian Radar Technical Report Niagara, Genesee, Wayne and Jefferson Counties, New York”, studied avian activity along the south shore of Lake Erie using radar.
https://digitalmedia.fws.gov/digital/collection/document/id/2128/
The study, conducted in 2013 and released in July 2016, monitored four sites using radar along the southern shore of Lake Ontario, scanning 24 hours a day in vertical and horizontal planes to capture movement. At all sites, the radar recorded high levels of bird and bat activity in or near the “rotor-swept zone” that wind turbines would occupy if built along the lakeshore. Activity was especially high at night, a finding that largely invalidates the use of daytime visual surveys often used by wind-energy developers to assess risks to birds.
AREA OF FOCUS 2 – LISTING PROCESS AND PROTECTIONS FOR SPECIES AT RISK
The Discussion Paper states:
“The Endangered Species Act provides automatic species and habitat protections for species that are listed as endangered or threatened.”
MY COMMENTS:  This protection exists only on paper.  As noted in Chapter 7 of the 2017 ECO report, “Getting Approvals Wrong: The MNRF’s Risk-Based Approach to Protecting Species at Risk”
http://docs.assets.eco.on.ca/reports/environmental-protection/2017/Good…
“Authorizations to harm species have increased dramatically since the introduction of the permit-by-rule.”
The ECO report goes on to say:
“In the permit-by-rule system, the MNRF abandoned the essential “overall benefit” safeguard for almost all species at risk and many of the major activities that harm them. While a few of the species-specific exemptions include actions that could potentially benefit the species (e.g., replacing damaged or destroyed habitat with a greater area of suitable new habitat), most exemptions only require the proponent to minimize the predictable adverse effects of their activities – likely leaving the species in a worse state than before. The sweeping scope of the exemptions created by the MNRF in 2013 is also cause for concern. “
MNRF RESPONSE TO THE 2017 ECO REPORT
The MNRF responses to the ECO comments and recommendations contained vague rationalizations for their behaviour.
For example:
“The ESA acknowledges that impacts cannot always be strictly avoided and includes flexibility mechanisms to authorize activities that would otherwise contravene the Act, provided all of the legal requirements can be met (e.g., providing an overall benefit to the species). This means the ESA protects species at risk and their habitat while continuing to support social and economic activities undertaken by the people and businesses of Ontario.”
This MNRF statement did not speak to the ECO’s comment that “providing a net benefit to the species” is rarely included in the “legal requirements”:
The ECO report stated: “The data provided by the ministry indicates that few activities now are proceeding under the overall benefit approach – the vast majority of activities are proceeding under exemptions that only ask proponents to minimize harm.”
Conforming to “legal requirements” is no guarantee that endangered species will receive any protection if exemptions to those protection requirements are routinely included in permits;  and if protection requirements are included,  they are not monitored or enforced.
AREA OF FOCUS 3 – SPECIES RECOVERY POLICIES AND HABITAT REGULATIONS
The Discussion Paper states:
“A Government Response Statement outlines the actions the government intends to take or support to help recover each species that is endangered or threatened (i.e. it is a species-specific policy). The Endangered Species Act requires that a Government Response Statement be published within nine months after a recovery strategy is prepared. The response statement is based on advice provided in the recovery strategy, social and economic factors, and input from stakeholders, other jurisdictions, Indigenous peoples and the public.”
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS for area of focus 3:
1) “In what circumstances would a species and/or Ontarians benefit from additional time for the development of the Government Response Statement?”
MY COMMENT:  If a time frame of nine months came out of consultations with numerous stakeholders, perhaps a more appropriate question would be to ask is “what is needed for a Government Response Statement to be completed on time?”
2)  “In what circumstances would a longer timeline improve the merit and relevance of conducting a review of progress towards protection and recovery?”
MY COMMENTt:  If a proponent has committed to a strategy of providing a net benefit to a species, a longer timeline may be needed to monitor the effect.
For example: a new grassland created as nesting habitat for species such as the Bobolink or Eastern Meadowlark, will take up to 5 years to mature. The success of such a strategy would require monitoring for several breeding seasons after the grassland has matured.
3)  “In what circumstances is the development of a habitat regulation warranted, or not warranted?”
MY COMMENT:  It should be made abundantly clear to all proponents that destruction of any habitat that is host to an endangered or threatened species, MUST be accompanied by a commensurate development or increase in the same type of habitat.
AREA OF FOCUS 4 – AUTHORIZATION PROCESSES
This section in the Discussion Paper states:
“The Endangered Species Act includes prohibitions against the harm, harassment or killing of species listed as endangered or threatened and prohibits the damage or destruction of their habitat. Under the Act, the government can issue different types of permits or other authorizations for activities that would otherwise not be allowed.”
…and…
“Overall benefit permit, s.17(2)(c): An overall benefit permit may be issued for an activity that would have an adverse effect on species at risk or their habitat, as long as an overall benefit is provided to the species in Ontario through conditions that contribute to improving the circumstances for the species.”
MY COMMENT:
Prohibitions against harm, harassment or killing of endangered or threatened species are of no help if the MNRF freely and repeatedly awards permits that allow activities that will cause overall harm to a species.
The ECO’s 2017 report contains these statements:
“In the permit-by-rule system, the MNRF abandoned the essential “overall benefit” safeguard for almost all species at risk and many of the major activities that harm them. While a few of the species-specific exemptions include actions that could potentially benefit the species (e.g., replacing damaged or destroyed habitat with a greater area of suitable new habitat), MOST EXEMPTIONS ONLY REQUIRE THE PROPONENT TO MINIMIZE THE PREDICTABLE ADVERSE EFFECTS (capital font is my emphasis) of their activities – likely leaving the species in a worse state than before. The sweeping scope of the exemptions created by the MNRF in 2013 is also cause for concern.”
….and…
“The MNRF has utterly failed to implement the law effectively. The massive shift from overall benefit to minimizing harm – a much lower standard of protection – now authorizes harm to most species at risk across Ontario. Meanwhile, the MNRF relies on blind faith and on public complaints instead of an effective compliance and enforcement strategy. It makes no attempt to ensure routine compliance, to prevent cumulative impacts, or to monitor the effect of its permit-by-rule system on species at risk.”
…and…
“This is particularly troubling because the MNRF is not tracking the cumulative impact of harmful activities on species. In April 2017, the ECO asked ministry staff whether the MNRF considers cumulative effects in its approvals process or under permit-by-rule, and whether it has conducted a cumulative effects analysis for the ESA. The ministry stated that it does not consider cumulative effects and has not undertaken any such analysis. THIS POTENTIALLY PUTS MANY SPECIES IN A ""DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS"" SITUATION THAT COULD CAUSE IRREPARABLE HARM, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE MNRF DOES NOT DENY ESA AUTHORIZATIONS"" (capital font is my emphasis)
There are 74 wind projects, 15 bioenergy projects, and 143 solar projects in the province, according to the Ontario government’s Renewable Energy projects listing:
https://www.ontario.ca/page/renewable-energy-projects-listing
In numerous Environmental Review Tribunal hearings, the proponents’ consultants have stated that the predicted mortality rates of bats, song birds, raptors and other endangered or threatened species, from their client’s individual project are insignificant in relation to the overall population.  What the proponents, their consultants, and the Ministry directors have ignored, and the ECO has highlighted, is that the cumulative effect from multiple wind energy projects has never been taken into consideration.  Hence the ""death by a thousand cuts"" comment.
The Environmental Commissioner of Ontario made several recommendations that would improve the protection for species in the ESA in the 2017 ECO report; those recommendations should be reviewed and given serious consideration.
MY RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Amend the Endangered Species Act so that the MNRF is required to post instrument proposals for all ESA permits on the Environmental Registry for full public notice and comment.
2. Amend the Endangered Species Act so that all interested parties are given sufficient notice and a right of appeal for permits.
3. Amend the Endangered Species Act so that  ALL ESA permits MUST include mitigation strategies to provide an overall net benefit to any endangered or threatened species.  The “we will kill less of them” approach that has been allowed by the MNRF, should not be considered sufficient reason for a permit.
4. Amend the Endangered Species Act so that enforcement officers in the MNRF and MECP are given the mandate and the authority, as well as the required resources, to conduct inspections of registered activities to ensure compliance with any permit or authorization conditions.
5. Amend the Endangered Species Act so that the MNRF is required to determine the effect of individual authorizations, as well as the cumulative effects of multiple authorizations on species-at-risk or endangered species, and publicly report on the results.
6. Amend the Endangered Species Act so that the effectiveness of any mitigation strategies are verified by MNRF or MECP field inspections and not be left to the discretion of the project proponents.
7. Amend the Endangered Species Act so that Ecosystem strategies to protect endangered species are implemented where appropriate.  This should include particular emphasis on providing a buffer zone with no new energy projects along the major avian migration corridors along the eastern end of Lake Ontario, the Pelee and Long Point peninsulas,  and along the shorelines of the Great Lakes, and Georgian Bay.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. We look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA); either through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, we must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is our understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. It is our expectation that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further, we remain extremely concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic
analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with us well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.
We would be happy to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the best path forward to ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk while keeping people in this province working.

Dear Sir/Madam,
RE: ERO #013-4143 Review of the Endangered Species Act, 2007
On behalf of Ontario Nature, the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence and the undersigned organizations, we offer our comments and recommendations below on the review of the Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA).
We note, with deep concern, that environmental deregulation – making it easier for industry and development proponents to proceed with activities that harm species at risk and their habitats – appears to be the overall focus and intent of the options put forward for consideration. Reassuring statements that the review is intended to “improve protections,” “improve effectiveness” and provide “stringent protections” (p. 2) are misleading, in light of the actual proposed changes that MECP is inviting the public to consider. These include options that would undermine the very cornerstones of the law: science-based listing (including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge), mandatory habitat protection, and legislated timelines for planning and reporting.
Allegedly responding to undocumented and unsubstantiated criticisms that the ESA is administratively burdensome and creates “barriers to economic development,” MECP presents options for legislative reform that are contrary to the very purpose and intent of the ESA, which is to protect and recover species at risk. Proposals to “increase efficiencies” and “streamline approvals” consist of simplifying requirements for industry permits and exemptions to undertake harmful activities, extending or removing legislated timelines for planning and reporting, and weakening automatic protections for species-at-risk and their habitats. They have nothing to do with advancing species recovery, and everything to do with allowing economic development to proceed at the fatal expense of Ontario’s most vulnerable plants and animals.
For the most part, the challenges outlined in the discussion paper are the result of poor implementation of the ESA, not the law itself. Unreasonable delays in processing permits, a common complaint of industry, would be one example of an issue to be addressed through improved implementation. In her 2017 environmental protection report, the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario provided a detailed analysis of the government’s implementation of the ESA and concluded that “MNRF has utterly failed to implement the law effectively” (p. 248). If MECP, as the new ministry in charge, is serious about improving outcomes for species at risk, it needs to invest in and improve ESA implementation, not weaken the law. It must put the protection and recovery of species at risk front and centre while administering the ESA.
Focus 1: Landscape approaches
A “landscape approach” to species at risk recovery is an alluring buzzword, but in the discussion paper MECP explains neither the concept nor the tools that could be used to implement it. In its description of challenges, nevertheless, the ministry indicates that it is contemplating a landscape approach that would enable planning and authorizations of harmful activities at a broad scale: “For species that depend on habitat across wide ranges, a landscape approach that enables planning and authorizing activities at a broad scale may be preferred” (p. 3).
From a planning perspective, no change to the law is needed to accommodate a landscape approach. The ESA (sec. 13, 14) already provides for an ecosystem approach to planning, including the preparation of recovery strategies for multiple species at once:
Ecosystem approach
13. A recovery strategy or management plan may be prepared under section 11 or 12 using an ecosystem approach.
Recovery strategies and management plans for more than one species
14. A recovery strategy or management plan may be prepared under section 11 or 12 for more than one species, whether or not the species are part of the same ecosystem.
There is no legal barrier to advancing a landscape approach to the recovery of species at risk or to considering the needs of multiple species at once. From a planning perspective, landscape approaches are an implementation issue only.
The fine scale species-specific approach to status assessments, listings and protections is critical to robust planning and recovery efforts and must not be abandoned. Landscape approaches must build on and complement these species-specific approaches, not replace them. As already provided for in sections 13 and 14, landscape and multi-species approaches may be used for recovery planning. Section 13 could be used, for example, for species that are wide-ranging or vulnerable to cumulative effects. A case in point is the boreal caribou, and in fact, the need for a landscape approach for that species is recognized in Ontario’s Caribou Conservation Plan (2009). Even though the plan sets the stage for a landscape approach, however, it has yet to be implemented – a failure of the government’s implementation of the law, not of the law itself. As for habitats that harbour multiple listed species, section 14 already provides for a multi-species approach.
Recommendation 1: Do not amend the ESA to accommodate landscape approaches to planning, as these are already adequately enabled in sections 13 and 14. When implementing a landscape approach, use it to build on and complement the species-specific requirements set out in the ESA.
With regard to “authorizing activities at a broad scale,” which refers presumably to authorizing harmful activities otherwise prohibited under the ESA, such an approach is inappropriate for endangered and threatened species. A landscape approach to authorizations doesn’t lend itself to addressing site-specific or species-specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril. Moreover, this approach has already been tested under the ESA, and has failed.  The sweeping regulatory exemptions provided in 2013 to forestry, mining, hydro, infrastructure development and other proponents of harmful activities provide a telling example of the implications of broad authorizations and clearly illustrates the risks inherent in this approach. According to the 2017 report of the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, the 2013 ESA exemptions have resulted in many more harmful activities going forward and much less protection being provided for at-risk species, all with reduced government authority and oversight (pp. 227 – 242). There is no routine auditing of compliance (p. 238), no effectiveness monitoring (p. 240), and no public access to information unless it is obtained through a freedom-of-information request: “The public is being kept in the dark on what activities are harming species at risk, and where” (p. 242). In other words, this experiment with broad authorizations has drastically reduced transparency, public accountability and protections for species at risk and their habitats. It is not an option that should be explored further. On the contrary, to truly improve protections for species at risk, the 2013 exemptions should be repealed (see Recommendation 10).
Recommendation 2: Do not amend the ESA to authorize harmful activities at a broad scale. Authorizations for harmful activities must address site-specific and species-specific concerns.
Focus 2: Listing process and protections
Science-based listing of species at risk by COSSARO (sec. 3 – 8) and automatic protections of listed species and their habitats (sec. 9, 10) are cornerstones of the ESA and must remain intact. The challenges described in the discussion paper are implementation issues, not problems with the law itself.
No amendments to the ESA are needed to address concerns about notification of new species listings. This is an implementation issue which should be addressed through better communications. In its listing process, COSSARO is required to consider species listed by the federal Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (sec. 4(2)a), and thus the listing of a species should come as no surprise to the government or to industry/development proponents. There are years of notice embedded in this process, from the release of COSEWIC status reports to the listing under the ESA.
No amendments to the ESA are needed to review a COSSARO decision if warranted. The ESA already allows the Minister to request a review of a COSSARO decision if “credible scientific information” indicates the listing is not appropriate (sec. 8(2)):
Reconsideration
(2) If a species is listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List and the Minister is of the opinion that credible scientific information indicates that the classification on the List is not appropriate, the Minister may require COSSARO to reconsider the classification and, not later than the date specified by the Minister, to submit a report to the Minister under section 6 indicating whether COSSARO confirms the classification or reclassifies the species.
There should be no changes to the ESA regarding the listing process or the role of COSSARO. The law sets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of “the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge” (sec. 5(3)). Tampering with COSSARO decisions will politicize the process and delay or even prevent recovery efforts.
We already have experience in Ontario with a political listing process under the previous Endangered Species Act. As a result, many endangered species were never listed for protection under the law. Indeed, that failure was one of the main reasons why the old law was reviewed and science-based listing was adopted in 2007. Moreover, a return to a political listing process would reduce certainty and decrease the efficiency of the system, given controversies that would arise over each species being considered for listing.
Recommendation 3: Do not amend the ESA with respect to the listing process or the role of COSSARO. The current ESA provisions provide a high level of credibility, accountability and certainty. The challenges described can and should be addressed through better implementation.
We are deeply concerned by the indication that MECP is considering alternatives to automatic species and habitat protections, including removing or delaying these protections at the discretion of the Minister. This is clearly a matter of letting short-sighted economic or political interests override the protection and recovery of species at risk. Alternatives to automatic protection will politicize decisions, undermine intended safeguards, and expose highly vulnerable species to additional risks – all for no good reason. The ESA already provides ample flexibility to consider socio-economic issues and to accommodate proponents of harmful activities through permits and exemptions (sec. 17, 18, etc.). Credibility, transparency and certainty require protections that are not subject to political whims or the influence of powerful industrial interests.
Recommendation 4: Retain automatic protections for threatened and endangered species. The ESA provides more than enough flexibility for proponents of harmful activities through permits and exemptions.
Focus 3: Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
The challenges described in this section focus primarily on timelines, yet MECP provides no analysis of why timelines are not being met nor of the potential consequences of lengthened timelines to the species themselves. Again, these challenges are first and foremost implementation issues and do not require legislative changes.
The existing legislated nine-month time limit to produce Government Response Statements (GRS) is reasonable, especially considering the extensive research and consultation that occurs earlier during the development of Recovery Strategies. This earlier research and consultation typically bring to the fore not only science-based considerations, but also socio-economic considerations; consequently, the government would not be caught unaware when the Recovery Strategy is released and could begin preparing the GRS ahead of time.
The GRS is a statement of the government’s intentions. It can and should stipulate the government’s plans and commitments for actions that it will undertake or support. The government’s intentions regarding further consultation with Indigenous peoples, further research on complex issues, and further engagement with stakeholders can all be set out in the GRS, with precise timelines. Nine months is ample time to prepare such a statement of the government’s intent.
Failure to meet the legislated nine-month deadline is an implementation issue. Adequate government investment in staffing and consultation are needed to meet deadlines. In many cases, it is also a political issue – and depends on the government’s willingness to accept the implications of the Recovery Strategy regarding what is needed for the species. The only solution in such cases is adequate political will.
Recommendation 5: Retain the legal requirement to produce Government Response Statements within nine months of listing (sec. 11(8)). Ensure adequate government investment in staffing and consultation to meet this legislated deadline.
The requirement to report on progress towards protecting and recovering a species within five years of the release of the GRS is reasonable and should not be changed. Reporting ensures transparency and accountability. It also provides an impetus for action, ensuring that effectiveness is assessed, and contributes to institutional learning and adaptive management.
Recommendation 6: Retain the requirement to report on progress within five years of the GRS.
Habitat regulations, which describe specific boundaries of features or areas deemed to be habitat for a threatened or endangered species, provide enhanced certainty and clarity for implementing and enforcing the ESA, particularly the prohibition against damaging or destroying habitat (sec. 10). Habitat regulations also provide an opportunity to protect areas where a species “used to live or is believed to be capable of living” (sec. 55(3)b), presenting a significant opportunity for protection and recovery efforts to extend beyond places where species at risk currently persist and to recover historic habitat. For these reasons, there should be no changes to the legal provisions regarding habitat regulations.
Further, the ESA already allows the Minister to delay the development of a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)b) or to not proceed with a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)c). No change to the law is needed.
Recommendation 7: Do not amend the ESA provisions regarding habitat regulations. The law already provides the Minister the power to delay or not proceed with a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)c).
Focus 4: Authorization Processes
There are already many flexibility mechanisms in the ESA to allow harmful activities to proceed, as described in the discussion paper (p. 6). More are not needed. The options under consideration reflect a desire to make it easier for industry and development proponents to proceed with activities that harm at-risk plants or animals and damage or destroy their habitat. The suggested options are inconsistent with the purpose of the ESA, which is to protect and recover species at risk. Protection and recovery must be the priority.
Wherever and whenever harmful activities are allowed to proceed, authorizations should be premised on providing an overall, on-the-ground benefit to the species affected. Yes, authorization processes may result in delays; but this is the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act. Enabling economic development is NOT the purpose of the act, and so-called routine activities can have devastating cumulative impacts – aptly described as “death by a thousand cuts.”
Proponents of harmful activities should NOT be allowed to simply pay into a conservation fund rather than meet current requirements to provide an on-the-ground, overall benefit to species that they negatively impact. Habitat loss and degradation are by far the most significant drivers of species decline, underlining the importance of on-the-ground reparation for authorized damage or destruction. A fee-in-lieu fund is an easy way out for proponents of harmful activities that reduces transparency and accountability. And of course, the easier it is to obtain an authorization for harmful activities, the more likely they are to occur. This would run contrary to the stated purpose of the review, which is to enable positive outcomes for species.
Recommendation 8: Do not create a fee-in-lieu conservation fund that will make it easier for industry/development proponents to harm species at risk and damage or destroy their habitats. Continue to require an on-the-ground overall benefit to species negatively affected.
Section 17(2)d permits are intended to be available only for projects that “result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario” and that will not “jeopardize the survival or recovery of the species in Ontario.” These are appropriate conditions and ensure that such permits are issued only an exceptional basis. Requirements for 17(2)d permits should not be simplified.
Recommendation 9: Make no changes to requirements for sec. 17(2)d permits. These permits should only be available for projects that “result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario” and that will not “jeopardize the survival or recovery of the species in Ontario,” as currently required.
We strongly oppose the option of simplifying requirements for exemptions through regulation. As described above, the long list of regulatory exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining, aggregate extraction, infrastructure development, wind facilities and more, approved by Cabinet in 2013, have significantly undermined not only protections for species at risk and their habitats but also transparency and public accountability. According to the Environmental Commissioner, ESA authorizations have “drastically increased” since the 2013 exemptions were put in place (2017, p. 227). Exemptions have become the primary means for allowing harmful activities to proceed. As of October 11, 2017, there had been 2,065 registrations for exemptions and about 85 percent of these were for activities that violate ESA protections for species at risk and their habitats.  These exemptions already allow industry/development proponents to proceed without providing an overall benefit to affected species, without government approval and without public scrutiny. What more do proponents want - carte blanche to proceed without any regard for species at risk? If the MECP truly intends to improve protections for species at risk, it should begin by repealing the 2013 exemptions.
Recommendation 10: Repeal the sweeping 2013 regulatory exemptions for harmful industrial/development activities.
No amendment to the law is needed for the purpose of “meeting Endangered Species Act requirements in other approval processes” (p. 7). Section 18 of the ESA already provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. The issue is implementation and ensuring that the high standards of the ESA, including the achievement of overall benefit to species affected by harmful activities, are upheld if a section 18 authorization is granted. For instance, discussions about how to harmonize the Crown Forest Sustainability Act, 1994 with the ESA have been going on for years, but to no avail. The forestry industry has been unwilling to meet the high standards of the ESA, including the requirement to provide an overall benefit where species at risk and their habitats are negatively impacted by forestry activities. Rather than insisting on a solution that upholds the standards of the ESA, the government has so far ceded to industry demands, exempting forestry from ESA requirements essentially since the act came into force in 2008.
Recommendation 11: Do not amend the ESA to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. There is no need. Use section 18 authorizations, which exist for this purpose. In so doing, retain the requirement to provide an overall benefit to species negatively affected by authorized activities.
Summary remarks
When the ESA was taken out of the hands of MNRF and reassigned to MECP, there was cautious optimism that the new ministry in charge would strike a constructive path forward and prioritize the protection and recovery of Ontario’s most vulnerable plants and animals through its administration of the Act. MECP’s discussion paper suggests, however, that this hope may be ill-founded. Almost all the options put forward for consideration would weaken protections and sacrifice the recovery of species at risk to economic interests. If MECP chooses to compromise the foundations of the ESA – science-based listing, automatic protection of threatened and endangered species and their habitats, and mandatory timelines for planning and reporting – its credibility as the agency responsible for realizing the purpose of the ESA will be shattered.
The challenges that MECP has identified can and should be addressed through improved implementation of the act, not legislative changes. The ESA already accommodates landscape-level planning (sec. 13 and 14); review of COSSARO decisions based on credible science (sec. 8(2)); flexibility for economic activity (sec. 17 and 18); flexibility to delay or not proceed with a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)c); and flexibility to harmonize ESA requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks (sec. 18). No changes to the law are needed for these purposes. Other issues presented, such as inadequate notification of species listings and meeting deadlines for planning and reporting, can be resolved through improved planning, implementation and investment in outreach to stakeholders, program development and staffing.
Rather than reducing its administrative role and weakening its effectiveness through exemptions, the ministry should embrace its role as a defender of the broad public interest in conserving biodiversity and securing a healthy environment for all. Investing in and incentivizing stewardship would offer, for example, a much more positive and promising means of protecting species at risk than finding new, streamlined approaches to allow proponents of harmful activities to damage and destroy the critical habitats of Ontario’s most vulnerable plants and animals.

23506,/comment/23506,"10th Year Review – Ontario Endangered Species Act
The current review of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to improve protections for species at risk, consider modern and innovative approaches to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk, as well as to look for ways to streamline approvals and provide clarity to support economic development. A strengthened and efficient ESA benefits both the City of Toronto and Toronto Water, and complements ongoing policies such as the Biodiversity Strategy for Toronto.
From Toronto Water's perspective, it is quite common for the habitat of threatened and endangered species to also be the same habitat that improves surface water and source water quality, provides filtration of contaminated storm water, offers erosion protection from overland and storm based stream flows, and results in retention of storm water flows.  As such, Toronto Water has the following comments to the proposed 10th Year Review of Ontario's Endanger Species Act: Discussion Paper.
1.   Clarity is needed that if the endangered species are present at a location, that development must be restricted to a certain degree if not completely. From a municipal infrastructure perspective, we are more efficient if planning and construction restrictions are clearly identified upfront prior to the proposed solution being submitted for regulatory review. (Page 3)
2.   Clarity is needed on how delaying a listing of a species is beneficial, for both the species and for development*. The proposed deferral can result in delaying a project or even possibly causing costly stoppage/delay of ongoing work, modification of designs, or complete cancelation of a project that already started. (Page 4)
3.   There are concerns that extending the time limit for the Government Response Statement (GRS) beyond 9 months will delay the protection response to the species as well as impact proposed development* moving forward. There also needs to be a mechanism in place to improve or modify the GRS after submission. (Page 5)
4.   Governments and Agencies (Federal, Provincial, Conservation, etc.) should be exempt from submitting a Letter of Credit as a guaranty of any compensation or habitat works, but the requirement should remain for private entities. For municipalities, this unnecessarily ties up funds that could be better use elsewhere. (Page 7)
* Development refers to potential Toronto Water projects taking place on environmentally sensitive lands.

23508,/comment/23508,"1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

I'm studying evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto. The current extinction rate is 100 to 1000x the normal background rate - this is unprecedented in the history of our planet. We are in the middle of a global emergency, and yet the focus is still on 'economy'?
I don't care if businesses are maximizing their profit, and I believe most Ontario citizens would agree with me there - we don't want irreplaceable biodiversity to take a second-seat to profit that will never 'trickle down' to us.

23511,/comment/23511,"Area of Focus 1: Landscape Approaches
1. Move forward with a permanent section 55(1)(b) regulatory exemption to the forest sector to continue enabling landscape approaches currently being delivered under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA).
2. Working under the section 55 (1)(b) regulation, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) must develop workable species at risk policy delivered under the CFSA that contributes to working landscapes and functioning ecosystems while incorporating socio-economic impact analysis, jointly, with practitioners, affected stakeholders, and Indigenous communities.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
3. Overhaul the membership of COSSARO to reflect more generalist professionals and Indigenous communities rather than academics with expertise in a very limited field of study. Known experts in a particular species, including local MNRF biologists and local RPFs should be invited to participate in the deliberation of species being evaluated by COSSARO at least 12 months before the committee meets to evaluate the species’ status.
4. Develop a clear process for using the “data deficient” category, particularly for species with a wide distribution and lack of data.
5. COSSARO should consider the use of regional sub-populations to account for differences in status across the province, risk to the species and the relative risk of human activities. Populations of species at the normal edge of their ranges in Ontario, outside of their core range, should be evaluated with due consideration of their global population.
6. Add an additional layer of accountability by having the responsible minister weigh scientific evidence provided by COSSARO with the socio-economic impacts before a species is automatically listed and protected.
7. Reassessment of species at risk should be considered when credible evidence has been presented to the responsible ministry beyond what is currently permitted within the ESA.
8. Enable individuals and organizations to report on SAR sightings without the perceived or real fear of being penalized for doing so.
Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
9. The current 5-year review should go beyond simply listing actions that have taken place. A biological review of the species should be included and feedback into the COSSARO listing process.
10. Habitat renewal should not be considered habitat destruction.
Area of Focus 4: Authorization Processes
11. Remove the July 1st, 2020 expiry found in O. Reg. 242/08 (22.1) to forest operations on Crown land giving the sector and government greater certainty.
12. Replace the term “overall benefit” within sections 17(2)(c), 18(1)(e)(iii)(A), and 18(2)(f)(iii)(A) with “positive outcomes” to species at risk.

1. Landscape Approaches
By protecting Natural Heritage Systems (NHS) and by giving priority to Species at Risk (SAR) within NHS we ensure the long term survival of SAR.
Mapping of NHS is ongoing and understood by planners, conservationists, and large developers. I am not in favour of introducing a new undefined term like “landscape approach”, feeling it is unnecessary and obfuscating.
Wider public knowledge of NHS and the areas concerned should be a Ministry priority. This would give landowners a “heads up” on the possibility of SAR and development conflicts.
Poster sized maps of regional NHS should be distributed to Municipal offices and Schools. The map’s date should be prominent.
I am concerned that protection and mapping of NHS in eco regions of the Canadian Shield is not mentioned in the Provincial Policy Statement.
2. Listing process
I believe COSSARO works well. Once a species makes the List, there are years before it reaches threatened or endangered status. Plenty of time for developers to anticipate future conflict.
My experience in Kawartha Lakes is that only threatened or endangered species trigger protection protocols by Planners or the MNRF.

23514,/comment/23514,"Re: EBR 013-4143
Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act
We support the continuation of a scientific-based approach to the listing of species at risk (SAR) without the addition of any Ministerial discretion.  A scientific approach ensures that politics and special interests will not weaken the protections needed for these species.
The current time limit of nine months to develop a Government Response Statement is not too short; in fact, the short time frame reflects the need for the government to act quickly to protect any SAR.  The need for “additional engagement” or additional time is not a reflection of the process being too quick, but of a lack of resources and manpower in the responsible Ministries.  Instead, funding to MNRF and MECP should be increased to the levels necessary to properly operate and engage stakeholders to develop the Government Response Statement in the allotted time.
We also support the requirement that any harmful activities are mitigated though the implementation of an overall benefit plan, and not banking on the contribution of cash for possible compensation in the future.  Delays in implementation are necessary to ensure harmful impacts to SAR are reduced or removed.  We do agree that there is a problem with the process that needs to be corrected.  As mentioned in the 2017 Environmental Commissioner of Ontario report, “the MNRF has never denied a permit to harm a threatened or endangered species”.  It would be naïve to believe that none of those activities caused any permanent harm to SAR or their habitats, or that there are sufficient resources in the MNRF, now MECP, to properly monitor or enforce these activities.  Further, any exemptions for industries such as forestry, mining, or hydro should be repealed as these industries can impact large areas of SAR habitat, and quickly undermine any work being done to protect these species.

23515,/comment/23515,"I believe the Endangered Species Act should maintain its science-based listing process and not allow possibility of minister discretion at listing. This is one of main issues of fed. Species At Risk Act (SARA). Maintain mandatory habitat protection (no minister discretion). Delaying or removing habitat protection will allow irreparable damage to species that need protection ASAP, especially those with long generation times likes turtles and bats. Maintain on-the-ground overall benefit requirements for affected species, instead of allowing payment into general ""conservation fund"". Paying into this type of fund will redirect effort away from most vulnerable species and habitats. These animals need our help and have no one else to speak up for them. If we don't take action to protect vulnerable wildlife now, our children will never be able to experience them and we have already seen this with the disappearance of Canadian Caribou. Please do not allow these changes to go through just so the big businesses can make their money and ruin the landscapes we know and love in Ontario.

23517,/comment/23517,"I oppose any changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act which jeopardize protections for species to allow human development or business benefits.  Many such species have very specific habitat requirements and limited ranges, and even moderate habitat loss in the wrong place can result in severe impact for these species.  I'm very concerned at the language surrounding ""streamlining"" applications for exceptions to the Act, and the seeming belief that concessions should be made for development if at all possible.
Any environmental restrictions on development and business do have to consider a need to support the province's economy.  However, the issue is not equally two-sided, because economic development can and will be adjusted to adhere to environmental regulations.  But once sensitive habitats are damaged or destroyed to make way for human activities, it is very hard or impossible for them to recover.
The global species extinction rate is already many-fold higher than it should be as a result of human activities.  Ontario should be trying to move in the opposite direction, not exacerbating this.

I look forward in seeing improvements to the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to the forestry sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, below are other requirements that should be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is my understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. I expect that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.

For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with impacted stakeholders and First Nations well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.

My comment is that in many cases the current regulations serve to frustrate the implementation of Good Forestry Practices as prescribed by member of the Ontario Professional Foresters Association. The prescriptions are designed to maintain or improve forest habitat conditions and pose no risk to the future of SAR in the vast majority of cases. Many of the things that threaten SAR, such as white nose fungus in the case of bats, have nothing to do with responsible forest management. Targeting forestry operations for red tape on SAR does nothing to protect species at risk, and causes costly delays and in some cases prevents the implementation of Good Forestry Practices.

When that is the case, money always wins over environment protection, and that is unacceptable.

23535,/comment/23535,"It is critical that the management of the Ontario forestry industry remain under the Crown Sustainability Act as it is a proven and effective framework to balance the Environmental, Social and Economic objectives of forest management activities. As a forest management planner, I am committed to the achievement of this balance. Managing forests under the Endangered Species Act loses this balance as it only considers the environmental perspective pertaining to species at risk and their habitat. Ontario's wood supply would be critically reduced, triggering job loss with devastating effect on the economic and social dynamics of Northern Ontario cities, towns and Indigenous communities. The forest industry is important not just to Northern Ontario but is a vital part of the entire province's economy. Within my own household, potentially two jobs would be lost.
I appeal to the Ontario government to keep a balanced perspective between their own initiatives to promote forest industry development (check Ontario.ca website) and the constant and often overstated pressures of environmental groups in Ontario. I support a permanent ESA Section 55 regulatory exemption for the forest sector and the continued management for at-risk species through the CFSA, in balance with other social, economic and environmental objectives. Management under the CFSA ensures that species prescriptions are developed with input from forest practitioners, affected stakeholders and rights holders, to ensure they are effective.

23536,/comment/23536,"Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the anticipated review of the ESA, 2007.  If this government is interested in transparency, it would be helpful if you had a name and an identity, as I find writing to an abstract entity discouraging.
Since the Act came into effect, it has been modified through further regulation, including the 2013 changes that weakened the protection afforded by the ESA from “overall benefit” to Species at Risk.  Registration of activities with potential adverse effects to SAR was developed in order to increase efficiencies and streamline the process.  It is my understanding that this approach has been effective, but the critical flaw is the lack of follow-through by the Ontario government to provide analysis with respect to the efficacy of the Act and its regulations to indeed “Enable positive outcomes for species at risk” (MECP 2019)
The Discussion Paper states that “Since coming into effect, the Act has been criticized for being ineffective in its aim to protect and recover species at risk, for being unclear, administratively burdensome, time consuming and costly for applicants, and for creating barriers to economic development.”  Comments are requested under four categories:
1. Landscape Approaches
2. Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
3. Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
4. Authorization Processes
…with the objective “to improve protections for species at risk, consider modern and innovative approaches to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk, as well as to look for ways to streamline approvals and provide clarity to support economic development.”
With respect, I suspect that this government is more focused on “streamline approvals and … support economic development” than it is on protection of SAR and their habitats.
I think that it is imperative that natural capital must be a part of the economic analysis; not an alternative to it.  Long term economic performance depends on preservation of natural heritage features and functions, included Species at Risk, that collectively provide priceless benefits to humans.  The Gross National Product is not an indicator of economy: it is only an indicator of trade and it does not factor in natural capital: it overestimates profits because it doesn’t take into account the consequences to natural heritage (air, water, soil, habitat and human well being).  Policy and public concern is geared to what you can measure (Paul Martin 2011).   If this discussion paper seeks to “support economic development”, then it is imperative that we find ways to measure natural capital as part of the balance sheet.  Acts such as the Endangered Species Act is a stop gap measure until we elevate our natural capital to a position of equal importance with all other activities that we manage, value and in which we invest.
Implementation, not Legislation
The challenges and discussion questions in the Review are weighted toward problems with implementation of the ESA; not the Act itself.  Sufficient protections are provided in the Act to improve protections for species at risk and to consider modern and innovative approaches to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk.  In my experience, what is needed is improved planning, implementation and investment in outreach and staffing including training.  Delays are often associated with staff who are dealing with SAR ill prepared to provide informed comment and therefore defer rather than move forward on an application.
The focus of the review should be on the welfare of the species;   not changes to the responsibility of those who are engaging in activities with potential to create negative outcomes.  The Act has already been “streamlined”, but the reciprocal commitment of the provincial government to monitor and ensure compliance has not materialized.  I see this Review as another opportunity to weaken protection for species, whether individually or collectively using a landscape approach already provided for in the Act, without balanced actions to ensure that the intended benefits accrue to the species.
It is true that we have a complex framework of environmental legislation but there is nothing with the possible exception of protection for provincially significant wetlands that provides the necessity to achieve positive outcomes for Species at Risk.  The fault lies with the inability of the province to identify meaningful recovery plans and options, to facilitate authorizations that link science to planning within the Ontario Government, and to provide the necessary monitoring both for implementation and compliance, with analysis and communication of results to the professionals who are involved with working within the Act.
Specifically:
1.	Landscape approach
The discussion paper does not provide any detail with respect to what this means.  In my experience, it means that large scale species specific approaches are ignored in favour of poorly defined small scale landscape approaches within which the detail is lost.  Landscape approaches are complex and affect many more stakeholders than the surgical SAR approach.  The ESA already allows for landscape approaches, so what is it that is different about the approach that your government is contemplating, that would trigger a need for a change in the Act?
Landscape approaches are not a new concept from an ecological perspective as the recovery plan for Woodland Caribou demonstrates.  They must be founded in protection of all the pieces as Aldo Leopold has said, “To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.” (1972). Landscapes cannot replace a species specific approach; the species calibrate the landscape scale initiatives.  What is needed is better funding for the science, better training for biologists (both external and MNRF/MECP and better integration and communication among ministries and departments within.
2.	Listing Processes and Protections
The current notification for the listing process is automatic and anyone can participate.  The process always anticipates species to be considered in the future and they are included in good environmental impact studies to avoid unnecessary delay if the species should be uplisted to a protection status (SAR) during the approval process.
Automatic listing is efficient (less costly) and focuses efforts on recovery where it belongs.
Political listing introduces costly delay; introduces politicizing.  Listing should be science based and transparent, not a political process (does this conjure up the SNC Lavalin case?).  Ministerial discretion introduces a great deal of uncertainty;  it is not transparent, more expensive and difficult to communicate.
COSSARO employs an open process and anyone can attend.  Investment in increased publicity and transparency would be welcome and does not require a change in the Act.  The process is already well balanced between public oversight and “in camera” decisions to prevent undue pressure on the committee…it works well.  Consideration of “emerging science or conflicting information” is what COSSARO does and invites presentations to ensure the process is as comprehensive as possible.
In the interests of promoting communication within the government, MNRF biologists should be permitted to sit on COSSARO; include indigenous knowledge and require those who are writing protocols at the district level to communicate and discuss outcomes from the science-based staff.
3.  Recovery process and habitat
Aside from the inability of MNRF/MECP to meet legislated timelines the Act would appear to be working.  Removing the timeliness of the recovery process will undermine its effectiveness, and ignores the fact that any species on the Species at Risk List is already under serious threat, and timelines should be accelerated; not delayed.
If the Government Response Statement would benefit from additional time, then the need for it should be documents, and a revised statement should be provided.  Each process should be an open file continually updated with emerging science and monitoring data to allow for adaptive approaches.
The concept that habitat regulations should be replaced by general habitat descriptions has not been tested.  No analysis regarding effectiveness of either approach has been provided.
4.	Authorization Processes
Delays in authorizations in my experience have been related to staff ill-equipped to advise on permitting.  More staff and better trained staff are required.  The concept of divorcing the permitting staff from those familiar with the science is crippling to the processing of applications.
Applications currently are being processed for multiple species, so without more information, I have not idea why this is a challenge.
Authorization is receiving undue attention.  The main emphasis should be on habitat protection and recovery.  The government seems intent on implementing the ESA without economic consequences however there will be cases where this is not possible.  Our processes need to mature to the point where we recognize that there are cases where natural capital is more important than the alternative.
Reg 242/08 (2013) reduced the threshold for performance from “overall benefit” to the species.   The registration approach increased processing of applications, but there is a great need for robust inspection, compliance and enforcement systems to ensure follow through.
For some species a habitat banking approach is an intelligent and viable solution to unavoidable impacts.  However, there is a need for stringent guidelines and more investment in staff and training to enable these discussions, focused on landscape solutions with species as indicators.
In terms of process, the existing land use planning legislation clearly was not meeting the needs of SAR.  Although dealing with multiple regulations and policies from a variety of levels of government requires expertise, if addressed early in the project planning process, and integrated studies are undertaken, it does not increase study requirements significantly.  The challenge arises when consideration of SAR is left to the end of the project and the cost of flexibility needed to comply with the Act rises sharply.
Summary:
In order to respond to the discussion in a more meaningful way I would like to know the following:
•	What prior analysis has been undertaken that has identified that the Act needs amending?  What is the source of the “challenges” identified?
•	How well is the Act working for SAR?  What analysis is available that discusses the outcomes of permitting on SAR populations?
•	Is there a link from monitoring data to the members of COSSARO for their consideration in the listing process:  both on and off the list?
•	If requirements are to be simplified, what checks and balances will be added to ensure that the flexibility implied by simplification will be implemented?
•	The broad exemptions like those for the forest industry are ill advised especially as more species are listed with greater potential for the creation of negative impacts.  What evidence to we have that such exemptions are not creating unacceptable impacts to listed species?  What monitoring is available that tracks the potential conflict and evaluates the significance of effects?
And finally, I think that the Endangered Species Act, 2007 is an important piece of environmental legislation in Ontario, and the proposal to change it with so little evidence for the need is alarming.
It is hard to figure out how to put a value on rivers or forests, but the wrong thing to do is give it no value at all (Faisal Moola, Vancouver Sun).
I see more potential to de-value SAR in this Review than I see reason for optimism.  Please prove me wrong.

Response to the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper
City of Brampton Comments
The City of Brampton is generally supportive of the proposals to increase efficiency, streamline
and clarify processes, and maintain effective government oversight, and have some
recommendations in this regard. For example, the Province could approve projects with
potential to impact Endangered Species faster by:
* providing more clarity to proponents regarding compensation requirements, which are
currently difficult to identify at the outset of a project;
* providing Best Management Plans to assist proponents to proceed in a manner that
would avoid the need for permits;
* providing requirements that are commensurate to the impacts of each project, where
currently all undertakings are treated the same, whether they be construction of road or
development of a trail;
* developing a standardized protocol for mitigation strategies on species by species basis
(see commentary under Question 2 below).
* developing publicly accessible, centralized mapping of Endangered Species Habitat.
Additionally, changes to the administration of the Act would greatly assist. For example, there is
currently a long wait time for Provincial issuance of permits, a significant delay in the transition
from General Habitat Protection and Regulated Habitat Protection, and a lack of communication
regarding species being considered for Listing. The implementation of the improvements listed
above would beneficial in terms of protecting species at risk and enhancing efficiency.
The City does not support changes to the Act that would further endanger Species at Risk or
their Habitat by prioritizing development over environmental concerns. The foundation of the
Act is the classification of species by an arm’s length group of experts that makes decisions based
on up-to-date science, and the recognition and protection of these species’ habitat. Weakening
or removing these elements from the statutory regime would, from the City’s perspective, have
irreversible negative impacts on the province.
The City’s responses to the questions posed in the 10th Year Review Discussion Paper are set out
below.
AREA OF FOCUS 1 – LANDSCAPE APPROACHES
Rather than focus on case-by-case and species-specific policy approaches, the Province is
investigating whether taking a landscape approach, “enables planning and authorizing activities
at a broad scale”.
Question 1: In what circumstances would a more strategic approach support a proposed activity
while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk? (e.g., by using a landscape
approach instead of a case-by case approach, which tends to be species and/or site-specific.)
Brampton advises that a landscape approach looking at habitat impact compensation
within a sub-watershed (for aquatic species) and nearby land (for terrestrial species) will
be more strategic. This allows flexibility for habitat compensation while achieving the
same objective and improved outcomes for species at risk.
Question 2: Are there existing tools or processes that support managing for species risk at a
landscape scale that could be recognized under the Endangered Species Act?
The City of Brampton, in partnership with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry
and Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, undertook the development of an
innovative strategy to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and consistency of identifying
Redside Dace-regulated habitat impacts and mitigation projects for development within
Redside Dace regulated habitat. Please refer to the ""Overall Benefit Strategy for Strategic
Planning of Urban Development Projects within Redside Dace-Regulated Habitat"", dated
November 2017.
This approach has been well-received by all stakeholders as it provides an objective,
predictable solution, and Brampton suggests that it be adapted and replicated
throughout the Province for other species and habitats.
AREA OF FOCUS 2 – LISTING PROCESS AND PROTECTIONS FOR
SPECIES AT RISK
The Province has indicated that in its view, there is insufficient notice prior to the automatic
listing a new species on the Species at Risk in Ontario List, and that the automatic listing process
can lead to an increase in costs for business and the public. The Province is also seeking to
increase the transparency around the assessment and classification of species by the COSSARO.
Question 3: What changes would improve the notification process of a new species being listed
on the Species at Risk in Ontario List? (e.g., longer timelines before a species is listed.)
The City of Brampton recommends that new listing on the Species at Risk in Ontario List
include a defined transition period for projects that have received approval under the
Environmental Assessment Act.
The City also recommends that the Ministry consider maintaining a contact list of all
stakeholders within a given area and notify these parties directly about updates to the
List.
Question 4: Should there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat
protections? (e.g., longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove
or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat.)
No. The City is recommending the precautionary principle should apply to any decision
about classifying species as endangered. If it has been demonstrated that a species is
endangered or threatened to the satisfaction of the COSSARO, then it must be
automatically given protection. The COSSARO uses the best and most up-to-date science
to determine that listing a species is warranted, and delaying or even removing
protections would completely undermine the purpose of the Act.
Question 5: In what circumstances would a different approach to automatic species and habitat
protections be appropriate? (e.g., there is significant intersection between a species or its habitat
and human activities, complexity in addressing species threats, or where a species’ habitat is not
limiting.)
None, as noted above the precautionary principle needs to apply when assessing whether
or not to protect a species that the COSSARO has identified as being at risk.
Question 6: How can the process regarding assessment and classification of a species by the
Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario be improved? (e.g., request an additional
review and assessment in cases where there is emerging science or conflicting information.)
The City recommends that the classification of species continue to be based on scientific
evidence, as determined by the COSSARO. Waiting for more evidence prior to adding a
species to the List will put the species at greater risk.
If the option for an additional review/assessment is being considered, then such a review
should not delay the addition of the species to the List or the implementation of habitat
protection. These measures should be in place while the review is carried out. Removal of species from the list should only be contemplated where a blatant error was made, or
where reliable new scientific information becomes available. These decisions should be
made based on a rigorous scientific process, in accordance with the precautionary
principle.
AREA OF FOCUS 3 – SPECIES RECOVERY POLICIES AND
HABITAT REGULATIONS
Under the Act, the Province has one year from the time a species is added to the List
The Review Document states that nine months is not long enough to prepare a Government
Response statement, and that carrying out a progress review within five years is too soon. The
Review Document also indicates that it is not necessary to develop a habitat regulation for each
species because, “general habitat protection applies and can be clarified through the use of
general habitat descriptions.”
Question 7: In what circumstances would a species and/or Ontarians benefit from additional time
for the development of the Government Response Statement? (e.g., enable extending the
timeline for the Government Response Statement when needed, such as when recovery
approaches for a species are complex or when additional engagement is required with businesses,
Indigenous peoples, landowners and conservation groups.)
Maintaining urgency in the protection of endangered species is important, therefore the
City recommends that additional time for Response Statements should only be
considered when there is compelling rationale for a delay as outlined.
Question 8: In what circumstances would a longer timeline improve the merit and relevance of
conducting a review of progress towards protection and recovery? (e.g., for species where
additional data is likely to be made available over a longer timeframe, or where stewardship
actions are likely to be completed over a longer timeframe.)
Again, maintaining urgency in the protection of endangered species is important,
therefore additional time for conducting progress reviews should only be considered
when there is a compelling rationale. Delaying these reviews runs the risk of overlooking
further declines in populations or new risks to habitat, so it is important to conduct
reviews regularly. City’s recommendation is that any change to the standard review time
of five years should be based on up-to-date science, as determined by an objective third
party such as the COSSARO.
Question 9: In what circumstances is the development of a habitat regulation warranted, or not
warranted? (e.g., to improve certainty for businesses and others about the scope of habitat that is
protected.)
The City’s position is that more precise habitat regulations are only warranted in
circumstances where it is demonstrated that additional protection is needed to protect
the species.
AREA OF FOCUS 4 – AUTHORIZATION PROCESSES
The Province has indicated through the Review Document that applicants are seeing delays and
are burdened administratively by the requirements for obtaining authorizations for routine
activities under the Act. It is also stated that the Act duplicates requirements under other
legislation and regulatory frameworks, all of which creates barriers to economic
development. Finally, inconsistent enforcement powers are identified as a concern.
Question 10: What new authorization tools could help businesses achieve benefits for species at
risk? (e.g., in lieu of activity-based requirements enable paying into a conservation fund dedicated
to species at risk conservation, or allow conservation banking to enable addressing requirements
for species at risk prior to activities.)
New authorization tools could help reduce delays in project approvals and species
recovery by funding larger projects with larger benefits. Any such tools, however, must
require resources to be spent within the jurisdiction and/or watershed where the impact
occurs, unless there are compelling ecological reasons for using the resources outside the
jurisdiction and/or watershed. Any decisions in this regard must be made based on
scientific expertise.
Question 11: Are there other approaches to authorizations that could enable applicants to take a
more strategic or collaborative approach to address impacts to species at risk? (e.g., create a new
authorization, such as a conservation agreement.)
In certain circumstances, the City supports the use of alternative authorizations such as
conservation agreements between a government agency and landowner that result in
the permanent protection of a species habitat. The City cautions that these
authorizations must be premised on the demonstration of net ecological benefit to the
species through sound science.
Question 12: What changes to authorization requirements would better enable economic
development while providing positive outcomes and protections for species at risk? (e.g., simplify the requirements for a permit under s. 17(2)d, and exemptions set out by regulation.)
The City of Brampton recommends that the Province consider instituting minimum
response timelines for permit applications, develop standardized compensation protocols
such as the City’s West Humber Strategy for redside dace, and create publicly accessible
guidelines setting out clear criteria for circumstances that do and do not require a
permit.
Question 13: How can the needs of species at risk be met in a way that is more efficient for
activities subject to other legislative or regulatory frameworks? (e.g., better enable meeting
Endangered Species Act requirements in other approval processes.)
The City recommends the Province examine the possibility of integrating the permitting
process under the Act with the Conservation Authorities’ and Department of Oceans and
Fisheries permitting process. This has the potential to increase efficiency and eliminate
duplication, while ensuring that subject matter experts are reviewing applications based
on sound science.
Question 14: In what circumstances would enhanced inspection and compliance powers be
warranted? (e.g., regulations.)
The City takes the position that the existing inspection and compliance powers are
sufficient, but that the Province should direct more resources towards enforcement on
projects which may have a significant impact to endangered species or consider
delegating compliance powers to local Conservation Authorities.

23543,/comment/23543,"I am a concerned private citizen, and believe the 10th year review of the Species at Risk Act should not in any way reduce environmental protection (conservation, habitat protection, etc.) of Ontario’s wildlife, especially species at risk. In particular, please see my concerned opinion in regard to the following:
1. Landscape Approaches:
I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections:
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations:
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes:
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent and irreversible, and no species should be threatened or sacrificed in the name of economic development. Biodiversity is essentially for both the health of an ecosystem and human health and well-being.

It is very important to me  and all of us for the Ontario government to create more stringent protections of our endangered species, biodiversity and wildlife habitat and and to implement many more programs that work to restore biodiversity and wildlife habitats where they have been lost to help our endangered species to thrive and survive. Job creation programs to combat biodiversity killing invasive species is also very important to implement.
Creation of educational programs starting in nursery school and every school year there after about our integrative natural web of life and how to protect it is also very important.

23547,/comment/23547,"Area of Focus 1: Landscape Approaches
1. Move forward with a permanent section 55(1)(b) regulatory exemption to the forest sector to continue enabling landscape approaches currently being delivered under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA).
2. Working under the section 55 (1)(b) regulation, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) must develop workable species at risk policy delivered under the CFSA that contributes to working landscapes and functioning ecosystems while incorporating socio-economic impact analysis, jointly, with practitioners, affected stakeholders, and Indigenous communities.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
3. Overhaul the membership of COSSARO to reflect more generalist professionals and Indigenous communities rather than academics with expertise in a very limited field of study. Known experts in a particular species, including local MNRF biologists and local RPFs should be invited to participate in the deliberation of species being evaluated by COSSARO at least 12 months before the committee meets to evaluate the species’ status.
4. Develop a clear process for using the “data deficient” category, particularly for species with a wide distribution and lack of data.
5. COSSARO should consider the use of regional sub-populations to account for differences in status across the province, risk to the species and the relative risk of human activities. Populations of species at the normal edge of their ranges in Ontario, outside of their core range, should be evaluated with due consideration of their global population.
6. Add an additional layer of accountability by having the responsible minister weigh scientific evidence provided by COSSARO with the socio-economic impacts before a species is automatically listed and protected.
7. Reassessment of species at risk should be considered when credible evidence has been presented to the responsible ministry beyond what is currently permitted within the ESA.
8. Enable individuals and organizations to report on SAR sightings without the perceived or real fear of being penalized for doing so.
Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
9. The current 5-year review should go beyond simply listing actions that have taken place. A biological review of the species should be included and feedback into the COSSARO listing process.
10. Habitat renewal should not be considered habitat destruction.
Area of Focus 4: Authorization Processes
11. Remove the July 1st, 2020 expiry found in O. Reg. 242/08 (22.1) to forest operations on Crown land giving the sector and government greater certainty.
12. Replace the term “overall benefit” within sections 17(2)(c), 18(1)(e)(iii)(A), and 18(2)(f)(iii)(A) with “positive outcomes” to species at risk.
13. Equivalency through section 55, not harmonization through section 18 is required for future success and is well supported by legal precedent.

The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) is Ontario’s largest non-profit, conservation-based organization, representing 100,000 members, supporters and subscribers, and 740 member clubs. We have reviewed the Discussion Paper 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act and submit the following comments for consideration. We strongly support the need for effective legislation and adequate funding to protect and recover species at risk, and we believe that Ontario should continue to be a leader in these endeavors. Ontario’s species at risk program is a large and complex subject. We consider this the first step in an important conversation, and look forward to providing input throughout the review.
The OFAH has extensive experience with species at risk legislation at both the federal and provincial levels.
•	We have been active on species at risk issues during the earliest proposals for stand-alone legislation, years before the ESA was passed.
•	OFAH staff (professional biologists by training) participate on the provincial Species at Risk Program Advisory Committee (SARPAC) and on the federal Species at Risk Advisory Committee (SARAC).
•	OFAH staff and Board members have observed Committee on the Status of Species at Risk (COSSARO) meetings in person.
•	OFAH has detailed knowledge of the workings of the ESA from a stakeholder perspective through the Lake Ontario Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program (LOASRP), including negotiating the first stewardship agreement under the Act, scientific collectors’ and stocking permits, habitat restoration (while also managing Redside Dace considerations), providing community knowledge to a COSSARO deliberation, and working with the Species-at-Risk Stewardship Fund (SAR-SF).
•	We have funded and partnered on successful restoration programs for extirpated species, including elk and wild turkeys.
•	We are a large stakeholder group who have had species of interest impacted by the Act, including Lake Sturgeon, Atlantic Salmon, Eastern Wolf and non-native coyotes, Snapping Turtles, and Caribou. Inflexible restoration mechanisms in the Act have impacted the angling and hunting communities, who are among the most active stewards for fish and wildlife conservation on the landscape.
•	OFAH coordinates several conservation programs that address some of the primary threats to native species – habitat loss (ALUS Peterborough, LOASRP) and invasive species (Invading Species Awareness Program). In 2018, ALUS Peterborough received SAR-SF funding for habitat restoration on marginal farmland.
A decade is a reasonable time frame for a legislative review, both for lessons learned in Ontario and to evaluate successes of other jurisdictions. In the 10 years since the implementation of the Act, we have identified several significant flaws that justify an extensive and critical review of Ontario’s species at risk program. These include but are not limited to a lack of conservation tools that have been demonstrated to work in other jurisdictions, concerns about COSSARO and the species listing process, insufficient capacity for proper implementation of the Act, and a failure to treat species based on risk (triage). The regularity with which exemptions are required also suggests the need for a comprehensive review of the program.
This review presents a rare opportunity to critically examine past successes and failures of the program. Our submission will address each of the Areas of Focus outlined in the Discussion Paper, preceded by a novel proposal for managing species differently.
Proposed Game Species Approach
The OFAH has extensive experience with legislation like the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (FWCA) and the Ontario Fisheries Regulations (OFR), which guide the management of game fish and wildlife species in Ontario. These pieces of legislation also offer a spectrum or gradient of tools for protection that can be harnessed to generate beneficial outcomes prior to outright protection, which is the only option available under the ESA. In some instances, these other tools will provide better outcomes than the ESA – our experience with Atlantic Salmon restoration is that, as much as we disagree with the 2011 reclassification scientifically, the restoration program is better outside the ESA.
The actual benefits of this flexibility are noticeable and significant:
•	Incentivizing conservation: Harvest creates value, value promotes stewardship, and stewardship benefits species. If a species is utilized and valued by people, they will work harder to conserve that species. For example, black bears were treated as vermin in Ontario until the 1960s, at which point the government instituted a regulated hunt for them. Today, black bears are a highly valued game mammal and an important component of Ontario’s biodiversity. In Newfoundland, government-funded stocked Atlantic Salmon were experiencing rampant poaching until it became a community stocking effort. It created a sense of ownership and stewardship of the fish and poaching declined.
•	Conservation funding: the sale of fishing, hunting and trapping licences generates tens of millions of dollars annually for the provincial fish and wildlife program. Certain species are so valued by anglers and hunters that conservation groups raise significant additional funds that can jumpstart or accelerate conservation efforts (e.g. NGO and community wild turkey and elk restoration fundraising efforts in Ontario). While not currently implemented in Ontario, there is the possibility of establishing ‘low success’ lotteries for species in certain areas (e.g. caribou in the Far North) that could generate significant funds, increase the species’ profile, and engender stewardship.
•	Robust assessment and monitoring: compared to most species at risk, harvested species are rarely data deficient.  Regulated harvest requires ongoing population monitoring, management review, and harvest planning that is much more frequent than the assessment timelines dictated in the ESA. As such, population changes would be detected earlier, facilitating adaptive management.
•	Spatial flexibility: game species are monitored and managed at a variety of spatial scales (e.g. sub-WMU scale for elk, Wildlife Management Units, Cervid Ecological Zones, Fisheries Management Zones). Conservation efforts for game species can be scaled depending on need, much like the existing species designation system under the ESA.
•	Complacency/satisfaction with status quo: due to a lack of capacity, the government is rarely capable of reversing species declines. The current mentality of being satisfied with stopping declines is unacceptable and the people of Ontario rightfully expect more.
These benefits are the direct result of the harvest of species, which can be leveraged in countless ways. The SAR program could learn a lot from past experiences with harvested species and management.
The reality is that the government has never had the capacity to implement the ESA as it was intended. We warned the government of this in our 2008 submission on the Act. If no additional investment is forthcoming, we need to try a different approach. This necessitates the development of a means to triage species based on risk. For some species, recovery is handicapped by the rigidity of the ESA. There are some species at risk (e.g. Lake Sturgeon, bobwhite quail) that could be restored sooner and more efficiently if we harnessed the tools available in other legislation.
Lake Sturgeon is an excellent example of a species with recovery actions in development, with an engaged stakeholder base, that largely came to a halt when the species moved from the OFR to the ESA, and first harvest and then all recreational fishing was prohibited on most populations.  This loss of angling opportunities negatively impacted community stewardship and fundraising opportunities for restoration.  Based on our experience, the government’s response is to maintain the species at a low-level abundance and hope for a natural recovery, rather than engage in a concerted effort to restore it.  As anglers we are not only concerned over Lake Sturgeon, but also where this leads for the next game fish species that might be listed – what will be the cost in volunteers, enthusiasm, and funding when the species becomes “hands-off”, and how low will expectations for recovery consequently be?
With this in mind, we recommend the government take additional steps to leverage the power of existing legislation and regulations (FWCA, OFR) to conserve/restore game species prior to listing on the Species at Risk in Ontario List and subjecting them to ESA prohibitions. The government should include provisions under the ESA (or through regulation) that outlines the steps taken if a scheduled game species is listed under the Act (currently, or in the future). This process should include a delay before protections are implemented, during which the government could examine the feasibility and effectiveness of managing the species under existing legislative frameworks (FWCA/OFR) before enabling section 9 and 10 of the ESA. The FWCA and Fisheries Act (via the OFR) could provide ways to effectively manage game species at risk with more flexibility than the ESA (e.g. allowing catch and release fishing, limited harvest, etc. to preserve the social value of a species). The FWCA and OFR already have the ability to limit and cease harvest of a species if a conservation concern arises, and therefore those mechanisms should be applied before other protections are enacted. The ESA would continue to act as a last line of defence (i.e. ESA protections would kick-in if all other non-ESA tools prove ineffective). This could generate better outcomes and leave the ESA (and its limited budget) to manage and restore other at-risk species, most of which are largely ignored in the current hands-off approach. This division of labour would free up valuable resources and capacity for lower-profile species under the ESA, and enable the government to actually restore (i.e. not just ‘hold the line’) others outside of the ESA. There are a myriad of options for incorporating a ‘game species consideration’ into the ESA, and we focused mostly on the ‘why’ and only highlighted a few examples of the ‘how’. The specific legislative mechanism will be dependent on what other changes are made to the Act itself and its accompanying policies and processes. It is our contention that specific consideration for game species can and should be incorporate into the ESA, we just need to figure out how.
AREA OF FOCUS 1 – LANDSCAPE APPROACHES
In what circumstances would a more strategic approach support a proposed activity while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk? (e.g., by using landscape approach instead of a case-by-case approach, which tends to be species and/or site-specific.)
The OFAH long ago identified Ontario’s species-specific approach to species at risk conservation as an inefficient and costly approach. Single-species management has resulted in a dismal return-on-investment for the provincial species at risk program. This insular approach could also potentially negatively affect other species if they are not treated as interconnected components of an ecosystem. Our concerns about single-species management were validated in 2018 when federal, provincial, and territorial governments initiated a paradigm shift with the Pan-Canadian Approach to Transforming Species at Risk Conservation in Canada. One of the key changes is a move towards a multi-species and landscape approach. The approach also details the identification of ‘Priority Places’, ‘Priority Species’, and ‘Priority Threats’ to focus conservation efforts and finite funding. A similar approach, if adopted, could pay dividends for Ontario’s species at risk.
A landscape approach is particularly well-suited for ecosystems such as the Carolinian Forest, a rare habitat type that supports a variety of species at risk. Carolinian species are naturally limited in Ontario due to the low extent of available habitat and could be considered a ‘Priority Place’. It would be more efficient to manage the entirety of Carolinian habitat as opposed to protecting SAR on a case-by-case basis within it. If SAR were managed at a landscape level, habitat could be listed as at-risk to protect areas that support specific species.
For species that are not limited by habitat, a similar approach could be undertaken by managing common threats (overabundant predators, invasive species, chemical use, diseases) instead of protecting the species. For instance, Australia is actively managing and removing feral cats due to the significant threat they pose to species at risk. Feral cats are also a significant threat to endangered northern bobwhite quail on Walpole Island First Nation in southwestern Ontario. This could be considered equivalent to the ‘Priority Threats’ in the Pan-Canadian Approach. Creating phase-out, management, or eradication plans for these threats would do more to improve SAR outcomes (and other species) than individual species protection plans would. In these situations, automatic habitat protections would be unnecessary, and instituting a ‘delay’ option would help form the recovery strategy more effectively and could result in no direct protections for the SAR under Section 9 of the ESA. For example, if a species was threatened by an invasive species, no degree of ESA protection would help that species. The only way to generate positive outcomes for the species would be to manage the invasive, which would be easier to quickly implement if there were no additional protections on the SAR (e.g. there would be no need for an authorization permit to harm the SAR while removing the invasive species).
How would a landscape approach alter the current listing process? Would COSSARO be responsible for identifying areas and threats where listed species could be managed together or would this be included in the recovery strategy? A delay in listing would enable more strategic species protections (e.g. if geographically specific habitat is not the limiting factor, then it doesn’t need to managed on a landscape level and a more specific recovery plan needs to be created; however, if the species requires the same habitat protections as an existing SAR it can be included in the protection/recovery plan for that species).
Are there existing tools or processes that support managing for species risk at a landscape scale that could be recognized under the Endangered Species Act?
Game species are already managed under the FWCA and the OFR at multiple scales, including the landscape scale. These legislative tools provide more flexibility (for game species) than if they were managed under the ESA. Recognizing and enabling the management of game species under the FWCA and the OFR could be a much more effective way to deal with at-risk game species, such as Lake Sturgeon, than to enact automatic protections under the ESA. It’s time we consider using all tools available to us.
Additionally, other sectors have legislation in place that could be enabled under the ESA to provide better and more effective outcomes for SAR. For example, forest management plans (FMPs) created under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act are science-based and reviewed/updated frequently to incorporate new knowledge. We support the recognition of approved FMPs within the ESA as tools to conserve species at risk, and acknowledge that requirements might need to be more stringent and prescriptive.
Offsetting would be easier to scope under a landscape level approach to SAR because the offset would have to focus on habitat in a specific geographic area to be considered. It would also lend itself to creating habitat which supports multiple species (including SAR).
Safe Harbour agreements also play an important role in landscape level protections for SAR. As we would be looking at species at a broad scale, habitat corridors through private properties would dramatically improve the overall health of the protected habitat. Because these protections have the potential to be temporary, they must not be considered an offset. Also, integrating programs such as ALUS into SAR habitat protections via a safe harbour agreement would further engage farmers in SAR conservation.
Other – Harmonization of legislation
There is no indication that increased investment in SAR management is forthcoming, so we need to find different approaches that more efficiently use the available financial resources. As previously outlined, by harmonizing management of SAR with existing legislation (where possible), the government would be able to deal with some species/threats and rely on the ESA to conserve those species that aren’t effectively protected under other legislation. Removing this legislative duplication would free up important capacity and finances for species that are largely ignored under the current system. For example, if an invasive species is identified as a threat, addressing it through the Invasive Species Act could benefit the at-risk species without unnecessary protections and burdensome administrative processes under the ESA (i.e. the ESA doesn’t have the tools to effectively address the threat).
For example, Lake Whitefish in Algonquin Park’s Opeongo Lake have been suggested to be a distinct variation of whitefish that only exist within that lake. They have been declining due to an influx of invasive species. The Lake Whitefish from this lake was brought to COSEWIC to be assessed and to prevent their decline. This concern can be managed under a variation order under the OFR by limiting harvest for Lake Whitefish in that lake, instead of going through the listing process. This would have been preferred considering the threat to these fish is not regulated harvest or habitat loss, but rather an invasive species (which will not be managed via the ESA). This provides flexibility to manage the species and the threat in a timely manner outside of the ESA (i.e. re-establishing a season would be much easier under the OFR than under the ESA).
AREA OF FOCUS 2 – LISTING PROCESS AND PROTECTIONS FOR SPECIES AT RISK
What changes would improve the notification process of a new species being listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List? (e.g. longer timelines before a species is listed)
We believe that earlier public notice will allow for more thorough and expansive community knowledge input. We also recommend that relevant experts, agencies and impacted stakeholders be directly notified so they can provide input either through the community knowledge track, or preferably through a separate process that recognizes the value of these contributions. For example, the government could distribute a call for verifiable sightings of a species that is going to be assessed by COSSARO, and for any databases, reports, and histories that exist. This could generate considerable additional information for certain species. The Natural Heritage Information Center warehouses this information for many species, but does not always have all of the relevant information (e.g. academic, citizen science, etc.). Notification should also apply to species re-assessments rather than just initial assessments, especially species of special concern that could be re-classified as threatened or endangered. Full, detailed reports on the COSSARO listing process are also needed to inform species re-assessments. The incomplete summaries that are currently available do not provide full public transparency about what data was reviewed and how it informed COSSARO’s designation, specifically how the data was matched against the classification criteria. There also needs to be greater effort and transparency in communicating how ‘community knowledge’ and other contributions were considered into decision making.
Should there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections? (e.g. longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove, or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat)
The review of the Act should consider a different approach to automatic species and habitat protections in some cases. Ontario should review what other jurisdictions (including the federal government) have done to successfully integrate the need for effective protection within the context of societal needs. Some species have significant connections to humans, whether through their distribution (e.g. barn swallows), specific relationships to a particular industry and its impacts (e.g. Bobolink and agriculture), or socioeconomic value through sustainable use (e.g. Lake Sturgeon, caribou, polar bears). Therefore, these species deserve special consideration to develop effective, targeted protections, while also recognizing their interactions with humans. It will require a more flexible approach to achieve this, and we fully support a built-in delay (a ‘pause button’) before ESA protections take effect. This will allow sufficient time to consider what protections are required and appropriate, while considering the socioeconomic implications. Functionally, this would result in three streams of species consideration: species managed outside of the ESA (but under other legislation), complex species within the ESA (significant socio-economic implications), and other species within the ESA (unprotected by other legislation and limited socio-economic implications).
In what circumstances would a different approach to automatic species and habitat protections be appropriate? (e.g. there is significant intersection between a species or its habitat and human activities, complexity in addressing species threats, or where a species’ habitat is not limiting)
How can the process regarding assessment and classification of a species by COSSARO be improved? (e.g. request an additional review and assessment in cases where there is emerging science or conflicting information)
Based on our experience, we have identified several flaws related to COSSARO and the listing process. Through this proposed review, the government must decide if it wants to overhaul COSSARO from the ground up or make minor adjustments to increase transparency and improve the decision-making process while also examining alternative approaches to automatic protection and the final listing of species. Ultimately, one of the main concerns that we have with the ESA is the unchallengeable conclusions of COSSARO – this is a process where unelected officials make decisions of provincial significance. This is particularly troubling when COSSARO does not have the relevant expertise or sufficient data to make a decision for a given species.
If the government decides to overhaul COSSARO and the listing process, the OFAH would like an opportunity to provide detailed comments and recommendations at that time. Irrespective of that happening, we wish to see changes made and our concerns include:
•	COSSARO having insufficient capacity and resources to prepare species reports with adequate rigour to justify classifications.
•	COSSARO choosing to simply follow decisions made by COSEWIC, or basing their decisions entirely on the report provided by COSEWIC. If Ontario has better data that calls into question the COSEWIC result, as was the case with Lake Ontario Atlantic Salmon, then it should be used.
•	There is no peer review of the species reports and decision-making process. Were decisions made using the best available science?
•	A general lack of rigour and transparency in the deliberation and decision-making processes, and voting results.
•	No social or economic values can be considered in the process or the decision to list.
•	COSSARO refuses to consider the consequences of listing a species (such as reducing stakeholder interest in restoration by making a species a pariah), yet does consider the consequences of not listing a species when it invokes the precautionary principle.
To address these concerns, we provide the following recommendations.
•	Review the definition of ‘species’ in the Act to ensure that we are protecting the right things. With the development of powerful genetic tools comes the ability to partition populations in an almost infinite number of ways. This necessitates greater clarity with respect to what criteria can and cannot be used to define a unit for protection, and how.
•	Ensure relevant expertise on COSSARO at all times (e.g. for most of its life, COSSARO has had little/no fisheries expertise). This could extend to generalists such as experts in population modeling, forecasting, probability theory, etc.
•	COSSARO should proactively identify and attempt to address knowledge gaps to the best of its ability prior to designation.
•	Public reporting on species reviews/assessments should include more information, including how a species scores against the evaluation criteria (Indicators A to E).
•	Special Concern criteria should be quantified in the same manner as the Endangered and Threatened designations.
•	Species at the extreme edge of their range (e.g. historically precarious species like Spotted Gar), recent discoveries, and very old (and possibly erroneous) identifications need to be recognized as such in assessments in order to communicate the weight of evidence for a designation.
•	The deliberation process needs to be improved. There is no official assessment of the amount or quality of data that exists to support a particular designation. For example, the process could be structured as a debate to ensure that these difficult but important questions are posed.
•	The voting process should be open to the public, even if it remains a secret ballot.
•	COSSARO should seek advice from the experts in MNRF and MECP following a transparent process. For example, provincial experts and members of the Atlantic Salmon recovery team were not consulted during assessment for that species.
•	The process to provide community knowledge to COSSARO could be improved. In the Atlantic Salmon example above, scientific data/reporting had to be contributed through the community knowledge form, which is ill-suited for this purpose. Also, there is no active recruitment of community knowledge, and members of the public are unaware of this opportunity unless they follow COSSARO news regularly.
•	The competent Minister should be more open to requesting a second review by COSSARO if it can be demonstrated that evidence or emerging science were not adequately considered (as in the examples above). It is our understanding that the current reassessment process has never been used, implying that reassessment has never been needed. The threshold is too high and should be reviewed to ensure there are legitimate checks and balances on the assessment and listing process.

AREA OF FOCUS 3 – SPECIES RECOVERY POLICIES AND HABITAT REGULATIONS
In what circumstances would a species and/or Ontarians benefit from additional time for the development of the Government Response Statement? (e.g., enable extending the timeline for the Government Response Statement when needed, such as when recovery approaches for a species are complex or when additional engagement is required with businesses, Indigenous peoples, landowners and conservation groups.)
Realistically, the government has never had the capacity to implement the ESA as it was intended. If additional resources are not forthcoming, then flexibility must be built into the process to acknowledge the inevitable delays. Currently under the ESA there is no provision to enable an extension to the nine-month timeline for Government Response Statements (GRS) to recovery strategies for Threatened and Endangered species. In many instances this timeline may be adequate, while for others extensions may be necessary for more complex recovery approaches and where additional engagement and consultation may be required. MECP should consider increasing the flexibility of this process similar to the timelines for recovery strategies and management plans, including:
•	A requirement to publish notices on the environmental registry stating additional time is required to prepare the GRS due to various reasons (i.e. complexity of issues, time needed to co-operate with other jurisdictions, prioritization of GRS for other species, socio-economic impacts, etc.).
•	Publicly describing the reasons for the timeline extension.
•	Providing an estimate of when the preparation of the GRS will be completed.
As stated, we believe that a pause button is necessary for some species under the ESA.  Our game species proposal could facilitate more immediate action for some species. These game species likely already have some form of management plan associated with them and therefore there would be a much quicker turn around on implementing recovery actions.
In what circumstances would a longer timeline improve the merit and relevance of conducting a review of progress towards protection and recovery? (e.g., for species where additional data is likely to be made available over a longer timeframe, or where stewardship actions are likely to be completed over a longer timeframe.)
Conducting a progress review is critical for the protection and recovery of species at risk, and to ensure government accountability. A five-year timeline may be too short for some species and recovery actions to result in a noticeable benefit. However, this is preferred over a longer review period if that delay results in a species becoming more imperiled/at risk. The biology of the species and the timeline of the threat should inform the progress review. For example, the five-year delay may be too lengthy for a species that reproduces annually and is imperiled because of more immediate threats (the review may need to occur sooner). On the other hand, for a long-lived species facing a longer-term risk (i.e. climate change), the five-year time frame may be unnecessarily short. The current process does not acknowledge these differences and would benefit from additional flexibility. These situations could both be addressed using a tiered review system that incorporates progress reports at short, intermediate, and long-term intervals. Short term reviews can simply be a checklist of actions taken and actions still needing to be implemented from the GRS, where long term reviews could quantify accrued benefits (i.e. population increases).
In what circumstances is the development of a habitat regulation warranted, or not warranted? (e.g., to improve certainty for businesses and others about the scope of habitat that is protected.)
General habitat protections and the development of specific habitat regulations are not warranted if the SAR is not habitat limited; there is no benefit in protecting habitat of a species that is not threatened by habitat loss. For example, since their arrival the emerald ash borer has been responsible for killing tens of millions of ash trees and continues to spread into new areas. If ash trees were to be listed as Threatened or Endangered under the ESA, species protection would prevent the removal of a tree, but protecting their habitat will not assist in the recovery of the species. Eliminating the mandatory requirement to protect the habitat of Threatened and Endangered species that are at risk due to factors other than habitat loss/degradation results in more efficient use of resources and time for both the proponents and government. By implementing a delay in habitat protections, it would allow for time to consider the socio-economic implications and develop pragmatic solutions (e.g. the bobolink experience).
AREA OF FOCUS 4 – AUTHORIZATION PROCESSES
What new authorization tools could help businesses achieve benefits for species at risk? (e.g., in lieu of activity-based requirements enable paying into a conservation fund dedicated to species at risk conservation, or allow conservation banking to enable addressing requirements for species at risk prior to activities.)
To our knowledge, the majority of compensation is implemented after adverse effects on the species or their habitats have occurred. As a result, there are negative impacts that are not well accounted for (if at all). Regulatory agencies must review numerous applications on a project-by-project basis which is administratively burdensome, and also limits resources that could be used for managing other project aspects. There is a need to update and improve authorization processes under the ESA. However, any new tools being considered to help achieve benefits for species at risk must be well-thought-out, carefully implemented, and rigorously managed. We recommend that the Review identify tools that have been successfully implemented in other jurisdictions that are feasible for application in Ontario, and enable them in the Act. Even if they are never implemented in Ontario, the government will have the ability to do so if circumstances dictate.
Conservation funds
Conservation funds have the potential to benefit species at risk, but have been criticized for not contributing to habitat gains or achieving no-net-loss (Hunt et al., 2011). These funds typically involve compensating through the preservation of existing habitat; however, if no new habitat is being added, then there is an overall net loss.
An effective conservation fund may consider the acquisition or securing of marginal habitats (i.e. of little to no ecological value), and making improvements through restoration, remediation, and enhancement to benefit SAR as directed through a recovery strategy and GRS. The lands could be conserved and made available for sustainable use activities like fishing, hunting, and trapping, where appropriate. Conservation funding could also be expanded to support research for species at risk that are not habitat limited, but at risk due to other factors (i.e. disease, invasive species, climate change, etc.).
Conservation banking
Any conservation banking system must ensure high quality habitat credits that achieve ‘no net loss’ of habitat.  Many conservation banking systems fail to ensure the creation/protection of habitat, and ultimately result in continued habitat loss. This difference between predicted and realized habitat gains is a serious concern, and we therefore recommend under any proposal a greater than 2:1 ratio of habitat area gained to habitat area lost in order to help achieve no net loss. Additionality is a critical component for the establishment of a functioning environmental market. Mechanisms for additionality testing and credit certification should be implemented to avoid flooding environmental markets with credits that don’t provide added value (i.e. non-additional). Control and management strategies for monitoring and evaluating markets is critical to the establishment of a functioning system. Checks, balances, and consequences need to be structured to ensure conservation banks perform as anticipated. A registration system to help track conservation projects, banks, and the exchange of credits is necessary and should be made available to the public, where appropriate.
Exchange of conservation credits, in most instances, should be in-kind replacement (i.e. “like-for-like”) that achieves an overall net gain of that commodity. For example, if the activities of a proponent result in adverse effects to Redside Dace habitat, the credits needed to compensate the work should come from a conservation project involving the creation of Redside Dace habitat within the same service area (e.g. waterbody, watershed, etc.). In order to contribute to additionality, a greater number of conservation credits should always be maintained ‘in the bank’ relative to the number of debits (i.e. principal versus interest).
The delineation of service areas and the geographical and spatial extent should not be arbitrarily determined. MECP should consider restricting service area boundaries to natural geomorphological features such as watersheds. The exchange of credits through conservation projects should occur at, or in close proximity to, the area that is being impacted/harmed (i.e. within the service area where the adverse effect is occurring). Furthermore, conservation projects that are created under the banking system should receive some level of protection from future developments to ensure its continued contribution to ecological conservation.
Are there other approaches to authorizations that could enable applicants to take a more strategic or collaborative approach to address impacts to species at risk? (e.g., create a new authorization, such as a conservation agreement.)
Third-party conservation banking
Proponents often lack the technical expertise to ensure the success of conservation offsets. Third-party conservation banking could enable applicants to take a more strategic or collaborative approach to address impacts to species at risk. This type of system provides opportunities for conservation organizations to undertake “environmentally beneficial work” (Poulton, 2018). Proponents required to offset adverse impacts would have the flexibility to purchase certified credits from conservation banking companies to compensate for activities resulting in adverse effects to species at risk or their habitats. Third-party banking has the potential to support large-scale conservation projects, it provides more certainty about the ecological performance of offsets, and benefits are achieved in advance of adverse impacts (CWF, 2018).
What changes to authorization requirements would better enable economic development while providing positive outcomes and protections for species at risk? (e.g., simplify the requirements for a permit under s. 17(2)(d), and exemptions set out by regulation.)
The OFAH supports the standardization and modernization of permitting under the ESA to provide more clarity to applicants and regulators, and to improve authorization processes. We would be pleased to comment further when more specific examples of changes are proposed.
How can the needs of species at risk be met in a way that is more efficient for activities subject to other legislative or regulatory frameworks? (e.g., better enable meeting Endangered Species Act requirements in other approval processes.)
See Area of Focus 1.
In what circumstances would enhanced inspection and compliance powers be warranted? (e.g., regulations.)
Inspection and enforcement powers should be made consistent across authorizations and regulations to enhance compliance with regulations. MECP could consider implementing provisions in the ESA to enable the establishment of a public registry; except during instances where full disclosure may compromise the ability to protect species at risk or their habitats. A registry would increase transparency and improve overall awareness of projects on a landscape scale, and would assist in the knowledge and understanding of cumulative impacts of development pressures. Codes of practice could be enabled and developed to provide advice to proponents to avoid impacts on SAR and their habitats. Also, provisions for designated projects could be considered for works, undertakings, or activities that would always require SAR authorizations; provides certainty for proponents around permitting and associated timelines.
Conclusion
Harmonizing management of SAR with existing legislation (where possible), the government would be able to deal with some species/threats and rely on the ESA to conserve those species that aren’t effectively protected under other legislation. Removing this legislative duplication would free up important capacity and finances for species that are largely ignored under the current system. We have additional thoughts on how to operationalize our recommendations, and would be happy to discuss them further.
Thank you for the opportunity and considering our comments. We believe this is only the first step in reviewing and revising the ESA to help develop a more efficient and effective SAR program in Ontario. The OFAH has significant experience, relevant expertise and a keen interest that can result in important contributions during future discussions on how to improve Ontario’s species at risk program.
Yours in Conservation,

I have worked in the forest industry for 25 years in various capacity's including forest management planning and forest renewal
I have a few comments to share regarding the 10th year review of the ESA:
The Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) has proven to be very effective legislation to regulate forestry in Ontario as it strives to balance social, environmental and economic outcomes associated with the management of SFL's.
The Endangered Species Act (ESA) however does not seek to achieve this same balance, instead it requires individual threatened or endangered species to be protected at the expense of all other forest management outcomes.
I would recommend the following;
-  a permanent ESA Section 55 regulatory exemption for the forest sector.
- continue to manage for at-risk species through the CFSA, in balance with other social, economic and environmental objectives
- ensure species prescriptions are developed with input from forest practitioners, affected stakeholders and rights holders, to ensure they are workable
-complete socio-economic impact analysis and share with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented.

I look forward in seeing improvements to the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to the forestry sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, below are other requirements that should be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is my understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. I expect that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further I am concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with impacted stakeholders and First Nations well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.
Sincerely,
Concerned citizen

23563,/comment/23563,"1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for the government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses a considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Protecting and Recovering Species at Risk in Ontario
I have reviewed the Discussion Paper and the Areas of Focus.
Area of Focus 1 – Landscape Approaches
A landscape approach is already enabled by the current legislation (Endangered Species Act, 2007).  No changes are needed to use this approach more effectively. It has been implemented with respect to the Woodland Caribou and could be used for other species and groups of species.
Area of Focus 2 – Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
No changes are needed for the listing process or notification of upcoming assessments.  Better use of existing tools such as the COSSARO website would improve notification. For example, I looked at the current COSSARO website (http://cossaroagency.ca) and noticed that the information on upcoming meetings and the list of species to be assessed is almost two years out of date!  Why?  It would improve notification to simply have the website made up to date by devoting more resourcing to it.
No changes are needed to automatic listing, and automatic species and habitat protection. These mechanisms are the core functions of the Act and to change them would be destroying the very reasons for which the Act was created.
Area of Focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
The Discussion Paper does not provide any examples of when or why the timelines for preparing the Government Response Statements (GRS) or Five Year Reviews (FYR) are considered too short or too soon. Nor are there examples of species for which habitat regulations are not needed.
There is no need to change the timelines for development of the GRS or FYR, or to restrict the use of habitat regulations.  The GRS and FYR are key to implementing recovery.  One of the main threats to species at risk is loss of habitat and requirements such as the habitat regulation are key to ensuring the appropriate amount and location of habitat is protected.
Area of Focus 4 – Authorization Processes
The Endangered Species Act has a suite of authorizations that enable activities to occur.  No specific examples are given which would demonstrate that there is a need to widen the suite further.
Overall benefits must be set up to give a benefit to the species being affected by an activity. An option such as donating to a conservation bank would not be species specific and would be much less likely to benefit the species. Other options presented such as simplifying permit requirements for s. 17(2)d, would lessen the protection given to species at risk and be to their detriment.  Permitting requirements should not be weakened through regulations in the name of efficiency.  It is not clear that there is sufficient inspection and compliance monitoring of existing permitting regulations let alone if additional methods of authorization are created.

23568,/comment/23568,"In general, I believe the Endangered Species Act should provide reliable protection to vulnerable species.  It makes no sense to allow irreversible damage to the earth's ecosystem by allowing species to go extinct, just so that one, or a few people of one or two generations can make some money.  People don't really know if their plans of playing around with allowing destruction here and enhancement there will work, human actions quite often have unintended consequences, so it seems prudent not to take actions that could have permanent consequences.
Area of Focus 2
There should be automatic species and habitat protections for threatened and endangered species.
The process of listing a species as extirpated, endangered, threatened or special concern should be based on the best available scientific information.  Listings are not automatic, they are (and should be) a result of review by the COSSARO of the best available scientific information.
In order to make the process transparent, COSSARO should prepare a scientifically referenced report outlining the decision process and reasons for the listing.  I believe these reports are currently written for each listed species.  Listings should be regularly reviewed, as new studies and information becomes available.
There is no need for a longer public notification, species do not suddenly become threatened or endangered, it is usually a process over several years.  Proponents of projects which will alter and impact on any kind of natural area (ie part of the earth) should be expected to be aware of natural environment concerns in their local area, and be aware of any species in trouble.  A basic ecological literacy should be expected of developers
Area of Focus 4
No permits or authorizations should be issued to allow the harm, harassment or killing of endangered or threatened species, or damage to their habitat.  This would simplify the permitting process, there would be no need to file numerous authorization requests.  The rule would be simple...No harming threatened or endangered species or the habitat on which they depend.
Ontario Nature
I agree with Ontario Nature’s position regarding Endangered Species Act amendments.  Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. I ask that the following points be included in the ESA:
1.	Maintain mandatory habitat protection for endangered and threatened species.
2.	MECP should repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development industries;
3.	Amend section 57(1)1 of the ESA so that any future exemptions cannot jeopardize the recovery of endangered and threatened species;
4.	Maintain COSSARO’s current species listing process, “based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge” (ESA, section 5 (3)); and
5.	Require compensation that results in a direct overall benefit to affected species where harmful activities are permitted. (Do not allow proponents of harmful activities to bypass protections by simply paying into a fund.)

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) remains difficult to apply to forest management due to the enhanced protection of certain species which is good but there needs to be an equal balance so it does not severely limit other forest managemnt outcomes.
The Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) has been very effective legislation to regulate forestry in Ontario as it balances the social, economic, and environmental outcomes within the forestry industry.
Government still needs to find a way to make the ESA work for forestry as well the endangered species without jeopardizing one or the other.  The only implementable solution has come through the use of an ESA Section 55 Regulation which expires next year.  The Section 55 Regulation whch recognizes the CFSA creates a more balanced aproach to achieve species protection as well as not greatly limiting forest management objectives.
A few recommendations I have would be:
-Implementing a permanent ESA Section 55 regulatory exemption for the forest sector that recognizes the CSFA.
-Continuing to manage the at risk species through the CFSA as well as developing species prescriptions with input from forest stakeholders along with other professionals within the forestry sector.
-Any socio-economic impact analysis should be made and shared with impacted forest stakeholders and First Nations before any policy is implemented.

23571,/comment/23571,"""Should there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections?"" - If anything there should be a greater amount of species and habitat protections and there should not be longer transition periods or ministerial discretion whether to remove or temporarily delay protections. This solely benefits businesses and is in no benefit to the public or the health of our environment.
""The development of a habitat regulation is not needed for each species that is endangered and threatened since general habitat protection applies and can be clarified through the use of general habitat descriptions."" - Endangered/threatened species require specific habitats, creating general habitat protection is not enough to ensure the species current habitat is protected and does not help in the rebounding of the species.
""Significant social or economic benefit permit"" - who determines what classifies as 'significant social or economic benefit'? This seems to contradict the entire act.
As a whole, this discussion paper is disappointing. The challenges highlighted are purely for economic benefit and not for the benefit of the environment and the species which we must protect. As the paper states, there needs to be more discussion on how to better recover SAR and less focus on the economic development barriers.

benefit permit may be issued for an activity that will result in a significant social or
economic benefit to Ontario, but the activity would have impacts that are otherwise

I feel as though worded this way, it opens a dangerous door for large scale companies to potentially cut corners on their safety regulations, giving them away to potentially argue that cut corners will be able to provide significant jobs at the cost of harming an ecosystem. Throughout history, Corporations have proven time and again that they are willing to trade safe and ethical processes if it could make more money in the short term, often resulting in situations like major Oil companies creating large scale disasters that require lengthy clean up. I feel proper regulation of large scale companies is important to the health of Canada, not just ecologically, but also economically and socially, and I frankly would not trust a large scale corporation to always think ethically when deregulated.
I propose taking another look at this particular policy, either cutting it, or being rigorous and highly selective in who gets access to this permit.

A blanket approach to landscape protection does not suffice for individual species. There are situations where a species-specific approach is warranted.

Permits that are detrimental to endangered species and their habitat should be denied or at the very least, should have strict conditions applied, and resources must be allocated to enforce those conditions.

The TOC is one of the oldest birding clubs in Canada established in 1934 and we are committed to the ongoing conservation initiatives of migratory birds in Toronto and the surrounding areas, with a sound basis in contributions to scientific projects and studies.  The TOC is very concerned with the proposed review of the Endangered Species Act (2007) and the associated revisions.
The TOC is very concerned that environmental deregulation - making it easier for industry and development proponents to proceed with activities that harm species at risk and their habitats - appears to be the overall direction of the options put forward for consideration. Statements that the review is intended to “improve protections,” “improve effectiveness” and provide “stringent protections” are very misleading, in light of the proposals that Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) is inviting the public to consider. These include options that would undermine the very cornerstones of the law: science-based listing (including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge), mandatory habitat protection, and legislated timelines for planning and reporting.
The TOC is deeply concerned by the indication that MECP is considering alternatives to automatic species and habitat protections, including removing or delaying these protections at the discretion of the Minister. This is clearly a matter of letting short-sighted economic or political interests override the protection and recovery of species at risk. Alternatives to automatic protection will politicize decisions, undermine intended safeguards and expose highly vulnerable species to additional risks - all for no good reason.
There are already many flexibility mechanisms in the ESA to allow harmful activities to proceed, as described in the discussion paper.  More are simply not needed. The options under consideration reflect a desire to make it easier for industry and development proponents to proceed with activities that harm at-risk plants or animals and damage or destroy their habitat. The suggested options are inconsistent with the purpose of the ESA which is to protect and recover species at risk. Protection and recovery must be the priority.
The TOC strongly opposes the option of simplifying requirements for exemptions through regulation.  The long list of regulatory exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining, aggregate extraction, commercial development and wind facilities, approved by Cabinet in 2013, have significantly undermined not only protections for species at risk and their habitats but also transparency and public accountability. According to the Environmental Commissioner, ESA authorizations have “drastically increased” since the 2013 exemptions were put in place.  Exemptions have become the primary means for allowing harmful activities to proceed. As of October 11, 2017, there had been 2,065 registrations for exemptions and about 85 percent of these were for activities that violate ESA protections for species at risk and their habitats. These exemptions already allow industry/development proponents to proceed without providing an overall benefit, without government approval and without public scrutiny. What more do proponents want - carte blanche to proceed without any regard for species at risk?
There are, nevertheless, improvements that could be made to the ESA or its regulations to strengthen protections for species at risk, should MECP proceed with amendments.
•	Require additional reporting beyond the current requirement to produce a report five years after the release of the GRS;
•	Repeal the sweeping 2013 regulatory exemptions for harmful industrial/development activities;
•	Amend section 57 of the ESA so that exemptions are allowed only if the overall benefit standard is met and the exemptions do not threaten the survival or recovery of a threatened or endangered species;
•	Amend Ontario regulation 242/08 (the exemption regulation) to require proponents of harmful activities to automatically submit their mitigation plans and annual reports to the government and to make these publicly available; and
•	Amend the ESA to give enforcement officers the power to conduct inspections to ensure compliance with exemption conditions.
Rather than reducing its administrative and role and relinquishing its authority through exemptions, the ministry would be wise to embrace its role as a defender of the broad public interest in conserving biodiversity and securing a healthy environment for all. Investing in and incentivizing stewardship would offer, for example, a much more positive and promising means of protecting species at risk than finding new, streamlined approaches to allow proponents of harmful activities to damage and destroy critical habitats.

23587,/comment/23587,"RE: 	Forest Sector Requires Permanent Regulation Followed by Workable Species at Risk
	Policy After 10th Year Review of the Endangered Species Act
To Whom it May Concern:
As the Mayor of the Municipality of Greenstone in Northern Ontario, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. We look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act(CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act(ESA) through a permanent Section 55 Regulation.  The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, we must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is our understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. It is our expectation that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further, we remain extremely concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with us well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.
We would be happy to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the best path forward to ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk while keeping people in this province working.
Sincerely

23588,/comment/23588,"Area of Focus 1: Landscape Approaches
1. Move forward with a permanent section 55(1)(b) regulatory exemption to the forest sector to continue enabling landscape approaches currently being delivered under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA).
2. Working under the section 55 (1)(b) regulation, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) must develop workable species at risk policy delivered under the CFSA that contributes to working landscapes and functioning ecosystems while incorporating socio-economic impact analysis, jointly, with practitioners, affected stakeholders, and Indigenous communities.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
3. Overhaul the membership of COSSARO to reflect more generalist professionals and Indigenous communities rather than academics with expertise in a very limited field of study. Known experts in a particular species, including local MNRF biologists and local RPFs should be invited to participate in the deliberation of species being evaluated by COSSARO at least 12 months before the committee meets to evaluate the species’ status.
4. Develop a clear process for using the “data deficient” category, particularly for species with a wide distribution and lack of data.
5. COSSARO should consider the use of regional sub-populations to account for differences in status across the province, risk to the species and the relative risk of human activities. Populations of species at the normal edge of their ranges in Ontario, outside of their core range, should be evaluated with due consideration of their global population.
6. Add an additional layer of accountability by having the responsible minister weigh scientific evidence provided by COSSARO with the socio-economic impacts before a species is automatically listed and protected.
7. Reassessment of species at risk should be considered when credible evidence has been presented to the responsible ministry beyond what is currently permitted within the ESA.
8. Enable individuals and organizations to report on SAR sightings without the perceived or real fear of being penalized for doing so.
Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
9. The current 5-year review should go beyond simply listing actions that have taken place. A biological review of the species should be included and feedback into the COSSARO listing process.
10. Habitat renewal should not be considered habitat destruction.
Area of Focus 4: Authorization Processes
11. Remove the July 1st, 2020 expiry found in O. Reg. 242/08 (22.1) to forest operations on Crown land giving the sector and government greater certainty.
12. Replace the term “overall benefit” within sections 17(2)(c), 18(1)(e)(iii)(A), and 18(2)(f)(iii)(A) with “positive outcomes” to species at risk.
13. Equivalency through section 55, not harmonization through section 18 is required for future success and is well supported by legal precedent.

Consider that development of one sort or another is the primary reason for species being at risk in the first  place.  Making it easier to conduct development activities rather than instead strengthening the act places the interests of business over biodiversity.  Quite literally short term interests over long term evolution of species and the ecosystems they a part of (and which we depend on).  This is selling the heritage of our children and grandchildren for immediate short term profit.

Our economy will benefit by clear regulations, swift responses and improved communications, not by delays and exemptions in applying the Ontario Endangered Species Act, which is a critical backstop against extinction.
Protecting endangered species requires looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm
The Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) must be able to determine the status of species, which is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing unproven and speculative economic benefit. The government should focus on balancing the need to provide the resources for protecting species and habitats with clear regulations on allowable and non-allowable economic development.
I believe that endangered species and their environments can co-exist with economic development.  It is essential to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent and a healthy environment benefits all Ontarians (and Canadians).

Though I support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) stresses a site-specific and individualized approach that does not recognize the benefits that habitat management provides through the CFSA. The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA); either through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The Forestry industry MUST be present at the table when the species at risk legislation is evaluated and their input MUST be considered. Economic impact assessments of species at risk policy MUST be a priority as the review is carried out. Forestry operations approved in a Provincial Forest Management Plan pose little to no risk to species and their habitats.The COSSARO listing process for species is flawed as species with a lack of data are listed because there is a lack of data (precautionary principle). Furthermore, species may be at risk in some areas of the province but not all areas and therefore flexibility is needed. Current Area of Concern prescriptions must be re-evaluated and mechanisms for accountability on the Government side need to be created. If the forest industry loses their exemption, then the Government will have to list Forestry workers as endangered species.

23610,/comment/23610,"I am in support of CWF's position on this matter.
1. Landscape Approaches
I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

The proposed development lands for a big box development is less than 40 metres from Ojibway Prairie.
We do not need additional traffic, created by the building of a big box store and widening of Matchette Road, so close to the precious Reserve and Prairie. Do governments at all levels not care about the endangered and at risk species? What is the Endangered Species Act doing to protect species? Why is it so easy for developers to receive ESP Permit Applications? Apparently plans are in place to add eight more tools for developers to gain approval for developing endangered species habitat. This will further weaken the ESA. We need a stricter Ontario Endangered Species Act, not a watered down one!
Those proposed development lands themselves are host to 100 endangered & threatened species.
Ojibway itself hosts 4000 species, 160 Ontario species at risk, & 21 endangered & threatened species.
Tall grass prairies is a globally endangered ecosystem, having gone from 23% coverage in North America to less than 0.1% now.
The number of endangered & threatened species in Ojibway have increased from 13 to 21 since 2009.
Why on earth do we need another big box store so close to this precious area? Can it not be built elsewhere? Several  stores have closed in the past 1.5 years in Windsor...Sears, Bombay, Bowrings, with Home Outfitters soon to follow. Windsor’s population has not supported the malls and big box stores we have now.
Countless store fronts are closed and there are acres of empty cement parking lots. Can this big box store not be built on one of these empty sites?

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this EBR posting.  I do agree that TRUE species at Risk need to be protected but the way they have been done for the past 10 years is not working.  Some of my suggestions when going forward is that only TRUE species using TRUE up to date science be used to classify these.  Absolutely no HYBRIDS should be aloud to  be protected.  When looking at a species there needs to be more emphasis on what this will do to the whole eco system.  Why are there numbers low?  Maybe they are at the range threshold and the climate and eco-system can not support them.  Grey fox for example,  they are listed due to low numbers but there are tremendous amounts of gray foxes in the North American landscape and they are very abundant.  Ontario borders  are just the most Northern range for there territory, and we will never have any amount as they have reach there northern range so are they really Threatened.  The answer is no.  You need to look at the species range entirely not Ontario's man made boundaries.  Animal don't have these boundaries.  When a species reaches threatened there need to be a longer period put in place to monitor these species and do some True science so you can see what the levels are going to do over a five year period.
There should be a mechanism in place that the Minister can over rule a classification if he or she feels that it was done without evidence or with bias.
When you make your recovery strategy look out how protecting one species and effect another species and the eco system.
Some may not want to believe but there are winners and losers in the eco system and sometime there is nothing you can do about certain species no matter what you do.
Here is just a few thoughts I have that could improve how you work with species at Risk.

Hydro One is Canada’s largest electricity transmission and distribution service provider; we transmit and distribute electricity across Ontario, home to 38 per cent of Canada’s population. Our values guide us to work relentlessly with our employees and those who work for us to achieve world-class environmental performance. We will strive for continual improvement of our health, safety and environment management system and will deliver electricity to our customers and manage our operations in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. Please find our recommendations below for your consideration.
Project Registration Timing:
The requirement to register maintenance projects under section 23.18 of O. Reg. 242/ 08 (Threats to health and safety, not imminent) in advance of undertaking work results in an inefficient process that leads to over registration. The scale of Hydro One’s maintenance work is province wide and year round; Species at Risk are one of many considerations and requirements that have to be satisfied when scheduling and carrying out our work program. Often, the most effective way of minimizing /eliminating impacts to Species at Risk and their habitats is by modifying our work schedule to avoid sensitive times of year (e.g. breeding, hibernating, etc…).  We are not always able to guarantee project timelines due to the nature of our scheduling. As a result, we are often forced to register projects that may have an impact to Species at Risk or their habitats to ensure legislative compliance.  We propose the option to register projects after maintenance work has been carried out. This will ensure that only appropriate registrations are provided to the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks, reduce administrative burden, and give more accurate information on actual impacts to Species at Risk and their habitat.
Regional level approach and a new conservation agreement:
Consideration should be given to larger scale agreements or registrations. This would allow for a more coordinated approach to Species at Risk habitat restoration and protections. The current framework results in fragmented restoration strategies based on individual project impacts. Further, overlapping and sometimes conflicting Species at Risk mitigation and recovery actions necessitate a higher level regional agreement that incorporates all known conditions to achieve positive outcomes for Species at Risk.
Stewardship/safe harbour agreement regulations are not suitable for our industry as they are currently written. The requirement for a defined conservation period precludes participating in many conservation actions. Hydro One’s requirement for unimpeded access to infrastructure assets for planned and unplanned maintenance is not compatible with habitat protection measures that have a defined term. A solution could be to include a provision allowing proponents to undertake necessary maintenance operations in areas covered under a stewardship/safe harbour agreement.
Species at Risk habitat protections limiting the ability to undertake required asset maintenance is currently a disincentive to engage in conservation activities.  A more comprehensive solution could be to create a new type of voluntary conservation agreement that incorporates the need for required maintenance work into a regional level framework that encourages creation of Species at Risk habitat. This agreement could include a vetting process whereby the regulating body would determine if an individual or an organization qualifies based on a relationship of trust and historical compliance.  Allowing for necessary industry activities with approved partners, following a defined conservation agreement would give the regulatory certainty for proponents to carry out voluntary Species at Risk conservation activities. These activities would occur on land that would otherwise not be considered for Species at Risk conservation due to the requirement for access and other work activities.  This type of agreement would ultimately promote beneficial actions for Species at Risk by providing a new framework that industry can use to participate in voluntary conservation actions while not compromising necessary operational or maintenance requirements.
Habitat Banking:
Habitat banking is a market-based environmental solution to ensure that impacts to the environment caused by development are offset by compensation and/or mitigation measures. The Government of Ontario could explore the creation of a fund in lieu of existing requirements to ensure a coordinated response and protections to benefit Species at Risk. Currently, proponent-led and project-based permitting results in fragmented efforts across the province. Habitat banking has the potential to focus on locations and/or Species at Risk where the most benefit could be gained through conservation activities, particularly where site specific recovery/mitigations are difficult or not practical.
We welcome the opportunity to discuss our comments and look forward to continuing to work with the Government of Ontario to find a balance between industry needs and species habitat protections that facilitates positive outcomes for Species at Risk in Ontario.

23620,/comment/23620,"To whom it may concern,
I think a more landscape approach is beneficial. A lot of the housing developers (especially in Ottawa where I am from) have been able to get through loops in the system because of the current case-by-case and species-specific approach. A single site can have multiple species at risk or endangered present and non-endangered species rely on these species for the overall health of an area. ""Specific geographic areas or ecosystems where the needs of multiple species at risk can be addressed"", I think is the best possible way to achieve a more broad and strategic approach.
The KNL development of the South March Highlands in Ottawa was a prime example of what this proposed change to the Act could have influenced on the outcome. I saw first-hand the clear cutting of native at-risk trees and the removal of Blanding’s Turtle habitats from land grading by housing developers in my city because they are getting through loops in the current system. Currently if only 2 or 3 species at risk are mentioned in an application and the developer has ""reasonable"" alternatives for mitigating the habitat loss and there is an “overall benefit” then the project gets the green light. KNL’s proposed measures consisted of no more than mitigation, for example, the extensive fencing that would be erected to channel Blanding’s Turtles into corridors and construction of new nesting and overwintering sites that they hope the turtles will make use of. These are experiments; that they would be an “overall benefit” is speculative.
Even if 1 of the 3 species were not found or present on the site for the few days the biologist (hired by the developer might I add) was there, the project still gets a green light. The Act allows some activities to proceed under a clause 17(2)(c) permit with specific conditions if: avoidance and reasonable alternatives have been considered. This is a fundamental misinterpretation of the legislation. When the Endangered Species Act refers to “reasonable” alternatives, it means reasonable with respect to achieving the objectives of the Act, as in, the protection of the endangered species. The profit of a developer does not come into it.
Pin-pointing a few species at risk in an area and formulating a few management strategies for each individual species in an application is a one-dimensional approach than if an entire geographic area were in question. The way species interact with one another is far grander than containing and reducing an area down to 2 or 3 species.
THE PROVNCE NEEDS MORE POWER. Habitat protection is under the Act. But a species-specific approach has allowed the developer to continue habitat and species destruction because the land, the boundary, in which endangered species lives on is not officially protected. Even though endangered and at-risk species are present the developers are able to come up with a few strategies for mitigation and are light on the fact that “some” of these species will be killed in the process. A landscape approach would fill the gap in the missing legislation.
Habitat boundaries of endangered and at-risk species should be heavily analyzed if the province wants to transition to a landscape approach to implementing the Endangered Species Act. Species on the at-risk or endangered list found in an area should not be up for debate in a proposed development site. A landscape approach would mean more land would be out of the question for development. I am not so sure this would yield the economic activity the province is hoping for but it certainly is a step in the right direction for saving and securing the habitats of endangered species.

23621,/comment/23621,"These protections were brought into place because these endangered species do not have the means to protect themselves from the encroachment of humanity, specifically of human businesses who value profits before any other considerations. Changing the act to look for ""efficiencies"" AKA cuts that will allow businesses to do as they wish, is EXACTLY what the act was made to prevent. And anyways, the amount of lawsuits brought forth by environmental groups if the act is changed means the government will likely LOSE money, not save it.

23623,/comment/23623,"A review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act could be exactly what wildlife need, but the government’s emphasis on creating “efficiencies for business” could make it even easier for industry to disturb and pollute nature where at-risk species need protections most.
According to World Wildlife Fund Canada, Ontario is home to 243 species at risk of extinction. Already, routinely granted exemptions to the Act make it far too easy for development and industry to tear up and cut through critical habitat. Changes to the Endangered Species Act should improve protections, not water them down even further.
This review won’t help species at risk if it doesn’t address exemptions that make it too easy for business and industry to do even more harm to critical habitat. Clearly defined no-go zones protect wildlife – while creating efficiencies for business by making it clear where development won’t be permitted.
We need protections that lead to recovery for species-at-risk in Ontario – we don’t need changes that will drive more species to extinction.
Half of Canada’s wildlife are in decline – by a whopping 83 per cent. Provincial governments must be part of the solution.  Please ensure that the Endangered Species Act truly protects wildlife and that it does not put business interests first.

To the Public Input Coordinator,
Comments:  EBR Registry # 013-4143:
10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act (ESA): Discussion Paper
We are writing on behalf of Animal Alliance of Canada, the Animal Protection Party of Canada, Born Free, Ottawa-Carleton Wildlife Centre and Zoocheck.  We are dedicated to protecting abundant wild species in order to prevent their endangerment from human activities.  We also support Ontario’s Endangered Species Act which is designed to protect those species already threatened with extirpation and extinction.
Therefore, we are very concerned with the direction taken in the “10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: A Discussion Paper”.  We hoped that the Review would provide an opportunity to strengthen protection for species at risk and address the failed implementation by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry as highlighted by the Environment Commissioner.
Instead, the discussion paper suggests changes that will not enhance the protection and recovery of species at risk and will not improve the implementation of the permitting process but will make it easier for industry and development representatives to proceed with activities that will harm the species and their habitats.  In addition, the Minister’s possible resolutions to the “challenges” highlighted in the Paper would undermine science-based listing, mandatory habitats protection, and legislated timelines for planning and reporting.
Focus 1 – Landscape Approaches:
The current Act already allows for both individual species protection and recovery and where needed, multi-species recovery strategies.  This paper seems to suggest that the Minister considers the ESA as an impediment to business interests and a “challenge” to planning and development activities.
The current Act allows for approval of activities where mitigation measures will protect species at risk.  In other instances, the Act prohibits activities where mitigation measures will not work.  Our assumption is that the “authorization measures” referred to in the challenges section would allow activities that would in fact harm species at risk and their habitats.
As a result, we oppose any changes to the Act that would allow planning and authorization on a broad scale because it would undermine the intent of the Act to protect species at risk and their habitats.
Focus 2 – Listing Process and Protections for Species At Risk:
It is imperative that the science-based listing of species and the automatic protection afforded species and their habitats remain intact in the Act.  Changing the Act to allow for ministerial discretion of the automatic protections will only make the listing and automatic protections process politically driven as opposed to science-based. We are opposed to changes that would allow the Minister discretion to remove or alter protections for both species and habitats.
Focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations:
In this section the Minister raises concerns about the timelines required under the Act, including the 9 month timeline for the Government Response Statement and five years for reporting on the progress toward protection and recovery of a species.  The Minister also highlights “challenges” with the development of habitats regulations for at risk species.
We would argue that both timelines are reasonable and speaks to the urgent need for protection for both threatened and endangered species.  We would also argue that habitats protection for these species is critical to the reversal of their status.
Instead of weakening the legislation by undermining required reporting times, we urge the Minister to enhance the Species at Risk programme within the Ministry in order to meet the timelines set out under the Act.
Focus 4:  Authorization Process:
The importance of the Act is that it prohibits harming, harassing or killing of a species listed as threatened or endangered and it prohibits damage or destruction to their habitats.  The Act already allows the government to issue permits or authorizations that would otherwise not allow such activity.  It is our view that the ESA provides sufficient flexibility through the authorization process and we oppose providing more ways to circumvent the intent of the Act.
The “challenges” as listed in this section use such language as “administrative burdens”, “barriers to economic development” and “duplication and delay of activities”, which are all business-related concerns.
Not once does the Minister include the “challenges” faced by the Ministry and others to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats.
Recommendations:
We recommend that the Minister:
1.	Require that any amendments to the Act and Regulations should strengthen protection for species at risk and their habitats.
2.	Enhance the Species at Risk programme within the Ministry in order to meet the requirements of the Act.
3.	Maintain the science-based listing of species and the automatic protection afforded species and their habitats.
4.	Eliminate consideration for ministerial discretion to delay or remove those protections.
5.	Maintain timeline requirements for Government Response Statements and Reviews.
6.	Maintain the current authorization process which would prevent simplification for exemptions and would maintain requirements for Section 17(2) permits that would be issued only under exceptional circumstances for activities “that result in a significant social or economic benefit” provided that they do not jeopardize the survival or recovery of the species.
Conclusion:
An Ontario that is “open for business” does not have to be an Ontario that is uncaring about protecting Ontario’s wildlife and its habitats.  This is particularly true for species at risk.  We urge you to strengthen, not weaken, the ESA.

There are a few politicians and an independent expert you need to go through to get the permit but lobbying is a big concern of mine.

There's nothing saying that the expert's opinion will affect the final decision. That's a big concern for me,  and I would much prefer several experts would need to come to a consensus on whether or not the species would be adversely affected and if they decide the species would be, then no politician can allow the exemption to be made.

23628,/comment/23628,"I think the most important thing to remember as you rip apart the endangered species act is the precautionary principle, per the protection and recovery of species legislation.
(3) In preparing a strategy under subsection (1), the persons who are preparing the strategy shall consider the principle that, where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. 2007, c. 6, s. 11 (3).
Also important is the *purpose* of the act:
1. The purposes of this Act are:
1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.
2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.
3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.
A few other motherhood observations:
Extinct is forever
Businesses don't go extinct. Wildlife does and is.
We no longer have a science advisor or (soon) and environmental commissioner to advise and oversee your legislation and its effects.
Now to your discussion paper...
I'm not 100% sure what a 'landscape approach' is, but if it means truly protected areas, then I would suggest that
a) we need large amounts and they should be connected
b) with climate change, we can't be sure that areas protected today will be suitable in the future
c) protected areas need buffers
Overall, your discussion paper reeks of putting development ahead of the environment. Just as you tried to do with Bill 66.  The legislation was already weakened under the previous government to enable development.
One of your discussion questions is
•In what circumstances would a more strategic approach support a proposed activity while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk?
Note that your main goal is to support [development] activity. The legislation is supposed to be about protecting species.
Your discussion paper lists the following as a 'challenge'
•There is not enough public notice before a new species is automatically listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List.
•In some cases, automatic species and habitat protections can contribute to high uncertainty and costly impacts to businesses and the public.
And one of the associated questions is
•What changes would improve the notification process of a new species being listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List? (e.g.,longer timelines before a species is listed.)
Please explain, transparently, how on earth longer timelines would help species at risk.  I think a longer timeline is counter productive. Remember the precautionary principle.
Other related discussion questions:
•Should there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections? (e.g., longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat.)
Longer transition periods don't appear to help endangered species, nor does removing or delaying protections.  Remember what the original purposes of the act are.
•In what circumstances would a different approach to automatic species and habitat protections be appropriate? (e.g., there is significant intersection between a species or its habitat and human activities, complexity in addressing species threats, or where a species’ habitat is not limiting.)
The idea is to protect species and their habitat from being destroyed by human activity.  Significant interaction implies it is even more important to implement automatic species and habitat protection.
Your next set of 'challenges' includes
•In some cases, the time limit of nine months to develop the Government Response Statement for an endangered or threatened species is too short, and there is no option under the Act to extend this timeline when needed.
The associated question was
•In what circumstances would a species and/or Ontarians benefit from additional time for the development of the Government Response Statement? (e.g., enable extending the timeline for the Government Response Statement when needed, such as when recovery approaches for a species are complex or when additional engagement is required with businesses, Indigenous peoples, landowners and conservation groups.)
I don't see any such circumstances.  What causes the time to be too short? If you need more resources, then employ them.  And as always, apply the precautionary principle.
Your discussion paper also cites this challenge:
•In many cases, conducting a review of progress towards the protection and recovery of a species within five years of the Government Response Statement is too soon.
Then provide independent expert analysis of why it is too soon.
In the context of authourizations, your discussion paper asks
•What changes to authorization requirements would better enable economic development while providing positive outcomes and protections for species at risk? (e.g., simplify the requirements for a permit under s. 17(2)d, and exemptions set out by regulation.)
I looked up s.17(2)d and found:
•Significant social or economic benefit permit, s. 17(2)(d): A significant social or economic benefit permit may be issued for an activity that will result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario, but the activity would have impacts that are otherwise prohibited under the Act.
Again, use the precautionary principle.  The NEB recently used similar twisted reasoning to greenlight the TransMountain extension *despite finding it would have significant negative impacts on at least one endangered species*.
That is unjustifiable and flies in the face of the purpose of endangered species protection legislation.
In closing, I would ask that you *improve* endangered species protection as opposed to opening their habitat up for business.

23629,/comment/23629,"Review of Ontario's Endangered Species Act
I spent my career working as an environmental scientist. It is clear to me that the environment in Ontario has dramatically improved over the past 30 years, although this is not widely appreciated. This improvement is in-part due to public pressure, in-part due to improved government environmental regulation and in-part due to a more pro-environment (green) approach by business. There have been drastic reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, boron, lead and arsenic largely from Ontario industrial sources but also from motor vehicles. We have seen improved use of road salt, a huge improvement in the recycling of materials as well as the storage and handling of waste in general. To say that these improvements have been a detriment to business, is simply untrue. Similarly, in protecting endangered species, businesses and individuals are forced to rethink and/or redesign projects, which is not necessarily negative for long-term business interests. Not all business ventures are good for society, the community or even the long-term prosperity of Ontario or the businesses themselves. Focusing on one species, such as a turtle, may seem extreme but this forces those involved to look at the broader landscape, habitat and toxicity issues.
A review of the Endangered Species Act is appropriate and I agree that the government has to do a better job in clarifying regulations and providing useful and easily accessible information to the public and industry. Nevertheless, the mark of a society is how it protects its most vulnerable, including species in the natural environment in general and endangered species in particular. The following comments made by the Canadian Wildlife Federation accurately reflect my concerns regarding revisions to the Endangered Species Act.
1. Landscape Approaches
I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23630,/comment/23630,"Weakening the Ontario's Endangered Species act, as I'm sure you're aware your proposals would-- is a dangerous threat to the Ontario we love:  our wildlife, our great outdoors, our precious ecosystems.
Ontario's economy has not been hindered by this act: we have a low unemployment rate, and have experienced significant growth during the time this act has been in place. (see link)  In contrast, some endangered species in our province have seen a 60% reduction.  They are in grave danger and need our protection!
Protection delayed is protection denied.  The proposals you label as 'discussion' items are illogical, generally boiling down to delay tactics to allow unsafe development before legal protections of endangered species can be enacted.
If a species is endangered by your independant scientific office, that means it's survival is in jeapordy AT THE TIME it has been listed as such.  Creating bureaucratic delays in the official status is essentially to delay communication, in other words misinform the public and the business community.  Whether a species is in danger is NOT a ministerial decision, it is a scientific reality which is decided, as currently, by an independent, non-partisan body.  IF a species is truly endangered, it requires immediate, and yes, automatic help!  Would you deny a sick pet or child immediate attention if you saw they were dying?  Let me remind you, that a 60% reduction in a species means 60% of those precious creatures who made our province the rich, natural wonder it is, are now dead!
These 'discussion' proposals complain of processing time taking too long, then propose to add additional delays to status updates.  This makes no sense.  If the process takes too long and creates instability for the business community (where is your evidence of this?), it is the government's responsiblilty to communicate changes more clearly, in a more timely manner.  The WWF report on endangered species in Canada (see link) points to a more likely cause of delays in this process, underfunding.
Finally, if a species is in danger, it's survival depends on habitat that must be protected. There is no question of whether this is 'warranted' or not, and a general conservation fund does not make up for precious, specific habitats lost.
If any changes are made to the Endangered species act, they should be to strengthen it.  There is already an over generous provision allowing leniency when 'Significant social or economic benefit' is considered.
Please look around you at the state our planet is in.  Consider the science responsibly.  Honour your duty to Ontarians present and future.  Don't undermine the barest protections we have.

Please consider:
-  a permanent ESA Section 55 regulatory exemption for the forest sector
- continue to manage for at-risk species through the CFSA, in balance with other social, economic and environmental objectives
- ensure species prescriptions are developed with input from forest practitioners, affected stakeholders and rights holders, to ensure they are workable

RE: Forest Sector Requires Permanent Regulation Followed by Workable Species at Risk Policy After 10th Year Review of the Endangered Species Act
To Whom it May Concern:
As the employee of a medium sized North Western Ontario forestry company, Obishikokaang Resources Corp./ HME Enterprises, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. We look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA); either through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, we must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is our understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. It is our expectation that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further, we remain extremely concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with us and the Ontario Forest Industries Association well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.
Sincerely,
Robert J. Auld

23640,/comment/23640,"One of the most significant challenges for site operators, particularly of quarries are large manufacturing sites is the changing requirements.  Quarry operators are required to develop site plans decades in advance and may operate anywhere for a few years to several decades.  When new species are added they can impact the final or progressive rehabilitation of these sites and lead to additional cost and administrative burdens that were not foreseen.  With that in mind, the following is recommended:
- listing of species in an area should be the result of the species being at risk or threatened in the affected area.  For example, if a tree species is rare in southern Ontario, but abundant in eastern Ontario, it should not all be listed the same.  Similar to fauna as well.  Also, if a species is listed at risk on the federal level, it should not automatically be added to the provincial level.
-Species that are listed at risk or threatened due to lack of data should be removed immediately from the list.  Care and diligence should be taken for species with minimal populations numbers rather than list individual species as a result of not having enough information.
- the affected species and compensation should be prioritized with a clear objective.  For example, creating more habitat for bats, will not necessarily help their resistance to fungus.  However, if the goal is to create more roosting habitat, then that should be the compensation when bat habitat is moved.  Often, sonar tracking can be required to confirm that bats use a particular area, which is expensive, inefficient and not effective.  If the goal is create more bat habitat, then that should be the objective and required under the act.  Special permits should not be required.

23643,/comment/23643,"In the introduction of this discussion paper, it is written that the government is “committed to ensuring that the ESA provides stringent protection for species at risk”. However that does not appear to be the intent of any of the rest of the document’s contents.
All of the challenges and discussion questions listed are highly biased towards helping businesses and developments increase profits while side-stepping any responsibility for local species at risk.
In particular, allowing companies to pay into a “conservation fund” and then interfere with at-risk habitat & species located on their land is a terrible idea. Those species and their habitats would be lost, and no amount of money sitting in a “fund” would be able to bring them back. Ecology doesn’t work like that.
Also, bringing in “ministerial discretion” would be a bad idea. It would be unethical to allow decisions on species at risk to be politically driven instead of science-based.
For the other challenges that were listed in the paper – who raised those questions? Most of their concerns sound like they are just asking for improvements to the way the system is managed (i.e. better communication, more staff to conduct reviews, etc.), not an overhaul of the Act itself.
If the government really wanted to change the Act to ensure that species at risk are protected, then different changes would make more sense, like getting rid of those blanket exemptions that are currently in place for mining operations, hydro works, and the rest of them. Those exemptions really seem to defeat the point of the ESA.

23644,/comment/23644,"Thank you for the opportunity to add my voice to the public consultation on the ESA review discussion paper.
The science is clear that business-as-usual development and industrial activities continue to threaten the survival and recovery of wildlife in Ontario. What is needed is not greater efficiency for industry but, rather, greater efficiency to recover the province’s at-risk species.
I urge you to:
•  Focus on habitat-protection measures that are effective for the listed species and that simultaneously improve outcomes for multiple species at risk.
•  Work with other ministries to ensure coordination to limit cumulative impacts on the lands and waters that provide wildlife habitat.
•  Repeal the long list of exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development, approved by cabinet in 2013.
•  Amend the law to set a higher bar for creating exemptions through regulation by ensuring they cannot jeopardize the recovery of threatened or endangered species.
•  Ensure local communities benefit from activities to maintain and restore endangered species and their habitat, including rural and northern communities.
•  Support the continued leadership and critical role of Indigenous Peoples in conservation initiatives.
The role of native species in Ontario's ecosystems is vitally important, and the implications of allowing species to disappear are likely catastrophic.

23647,/comment/23647,"Overall the discussion paper is very vague and therefore it is hard to provide meaningful comments.  In trying to decipher the vagueness, it appears, despite the occasional phrase that the review is meant in part to help protect and recover SAR, that the intent of the review is to make it easier for developers and industry to impact SAR and their habitats.  As such, I do not support the review.
The discussion paper states that the ""Act has been criticized for being ineffective in its aim to protect and recover species at risk, for being unclear, administratively burdensome, time consuming and costly for applicants, and for creating barriers to economic development"".  A good discussion paper would include the source of this criticism and evaluate data that supports or refutes the claims.  As this was not done it appears that the province is simply taking claims at face value and contemplating changes without proper evaluation and analysis.  This represents irresponsible governance.
As far as I am aware, only the first criticism is backed with any data: the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario (ECO), the office the province irresponsibly decided to close, has outlined that data and made it clear that the previous weakening of the Act to include exemptions for industry were largely to blame.  As this discussion paper is focused on making it easier for industry, those data and the associated criticism is clearly being ignored.  It appears that only the unevaluated criticism by industry and their lobbyists is being heeded.
Having worked with the Act since its inception through my land use planning career, I completely disagree with all of the industry criticisms.  The Act is very clear, and the majority of administrative burdens, time, and costs that they bear is industry's own doing.  Slight administrative tweaks could improve the process somewhat (such as not requiring Ministerial approval of every permit - a time consuming part of the process with little value) but vastly larger improvements would be realized by industry changing their practices.  To be sure, industry's propensity to fruitlessly argue over every provision of the Act and poor submissions cause significant time delays.  If these criticisms have any substance, why isn't anything in the discussion paper aimed at improving industry practice such as incentives for good submissions?  Effective solutions are never realized by only looking at one side of a problem.
Despite the above, if the province was interested in addressing those unsubstantiated industry criticisms, it is unclear why it was decided to move responsibility for the Act to a different Ministry.  It is my understanding that only a small number of the staff currently implementing the Act are moving ministries to continue its implementation.  Far fewer staff suggests an increase in administrative delays.   Unless of course, the province is planning on hiring new staff (which will inevitably cause delays as they proceed through their learning curve) or the province is already planning to further dilute the Act and its implementation through more ""self-regulation""  or similar  (which is already shown to be ineffective in protecting SAR by the ECO).  If the latter case were to be true, the public consultation associated with this discussion paper would be a sham.  Would the province do that?  Time will tell.
The discussion paper indicates that the province is most interested in comments on the four areas of focus.  Below are my comments on each:
Landscape Approaches - Overall this section is extremely vague.  The ""challenges"" are unsubstantiated and it is not clear what the ""Discussion Questions"" are contemplating.  All that is clear is that the province is contemplating 'something' to make it easier for industry.  There does not appear to be anything that would help SAR.  As a guess, it appears that this section is contemplating 'trade-offs' whereby impacts to SAR and their habitats are allowed in one location due to some action elsewhere that is supposed to help SAR.  In addition to the fact that most scientific evidence indicates that we are generally ineffective at creating quality habitat, this sounds like a massive increase in administration with associated time delays.  Regardless, I do not support 'horse trading' SAR and their habitats.  All SAR and associated habitats should be protected fulsomely, not strategically.
Listing Process and Protections for SAR - The challenges are unsubstantiated.  For instance, the COSSARO website lists, in advance, what species are going to be reviewed and when that review will take place.  Further, anyone is welcome to provide input into the review including by attending the meetings.  The notion that there is not enough notice before a species is listed is ridiculous and can only represent shoddy industry practices in that they are not paying attention.  Similarly, the notion that COSSARO's process is not transparent enough is false.  Advance notice of assessments, the ability for anyone to participate in (and attend!) the assessment, and the fact that the reports are published online after the results are presented to the Minister provide evidence of the falsehood.   All of this can be found out within thirty seconds with an easy internet search.  The discussion questions are also problematic.  The first and fourth relate to the false 'challenges'.  As indicated above, there is ample notice of species assessments and anyone can provide any current science during the assessment.  Regarding the second and third, I do not support politicizing SAR protection and science.  This would result by giving the Minister power to apply, remove, or delay protections.  I do not support allowing impacts to SAR habitat because it is 'not limiting'.  This is a red herring - if the habitat is being used by SAR it is important to SAR.  Causing the species to look elsewhere for habitat it didn't initially choose represents an impact.
Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations - In general, I do not see the challenges in this section.  Without any substantiation, it appears to just be the province not doing its job.  The discussion questions are similarly perplexing.  Why would there be a need to extend timelines for a GRS due to complex recovery approaches?  The approaches are already outlined in the Recovery Strategy.  Why would engagement take longer than 9 months?  This is truly laughable considering the province is only engaging on the entire Act for 45 days!  How would a longer timeline for progress reviews improve outcomes for SAR?  Currently, there is very little funding for any of the approaches outlined in GRSs; therefore very little is done.  Extending timelines would not improve this.  Further, species data are not the only way to report on progress.  Funding monies provided, number of activities/projects implemented, amount of outreach conducted, etc. are all useful metrics that can be reported on in the first five years for every species.  These metrics could also be assessed against the species data obtained in future progress reports.  In general, this entire section appears to be bureaucratic challenges that are erroneously being disguised as scientific (or other) challenges.
Authorization Process - in general the challenges are bureaucratic in nature.  Fix government operations not the Act.  The recent move of responsibility for the Act does not appear to be fixing anything.  The first challenge is spurious.  If an applicant has to file numerous applications/registrations, even for routine activities, they are obviously undertaking an activity or activities with a high potential for impacts.  Why shouldn't they have to demonstrate that they are protecting SAR?  The discussion questions give many examples.  I absolutely do not support the creation of a conservation fund to allow proponents to undertake activities in SAR habitat without requirements.  This is very unlikely to support the protection and recovery of SAR.  Conservation banking could be effective but only if the current 'overall benefit' standards and project types as described in regulation are banked.  It is not clear what is being contemplated for a conservation agreement; however, as long as it meets the current 'overall benefit' standard and practice it could be effective (e.g. in Secondary Plan processes).  The examples of possible changes to authorization requirements are very unlikely to provide positive outcomes for SAR.  The 17(2)d exemptions are already being erroneously used and the registrations for all of the exemptions lack any government oversight or enforcement (as detailed by the ECO).  I do not support further relaxing of the rules to support economic development.  Finally, enhanced inspection and compliance powers is warranted in all cases - there is very little now.  However, changing the Act and its regulations means nothing if there are not resources (staff) to undertake these powers.  Without the resources, enhanced legislative power is just smoke and mirrors.  Good for marketing purposes but no actual improvement.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide my comments.  Unfortunately, I have little faith that my comments matter.  As reported by the ECO,  over 11,000 comments from the public on the Cap and Trade Cancellation Act were provided, including mine, with less than 1% of the comments expressing clear support for its cancellation.  However, the Act was still cancelled.  Why would I view this consultation any differently?  Sigh.

The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk.

2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is my understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. I expect that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.

For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with impacted stakeholders and First Nations well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.

23650,/comment/23650,"I am extremely concerned that this government seems to consider protecting species at risk as so much ""red tape"". I have two young kids, and the world they grow into will already be starkly different from the world I did. I want them to have the safety of a world with as much biodiversity as it is yet possible to preserve.
However, I am concerned that the Discussion Paper is a thinly veiled proposal to remove existing protection for the growing number of species at risk in our province and make it easier for industry to continue to degrade and destroy habitat and species-at-risk directly.
The ESA exists to protect and recover species facing extinction in Ontario. Therefore, I support only the direct strengthening of this ESA by:
- Maintaining that every species gets assessed by COSSARO, and if necessary receives a science-based Recovery or Management Strategy, a Government Response Statement and a Progress Report within existing mandated timelines. Any ""landscape approach"" must exist over and above species-specific regulations.
- Maintaining science-based listing by COSSARO, and abandoning the idea of allowing ministerial discretion regarding habitat and species protection under section 9 and section 10 of the ESA
- Preventing any appeal process to COSSARO assessments and subsequent listing on SARO
- Requiring all proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground, monitored and enforced overall benefit to impacted species and abandoning your proposal to create an option for such proponents to pay into a conservation fund to compensate for conducting activities that are harmful to species at risk
I ask that you commit to actual strengthening the ESA by:
- Repealing the exemptions created in 2013 to permit forestry, hydro and mining industries to conduct harmful activities to species at risk
- Repealing the exemption created in 2016 to allow hunting and trapping of the Threatened Algonquin wolf
- Amending section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and/or recovery of Endangered and Threatened species
- Affording section 9 and section 10 protection to any species that has been assessed as Special Concern in two consecutive assessments by COSSARO until such a time when the species' assessment results in downlisting to Not At Risk

23653,/comment/23653,"You state that the provincial Endangered Species Act (ESA) should ""increase efficiencies for businesses"", but this suggested change contradicts both the intended purpose of the ESA and the positive associations between a region's biodiversity and its economic potential. The ESA's primary purpose is to protect Ontario's environmental wealth, as represented by a diverse set of species, habitats and ecosystems. It is impossible to achieve the intended goal of the ESA without setting some limits on industrial development. Wild areas must be preserved, conserved, maintained and even expanded to ensure the persistence of ecosystem health. The future of this province and country rests on the ability of ecosystems to continue to support vital services, including: clean drinking water, carbon sequestration, eco-tourism and agricultural output, as well as other recreational uses. Deregulated expansion of industrial activities and land conversion will absolutely compromise these vital ecological services. I urge this government to abandon changes to the ESA that would compromise its ability to protect species and habitats at-risk, and focus on changes that set informed and achievable conservation goals. I submit these comments as both a professional biologist and a temporary resident who was proud to call Ontario home.
As a final note, I would urge the government to fully disclose all proposed changes to provincial legislation BEFORE implementing them, such that public input can be maximized and the full ramifications of the changes can be analyzed and fully understood by all. Neither the changes to the ESA nor Ontario's healthcare and education systems have been fully disclosed, and it is with great trepidation that I await this government's future changes.

23656,/comment/23656,"RE: ERO# 013-4143 Review of Endangered Species Act 2007
After reviewing the information in ERO# 013-4143, I can see the recommendations in this paper, if passed, will ultimately degrade Ontario’s wonderful natural habitats and unique wildlife. The direct result of this degradation will be a loss of support for the Progressive Conservative Party in the next election.
Over the past two decades a number of people have left the 416 region and moved into the 905 area. The main reasons for the relocation are; escaping the stress of the city, and enjoying the benefits of country or small town life. One main benefit is embracing the pleasure of our natural habitats offer through activities, such as hiking, hunting, fishing, boating, photography, or snowmobiling.
The 905 area has been a stronghold of support for PC’s, but if their tranquil country living is disrupted by environmental deterioration, these voters will be rightly upset and will place blame on the government in power.
As wildlife species become endangered or even extinct, there will be a negative domino effect on habitats which will directly affect the quality of life of these city escapees. Favourite fishing locations in cottage country will be less productive, hunting areas will have less game, forest areas will have less wildlife that people enjoy viewing. Top predators will have less prey, and will eventually invade residential homes in search of food, which includes pet food left in the open, or even pet themselves. This is already happening in my area. Again, voters will blame the government and punish them in upcoming elections.
The other group the PC’s need to concern themselves are the Millennial generation, who are highly attuned to environmental and wildlife issues. By the next election cycle, they will be the largest population cohort, and opposition parties will have a laser focus on their concerns. Millennials will not buy into the belief that “automatic species and habitat protections can contribute to high uncertainty and costly impacts to businesses and the public.” Species protection will trump business impacts in the eyes of these voters.
So it is important for this government to weigh the benefits of a policy that can “streamline approvals and provide clarity to support economic development” resulting in questionable wildlife and habitat protection against future voter disapproval.

23658,/comment/23658,"As a lifelong resident and taxpayer of Ontario, I am dismayed by many of the discussion questions proposed by the Ontario government as part of the 10th year review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act.
In this discussion paper, there is a clear emphasis on trying to reduce the level of protection provided to SAR in favour of economic development (e.g., generalization of habitat protection whereas many SAR require specific habitat sizes/features etc.).  Changes to the Endangered Species Act should improve SAR protection and foster population stability and recovery, not weaken and further endanger their survival it appears to be the direction of the review as indicated in the discussion paper.
It appears also that this review also will not address exemptions that enable business and industry to impact habitat considered critical.  If efficiencies for business is desired, one thing that business responds to is clarity, and so clearly defined no-go zones to protect wildlife and wildlife habitat where development won’t be permitted would be an excellent addition to a revised Act.
The stress on SAR, with increasing human population concomitant with poorly planned or weakly regulated land use planning/development, as well as current regulated but in some cases poorly enforced (due to lack of enforcement capacity) environmental pollution or habitat degradation regulations, is increasing exponentially in Ontario.  Ontario has the highest biodiversity of all of Canada in the most densely populated area, and the biggest stressor to SAR populations is loss of habitat.
Aside from the intrinsic value of wildlife and wild places to the people of Ontario, there is enormous economic potential and advantage to protecting and restoring natural habitat for SAR species including: drinking water protection; improved air and noise quality; decreased light pollution; recreation (passive and light active); and, finally, in one area that represents the most costly portion of Ontario government spending – health care.  This is because an increasing body of medical and psychological data is accruing that shows that protecting and restoring natural habitat (such as those needed by SAR populations), particularly in highly populated areas where developmental and industrial pressure is greatest, improves both physical and mental human health and thereby will result in significant cost savings by preventing and/or help treat acute and chronic physical and mental illness of Ontarians.
The above comments are applicable to all areas of focus especially 2-4, and I would like to include additional comments on Area of Focus 1:
Existing tools and processes that can be used include a rigorous cumulative effects assessment approach that documents and quantifies the incremental and total impacts of new activity or intensification of existing activity is recommended.  This approach needs to assess, at multiple geospatial and temporal scales how SAR (sub)population survival, maintenance or recovery (if any) is impacted by activity during the entire lifecycle of a population (breeding, overwintering, feeding, etc., i.e., any stage of the lifecycle that is relevant to the population existing in Ontario).  A true, robust cumulative effects assessment must consider activities and degraded habitat that has already occurred outside Ontario jurisdictions such as development along international migratory flyways, in order to understand the incremental effects of new activity in Ontario to a population.   Landscape level assessments need to include, for example, total habitat area, connectivity of habitats and access to (or barriers to) important habitat features required by SAR. Too many assessments only look at isolated effects of a single proposed activity or development on a population, rather than the cumulative effect of said activity or development on a landscape already impacted by past land use/land activity changes.

23666,/comment/23666,"The Ontario Woodlot Association (OWA) submits the following comments on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper.
1. The OWA is very much in support of protecting species at risk in Ontario. Species at risk are a very important to Ontario’s biodiversity. They typically occupy habitats that are declining and are themselves in need of protection.
2. The current approach to the protection of threatened and endangered species in Ontario has been focused primarily on legislation, and the development and enforcement of habitat regulations. This approach can create distrust and apprehension on the part of many private landowners and a fear that the presence of species at risk may somehow negatively impact how they use their land. A much more effective approach for protecting and restoring species at risk on private land is a stewardship approach that encourages landowners to protect and restore species at risk with no threat or fear restrictions to the use of their properties.
3. Most species at risk are located in southern Ontario, largely due to habitat loss. About 90 % of the land base in southern Ontario is privately owned. The government has no authority to trespass on private lands for the purpose of inventory or surveys for SAR. As a result, there is very little data regarding species at risk on private lands. The OWA welcomes the opportunity for research on private lands should the proper consultation take place. For example, many private land owners have interests in supporting the development of habitat for species that are at risk. Those that are interested in research and in participating in government programs, must be assured their land will not be governed away from landowner uses. Those uses include good forest management practices.
4. Currently there are some tools under the ESA that can encourage stewardship of species at risk.; i.e.
- Stewardship agreement, s. 16:  An agreement may be entered into under this section for activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species at risk.
- Protection or recovery permit, s. 17(2)(b): A protection or recovery permit may be issued for an activity that is meant to help a species at risk or its habitat, but the activity may involve actions that are otherwise prohibited under the Act (e.g., capturing or possessing the species).
- Overall benefit permit, s. 17(2)(c): An overall benefit permit may be issued for an activity that would have an adverse effect on species at risk or their habitat, as long as an overall benefit is provided to the species in Ontario through conditions of the permit. Providing an overall benefit to a species means undertaking actions that contribute to improving the circumstances for the species.
However, these tools are not widely used. There should be dedicated staff available to promote and assist landowners with these tools.
In addition, new programs should be implemented to expand stewardship efforts through partnerships with organizations such as the Ontario Woodlot Association who have direct links to private landowners.
For example, programs such the Alternate Land Use Services (ALUS) program is an excellent model to encourage private landowners to restore habitat for SAR.
5. With respect to Area of Focus 1 - A landscape approach would be an effective approach for protecting and restoring habitat for SAR. It is a challenge to implement a landscape approach in southern Ontario where private land ownership dominates. Enhancing the Natural Heritage Policy under the Planning Act to provide policy support for municipalities to develop Natural Heritage Strategies would be the most effective way to implement a landscape approach in southern Ontario.
6. With respect to Area of Focus 2 and the question; Should there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections?  Automatic species and habitat protections are for the most part ineffective on private lands due to a lack of inventory. The approach does not work well for a species such as Butternut, where the best and only chance of saving this species is through landowner owner cooperation to try to find trees with resistance to the Butternut canker. Removing barriers would facilitate greater cooperation.
7. Also on Area of Focus 2 and the question; How can the process regarding assessment and classification of a species by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario be improved?  (e.g., request an additional review and assessment in cases where there is emerging science or conflicting information.) Yes, we agree that for species where there is a lack of data or conflicting science additional review before a species is listed should be required. There is a desperate need for a provincial inventory of southern forests to determine what we have. Good management decisions are based on this information.

23669,/comment/23669,"Basically the existing Act is great and it doesn't need any major changes to it.
Area of Focus 1 - Landscape approaches:  No changes are needed to use the current legislation more effectively.  It has been used for the Woodland Caribou and could be used for other species.
Area of Focus 2 - listing process and protections for Species at Risk:  There needs to be regular updating  of existing tools, such as the CAOSSARO website, which would improve notification.  The information on upcoming meetings and the list of species to be assessed is almost two years out of date!!! It would improve notification to simply devoting more resources to updating the website regularly.  No changes are needed to automate listing and automatic species and habitat protection.  These mechanisms are the core function of the Act and to change them would be destroying the very reasons for which the Act was created.
Area of Focus 3 - Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations:  There is no need to change the timeline for development of the GRS or FYR or to restrict the use of habitat regulations.  The GRS and FYR are key to implementing recovery!  Oe of the main threats to species at risk is loss of habitat and requirements such as the habitat regulation are key to ensuring the appropriate amount and location of habitat is protected!
Area of Focus 4 - Authorization processes: The Endangered Species Act already has a suite of authorizations that enable activities to occur so there is no need to widen the suite further.  Overall benefits must be set up to give a benefit to the species being affected by an activity. An option such as donating to a conservation bank would not be species specific and would be much less likely to benefit the species.  Other options presented, such as simplifying permit requirements for s. 17(2)d would lessen the protection given to species at risk and be to their detriment!  Permitting requirements should not be weekend through regulations in the name of efficiency!  What is not clear and needs more resources is that there needs to be more sufficient inspection and compliance monitoring of existing permitting regulations!

Modifications and or amendements to the ESA for ""effectiveness"" is only to benefit aggresive development and further create encroachment into restricted, endangered, fractured habitats and species that are in desperate need of protections.
The system has been proven to work and there HAS to be a balance between both sides. This is irresponsible stewardship of a finite resource that once is gone is far more expensive and strenuous to rehabilitate.
Politics aside there is no further effectiveness that can be created from these changes only criminal short sighted negligence.

23672,/comment/23672,"The ESA is an effective act I believe for site specific projects such as a bridge, a housing development, a golf course or other area that is limited in size but has significant long term and acute impacts.  As a forester, the ESA is not an effective or particularly useful act for the health of our forests including Species At Risk.  I say this because:
1) the Crown Forest Sustainability Act provides protection for forest dwelling SAR and in a manner that considers all species - SAR or not,
2) forestry activities are NOT the reason species at risk in southern Region (i.e. snakes, turtles, whip-poor-will) have made it onto COSSARO's list. However, since they are on the list, government policy is overly restrictive and discriminatory against forestry workers and by extension their families and communities;
3) The ESA suggests under Section 17 and 18 permits or using a FMP as an instrument under the act but what sounds reasonable on paper falls well short in real life. Multiple species, large areas, over several years and many treatments (harvesting, site preparation, tending, planting, access) being involved makes these mechanisms overwhelmingly complex,  open to constant debate (e.g. overall benefit measures) and therefore uncertainty for forest managers and the logging community to plan and carry out the sustainable work they have been doing for decades.
4) When forestry occurs, there is no damage, destruction or harassment - there is only a risk - and most often a very very slight risk of damage, destruction or harassment.  Any rules, restrictions and overall benefit type of approaches should be reflective of this very small risk.  i.e. if someone is going to drain a marsh that is the home to Blanding's turtles to build a golf course, the rules and compensating overall benefit needs to reflect that certainty of harm and destruction.  When someone is merely harvesting in an area and driving down a forestry road with slow speeds, very little traffic and driver training (and with virtually no evidence of history of harm occurring), rules and restrictions should be a tiny fraction of those for the golf course issue.
Also, species that get listed on COSSARO seem to do so because of people passionate about that species - often by people with no local knowledge of the forests that resulting rules and issues that are impacted. Then, people start surveying for them and it turns out that populations are much higher than thought yet some biologists continue to convince COSSARO that the species should still be a SAR.  For example, I had a biologist in a field tour once say correct someone in the group that quipped there are hundreds of blanding's turtles. The biologist quickly said there are not hundreds, but only dozens. Then people start looking and recording and there are indeed obviously hundreds, if not thousands...yet the status continues to apply.  Why?  Where is the field based expertise..the local expertise. Someone studying turtles south of Toronto or Barrie have no experience what the turtle population is between Bancroft and Georgian Bay.
This brings up the point about why species are SAR.  Over development for urbanization, farmland, golf courses and a myriad of roads in southern Ontario i.e. south of the Canadian Shield should not be used to list species on COSSARO except as only a regional species...so as not to include many restrictions on the landscape that covers much of our Shield without that level of development. E.g. there are literally thousands of aquatic features for Blandings turtle across the GLSL Forest in which the Area of the Undertaking for Forestry on Crown Lands occurs.  Yet, it seems comparisons are being made to the level of development and lack of such features that still exist on the landscape in the 416, 905, 519 and the very southern 705 area codes.  i.e. Peterborough, BArrie, Ottawa, Cornwall, Kitchern, Collingwood and Chatham situations are vastly different than those of Bancroft, Cloyne, Algonquin Park, and Parry Sound.  Treating them as the same does a disservice to the economic well-being of Ontario, especially rural Ontario that relies on forestry and does very little to the very SAR the ESA is purporting to protect.  Regionalization of COSSARO listings should be used in conjunction with local field people.  There needs to be sufficient time for listings and how they may be applied as well.

23675,/comment/23675,"By removing or reducing these measures taken to protect endangered species to instead find “efficiencies for businesses” is absurd. Our main priority should be the protection of our environment and ALL living species within it. When we give business and corporations advantages -by overlooking the serious and devastating consequences reduced protective measures would have on endangered species and the environment- the Ford government is essentially saying they do not care about our province beyond their term in office. With data demonstrating the impacts of climate change on our environment, and the Ford government's promotion of frankly asinine and anti-environment policies (re: the removal of carbon taxes for businesses etc) we should be looking at ways to protect and support the many different species, and ecosystems in Ontario.
Without protective measures for endangered species, we could experience real consequences- we are in a position where we can work to sustain the longevity of these ecosystems and its endangered species or we could do what makes a quick buck.
Frankly, as a resident of Ontario I am appalled by the thoughtlessness of creating policy which offers less protection for endangered species. I am in support of policy that offers to ensure that these measure are regulated and enforced and that the environment is not destroyed for mere greed.

As a wildlife scientist, I endorse this general message from the David Suzuki Foundation.
In addition to the points made below, I am particularly concerned at the underlying desire in the proposed changes to extend timelines for the protection of species  and to life barriers to industry for developmental purposes. The idea that uncertainty in the risk posed by a development should be met with continued business as normal until proven that the development is truely a threat is ludicrous. We need to err on the side of caution. We need processes that will speed up the processes of protection and uncertainty should be met with species protection until we understand whether or not a particular action is a threat.
Thank you for the opportunity to add my voice to the public consultation on the ESA review discussion paper.
The science is clear that business-as-usual development and industrial activities continue to threaten the survival and recovery of wildlife in Ontario. What is needed is not greater efficiency for industry but, rather, greater efficiency to recover the province’s at-risk species.
We urge you to:
•  Focus on habitat-protection measures that are effective for the listed species and that simultaneously improve outcomes for multiple species at risk.
•  Work with other ministries to ensure coordination to limit cumulative impacts on the lands and waters that provide wildlife habitat.
•  Repeal the long list of exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development, approved by cabinet in 2013.
•  Amend the law to set a higher bar for creating exemptions through regulation by ensuring they cannot jeopardize the recovery of threatened or endangered species.
•  Ensure local communities benefit from activities to maintain and restore endangered species and their habitat, including rural and northern communities.
•  Support the continued leadership and critical role of Indigenous Peoples in conservation initiatives.
Hoping for a thoughtful review of current policey,

Re: 10 year review of the Endangered Species Act, ERO 013-4143
To Whom it May Concern:
As witnessed with the Oak Ridge Moraine Conservation Plan (ORMCP) in 2000 and more recently, the response to Bill 66, residents across southern Ontario including the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM), Greenbelt and Simcoe County, care deeply about the protection of habitat for all wildlife particularly Species at Risk.
The Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust was formed in 2000 by volunteers involved in the advocacy for the creation of the ORMCP under the Harris government with the support of MPP Steve Gilchrist (past ORMLT Board member). Since 2000, the Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust has worked with many levels of government to work within the land conservation framework and land-use planning in Ontario.
Our current Natural Heritage Mapping Strategy across the ORM, Greenbelt and Simcoe County uses a system that weighs the number of species at risk and assesses the priority of habitat protection required. The current Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection for the protection of the habitats of species at risk.
The primary cause of species decline in Ontario (as well as nationally, and globally) is habitat loss and degradation, primarily from development. Additional limits need to be set to prevent further decline, whereas creating greater efficiencies to expedite habitat loss is counter productive.
We highly recommend that the current ESA is not changed to allow faster implementation for business purposes. Its primary purpose to protect species at risk and must be strengthened, not reduced.

Susan Walmer CPA, CMA

23678,/comment/23678,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. I look forward in seeing improvements to the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to the forestry sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, below are other requirements that should be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is my understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. I expect that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further I am concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with impacted stakeholders and First Nations well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.

23682,/comment/23682,"I am opposed to any changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) that would reduce protection for Species at Risk (SAR).
It is difficult to take this discussion paper seriously, as it so clearly has such a strong ideological slant towards easing the Act in favour of development. One might think that this is paper was actually written by a pro-development lobby group, rather than our own government. Of the 12 ‘challenges’ listed, 4 (30%) refer to making things easier for applicants. Of the 14 ‘discussion questions’, 7 (50%) are framed around improving conditions for economic development. The ‘discussion questions’ are written in a leading way, laced throughout with pro-development opinions that have nothing to do with the actual intent of the ESA: to protect SAR. I will speak to each of the four focus areas outlined in the discussion paper, in the following paragraphs.
1.	Landscape Approaches:
The very first ‘challenge’ listed in the discussion paper insinuates that the ESA is limiting “the ability to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk”. The following discussion questions suggest that we might improve this situation by swapping out case-by-case studies with a landscape approach. Landscape habitat analysis and species tracking are useful tools, which are already widely used – this is not a new suggestion. However, these cannot in any way replace site-specific surveys. Part of what makes many SAR rare in the first place is a dependence on uncommon habitats or site conditions. Even those that require large tracts of habitat on a landscape level can also have site-specific requirements to support critical life processes such as breeding and overwintering. I am opposed to the idea of swapping out site-specific surveys for SAR and their habitat with a landscape scale analysis; both landscape scale analysis and site-specific analysis are needed.
2.	Listing Process and Protections for SAR:
Species are listed as SAR following thorough research, which is made extremely transparent and publicly available in the form of species-specific Recovery Strategy documents, Government Response Statements, and General Habitat Descriptions, all of which are easily accessible on the SARO website. The suggestion that more public notice is needed prior to species listing seems not to benefit the species’ in question. What benefit would increased timelines provide to SAR? If a species has been designated a SAR, it is in danger and protection is needed; in some cases a rapid response may be necessary. It is already not uncommon to find developers filling in wetlands, felling butternut, and trampling habitat of other species prior to proper site-surveys and/or prior to obtaining permits; providing more advance notice prior to listing would, quite frankly, just allow businesses or people with conflicts more time to conveniently erase those conflicts without fearing legal consequence. I’m not against a certain amount of “grandfathering” for projects that are near completion (although I still believe these should be reviewed and that ways to minimize impact should be incorporated), but a broad blanket policy to delay listing would not be an improvement to the ESA.
3.	Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
One of the highlighted purposes on page 2 of this paper is to streamline processes, yet focus areas 2 and 3 focus almost entirely on slowing the whole process down, to the benefit of big businesses, and the detriment of SAR. The fact that the government is having trouble meeting their own timelines on SAR matters should possibly indicate the need for increased staffing, rather than a rationale for slowing the whole process down even further. It is especially irritating that in the first discussion question listed on page 5 the example provided suggests that there may be some situations where slowed timelines are ”needed” because additional engagement is required with businesses and landowners (in addition to other groups, who might actually have valuable input). The opinions of businesses and landowners should have nothing to do with how SAR are designated or how the government treats listed SAR.
4.	Authorization Process
The second ‘challenge’ listed on page 7 of the discussion paper states that the requirements to obtain an authorization can be extensive, creating barriers to economic development. This is completely true, and completely necessary. The purpose of the ESA, as stated on page 2 of the discussion paper, is that it “provides stringent protections for species at risk”. The purpose of the ESA is not to protect, coddle, or save money for developers. The purpose of the ESA is to protect SAR. Making changes to the protection of SAR in order to speed things up for the sake of development would be a disgrace. Many would argue that the ESA already contains too many loopholes and exemptions. Please do not muddy the waters any further with “efficiencies” that might save someone a few dollars or a bit of time in exchange for our biodiversity and the health of our planet.
I am opposed to any changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) that would reduce protection for Species at Risk (SAR).

Dear Public Input Coordinator,
The Council of Tay Valley Township, in Eastern Ontario, passed a motion February 14, 2019 directing staff to comment on Area of Focus 4 – Authorization Process of the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper.
Tay Valley Township is part of two unique ecoregions in the province: the Frontenac Arch in the southeast of the Township and The Land Between in the northwest of the Township.  Council is aware of the high level of biodiversity found in the Township as a result of its position as the northern limit of many southern species and the southern limit of many northern species.
Much of the Township is still rural and it is on these rural lands, that contain species at risk habitat, that the Township wishes to focus its comment.  In Area of Focus 4, the Discussion Paper poses the question, “What new authorization tools could help business achieve benefits for species at risk? (e.g., in lieu of activity based requirements enable paying into a conservation fund dedicated to species at risk conservation, or allow conservation banking to enable addressing requirements for species at risk prior to activities).
Tay Valley Township supports the establishment of conservation banks similar to those established in 16 states, managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Tay Valley Township sees an economic opportunity for its  rural residents to be financially compensated for maintaining  endangered species habitat through conservation banks.
Finally, Tay Valley Township has a process related comment from working with development proponents and seeing how the permit process works.  When a proponent submits information it goes through many layers within the Ministry– information gathering form, authorization form, conservation permit form and goes up the hierarchy of approval within the Ministry.  Instead of coming back down the layers of approval and sitting on someone's desk while they are on vacation, etc., the permit could be sent directly from the Minister to the proponent.
If you are interested, more information on conservation banks, as described by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, is provided below.
“Conservation banks are permanently protected lands that contain natural resource values. These lands are conserved and permanently managed for species that are endangered, threatened, candidates for listing as endangered or threatened, or are otherwise species-at-risk.
Conservation banks function to offset adverse impacts to these species that occurred elsewhere, sometimes referred to as off-site mitigation. In exchange for permanently protecting the land and managing it for these species, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) approves a specified number of habitat or species credits that bank owners may sell. Developers or other project proponents who need to compensate for the unavoidable adverse impacts their projects have on species may purchase the credits from conservation bank owners to mitigate their impacts.
Lands used for ranching, farming, and timber operations or similar agricultural purposes can function as conservation banks if they are managed as habitat for species. Degraded habitat, such as retired croplands or orchards, may be restored. Linear areas or corridors, such as stretches of streams and their associated riparian habitat that link populations of species, may also qualify as conservation banks.
A conservation bank is a market enterprise that offers landowners incentives to protect species and their habitat. Landowners can profit from selling habitat or species credits to parties who need to compensate for adverse impacts to these species. Landowners can generate income, keep large parcels of land intact, and possibly reduce their taxes.
Conservation banking benefits species by establishing large reserves (200-300 acres or more) that function as compensatory mitigation areas for multiple projects. It costs less per acre to manage a conservation bank than the equivalent acreage divided among many small isolated mitigation sites. Larger reserves are more likely to ensure ecosystem functions, foster biodiversity, and provide opportunities for linking existing habitat.
Conservation banking also benefits the public by protecting open space and contributing environmental services such as nutrient recycling, pollination services, and climate regulation.
Conservation banks have existed in the US since 1995.
Conservation banking is not a substitute for avoiding and minimizing effects on listed species on-site. The purpose of conservation banking is not to encourage development of listed species’ habitats, but rather to provide an ecologically effective alternative to small on-site preserves which are not defensible or sustainable.”

Throughout my environmental career, I have worked as an environmental consultant, held positions within the non-profit industry, worked in a permitting role at a conservation authority, and am now a faculty member at Fleming College. I have been involved with species-at-risk issues in all of these positions and appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposal.
Throughout my career, I have watched as more and more species were added to the ESA. The ESA exists to protect species, primarily as a result of the impacts of human activities.  The current proposal’s direction to providing an “open for business” approach to environmental law and policy is not something that I support.
The transparent science-based listing of species by COSSARO provides certainty for species that is justified by research.  The species-specific listings are critical to learning more about SAR and help communicate this information with relevant professionals. Replacing these with a landscape-approach would not provide a scale of resolution fine enough to base law and policy upon.
Flexibility mechanisms for industry currently exist in the ESA. The options under consideration suggest an intent to make it easier for industry and development proponents to proceed with harmful activities. This direction is inconsistent with the purpose of the ESA which is to protect and recover species at risk.  Of the flexibility mechanisms I have seen, more oversight – not less – is required to ensure that, for example, habitat compensation and artificial structures are being implemented as required.
Habitat regulations provide ease of implementation and enforcement and should not be changed. The inclusion of areas where species used to live or are capable of living provide much-needed options for species recovery actions and should not be removed from legal provisions.
Improving the implementation of the ESA is certainly worth considering, but not at the expense of the strong regulations in the ESA that help to protect Ontario’s species at risk.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ESA review discussion paper. I have reviewed the document and am submitting comments based on my experience working as a biologist in Ontario for over 40 years. I support the stated intent in the discussion paper to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, however almost all of the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal.
I recommend that MECP:
•	Improves implementation of the ESA and not make any changes to the legislation;
•	Increase resources for additional staffing to handle any backlog and to respond in a timely manner to listings under the ESA;
•	Ensure that the public is informed of COSSARO meetings through the maintenance of an up-to-date website with information on the species to be considered for listing and date and location of the next meeting. Currently the website is more than six months out of date;
•	In order to improvement monitoring and ensure that information in status reports is current, enter into an official agreement with the Natural Heritage Information Centre, OMNR, to monitor populations of SAR and ensure that all populations of endangered and threatened SAR have been inventoried at least once every five years;
•	Consider broad-scale landscape approaches only for extremely wide ranging, mobile species, such as caribou and wolverine.  An example of the effectiveness of this is the Caribou Conservation Plan. However the vast majority of species cannot be adequately protected in this manner.
•	Collaborate with Ontario Parks in the protection of SAR;
•	Collaborate with NGOs, such as land trusts and the Nature Conservancy of Canada, in the identification and protection through land purchase of multi-species SAR hot spots within Ontario.
•	Initiate routine compliance monitoring for permits and authorizations;
•	Do not amend the ESA to “harmonize” with the CFSA. Do not renew the exemption for forestry or make it permanent. Instead, use section 18 authorizations, which exist for this purpose, retaining the requirement to provide an overall benefit to species negatively affected by authorized activities; and
•	Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process.
It is imperative that the following remain unchanged since they are the cornerstones to the protection of endangered and threatened species under the Act:
•	Maintain automatic species and habitat protections;
•	Maintain the primary focus on individual species;
•	Maintain the legislated timeline for public notice before a new species is automatically listed on the SARO;
•	Maintain legislated timelines for listing, recovery strategies, government response statements and habitat regulations;
•	Maintain legislated timeline for conducting a review of progress towards the protection and recovery of species; and
•	Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion.
If the government is determined to make amendments to the ESA, they must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end the following changes should be considered:
•	Providing legislated powers to conservation officers to enter private property and conduct an inspection to determine if activities are harming endangered or threatened species and to determine compliance with an authorization or permit.  Officers with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency have this type of power to allow them to inspect for forest pests;
•	In cases where authorizations for mitigation or rehabilitation are not going to be appropriate for meeting the recovery objectives of SAR, create a fund for the sole purpose of purchasing land or perpetual conservation easements for remaining populations of the SAR that is being impacted. This is particularly important for species that have complex life histories and/or habitat requirements. However it would be imperative that all inputs into the fund be tracked and designated specifically for the species that was impacted by a particular activity. The value of the contribution to the fund would need to match the cost of a land purchase or conservation easement for any remaining populations of the SAR;
•	Making the COSSARO selection process more transparent to the public;
•	Removal of the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries; and
•	Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species.
In 2013, exemptions were approved for many industrial activities, including logging, from prohibitions under the Act.  These legislative changes were extremely broad reaching and have had potentially detrimental impacts on Ontario’s SAR, although the extent is unknown because there were inadequate legislative provisions for monitoring of the exemptions.  As is evident by the ongoing Endangered Species Act (ESA) – Crown Forest Sustainability Act Integration Project, almost 10 years after the ESA came into force, forest management planning in Ontario still does not fulfill the requirements of the ESA and has been exempt. Ontario’s Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA, 1994) is not a duplication to the ESA. The ESA prohibits damage, authorizing otherwise prohibited activities contingent upon the achievement of an overall benefit for the species, whereas the focus of the CFSA is to “minimize adverse effects”.
It is quite disheartening to see that the government is again proposing changes that, for the most part, would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of Ontario’s most vulnerable plants and animals. I strong urge you to improve the implementation of the ESA and not to undermine the protection that the currently ESA affords.

23694,/comment/23694,"1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.

The current review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA) should be utilized to better protect the hundreds of species at risk in the Province and their habitat. It must not be used as a means of degrading that protection, which, alarmingly, appears to be the intent of the ministry’s 10th Year Review Discussion Paper.
The ESA was seriously weakened in 2013 with the adoption of exemptions to the prohibition on harming species at risk or their habitat. The current process appears to be aimed at further “streamlining” of procedures in favour of developers, and attacking the science-based nature of COSSARO assessments.
Therefore, I strongly oppose such measures and instead urge the following:
a) Eliminate the exemptions that were introduced in 2013.
b) Maintain the science-based COSSARO listing process. Listing should not be at the minister’s discretion.
c) Do not lengthen the process for COSSARO assessment and listing. It is already too long to the detriment of species at risk.
d) Do not change the 5-year review of progress process. We need to know if a recovery strategy is working, so that changes can be made when necessary.
e) Do not lengthen the timelines for the preparation of recovery strategy and government response documents. They are often late.
f) Developers must not be able to pay into a fund in order to allow them to harm species at risk and their habitat.
g) Protection of habitat for endangered and threatened species must be automatic, not at the minister’s discretion.
h) Habitat regulations can be very important to species with a limited range because they may included areas that were formerly but are not now occupied by the species, as well as areas to which they may expand their range.
i) Provide sufficient staff and funding to endure that various documents are prepared on time, strategies are implemented fully, and compliance monitoring is carried out.
j) Ensure that the ESA is fully implemented, which is not currently the case.
These steps will help ensure that Act is strengthened and species at risk and their habitat are better protected.

23697,/comment/23697,"Changes to the Endangered Species Act should improve protections, not water them down further. This review is not in the best interest to protect Ontario's endangered species, and is instead aimed to find efficiencies for industries that want to operate in the protected regions where these species live. This review won’t help species at risk if it doesn’t address exemptions that make it too easy for business and industry to do even more harm to critical habitat. I care about Ontario's continually declining species, and am highly concerned at watching them decline in record numbers. More needs to be done to protect them.
What I want to see in a strengthened species-at-risk act:
- Clearly defined no-go zones protect wildlife while creating efficiencies for business by making it clear where development won’t be permitted (no exemptions).
- Protections that lead to recovery for species-at-risk in Ontario.
- Remove the 2013 amendment that exempts a broad suite of industrial and development activities from the rules against harming endangered and threatened species and their habitats. These species can't be protected when providing exemptions (and making them more accessible like your new plan appears to).
- Improved communication and transparency of COSSARO provided to the public in a timely manner.

23698,/comment/23698,"I support the position of the CWF. Specifically,
1.Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.

23699,/comment/23699,"10th year review of the Endangered Species Act
The City of Toronto currently protects sensitive natural areas and species through the recognition of Environmentally Significant Areas in our Official Plan, as well as bylaws such as the Ravine and Natural Feature Protection bylaw and Private Tree bylaw. The purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to protect species in Ontario that we are at risk of losing. These species are the last of their kind on this planet, and as such it is of critical importance that we protect, monitor and use best practices to help these species recover. Ontario should continue to support this important legislation which supports, but does not duplicate our efforts.
AREA OF FOCUS 1 – LANDSCAPE APPROACHES
The City of Toronto already takes landscape approach to providing additional protection to Environmentally Significant Areas and areas that fall under our Ravine and Natural Feature Protection bylaw. Our landscape approach to protection is important for general habitat protection, however the Endangered Species Act is an added layer of protection for Species at Risk (SAR) and helps to guide the management of sensitive areas.
Some development and capital projects (such as park trails) are allowed in our protected areas and these projects can be designed to account for the presence of SAR if they are on site. This allows development to proceed, while minimizing or avoiding impacts to SAR if we know what they are, where they are, and best practices to support their recovery.
If the Province is to take a landscape approach, this could streamline the approval process by restricting development across a broader area where SAR may be present. However, in order to ensure the protection of SAR the regulations for this approach would need to be very strict. Having a species specific approach may actually give developers more flexibility in moving forward with their plans.
The landscape approach will not protect SAR that are located outside of a sensitive habitat. For example, a butternut tree in someone's backyard, or bobolink nesting in an old field, may be better protected through a species by species approach rather than just a landscape approach.
AREA OF FOCUS 2 – LISTING PROCESS AND PROTECTIONS FOR SPECIES AT RISK
Species should continue to be listed by COSSARO based on scientific evidence. The listing of species should not be swayed by political, economic or public opinion. As soon as a species is deemed at risk it should be listed as soon as possible. Any delay in listing could mean the extirpation or extinction of a species.
There are many uncertainties in development projects and business operations, however businesses should account for the need to protect SAR as part of their regular practice, particularly in any greenfield development. Clear communications to the business community about the Endangered Species Act's regulations can help to remove some of the uncertainty and assist businesses in making sound decisions.
COSSARO should modernize their communications to improve transparency and ensure that information around the assessment and classification of a species is clear or transparent. Decisions by COSSARO must be based on scientific study, review and consensus. These studies should not have any real or perceived conflicts of interest. For example, developers should not be allowed to present studies contrary to the scientific consensus unless performed by an independent body.
AREA OF FOCUS 3 – SPECIES RECOVERY POLICIES AND HABITAT REGULATIONS
There is no reason to extend the time limit of 9 months to develop the Government Response Statement if the review teams are adequately staffed and appropriate systems are in place to streamline and modernize opportunities for public engagement. There should be a process in place to update the GRS on an as needed basis if additional information comes to light. This may further restrict or potentially relax requirements of the proposed activities, depending on what new information is received.
There is no benefit to extending the five year timeline for conducting a review of progress towards the protection and recovery of a species. Reviewing recovery plans on a more frequent basis will allow these plans to be updated with new information and best practices. It may be beneficial to have a process in place that would allow updates to be made to the GRS on an as needed basis if new information comes to light, in addition to the 5 year reviews. Delays in review could also delay the possible delisting of a species, which would allow development to take place.
It may be helpful for the Ministry to provide guidance for the general protection of habitat when a new development or business operation is taking place. However, this general approach should not take the place of the need for species specific recovery plans. Providing additional support to businesses to better understand their roles and responsibilities in the protection of SAR could be provided by Ministry staff. A species specific approach can, in some cases, provide a developer with more flexibility in moving forward with a project.
There should be more transparency with respect to the development, submission and approval of mitigation plans. These submissions should be publicly available on the Ministry website. In so doing, it will make the protection of SAR more transparent to the public. In addition, sharing strategies and best practices between property owners who may have similar situations will make the development or updating of plans easier and will hopefully lead to a more speedy recovery of SAR if proponents are able to learn from each other.
AREA OF FOCUS 4 – AUTHORIZATION PROCESSES
Shortcuts to allow business to proceed must be done with the protection of SAR as the goal. If there are legitimate opportunities to streamline processes and reduce duplication that is fine. However, circumventing the process entirely by allowing businesses to pay into a general conservation fund does not make sense for SAR. Most species that are found on a specific site, may not be found in a similar habitat nearby. If SAR are introduced or transplanted to a different site there is no guarantee that they will survive or thrive in the new location. If a conservation fund option is developed, the funds must go towards protecting a specific species.
Conservation banking may be considered on a species by species basis. If appropriate, this is something that should be included as part of a species recovery plan. The province would need to monitor and regulate conservation banks to ensure that these areas remain protected and that the species in question are successful in these locations. There may be circumstances where conservation banking should not be an option, for example if the area to be developed is a large or significant area for the SAR in question. However, it may be an option for businesses to support conservation banks where they are impacting smaller habitat patches or where habitat for a specific SAR is marginal.
Conservation agreements or easement, registered on title, may be a good tool to address long term protection of the land. Provisions in the agreement should include specific provisions as per the recovery plans for species found on these sites. These areas must be monitored by the province or an independent conservation minded organization on a regular basis to ensure prohibited activities are not taking place.
Exemptions for significant social or economic benefit permits, s.17(2)(d) should not be allowed. There is no circumstance where a social or economic purpose should trump the potential extinction of a species.
These projects can be moved or modified to protect SAR. Situations where harm to humans is a concern, would be covered under the health or safety permit s.17(2)(a).
Additional comments
The Province should repeal the 2013 exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development industries. In addition, section 57(1)1 of the Endangered Species Act should be amended so that any future exemptions cannot jeopardize the recovery of endangered and threatened species.
Having clear regulations and communications regarding requirements under the Endangered Species Act can take some uncertainty out of the development process making it easier to finalize business decisions on where to best locate new development - away from sensitive habitat and species at risk.
This should not be any concerns regarding timelines for releasing or reviewing Government Response Statements if there are appropriate staff and other resources available to conduct this work. Staff should be available to support and provide guidance to businesses in modifying their plans to best protect these species.

23700,/comment/23700,"I am one of 5 property owners who are currently following the process to develop 10 (70' frontage) residential building lots in Lasalle, Ontario. Specifically the lots are on Brooklyn Avenue from 13th Street to Huron Church (170m). The parcel is about 1.3 hectares.
We have had the Environmental Study completed on the property and it is in review with the MNRF. We know that they have deemed a portion of this parcel as suitable Eastern Foxsnake habitat. There are no snakes there but it falls within the 1.5 km radius of a snake sighting.
This parcel of land already has a paved road running longitudinally down the center, however services need to be added to make them compliant building lots. Over 70 % of the parcel is currently being maintained as residential lawns to adjacent houses. There are trees, brush and weeds on the balance.
This 1.3 hectare of land is completely enclosed and ""land locked"" by busy residential roads. Two roads, Normandy and Huron Church Line are main thoroughfares with heavy traffic. There are residential neighborhoods completely surrounding this property.
The 5 individual owners of this parcel are not developers. We do not have the financial resources and contacts of land developers who can overcome the hurdles presented by the MNRF and other government entities. For the most part we just want to build family homes for ourselves and in some cases for relatives. We do want to sellout to a land developer who in turn will develop and sell these lots at a significant profit.
In summary, I understand and agree with the efforts to preserve ES habitat. However in this specific real example, the reality is that, in my opinion, no snake will successfully migrate to this parcel of land. If they do, chance of survival is slim given the vehicle traffic and the non natural threats totally surrounding the parcel. If a snake did settle here it would soon eliminate all small rodents and other food sources and it would need to move on risking certain ""death by traffic"". Additionally, the municipality maintains the road on this parcel such as snow removal and edge grass cutting. I am sure that they could use the additional property taxes from 10 upscale homes.
Please consider modifying the ES regulations to allow small land parcels that are completely surrounded by streets and houses to be developed. Alternatively, planners designating ES habitat should have guidelines that allow them to consider the chances of survival for endangered species on newly designated habitat.
Thank you for your consideration.

RE: Forest Sector Requires Permanent Regulation Followed by Workable Species at Risk Policy After 10th Year Review of the Endangered Species Act
To Whom it May Concern:
As the owner of a small, Northwestern owned-operated business, Sawyer Logging Ltd, with 4 people, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. We look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA); either through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, we must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is our understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. It is our expectation that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further, we remain extremely concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with us well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.
We would be happy to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the best path forward to ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk while keeping people in this province working.
Sincerely,
Trevor Sawyer

23707,/comment/23707,"I think that a balance of a landscape approach and species specific approach would cover a broad range of protections. I find it strange that protection approaches for individual species can conflict with each other to a great degree, usually by restoring or improving habitat for one species, you improve habitat for many other species... Funding for scientific research to develop tools to support management for species at risk at a landscape scale is needed. I don't think that a longer timeline is needed before a species is listed on the SRO list, because time is of the essence to protect endangered species! And as we know, the government is already quite slow. However, perhaps better public communication strategies could be utilized, including stakeholder involvement, citizen science, use of existing organizations, etc. It would also be beneficial to conduct an a priori risk assessment (doesn't need to take too long) for potential for high costs to businesses and the public--in many cases these may be perceived risks and not actual risks. I understand that 9 months might be too short to develop a GRS, but instead of extending this, maybe we need more efforts put towards these response statements. If this is a huge financial barrier, perhaps consider hiring more University co-op students for work like this. I think that enhanced inspection and compliance powers are certainly warranted across the board. What's the point to going to all this effort to (make plans to) protect endangered species, when people and businesses are not being compliant?
Overall, I want to see our timelines tightened, more species protected, stronger protections for existing species, more data on species that don't have enough data, more funding of researchers, and more funding for compliance and inspection. The conservative government has a long history of rolling back environmental protections, under the baseless assumption that this will somehow promote economic growth and opportunity. However, what science has shown us time and time again, is that humans receive innumerable benefits from intact, functioning ecosystems. And endangered species are often key to maintaining ecosystem functions. So our provincial government now has a chance to recognize the importance of protecting species at risk by strengthening protections in the the ESA. We humans have done an incredible job at over-fishing, polluting, deforesting, introducing invasive species, reducing landscape connectivity, building sprawling urban centres, etc. etc. etc. Thanks to science, we now know better than ever the consequences to our actions, and we have a serious responsibility to mitigate and restore ecosystems and the species within them.

Endangered species are protected because countless specialists around the world have looked at those species and said, ""For the continued existence of a healthy Earth (and thus, healthy humans), this species must be preserved, even at the expense of personal or financial gain.""

The Minister should also not be given the power to ignore the recommendations from COSSARO with respect to listing.
The implementation of the Endangered Species Act has always been challenging for MNRF as the program was never staffed or resourced properly.  Additionally, over the years the development of policies and technical guidance has been slow and minimal at best.

On behalf of our members, The Ontario Road Builders’ Association (ORBA) appreciates the opportunity to provide a written submission in response to the ERO posting 013-4143: 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper.
The Ontario Road Builders’ Association is the voice of the road building sector in Ontario. Our members build the majority of provincial and municipal roads, bridges and transportation infrastructure across the province. The road building sector directly employs in excess of 30,000 workers at peak season and impacts all Ontarians.
ORBA is committed to the principles of sustainability and environmental stewardship. We strive to promote best practices in environmental stewardship and project management among our member companies and the goals of reduced consumption of virgin resources, reduced impacts on the environment and reduced waste. In keeping with these principles, we support the government’s commitment to ensuring that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) “provides stringent protections for species at risk, while continuing to work with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of the program.”
We welcome the review and the consultation approach towards seeking opportunities to improve processes. Our members support an ESA process that is guided by the measures of responsible, reasonable, timely, evidenced based requirements, with clear protocols, adequate lead time for implementation, and efficient processes for review and decision making.
Transportation infrastructure projects in Ontario must be delivered in short time frames due to seasonal factors. Projects therefore require dependable work schedules that optimize all opportunities to complete the work in a timely manner. Delays due to uncertainty or lengthy, linear multi-party review functions are costly without necessarily adding environmental protection benefits. Ministry guidelines and timelines should provide for a dependable and transparent review process for ESA approvals.
We note that species are automatically listed based on Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) recommendations. Our members are of the view that identification of new species should be further reviewed and approved by the government. This approach would ensure transparent, evidence-based assessments with defined processes and timelines to resolve potential issues and presents an enhanced opportunity for government to fully consider the impact of new listing recommendations on transportation infrastructure projects.
We would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment, and we look forward to further discussion opportunities regarding this important review. Please do not hesitate to contact Andrew Hurd at 905-507-1107 ext. 223 if you have any questions or concerns.

During the past decade, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) has denied very few, if any, ESA Permit applications, yet our endangered species list continues to grow.  ESA Permits should be held to higher scrutiny and not approved in every case. In addition, ESA Permits should never be granted when a development is under appeal at an OMB or a Tribunal Hearing.

I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.
In closing, I want strong protection for Species at Risk in Ontario, which means a prioritization on conserving species at risk and the habitats they depend on through improved implementation of the Endangered Species Act in its current form.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ESA review discussion paper. Though I support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.

The government must ensure that enough staff are available to study species, prepare reports and process applications in a timely manner.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
-	Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
-	Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
-	Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.
-	Ensure that the government continues to fund projects related to species at risk recovery
Thank you for your attention.

Re: ERO #013-4143  10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper
To Whom it may concern,
The Quetico Foundation, established in 1954, is dedicated to the protection of wilderness in Ontario, with a particular focus on Quetico Provincal Park. Biodiversity in general, and the protection of species at risk and their habitat in particular, are of critical importance in maintaining healthy ecosystems across the province’s wilderness and other natural areas. Therefore, we view a strong and properly implemented provincial Endangered Species Act as a top priority.
Introduction
The Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA), when adopted, was considered to be a major step towards the protection and recovery of species at risk. Unfortunately, since that time the Act has been seriously compromised, especially in 2013, with the introduction of a permit-by-rule system with exemptions from the prohibition on harming species at risk or their habitat for many industrial users and developers. At that time, the Quetico Foundation joined many other environmental organizations in opposing those exemptions.
In 2013, the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario (ECO) discussed the new permit-by-rule system in a special report, titled Laying Siege to the Last Line of Defence: A Review of Ontario’s Weakened Protections for Species at Risk. The report outlined serious concerns with reduced protection for species at risk, lack of enforcement and reduced public consultation.
In 2017, the ECO’s Environmental Protection Report, titled Good Choices, Bad Choices. Environmental Rights and Environmental Protection in Ontario, re-examined the effectiveness of the ESA. The Report states that “The wellbeing and survival of Ontario’s species at risk has been dramatically undermined by the MNRF’s ‘modernization’ of its ESA approvals. Instead of individualized permits that require an “overall benefit” to species, the MNRF now allows many harmful activities under a permit-by-rule system that requires proponents only to minimize (not eliminate or compensate for) harm. To make matters worse, the MNRF turns a blind eye to whether proponents comply with these weakened rules and to the impact of the new system on species at risk. Meanwhile, the MNRF keeps the public in the dark about what activities it allows to harm species at risk, making it difficult to hold the ministry to account for this critically important program.” The report concludes that the ESA is generally sound but that “the MNRF has utterly failed to implement the law effectively”, the ministry is “failing to not just protect species at risk as intended under the law, but also to lead effective recovery programs”, and “the ministry’s compliance monitoring and enforcement actions for activities affecting species at risk are deficient”.
Also, in 2017, the David Suzuki Foundation, Ontario Nature and Ecojustice issued a joint report, titled Without a Trace? Reflecting on the 10th anniversary of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, 2007. It describes how the “regulatory exemptions fundamentally change the way the ministry addresses harm to species at risk. Circumventing the permitting process, which requires government assessment and approval of harmful activities, the exemptions allow activities to proceed without government review or approval, as long as development proponents register online and meet the conditions set out in regulation. There is no requirement, unlike permits, to provide an overall benefit to the species harmed and thus promote its recovery”. It concludes that “[a]s the regulatory exemptions indicate, MNRF has chosen to put the interests of industry first, over the recovery of Ontario’s most imperilled species”.
The ECO’s most recent (2018) Environmental Protection Report, titled Back to Basics, issues a stark overall assessment, stating that “Ontario’s species are under tremendous pressure from habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation, pollution, disease and parasites, and climate change”.
In summary, the ESA remains a powerful law for the protection of species at risk and their habitat, but it has been seriously compromised by the introduction of exemptions, a lack of proper implementation by the Ministry, and inadequate compliance monitoring and enforcement. These deficiencies must be addressed during the 10th Year Review.
The ESA and its 10th Year Review
The purposes of Ontario’s ESA are listed in the Introduction to the Act:
1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.
2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.
3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk.
The Quetico Foundation fully supports these aims. The current 10th Year Review of the ESA presents the opportunity to ensure that the Act is able to achieve its stated purposes and that it is fully implemented.
Unfortunately, however, the Discussion Paper that accompanies the ERO posting appears to mainly focus on the interests of developers and the reduction of protection for species at risk in the Act - by eliminating the science-based procedure for identifying and listing species at risk, extending the timelines for producing recovery strategy documents and further simplifying the permitting process for developers. As described below, the Quetico Foundation opposes all such changes.
Comments on the Discussion Paper:
Focus 1 – Landscape Approaches
The intent of this Focus is unclear. We support recovery strategies that are aimed at both the landscape (or ecosystem) level and the individual species level (both of which are available in the present ESA). A landscape approach can be beneficial for many species by, for example, helping to maintain or increase habitat connectivity. An approach aimed at the needs of individual species is also critical if they are to survive and recover. We believe that the landscape approach should augment, but must not replace the individual species approach.
Focus 2 – Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
The process for listing species at risk is already overly long, threatening their recovery. We oppose any proposal to extend these timelines. Species are currently listed based on the science-based assessment of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO). Species and habitat protection for threatened and endangered species is then applied automatically. We strongly oppose any change toward making these decisions political. The current COSSARO assessments are scientifically rigorous. There is no need for further review or assessment.
Focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
Recovery Strategies and Government Response Documents are often delayed (in some cases for years) to the detriment of the species at risk. We oppose any move to increase the timelines. Instead more resources should be made available to ensure that these documents are completed on time.
Reviews of progress are produced every 5 years and are critical to assessing the progress towards recovery and to identify problems with the recovery strategy in a timely fashion. We oppose any proposal to eliminate these reviews or to extend the timelines.
General habitat descriptions relate to the area currently inhabited by a species, whereas habitat regulations can also include areas that were formerly occupied by a species or where there is potential for the species to become re-established. While we agree that there may be cases where the general habitat descriptions are adequate, it is especially important to develop habitat regulations for any species with a limited range or that needs to expand its range to ensure its long-term survival.
Focus 4 – Authorization Processes
The requirements of overall benefits for species at risk are of fundamental importance to protecting species at risk. We oppose any proposal to permit developers to pay into a conservation fund as compensation for harming species at risk or harming or destroying their habitat. We do not support proposals to simplify the process for obtaining authorizations that harm species or their habitat. Compliance monitoring is inadequate, as discussed in the ECO’s 2017 Environmental Protection Report. Therefore, we support proposals to increase monitoring and enforcement.
Quetico Foundation Recommendation for the 10th Year Review:
The Quetico Foundation wishes to make the following recommendations to strengthen the ESA and ensure that it better protects the growing list of species at risk in Ontario.
1)	Exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and other industries that were put in place in 2013 must be eliminated, as they are a major threat to the recovery of species at risk and are inconsistent with the aims of the Act to protect and restore endangered species and their habitat.
2)	The current science-based nature of the COSSARO listing process must be maintained, and must not be replaced with one based on political decisions (e.g., at ministerial discretion).
3)	The COSSARO review and listing process should not be lengthened, in order that protection for species at risk be put in place in a timely fashion.
4)	The timelines for development of Recovery Strategies and Government Response Documents are critical to the recovery of a species at risk, and should not be lengthened. Currently, these documents are often late, and more resources must be made available to meet the deadlines.
5)	The current 5-year Review of Progress schedule should be maintained, as it is important to closely track the success or failure of a recovery effort over time.
6)	Mandatory protection of habitat for threatened and endangered species must be maintained. Habitat protection must not be a political decision (e.g., ministerial discretion).
7)	The current requirements of overall benefits for species at risk must be maintained, and developers must not be permitted to pay as compensation for harming species at risk or their habitat.
8)	General habitat descriptions only deal with the area currently inhabited by a species, whereas habitat regulations can include areas that were formerly occupied or where there is potential for the species to become re-established. Therefore, it is especially important to develop habitat regulations for species with a limited range or that need to expand their range to ensure their long-term survival.
9)	Strategies must be developed and resources allocated to address the currently inadequate implementation of the provisions of the ESA, to ensure adequate compliance monitoring and enforcement, and to increase public consultations.
We ask that these recommendations be incorporated in the 10th Year Review.
Sincerely,
Fraser Reeves
Executive Director
The Quetico Foundation

23731,/comment/23731,"Focus 1:
It is said that a landscape approach could support proposed activities but there needs to be examples provided of what these might be. This approach also indicates that it may be useful for authorizing activities. It would therefore appear that protections for species at risk may actually be lost.
A landscape approach may be useful for  terrestrial species but it would be questionable for aquatic species.
Focus 2:
The public notification process for new species listings could be improved by providing more information and/or news releases about potential listing earlier in the process. COSSARO and the ministry responsible should be “announcing” which species are being considered well in advance so that businesses and the public are aware.  Websites need to be updated and kept current. Currently the COSSARO website indicates the next species to be considered are for the next meeting, which is Fall 2018, therefore out of date.
It is said that automatic protection contributes to uncertainty and costly impacts.  The provision of “species considerations” well in advance would provide information to inform business decisions.  Should these species occur in an area where there is potential “development” then it is a risky venture and should not be considered for future development and this would avoid costly impacts.
Longer transition periods, removing or temporarily delaying protections results in lost protections.
Focus 3:
A general habitat description may be open to interpretation therefore a habitat regulation would provide better protection for species at risk.
Focus 4:
Enabling economic development (under 17 (2)(d)), in areas where species at risk occur will not provide protection for the species. Mechanisms need to be required to offset the harm, loss of species or populations. Repatriations in former ranges should be considered as acceptable offsetting measures.
With respect to the Overall Benefit permit 17(2)(c), we are happy with how this has been working as it contributes to the recovery of species at risk and is not inconsistent with our permitting processes.
We have been working with our counterparts in the MRNF to synchronize our permitting process and our biggest concern with respect to the 10-yr review of the ESA is potential changes that may result in the authorization process that aren't conducive to a coordinated approach. For example, we have been working very closely with the MNRF when issuing permits for Redside Dace projects and we have had comments from proponents on how well it has been working. Ensuring that a coordinated approach can be continued in light of potential changes to the ESA is of paramount importance.
We are happy to meet and discuss these issues further and look forward to continuing our work in the conservation and recovery of aquatic species at risk with our provincial partners under SARA and ESA.

If the government believes the current ESA to be ineffective, then push harder for conservation and invest more into science-based research and indigenous knowledge, not allow for greater development and further habitat destruction. So many species are already at their Northern limits and at the brink of extirpation from our province. This lessening of what small amount of protection they already have could be what finally causes our ""future generations"" to loose the gift of seeing our most iconic and at-risk wildlife in their natural habitats in Ontario.

23739,/comment/23739,"The discussion paper seems to focus on relaxing protections for endangered species rather than enhancing protection. This is distressing for the fate of our endangered species since a number of exemptions have already been given to industry. Extending timelines for the processes required to protect and report on results of endangered species protection will only reduce protections required to support endangered species. Instead adequate resources should be provided to ensure that assessment reports, recovery strategies, government response statements, habitat regulations and five year progress reviews are completed in a timely manner.
It is proposed that the Minister be given discretion to remove automatic protection for a threatened or endangered species at risk. This would reverse the science based process of classifying species at risk making the fate of species susceptible to political pressure.
The discussion paper proposes that an applicant be allowed to pay into a conservation fund rather than implement site specific measures to provide overall benefit to the species at risk. This proposal is worrisome since it is not evident that the species at risk would benefit from this.
Overall the discussion paper does not give due consideration to the importance of protecting endangered species and is more concerned with ""streamlining"" processes rather than putting emphasis on species protection.

23741,/comment/23741,"If the ESA is going to be changed by your Conservative government, it needs to be strengthened not loosened.  It is not the case that we have a strong law now which is onerous to business. The current law which the Liberals changed in 2013 is a joke.  It provides virtually no protection to species at risk as the government has never failed to give an exemption (""permit"") to businesses who harm species at risk.  Businesses that damage species at risk in one area should have to have an ""overall benefit"" to the species, by providing enhancements in another area.  Permits should also be individually considered and the public should be able to have input.  If the permit is given it should have to be posted on a public website with reasons why it was allowed and what they are doing to enhance habitat and conditions for the species.  Permits should not be a rubber stamp like they are now.  Currently, there is no enforcement of the weak ESA.  Any changes by your government will have to include staff in the field enforcing the ESA.
It is also important that the endangered species list be based on science and not politics.  We can't choose not to protect a species because it might be expensive or inconvenient.  Each species has a right to exist.  All species on the list need to have a recovery plan which is developed in a timely manner and needs to be actually implemented.
Environmental regulations like the ESA are not red tape.  They protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the species we rely on for ecosystem services.
By not strengthening the ESA, and potentially weakening it, you are not doing what is good for business, you are just picking winners and losers.  For example, if a quarry or forestry operation damages wildlife, they hurt the fishing industry and the tourism industry, but don't pay the cost for this damage.  You are benefiting some businesses while hurting others, this doesn't make sense!

23745,/comment/23745,"Hello,
I implore the Ontario Government not to weaken the Endangered Species Act (the Act) by making revisions to it. Species-at-risk are at risk in large part due to habitat loss and the Act needs to improve habitat protection, not weaken it to development.
The Government should instead focus on how to better protect the species-at-risk by improving how the Act is implemented and enforced. More focus should be on protecting these species-at-risk and their habitat and ensuring their recovery. If any changes were to be made to the Act, I would only request that the exemptions for major industry groups like forestry, mining and agriculture be removed.
My other comments as they relate to the 10th Year Review Discussion Paper are as follows:
This discussion paper does not provide much information in the review process that's transpired over the past 10 years nor does it provide context or evidence as to why and where the 'Challenges' have derived from.
Area of Focus 1:
The landscape approach is not explained well.
Habitat of species-at-risk can be interconnected and a landscape approach with broad-species focus would be helpful for habitat and species. These tools are already included in the Act, but should not replace a species-specific focus.
Area of Focus 2:
There should NOT BE a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections. Listing a species at risk or their habitat should be based on sound research, scientific evidence and as informed by COSSARO's review. A species/habitat, if deemed 'at risk', should always be listed and the listing should have nothing to do any other outside influence. This Act is FOR species-at-risk, if anything, improving the communication with affected stakeholders that may be impacted would be beneficial.
Allowing Ontario Scientist to sit on COSSARO is encouraged.
Area of Focus 3:
The Act is for the protection and recovery of species-at-risk. If a species is listed, already they are in peril and there should be no extension to the timelines. Changes to the legislation timeline will not improve the Government Response Statement challenges.
The Government Response Statement and the development of the recovery strategies should better be coordinated and recovery strategies should be created for multiple species that share similar geographic areas or which face similar threats. Again, coordinated efforts in how the current Act is implemented would be more beneficial than changing the Act itself.
Habitat regulations should not be changed.
Area of Focus 4:
The Act should only focus on the protection and recovery of species-at-risk and their habitat.
There should not be conservation banking or paying into a conservation fund or anything to that affect. These species and their habitats are at-risk likely because their habitat is already compromised. Habitat needs to be protected and allowing activities to be conducted where there's critical habitat in lieu of a payment is backwards and is unacceptable. Instead, there should be the focus on habitat protection for species-at-risk which in turn would also benefit the rest of the ecosystem.
As a species declines, the more an effective strategy is require and the more this may cost. It would be beneficial to ensure appropriate protection at the onset of a species being listed. There should be no delays.
Early identification of the needs of the species that may be impacted during the planning phases of development should be discussed with the stakeholders and expectations of how best to protect them and their habitat should be communicated and understood.
If changes are to be made to the Act, removing the regulatory exemptions for activities that can have the most negative affects on species-at-risk should be considered. As well, how the Act is implemented and communicated could improve species and economic outcomes, but the protection and recovery of species and their habitat should not, in any way, be sacrificed for economic benefit.

We do not get to try again with the balance of ecosystems. Once a species is gone many thousands more will be impacted - creating scarcity of resources for predator animals, creating overpopulation in a species' primary prey, disruption of plant life due to lack of the normal feeding patterns an animal species may have, and more.

Today there is little attention on these species as focus has shifted to caribou, turtles and ginseng plants. Environmentalists will use these “sexy” species as scapegoats to shut down industrial activities with little regard to the socio-economic impacts on the hard working men and women who rely on jobs in resource management sectors. To be truly sustainable, the endangered species act MUST consider the impacts to the economy, society as well as the environment. Listing species should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of these three aspects given the severe impacts and losses industries have already suffered. In Central Ontario since the Government began looking for species at risk, they have found many. Once a species makes it on the list, it never seems to come off. There needs to be more accountability on the Government to prove impacts to species at risk before creating harsh legislation that restricts resource management and industrial activities, the cornerstones of our economy.

1.	Introductory Letter
•	Our submission focuses on the involvement of Indigenous communities, including those involved in Indigenous Guardians programs, in Species at Risk (SAR) protection and recovery in Ontario, as well as more effective integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge in species listing and recovery planning efforts.
•	As Algonquins, we are the stewards of their lands and waters, it is essential to have legislation and regulations in Ontario that include true collaboration with ourselves and other Indigenous communities regarding Ontario’s Species at Risk protection and recovery efforts.
•	Contributors to this DRAFT ESA Review memo: Shared Value Solutions, Algonquins of Ontario
•	The submission of this letter should not be considered in any way “consultation” with the signatory First Nations, as the 45-day comment period is insufficient and no capacity support was provided to encourage First Nations contributions. The MECP should continue to engage with the signatory First Nations even after this comment period has closed.
•	We are concerned that the MECP has already decided that they are going to reduce protections for SAR and streamline approvals processes for industry in Ontario, as evidenced by the tone of the challenges and questions outlined in their discussion paper.
2.	ESA Review Memo
Primary Comment: There is a need for true collaboration with First Nations regarding Ontario’s SAR protection and recovery efforts. True collaboration begins with meaningful communication, notification, consultation, and leads to joint planning and work to protect Species at Risk and related habitat. This could include, but should not be limited to:
o	Significant, cross-Ontario Indigenous Knowledge Holder Membership on the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO).
o	Include a standing item on the meeting agendas of COSSARO and the Program Advisory Committee (PAC) regarding the inclusion of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK).
o	Develop guidance documents with First Nations peoples for:
•	how to effectively incorporate Indigenous knowledge in Species at Risk protection and recovery;
•	how to assess, evaluate and provide inclusive consideration for species considered to be at risk by First Nations people due in relation to food security, harvesting, teaching, medicine and spiritual needs; and
•	how to collaborate effectively with Indigenous Guardians on Species at Risk monitoring, protection, and recovery.
o	Adapt the structure of species recovery teams to create a team dedicated to Traditional Ecological Knowledge integration AND move to have Traditional Knowledge holder representatives on all species recovery teams.
o	When developing or updating species recovery strategies and government response statements include a First Nation engagement and collaboration component that includes travelling to communities to learn and transfer species at risk knowledge allowing the braiding of Indigenous and western science.
o	As part of the development, updating, and/or evaluating the success of a species recovery strategy and government response statements, include conducting Species at Risk inventories for those species on First Nation traditional territories, including reserve lands. This should be done in full collaboration with First Nations and include the involvement of local Indigenous monitors and/ or guardians.
o	Continue to administer the Species at Risk Stewardship Fund (SARSF), especially to support Indigenous-led Species at Risk recovery efforts, which also generates the added benefit of local employment and capacity building within First Nations across the province of Ontario.
Area of Focus 1: Landscape Approaches
o	A landscape-level approach could better integrate Indigenous worldviews into the Endangered Species Act and harmonize with existing federal processes, if it were implemented in tandem with single-species approaches.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process and Protection for Species at Risk
o	Improve the process of species listing by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) by ensuring the incorporation of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into western science-based decision-making in practice, not just on paper.
o	Make information on species listing as well as automatic species and habitat protections more accessible to, but not open for debate by, the public.
Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
o	Species at Risk do require habitat protections and effective recovery activities to ensure the species can both survive and thrive for generations to come. Species recovery strategies, government response statements, and habitat regulations must be carried out in a way that promotes species protection, survival, and recovery. It is not about the timelines of the recovery strategy and government response statement, but rather ensuring these tools contain activities and mechanisms that truly enable SAR recovery.
Area of Focus 4: Authorization Processes
o	While economic development is important and necessary in Ontario, the purpose of the Ontario Endangered Species Act is not to promote or ease economic development in Ontario but to protect and recover Species at Risk and ensure that authorized development activities do not negatively impact Species at Risk or their habitats.
o	The ecological complexity needed to sustain Species at Risk in living ecosystems is married to First Nations’ cultural relationships to place, and is largely incompatible with having businesses paying into a conservation fund dedicated to species at risk conservation, or allowing conservation banking to enable addressing requirements for species at risk prior to activities.

23756,/comment/23756,"1. Landscape Approaches
We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23757,/comment/23757,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ESA review discussion paper. Though I support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. Rather, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. While I understand that this is being done to improve the business outcomes in Ontario, the irreplaceable ecosystem services and tourism industries that would be destroyed with the loss of vulnerable species have costs that are beyond comparison to short-term economic gains.
Species continue to decline even under the ESA, with one example being Ontario’s freshwater turtles, all of which are considered as Species At Risk (SAR). As such, any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To ensure that these species do not become extinct due to our careless actions, it is imperative to:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.
This review must be shifted to be more conducive to protecting the species that we rely on, which extends far beyond those that we hunt and fish. Taking a scientific approach to the ESA is the only way to ensure this, and evidence that shows the need for a more stringent approach cannot be ignored.

•	As First Nations. we are the stewards of their lands and waters, it is essential to have legislation and regulations in Ontario that include true collaboration with First Nations regarding Ontario’s Species at Risk protection and recovery efforts.
•	Contributors to this DRAFT ESA Review memo: Shared Value Solutions and Olthius Kleer Townshend LLP
•	The submission of this letter should not be considered in any way “consultation” with the signatory First Nations, as the 45-day comment period is insufficient and no capacity support was provided to encourage First Nations contributions. The MECP should continue to engage with the signatory First Nations even after this comment period has closed.
•	We are concerned that the MECP has already decided that they are going to reduce protections for SAR and streamline approvals processes for industry in Ontario, as evidenced by the tone of the challenges and questions outlined in their discussion paper.
2.	ESA Review Memo
Primary Comment: There is a need for true collaboration with First Nations regarding Ontario’s SAR protection and recovery efforts. True collaboration begins with meaningful communication, notification, consultation, and leads to joint planning and work to protect Species at Risk and related habitat. This could include, but should not be limited to:
o	Significant, cross-Ontario Indigenous Knowledge Holder Membership on the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO).
o	Include a standing item on the meeting agendas of COSSARO and the Program Advisory Committee (PAC) regarding the inclusion of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK).
o	Develop guidance documents with First Nations peoples for:
•	how to effectively incorporate Indigenous knowledge in Species at Risk protection and recovery;
•	how to assess, evaluate and provide inclusive consideration for species considered to be at risk by First Nations people due in relation to food security, harvesting, teaching, medicine and spiritual needs; and
•	how to collaborate effectively with Indigenous Guardians on Species at Risk monitoring, protection, and recovery.
o	Adapt the structure of species recovery teams to create a team dedicated to Traditional Ecological Knowledge integration AND move to have Traditional Knowledge holder representatives on all species recovery teams.
o	When developing or updating species recovery strategies and government response statements include a First Nation engagement and collaboration component that includes travelling to communities to learn and transfer species at risk knowledge allowing the braiding of Indigenous and western science.
o	As part of the development, updating, and/or evaluating the success of a species recovery strategy and government response statements, include conducting Species at Risk inventories for those species on First Nation traditional territories, including reserve lands. This should be done in full collaboration with First Nations and include the involvement of local Indigenous monitors and/ or guardians.
o	Continue to administer the Species at Risk Stewardship Fund (SARSF), especially to support Indigenous-led Species at Risk recovery efforts, which also generates the added benefit of local employment and capacity building within First Nations across the province of Ontario.
Area of Focus 1: Landscape Approaches
o	A landscape-level approach could better integrate Indigenous worldviews into the Endangered Species Act and harmonize with existing federal processes, if it were implemented in tandem with single-species approaches.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process and Protection for Species at Risk
o	Improve the process of species listing by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) by ensuring the incorporation of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into western science-based decision-making in practice, not just on paper.
o	Make information on species listing as well as automatic species and habitat protections more accessible to, but not open for debate by, the public.

23763,/comment/23763,"As a biologist working in the environmental consulting and engineering sector for the past 6 years, I have had a first hand experience in the implementation of the Ontario Endangered Species Act. I believe the strength of the ESA has had successful outcomes for protection of Species at Risk (SAR) and conservation of their habitats. It has forced many developers to create compensation habitat and avoid impacts on SAR; I believe protection of SAR is important and should continue in the future. I do not think businesses should be allowed to destroy or negatively impact SAR habitat in order to improve the economy; conservation of SAR should be the top priority.
However, to find efficiencies and improve certainty for businesses in the implementation of the ESA I have the following suggestions:
- ensure consistency between the various MNRF districts or MNRF/MOECP staff. We have experienced some cases (especially with assessment of SAR bat habitat) where there has been inconsistent approach between various MNRF staff.
- develop standards for acceptable levels of effort in assessing SAR habitat through ecological studies / standard protocols
- for SAR bats, an ESA registration option should be developed (similar to Bobolink/Eastern Meadowlark): for example, if the proponent is planning to remove x hectares of treed habitat or less, then they should be able to do a registration, provided that the removals occur outside the bat active period, and with the area cut-off based on a review of current science. Or if the proponent is removing a certain amount of forest and SAR bats have been confirmed through acoustic monitoring, then they can register and install a certain number of bat boxes.
- the number of MOECP staff assigned to ESA implementation and reviewing development applications needs to be increased, to improve the speed of responses. We have had to wait months for review of our reports or responses to our reports; this creates challenges and delays for businesses or increased costs for tax payer funded projects (like MTO projects or environmental clean up projects).

Habitat loss is the leading factor in species endangerment and extinction. We need to stop pretending that we are doing our duty in protecting them, and actually make laws that protect those things on earth without a voice.

RE: Forest Sector Requires Permanent Regulation Followed by Workable Species at Risk Policy After 10th Year Review of the Endangered Species Act
To Whom it May Concern:
As the owner of a logging business in Northwestern Ontario, we employ about 23 full-time employees plus 5 broker/operators and we have been operating for 20 years in the Sioux Lookout area. We are a stump to dump logging contractor and we build 90% of our access roasds as well. We would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. We look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA); either through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, we must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is our understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. It is our expectation that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further, we remain extremely concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with us well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.
We would be happy to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the best path forward to ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk while keeping people in this province working.

23771,/comment/23771,"In regards to Area of Focus 2, I believe that giving public and private notice about the listing of a SAR is detrimental to the species as it encourages developers, businesses, and citizens to carry out any destructive behaviour towards SAR or SAR habitat, such as removing SAR habitat or individual SAR from a property or proposed development, prior to their listing as Threatened or Endangered. This ultimately causes more harm to the species that is slated to be protected. While this can cause issues for businesses and development, it is a minor inconvenience and in most cases, effective mitigation measures and management can be implemented for a solution to these 'problems.'
In regards to Area of Focus 3, government response statements should be still be issued within the required time limit. The initial responses should outline preliminary findings, regulations, and other pertinent information. However, if the response is incomplete, an extension should be granted and any additional information can be issued as an addendum after further research. This approach ensures the government is proactive about species conservation and grants basic protection and mitigation measures, rather than permitting developers and other businesses additional time to skirt legislation.

Re. ERO # 013-4143
Re. 	Northwatch Comments in Contribution to the 10th Year Review of the
	Endangered Species Act
On January 18th, 2019 the Government of Ontario announced that it was undertaking a
review of the Endangered Species Act. The stated purpose was “to improve protections for species at risk, consider modern and innovative approaches to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk, as well as to look for ways to streamline approvals and provide clarity to support economic development.”
According to the posting on Ontario’s Environmental Registry and the sole other notice Northwatch received, the review was comprised of the posting of an eight page Discussion Paper as a basis for public comment, and a “Skype meeting” delivered twice and described in advance as being for the purpose of providing an overview of the Discussion Paper.
Northwatch is a regional coalition of environmental and social organizations across northeastern Ontario. Founded in 1988, Northwatch has the dual mandate of supporting public participation in environment-related decision-making and consultation processes, and advocating for the wellbeing of human and natural communities in and beyond the region. Northwatch participated in the “Skype meeting” on January 24th and we have reviewed and given careful consideration to the Discussion Paper.
Northwatch offers the following comments in response. They are provided in point-form format to assist the Ministry in their careful dispositioning of our submission.
Overarching and General Comments
-	Extremely short timeline for public consultation placed regrettable constraints on ability to engage in detailed review, particularly for municipalities or volunteer organizations (such as those who meeting monthly)
-	Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a complex Act and requires both technical/scientific and local understanding of implications and implementation experience
-	Box 282, North Bay ON P1B 8H2 | 705 497 0373 | northwatch@northwatch.org | www.northwatch.org
-	The Review lacked any evidentiary basis; such a review should have been preceded by an analysis of implementation experience to date at the provincial level, and an analysis of challenges and successes that was supported by actual investigation and analysis
-	The primary criteria for the review of the ESA should be “has it been effective in reducing the level of threat to species in Ontario that are endangered, threatened or of special concern?” but there has been no information or analysis made available that allows those engaged in the review to consider the first ten years of the ESA experience in an informed manner
-	the discussion paper purports to have upholding the Act’s intent to protect and recover species at risk in Ontario as a primary motivation, but the underlying messages are that finding “efficiencies” may be the greater motivator; the discussion paper lacks clarity on this key point, and that in itself is problematic
-	The Act was put in place in 2007 because other policies and legislation were not effectively protecting these species and their habitat (hence the growing list of species on the “list”) and until such time as the level of risk / pressure / threat on those species can be demonstrated to be no longer in force, then the purpose of the Act must be upheld, i.e. levels of protection cannot be reduced
-	There is no indication in the discussion paper as to whether the authors / drivers of the discussion paper consider the cause of the identified “challenges” to be in language of the legislation, the policies or regulations, or the implementation; local discussions led to the conclusion that the challenges were in implementation, and in particular in the lack of capacity to properly implement the ESA’s provisions, particularly in a timely manner; as such the focus of this review must return to the challenges in implementation; again, having a sound analysis of experience to date is essential
-	The focus of review findings should be on how implementation can be strengthened (and capacity increased)
-	The discussion paper seems to suggest that it is a given that an economic development project will be able to actually benefit SAR; this is not supported by any evidence or even anecdotes, and there are more likely to be examples of when an economic development does NOT benefit a species at risk
-	The discussion paper ignores several important factors: 1) there was a streamlining of the Act in 2013 that brought about significant changes to the Act’s ability to meet its purpose and 2) the Act is still a “work in progress” in that there are still many listed species for which there is no recovery plan, and even more for which there is no response or regulation
-	It is reasonable to have a review of a piece of legislation at the ten year mark, but is problematic when the Act has not yet been fully implemented, and even more so when there is no indication that the review is being based on an examination of implementation experience to date and to what degree implementation to date has been successful in meeting the Act’s purpose, i.e. to protect species at risk
Area of Focus 1 - Landscape approaches
-	The absence of any definition of “landscape approach” and any discussion of how this undefined approach would be applied makes it very difficult to comment on this section
-	anecdotally, when asked in the January 24th “Skype meeting” the Ministry staff could not reply to a question about the definition of “landscape approach” as used in the discussion paper; this indicates that perhaps even the authors / drivers of the paper are unsure of its meaning or implications
-	the section is plagued by unsupported statements which appear to be conclusive but have not been supported by any actual information about how the first ten years of the Act has been evaluated; for example, the statement that a species-specific policy approach “can limit the ability to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk” lacks any evidentiary basis, as does the contention that recovery approaches for individual species “can limit or conflict with one another”; this important review should not be based on hearsay or unsupported assumptions
-	the “species specific policy approach” may create management challenges when there are multiple species that require response / protection within a given area, as the discussion paper purports; that is the contemporary reality of species at risk. However, this challenge would be reduced by having a recovery plan and response in place for all listed species – the challenge is made all the greater by having species that are at different points along the path to having regulated protections in place
-	species have specific habitat needs, and those habitats must be protected as part of protecting the species; an averaging out of the those habitat needs – which is potentially the notion behind the “landscape approach” - cannot be assumed to meet those needs or expected to assist in the recovery of the species; such a strategy may hasten species along the trajectory from threatened to endangered to extirpated, which is fully in opposition to the purpose of the Endangered Species Act
-	the actual state or extent of the recovery of each listed species must be the basis for assessing the effectiveness of recovery actions on a per species basis, and the effectiveness of the Act – and, more importantly, its implementation – overall; this analysis is absent from this review
-	there may be potential within a given area, such as a single eco-district, to develop an integrated recovery plan for the various species at risk that have been identified as having a presence in the area; however, such an integrated recovery plan could follow only after the individual recovery plans have been developed on a species-specific basis
-	the failure of the system to produce a full suite of recovery strategies / responses / regulations within the first ten years of the ESA is the barrier to being able to potentially move to area-based integrated recovery plans; without more capacity in the responsible agencies, this barrier will most probably remain in place
-	the notion of area-based integrated recovery plans must be supported by science, and careful observation and evaluation of progress to date for species at risk or in recovery; while Northwatch is not dismissing the notion out of hand, it cannot be supported without any basis for that support
Area of Focus 2 – Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
-	the notification process could be improved by improvements to COSSARO’s support, infrastructure and communication systems; for example, the COSSARO web site appears to have not been updated since prior to the Spring 2018 meeting, has no option for being added to an email or notification list (other than the option of emailing the secretariat), and the web site is static and limited; simple improvements like a) keeping the web site current, and b) providing a simple  listing or notification system advising when an additional species is coming under the Committee’s consideration and c) increasing transparency around the Committee’s operations would  all contribute to significant improvements in the notification process for new species being listed or considered for listing. Again, this appears to be a capacity issue.
-	There has already been excessive discretion in the application and extension of exemptions / transition periods; what is required is sufficient capacity and investment to complete the process of those species already listed, and to accommodate any future listings
-	Overall, the process regarding assessment and classification can be improved by increasing capacity, investing in the process, applying timelines, and providing greater transparency
-	The priority elements of the listing process are a) that the process is science and evidence based and supported by subject experts, and b) that species are afforded protection at the point of being identified as candidates for listing – if the system is slow and cumbersome, it is not the species at risk that that should be sacrificed to failures within the protection system
Area of Focus 3 -- Species Recovery Policies and Habitat regulations
-	This section of the discussion paper pays considerable attention to timelines, but there is no analysis of experience to date, including why timelines are not being met, or what changes in the system would be required to improve timelines; this is – again – tightly linked to already identified capacity issues
-	Consideration should be given to how greater transparency might improve timelines, particularly in the case of the preparation of Government Response Statements; the lack of appropriate linkages between COSSARO and the bureaucrats charged with preparing Government Response Statements is a factor that should be investigated (for example, there are currently no government employees included in the COSSARO)
-	The notion that a habitat regulation might be  “not needed” is incompatible with a species having been  identified as at risk; without a habitat regulation, the protection of the species and its habitat is subject to interpretation of general habitat guidelines; anecdotally, we have heard  from practitioners that such subjective application of general habitat guidelines lacks certainty and predictability  (two elements of the regulatory system which industries have consistently identified as being of high priority) and results in considerable time delays for development projects; we would note that this anecdotal testimony was shared with Northwatch by consultants to the development industry
-	There is no evidence-based rationale for changing the current legislated timelines
Area of Focus 4: Authorization Processes
-	The section overall conveys an intent to favour economic development over species protection in most or all instances; this is problematic, and inconsistent with the purposes of the Act, the needs of species at risk, and the stated intentions of  this review
-	There are numerous tools already available that provide alternatives to actually delivering on protection for species at risk as required by the Act (see page 6 of the discussion paper); in the absence of any analysis of the overall effectiveness of the Act or – more specifically in the context of Area of Focus 4 – these already available alternatives, there is no cause to identify additional exemption mechanisms at this point
-	Without sufficient capacity, even a changed authorization process can be expected to remain slow, cumbersome, and ineffective
-	There is no evidence that a cash-in-lieu system (i.e. “paying into a conservation fund”) will be of any benefit to a species at risk or its recovery, or that it will make the approvals process more effective (or efficient); the subjective nature of this potential tool could result in greater delays and inefficiencies, as well as reducing the protection and/or recovery of species at risk
-	The needs of species at risk – and of the development industry – can be more efficiently met by increasing capacity and investing in the system in order to properly support the development of recovery plans and having sufficient staff resources in place in all involved agencies
-	Overall, evaluating the effectiveness of the system and its implementation requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation; this should not be a complaint-based approach, but one which is system wide and includes monitoring and evaluation of not only activities undertaken under the auspices of SAR permitting, but of the listed species and their status and (potentially) recovery
Conclusions
Throughout the many discussions about the Endangered Species Act which we engaged in with our counterparts in environmental non-governmental and community organizations, the academic and scientific community, municipalities, developers and members of the public during this review period, three key messages emerged, clearly and consistently. They were:
-	The Act is sound, and does not require amendments at this time
-	Implementation has been slow and weak and must be improved in order to meet the purposes of the Act and to protect species at risk and their habitat
-	The greatest contributor to poor implementation has been a lack of capacity; this has particularly been the case in the Ministry of Natural Resources, and includes insufficient support of the COSSARA; transitioning the Act from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests to the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks is going to require a substantial investment if the implementation of the Act is not to be further eroded
In closing, we would recommend that now having had the opportunity to received initial feedback on the Endangered Species Act and its first ten years, the Ministry should now commence a detailed and science-based evaluation of the effectiveness of the ESA over the last ten years, particularly in terms of the protection and recovery of species at risk and their habitat.
As a second phase in this review, the findings of that detailed evaluation should be made public, and consultation undertaken to rank options for strengthening the Act and the protections it provides to species at risk and their habitat. This second phase of consultation should be led by COSSARA, and provided with sufficient resources.
Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to engaging in second-phase discussions of the Endangered Species Act as an extension of this Ten Year Review.
Sincerely,
Brennain Lloyd

2.	ESA Review Memo
Primary Comment: There is a need for true collaboration with First Nations regarding Ontario’s SAR protection and recovery efforts. True collaboration begins with meaningful communication, notification, consultation, and leads to joint planning and work to protect Species at Risk and related habitat. This could include, but should not be limited to:
o	Significant, cross-Ontario Indigenous Knowledge Holder Membership on the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO).
o	Include a standing item on the meeting agendas of COSSARO and the Program Advisory Committee (PAC) regarding the inclusion of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK).
o	Develop guidance documents with First Nations peoples for:
•	how to effectively incorporate Indigenous knowledge in Species at Risk protection and recovery;
•	how to assess, evaluate and provide inclusive consideration for species considered to be at risk by First Nations people due in relation to food security, harvesting, teaching, medicine and spiritual needs; and
•	how to collaborate effectively with Indigenous Guardians on Species at Risk monitoring, protection, and recovery.
o	Adapt the structure of species recovery teams to create a team dedicated to Traditional Ecological Knowledge integration AND move to have Traditional Knowledge holder representatives on all species recovery teams.
o	When developing or updating species recovery strategies and government response statements include a First Nation engagement and collaboration component that includes travelling to communities to learn and transfer species at risk knowledge allowing the braiding of Indigenous and western science.
o	As part of the development, updating, and/or evaluating the success of a species recovery strategy and government response statements, include conducting Species at Risk inventories for those species on First Nation traditional territories, including reserve lands. This should be done in full collaboration with First Nations and include the involvement of local Indigenous monitors and/ or guardians.
o	Continue to administer the Species at Risk Stewardship Fund (SARSF), especially to support Indigenous-led Species at Risk recovery efforts, which also generates the added benefit of local employment and capacity building within First Nations across the province of Ontario.
Area of Focus 1: Landscape Approaches
o	A landscape-level approach could better integrate Indigenous worldviews into the Endangered Species Act and harmonize with existing federal processes, if it were implemented in tandem with single-species approaches.
Area of Focus 2: Listing Process and Protection for Species at Risk
o	Improve the process of species listing by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) by ensuring the incorporation of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into western science-based decision-making in practice, not just on paper.
o	Make information on species listing as well as automatic species and habitat protections more accessible to, but not open for debate by, the public.
Area of Focus 3: Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
o	Species at Risk require habitat protections and effective recovery activities to ensure the species can survive and thrive for generations to come. Species recovery strategies, government response statements, and habitat regulations should be carried out in a way that promotes species protection, survival, and recovery, but NOT in such a way that Indigenous rights and livelihoods are compromised. It is not about the timelines of the recovery strategy and government response statement, but rather ensuring these tools contain activities and mechanisms that enable SAR recovery and simultaneously protect local Indigenous rights and livelihoods.
Area of Focus 4: Authorization Processes
o	While economic development is important and necessary in Ontario, the purpose of the Ontario Endangered Species Act is not to promote or ease economic development in Ontario but to protect and recover Species at Risk and ensure that authorized development activities do not negatively impact Species at Risk or their habitats.
o	The ecological complexity needed to sustain Species at Risk in living ecosystems is married to First Nations’ cultural relationships to place, and is largely incompatible with having businesses paying into a conservation fund dedicated to species at risk conservation, or allowing conservation banking to enable addressing requirements for species at risk prior to activities.

23776,/comment/23776,"As a conservation biologist, I am very concerned that the proposals set forward in the ESA review discussion paper will not protect Species at Risk. For ten years, I have waited for this review in the hopes that it would tighten loopholes that enable destruction and degradation of Species at Risk and their habitat. Now that this opportunity is upon us, I am incredibly disappointed to see so many allowances that make it easier for applicants to destroy Species at Risk habitat.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of PROTECTING and RECOVERING Species at Risk, not be an enabling tool to keeping industry and developers happy. Regarding the ESA review discussion paper, I urge you to:
1. Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
2. Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
3. Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
4. Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
5. Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.
If MECP doesn't feel the current ESA is working well enough, why not try implementing some of the ""broader ecosystem"" approaches enabled by the current legislation? Why is every recovery strategy and every ESA permit issued on a single-species basis? Strengthening the holistic approach, through habitat stewardship and multi-species recovery plans, makes more sense than the amendments currently proposed.
We need biodiversity. We need all the plants, animals, fungi, and other organisms that call Ontario home -- and they need us to speak for them when their habitat and very existence is at stake.
Don't mess up for another 10 years, MECP. EXTINCTION IS FOREVER.

23781,/comment/23781,"10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper
Nature Conservancy of Canada - Ontario Region Comments
The Nature Conservancy of Canada’s Ontario Region is pleased to provide commentary to the Government of Ontario regarding the ten-year review of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Discussion Paper tabled by the Government.
We recognize the work completed to date with the government’s Made in Ontario Environment Plan.  As Environment Minister Rod Phillips stated, these consultations can improve the effectiveness of environmental protections to ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy. In addition, NCC supports the approach of working with conservation organizations, businesses, Indigenous communities, and the public to improve environmental protections.
As stakeholders who have a nearly 60-year track record of delivering tangible results and solutions to protect land for future generations, there is an opportunity for all of us to work together to achieve the government’s goals on clean air and water, addressing climate change, and conserving land and greenspace. NCC was pleased to have been recognized in the Made in Ontario Environment Plan  as a trusted partner in conserving land and greenspace which, in turn, protects species at risk.
The Discussion Paper notes that several species across the province are on the Species at Risk in Ontario List due to threats such as habitat loss, invasive species, climate change and disease. These include diverse species such as birds, fish, mussels, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, plants, and insects.
In Ontario and across the country, Nature Conservancy of Canada staff and partners play key roles in the protection of habitat for species at risk. Together, we are working to gather the clues and develop strategies that will help ensure the identification, protection, and even reintroduction of Canada’s species at risk.
The Nature Conservancy of Canada participates in important work that contributes to the well-being of these species through on-the-ground actions such as monitoring species and improving their habitat, researching and planning what habitat needs to be conserved, and by participating in the development of species-at-risk recovery strategies.
We note that the Government of Ontario is particularly interested in hearing ideas in relation to four key areas of focus, as outlined in the Discussion Paper. Our response includes proposals for these four key areas of focus. In addition, we are proposing a specific partnership to protect species at risk through the Greenlands Conservation Program.
Landscape Approaches
The Nature Conservancy of Canada’s Ontario Region supports a landscape approach for conserving and restoring habitat mosaics for multiple species at risk.
•	NCC recommends incorporating principles for recovery of species and mitigation of further loss, through the conservation and restoration of native species, and by addressing threats such as invasive species.
•	For qualified, competent conservation organizations doing species at risk recovery/stewardship work, consider an overarching multi-year umbrella stewardship agreement that recognizes net species at risk habitat benefits and species at risk habitat.
•	Government should empower and adequately resource conservation organizations to implement landscape-scale stewardship activities that directly benefit species at risk and species at risk habitat, working on both private and public land (i.e. Long Point species at risk phragmites control project in collaboration with many partners and landowners). This is particularly relevant in southern Ontario where conservation organizations have existing relationships and partnerships with private landowners and many species at risk exist and are threatened.
Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
While they play an important role, Government of Ontario Response Statements need to be updated over time to ensure they have a greater impact. NCC recommends establishing a feedback mechanism to assess the value and successes that have been achieved and actions taken.
Authorization Processes
•	Section 16 Stewardship Agreements or similar instruments for projects to help species at risk should be promoted. These instruments will help cut red tape and streamline administration. This tool is not well-understood or advertised as a positive way to enable conservation projects to proceed within the intent of the legislation.
•	The current Endangered Species Act authorization review process does not differentiate species at risk stewardship and beneficial conservation projects from other projects with significant impacts such as development proposals.  As a result, substantial delays in the process occur. Clear direction and flexibility to field-level staff regarding the use of these agreements will enable a speedier and more flexible process.
•	Provide local field office flexibility to work with project proponents in providing high-quality advice regarding project mitigation measures which will facilitate projects proceeding without contravening the Endangered Species Act.
•	Encourage ideas to streamline authorization timelines for projects.  For example, some Ministry of Natural Resources district biologists (such as Aylmer, Guelph, Aurora) have issued a Letter of Advice or Letter to Proponent (LOA), which is much quicker and easier than moving a proposal through a Section 17(2)c “Overall Benefit Permit.”
•	Formalizing these processes under the Endangered Species Act will greatly benefit good quality conservation projects, other projects with lower impact potential, and effectively cut red tape by streamlining authorization timelines for many projects. Document and share common and/or standard mitigation techniques with proponents to assist with mitigation plans (i.e. timing of activity, method, equipment, survey needs). Guidance on mitigation techniques for specific species and/or habitats could help speed up the process.
•	Rely on the expertise of local field staff and biologists for the review and approval of Overall Benefit Permits. While most review and communication about project proposals is done at the local level, this process has traditionally required additional review at Ministry of Natural Resource and Forestry regional offices, adding weeks or months to the process. As the local biologists are most familiar with the projects, landscape, species, and habitats it makes more sense to rely on their expertise and review for permit conditions. In addition, the current process delegation of authority for signing of these permits rests with the Minister. Delegating this authority down to the local manager would greatly improve timelines.
•	Ensure that the Endangered Species Act meshes well with other pertinent legislation. This is especially timely as responsibility for the Act has moved from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to Environment, Conservation and Parks. Coordination between ministries will be required to ensure that projects are not held up by one or both authorizations. In addition, to ensure that conditions (e.g. mitigation measures, timing windows, techniques etc.) are not conflicting between authorizations, both within and between regulating ministries.
•	Improve enforcement abilities and powers including inspection and investigation provisions to act quickly when a tip regarding a compliance issue is received. Increase monitoring and inspection of Endangered Species Act authorizations including online registered activities and rules-in-regulation approvals. Ensure officers have ‘Stop Work Order’ provisions to halt habitat destruction or species violations on the spot.
•	The government should also study conservation banking as a fund that has potential to create a net benefit for species at risk. Given the complexity of this issue, the Nature Conservancy of Canada would be pleased to work with the Government of Ontario further on this matter.
Greenlands Conservation Program
The Nature Conservancy of Canada has a track record of success across Canada in preserving areas of significant environmental and ecological importance. These areas contain many species at risk. Most of Canada’s critically endangered species live in the southern part of Canada. This is especially true in Ontario.
Greater effort, through place-based conservation action and community engagement, is needed to stop species loss in Canada over the next decade. As part of NCC’s initial submission in the first consultation phase, we proposed a partnership with the Government of Ontario to maximize progress towards Ontario’s 2020 land conservation targets through the Greenlands Conservation Partnership.
Over the last thirteen years, NCC has successfully demonstrated that it can leverage private sector contributions and donations with public funding to achieve real conservation results. To this end, NCC is proposing that the Government of Ontario invest $30 million in the Greenlands Conservation Partnership. This funding will be matched by NCC, at a ratio of least 1:1, with funds from other sources to achieve value to taxpayers.
The result of this partnership would be more than 150,000 acres (60,700 hectares), an area greater than ten times the size of the Town of Ajax. This would be secured land that is restored and managed. A $30 million investment to realize $60 million in conservation results that will directly lead to conservation and species at risk results.
NCC proposes a “ramp-up” for this funding partnership which would work as follows:
•	$5 million in year 1
•	$7.5 million in year 2
•	$7.5 million in year 3 and
•	$10 million in year 4
NCC and Ontario’s community land trusts stand ready to work with the government to enable a cost-effective and value-added program that, at a minimum, will double provincial government funding and facilitate tangible conservation outcomes in key communities across the province. The outcome of this partnership will be strategic conservation of Ontario’s most significant and threatened natural landscapes and the species at risk found in these places.
Conclusion
As stakeholders who have more than a track record of more than 50-years  delivering tangible results and solutions in protecting land for future generations, NCC welcomes the opportunity to work together to achieve the government’s goals on clean air and water, addressing climate change, and conserving land and greenspace.
NCC looks forward to working closely with the Government of Ontario as it implements its environment plan.

23784,/comment/23784,"A review of this act needs to focus on the at-risk species not development.  It is, after all, a piece of legislation designed to PROTECT animals not make it easier to cause their extinction in the name of progress.
It would be disingenuous to suggest developing in environmentally sensitive areas will help with the housing crisis in Ontario and I hope this will not be the tactic used by the government in this review. There are vacant warehouses, schools and other buildings languishing across this province. Before we destroy habitat we should repurpose the already developed areas available to us.
I further hope this review does not suggest 'cutting red tape' is more important than taking the time to fully assess the damage a development project could cause in regards to our wildlife. Complaining about paper work in the face of losing a species permanently is not a valid argument, it's an excuse.
What we must all understand is extinction is final. While the profit margin may be smaller on turning a school into lofts over building on currently protected land, there is no amount of money that can reverse death.

23785,/comment/23785,"Thank you for the opportunity to review the ESA (2007).
When this act was created it was internationally renowned for having a standard of each project that impacts SAR must achieve an overall benefit to the impacted species. The act held this standard while providing the flexibility to allow economically important projects to proceed, even in SAR habitat, so long as the impact is offset elsewhere.
However, in 2013 exemptions were created to reduce this impressive, yet balanced approach. Several industries were given blanket exemptions from the overall benefit standard. These changes were shameful and pandered to the few rich folks. The same few rich folks the Ford government appears to be pandering to now. Let us hope this is not the case.
As a first step, the Ford government should repeal the 2013 exemptions that reduce the stand from ""overall benefit"" to ""mitigating adverse effects"".
Here are some things that are very important to retain as they are crucial to the protection of SAR:
1) The species at risk stewardship fund should be retained and the government should increase the amount it contributes to this fund each year. Furthermore, this fund should put a higher priority on projects that conduct research to improve our understanding of effective mitigation and offsetting measures.
2) the species at risk research fund of Ontario should be retained and its support increased.
3) The number of enforcement officers should be drastically increased as they simply do not have enough to do their jobs effectively.
4) COSSARO should continue to be an independent, scientific panel that does not consider socioeconomics when determining the status of a species.
Here are some things that should change:
1) Permitting under the ESA, the FWCA, and the PPS should be integrated. The redundancies in applying for multiple provincial permits cost developers time and money. Each permit has its own set of timelines and its own independent government reviewers.)
2) A tracking system of whether or not a project achieves the overall benefit at some time (e.g. 5 years post completion) should be implemented and corrective actions taken should the project fail.
Thank you for this opportunity to comment and make the ESA a stronger and more effective at recovering species at risk.

23787,/comment/23787,"Species at Risk in Ontario need all the protections they currently have. Please do not make it easier to destroy their habitat.
The current ESA already has exemptions in place that would help developers move forward in rare situations where human safety trumps animal safety.
If you would like to make it easier for developers in Ontario I would like to see more Ministry advisors. If there were people who knew all the regulations of the ESA as well as the Planning Act those people could advise developers. Current systems do not allow for good communication between the developers and the different Ministries that regulate what a developer can and can not do.
Developers want to protect species as well. They so not want to build on land that is critical to a species survival. But they need better communication earlier in the development process so such land is never considered as a prospect for development in the first place.

23790,/comment/23790,"Comment on area of focus 1 - Landscape approaches:
- Species-specific and landscape approaches should go hand in hand when designing ways in managing Species at Risk (SAR). Indeed, landscape approach is an efficient way to design ways in managing SAR, however, since each species is different and have different habitat requirement, species-specific approach should still be the main management approach, while landscape approach should be a supplementary approach in deciding SAR management approach. This is especially important to species that are highly endangered and with a decreasing population trend. Depending mostly on landscape approach as the main way to design SAR management will risk missing important information regarding a SAR's ecological needs.
Comment on AREA OF FOCUS 2 – LISTING PROCESS AND PROTECTIONS FOR SPECIES AT RISK:
-  SAR Listing decisions should be based entirely on best-available science from experts and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge, economical reasons should not be included when listing decisions are made. Immediate actions should be taken to fight species endangerment and extinction.  While the listing process is already unnecessarily long, and such long timeline has already shortened the time spent in coming up with effective SAR management approaches, involving businesses and the public will only lengthen and complicate the listing procedure. Eliminating the involvement of businesses in species listing will also eliminate any sort of economical incentive that leads to favouring development over SAR protection. Endangered and threatened species should continue to be protected automatically. Information from COSSARO meetings can be posted online to improve transparency.
Comment on AREA OF FOCUS 3 – SPECIES RECOVERY POLICIES AND HABITAT REGULATIONS:
- As mentioned earlier, fighting species endangerment and extinction requires immediate actions. SAR populations and their habitat conditions should be constantly monitored, and for species that are highly endangered, their population status and recovery progress should be monitored even closely to prevent them from going extinct. The time limit of nine months to develop the Government Response Statement should be shortened, or if not, remain unchanged, and not lengthened. A recovery progress review should be conducted every 3 years.
- A species specific habitat regulation should always be in place for endangered and threatened species. Many species have unique habitat requirement during different life stage. This is especially true for aquatic species. Having general habitat protection will not fully protect species with different life stage requirements. Only through understanding a species' habitat requirement will lead to designing effective management approach to conserving the species.
Comment on AREA OF FOCUS 4 – AUTHORIZATION PROCESSES:
- Human activities highly impact the ecosystems and species population. For example, hunting and fishing directly impacts the population trend of a species, releasing non-native species to an ecosystem may lead to biological invasion and other ecosystem disruption. Human activities that will affect the status and recovery progress of endangered and threatened species should be highly regulated. The government should not see authorization processes as ""administrative burdens"", it is an act of precaution and to ensure that there is no further endangerment of SAR.
All in all, when it comes to protecting Species at Risk, it is a race to rescue these species that are valuable to Ontario's biodiversity and to the overall global biodiversity. Economic development should not be included in the Endangered Species Act, and it should not affect any Species at Risk listing, protection and recovery strategy decisions. Best-available science and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge should inform SAR listing and protection decisions. Climate change should also be accounted for when designing SAR management approach.

23791,/comment/23791,"I am an ecologist and work for a consulting company that regularly implements the ESA on projects for the provincial government (i.e., MTO) and private developers.  I support the review of the Endangered Species Act, there are opportunities for improvements, but the tone of the Discussion Paper concerns me, as it seems that the primary intention of the review is to reduce the barriers to economic development.  While pro-business constituents can voice their opinions through this review (and other means), I ask you to listen to those that speak on behalf of the plants and wildlife that cannot and do not have the same financial backing to make their voices heard loudly.  I am even more concerned that these voices will not be clearly heard given the recent dismissal of Ontario’s Environment Commissioner.  The protection of our plants and wildlife is critical – strong mechanisms are required to ensure their protection.  I see it ALL the time – if it costs more money to protect them it will not be done unless it is required, but these actions do not reflect what we all actually need.  Unfortunately, our society does not have the understanding of the great importance of the protection of our environment of which SAR are a component, in order to take action that support our environment for the benefit of all.  Until then, strong legislation and regulations are needed to ensure their protection.  Voluntary efforts, and nominal stewardship incentives are not enough.
I also note that there is no indication that there has been a review to determine whether or not the ESA is currently effective at protecting and recovering species at risk.  This should done to critically assess the need for changes to the ESA, and to demonstrate how any proposed changes are intended to improve protection and recovery (including a measure of certainty of the anticipated success of those changes).
Landscape Approaches:
The design of any landscape approaches needs to be made with the intention of species protection and recovery, and it needs to be overseen at the landscape level (this is expected to require government staff to oversee it).  The ESA is implemented on a project or site by site basis.  It is very difficult (maybe impossible) for an individual project to assess its relative contribution to the overall harm or protection of a species, as this is just a snap-shot in time, and the landscape is changing with many other projects being concurrently completed.
There is certainly value in the creation of recovery strategies at the landscape level in certain situations.  For example where there are multiple species using a landscape that may have competing protection requirements.
Listing Process:
I understand that automatic species and habitat protections can contribute to uncertainty, but I do not support ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protection for species or their habitat.  While it sounds like some flexibility would be beneficial as the implications of listing of species can vary, I do not trust the ministerial staff and politicians to make this decision, especially without the Environmental Commissioner’s oversight.
I also do not support a transition period to listing of species or their habitat because of the likelihood that it will actually result in much more harm to SAR and their habitat during the transition period to avoid potential regulations.  We’ve seen this in many other cases (i.e., clearing of woodlands during the development of Significant Woodland definitions in some municipalities to avoid the potential protection of these features).
It is necessary that the listing process be a scientifically based approach.  In practice this does not always appear to be the case.  COSEWIC has a much more robust scientific review of SAR listings, this reflects the investment in the staffing of this committee.  COSSARO could be improved with better funding for staffing of the committee.
Species Recovery:
Extending the government response period of nine months for recovery strategies and management plans needs to be clearly justified and the government needs to ensure they have sufficient staffing to undertake and develop these strategies and plans in a timely manner.  It does not currently appear that there will be enough ministerial staff to complete the work load required, given the anticipated reductions in staff.
Authorization Processes:
The question of whether conservation banking is an option requires demonstration that this has been successfully implemented elsewhere (measure of success requires benefit to the species), and that it directly applies to the situation and species in Ontario.  I am very reluctant to support this, on the ground recovery actions are necessary to offset any impacts to SAR.
I would like to see that there has been rigorous review to justify any proposed changes to the act and that any changes prioritize the intentions of this Act, which is to protect and recover at risk wildlife.

23792,/comment/23792,"As an ecologist, this review of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is alarming and littered with no-so-thinly veiled hints that economic growth will be prioritized over conservation. Without even delving into the intrinsic value of our native flora and fauna, Ontario's biodiversity (including its 243 species at risk) provides invaluable ecosystem services that invasive and introduced species cannot replicate. This discussion paper claims that automatic species protections ""can contribute to high uncertainty and costly impacts to businesses and the public"". I would argue that it is better to err on the side of caution by affording a species more protections that potentially are needed, than to underestimate and risk extirpation. We are currently in the midst of a sixth mass extinction event, caused by humans, that will have major economic and social consequences. More freedom for economic development now will not benefit us in the future when we are facing global shortages of clean water, soil nutrients, crop pollinators, areas of carbon sequestration, etc.
Additionally, it is disturbing to read that proposed changes should ""increase efficiencies"" for businesses; this runs counter to the ESA's main purpose of protecting species at risk. It cannot be avoided that processes such as those for authorization permits under the ESA will often involve ""significant administrative burdens and delays"". Destruction, degradation, or fragmentation of habitat has serious ramifications and in the overwhelming majority of cases cannot be reversed. The burden should always be on businesses to avoid and mitigate harm to species and their habitats, rather than modifying the ESA to make it easier for businesses to obtain authorization. The suggestion that businesses could pay into a ""conservation fund"" instead of fulfilling activity-based requirements ignores the fact that not all habitat is equal. Many populations, including those of migratory species, are dependent on specific areas and may rapidly decline once the amount of available habitat falls below a certain threshold. Destruction of habitat cannot be directly compensated for by contributing to other conservation measures, or even by protecting habitat elsewhere.
I conclude that this discussion paper has presented no evidence to support the claim that the current ESA has harmed the economy, and that based on the goals of the ESA, proposed changes should not ""streamline processes"" for economic development. The Ontario government should remember the extraordinary value of our biodiversity.

23797,/comment/23797,"To reduce the red tape and duplication that results from having two Acts that attempt to achieve the same outcomes the government must recognize the Crown Forest Sustainablity Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through a permanent Section 55 Regulation.
The CFSA provides landscape, stand and site level direction for managing, conserving and protecting species at risk. Having two Acts trying to accomplish the same outcome is decimating the Forest industry in Ontario by tying it up in red tape.
A sustainable Forest Management Plan (FMP) to be truly sustainable must satisfy all three pillars of sustainability: Social, Environmental and Economic.  Currently there is NOT equity in the application of the three pillars.  Focus appears to be only on the Environmental component.

23798,/comment/23798,"To Whom It May Concern,
Please accept the following comments regarding the discussion paper about the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
A large number of species are in decline, most of which due to anthropogenic impacts to habitat or the species directly.  In some cases, near catastrophic habitat loss has already occurred (ie Essex County, Perth County), though in other circumstances, mortality and/or habitat loss has not yet reached critical levels (ie parts of Muskoka, northern Ontario, etc.).  Whether it is acute impacts, or chronic long-term losses, the result is clear, we are losing wild plant and animals at an alarming rate.  Both COSEWIC and COSSARO assessments show how dire the situation is for many plants and animals in the province, and beyond.    Maintaining only representative subpopulations is not enough, we need to ensure large-scale protection of species and habitats into the future.  Habitat is not static, it changes due to environmental conditions, anthropogenic threats, and natural succession.  We need to, at the very least, maintain current protections offered by the provincial ESA, but at best increase protections, increase charges for violations, better enforce current laws and provide more funding for protection, research and enforcement.  Without proactive efforts, we will continue to lose or harm Ontario’s biodiversity.  Ensuring Ontario is seen as the gold standard for species protection will influence other provinces and countries to keep up.  I have worked with Species At Risk for over 25 years and the threats are increasing.  In general, the bulk of Ontario’s human population exists within the most important habitat for wildlife in the province.  Allowing business, infrastructure, and other opportunities that negatively impact our environment to proceed without extremely strict guidelines and enforcement of Endangered Species legislation is both careless and short-sighted.  Once an area is lost to development, it does not return.  Compromising important plant and wildlife habitat results in decreased viability of populations, loopholes that benefit more development over ecosystem health and long-term impacts that not only affect plants and wildlife, but the human population as well.
Area of Focus 1 – Landscape Approaches
Recovery activities that can assist a community of species can be beneficial, though single-species needs may not always be met during landscape approaches.  Species protection needs to be addressed on a case by case basis, and when opportunities for a landscape approach make sense, they can be put into practice.  Approaches that increase overall habitat availability, link natural habitats and reduce significant threats are generally efforts that can benefit a large diversity of species.  However, single species threats may need separate approaches.  Additionally, it must be made abundantly clear that the protection of species across their range is necessary, not just representative populations.  Species protection across the range is necessary to ensure long-term survival as threats increase.  It is essential to promote ecologically sound recovery and conservation practices that include the protection of multiple populations, even those that may be isolated.  Under no circumstances should changes be made to the ESA that would weaken Species At Risk protections, or make it easier for proponents to fragment, harm or destroy habitat, or result in injury or mortality of Species At Risk.
The species listed as at risk are under intense pressures already, many of which continue to decline due to not enough protection being offered.  If changes are to be made the ESA, they should be based on increasing protections for Species At Risk, increasing enforcement of the ESA, increasing funding opportunities for research and stewardship activities and ensuring COSSARO is able to function efficiently and effectively.  With regard to “overall benefit” during development, it should be noted that further protections for Species At Risk need to be addressed, since what looks good on paper, is not necessarily what is best in practice.  Overall benefit has the potential to reduce true protections for Species At Risk under certain circumstances, so a more thorough review of the destruction to SAR needs to be completed, and increased protections and more appropriate overall benefit options need to be investigated.  For example, putting in ecopassages without fencing is not appropriate, putting in turtle nesting mounds without a permanent management plan for upkeep is pointless, removing established habitat and replacing it with unproven alternative habitat is detrimental. Many more examples exist.
Area of Focus 2 – Listing Process
No changes to the automatic listing of SAR after review by COSSARO should be made.  This is an important aspect of the ESA, one that ensures listing is based on the best available scientific information, not political pressure.  Additionally, the automatic protection of habitat for newly-listed Threatened and Endangered species should not change.  The species is being listed because it is in decline, and thus quick action is necessary to slow current threats. Ministerial removal or delay of protections could be detrimental to the species in need of protection and could reduce the integrity of the listing process and the Act itself. If a delay is necessary, this could be vetted through COSSARO to ensure significant harm to the species will not occur based on the best available information.
In some cases, there may be no way around limited public access to location information due to data sensitivity.  Due to the risk of illegal collection, the location of many species is unknown to most residents of Ontario, until issues of habitat destruction or other issues of species impact occur. To better inform the public, a detailed fact sheet on data sensitivity may be necessary and may need to include all of the species that may be included (i.e., ginseng, spotted turtle, etc.).  This information sheet would need to be linked whenever a data sensitive species is up for assessment. On a species by species basis, general range information may be provided, without specific location information (i.e., Carolinian Zone, Niagara Escarpment, Oxford County, etc.).  There is no perfect solution for all species, and educational materials need to illustrate this.  Letting the public know how the process works, and why some species need additional safeguarding is important.
In materials available to stakeholders and the public, it should be made clear that the majority of reports have already been peer reviewed through the COSEWIC process.  COSEWIC provides a rigorous IUCN-based assessment that is vetted by biologists, government, First Nations and independent members.  By the time COSSARO reviews these documents, they have been heavily scrutinized, and COSSARO provides an additional level of assessment, revision and peer review of the information.  The process used by IUCN, COSEWIC and COSSARO is nationally and internationally recognized and adopted, after decades of fine tuning.  If there is new, emerging information that could affect status, COSSARO should be tasked with ensuring this is addressed.
Area of Focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies
Habitat protection is necessary for all species. Regulated habitat is necessary for species that require a range expansion in order to be down-listed, as well as species with limited distributions to ensure enough habitat is available for future movement and protection.  We need to see wildlife habitat as a living entity, one that changes over time, and in doing so wildlife need to move in order to survive.  River channels can move considerably over a century, prairies can turn into forests, ponds can become meadows, meadows turn into fields and so on and so forth.  Humans often see natural areas as permanent, assuming the natural area will always be similar.  This is not the case, so we need to allow room for species to move when habitats change.  The changes to habitats are increasing rapidly due to anthropogenic issues (ie invasive species, climate change, pollution etc), so this issue continues to be relevant.
Area of Focus 4 – Authorization Processes
Various permits are available under the ESA, with the most common being the C permit (Overall Benefit Permit).  The potential for the overall benefit not to be overly beneficial is high.  What looks good on paper is not always what works on the ground.  Expert review of such permits must be carried out by species specialists, especially in cases where important habitat could be lost, or mortality of individuals could occur.  Also, allowing the proponent too much leeway in how these activities are carried out has the potential to limit effectiveness or appropriateness of the actions.  Consulting firms are often heavily influenced by the proponent and thus appropriate efforts are not always carried out.  When combined with lack of enforcement due to funding limitations, problems facing Species At Risk could increase, or at the very least not be addressed to the extent necessary to protect, conserve or recover the species.
Having consultants hired by the proponent, and the proponent in charge of activities to benefit Species At Risk, is obviously a backwards approach to species protection.  With regard to monitoring of overall benefit: long term benefits can not be observed over a few month or few year period for many species.  Animals such as turtles may take decades to show increases or losses due to changes in their environment.  The Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks must ensure enforcement, review and follow-up with the proponent over many years.  Without this, how is there proof that benefit has occurred?  Most Species At Risk don’t show rapid changes in populations, so the damage that may be done today, may not truly be understood for many years.  Since alteration of habitat and potential mortality of individuals is occurring in many areas across the province, we do not have a true sense of the overall impact it will have.  For example, adding a culvert under a road to compensate for destroying habitat may not be a true benefit, and should not simply be seen as a checkmark on a permit application review.  Overall benefit reports (other than for data sensitive species) should be made available to the public, to ensure benefit has been achieved through peer review.
Significant Social or Economic Benefit Permits (D permits) have the potential to be used inappropriately, and cause large-scale damage to Species At Risk and their habitats.  The use of these permits should never become a tool to circumvent laws to protect Species At Risk without appropriate justification.   The acceptance of this permit should only occur after rigorous review, and only truly significant benefits should trigger their use.  In essence, this should be an extremely rare occurrence.  Even under such rare circumstances, if a permit is granted, the overall benefit to Species At Risk should also be significant to compensate for losses.  Additionally, big industry, including Forestry should not be exempt from the ESA, and needs to be enforced on all lands, including Crown Land.
I would also like to support the following information provide through the Canadian Herpetological Society:
“Other changes to the ESA should also be made to truly strengthen the protection  of SAR in Ontario:
1)	It is time to repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries. These exemptions can allow the widespread destruction of SAR habitat.
2)	Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of Endangered and Threatened species.
3) 	Proper enforcement of the ESA must also occur. Too often there is no government monitoring of development projects, which can lead to violations of ESA permit conditions, and especially a lack of follow-through on required overall benefit activities. Even when charges are laid under the ESA, the penalties have often been lax. Fines simply become the price for doing business, rather than a deterrent.
Protection for SAR also requires stable, long-term funding. We strongly encourage the government to continue to fund the Species at Risk Stewardship Fund, and the Species at Risk Research Fund. Both of these funding programs leveraged a significant amount of funding from the private sector, providing valuable extra funding for protecting SAR informed through scientific research, and making the investment from the provincial government very cost effective. Cutting these funding programs would greatly harm the recovery of SAR.”
Conclusion
While there may be opportunities to streamline permitting and other ESA-related tasks, they must not weaken the protections provided to Species at Risk.  We are facing a critical moment for wildlife losses around the world, and Ontario is not immune.  Threats are increasing each year, and there is little chance of relief from these pressures (human population growth, pollution, invasive species, climate change, etc.). Without quick and effective action now, we will continue to observe declines for species across the province.  Without maintaining or increasing protections, either recovery will not be possible, or it will be exponentially more expensive to achieve.  With the current legislation, we are not witnessing drastic increases in most SAR populations, but the efforts are helping to at least slow declines.  With any weakening of the act, we run the very likely risk of increasing rates of decline, increasing costs to recover species and increasing the number of species that become at risk.  Ontario needs to be an example of what true species protection looks like in Canada, and around the world.  If we limit protections in the ESA, we will continue to dismantle the ecosystem through the loss of habitat and species diversity.  In the end, this will impact us all.  As someone that has studied wildlife and worked to recover populations of species at risk for over two decades, I can state with full confidence that we are not doing enough, but we are on the right track with the ESA.  There is little room for error, so protections for SAR must be maintained or increased.

23800,/comment/23800,"Please take a moment to consider my commentary re: the 10-year review of the Endangered Species Act (ESA; ERO No. 013-4143).
I am an ecologist by trade and have some experience in interpreting the ESA in development scenarios. Furthermore I am familiar with many of the species that the ESA protects, and I am aware of at least some of the problems with the Act.
In the Discussion Paper, you state that the ESA is criticized for being ""ineffective in its aim to protect and recover species at risk [and] for being unclear"", both of which are subjective overstatements.
The ESA is an effective and transparent piece of legislation that allows very little wiggle room, which is exactly what is needed for Ontario's Species at Risk. The ESA is clear in both intent and application; Endangered and Threatened species and their habitats are protected, and the particulars are dealt with under the species' individual regulations.
There are some problems in implementation. The majority of problems occur due to a few key species which the Act does not protect effectively.  These should be dealt with through specific exceptions/revisions of their protection criteria or habitat regulations, not by substantially altering the Act overall. Typically, failures of the ESA relate to species declining from disease (like Butternut), species that move substantially year-to-year or those whose main problems occur south of our borders (like Bobolink). These scenarios could be improved by making changes to the individual species' habitat regulations or exemptions on a species by species basis, rather than overhauling core components of the act.
The discussion paper cites a desire for a 'landscape approach', which sounds good on the surface but contains flaws in practice. On its own, a general 'landscape' habitat protection is too blunt of a plan and risks rendering the ESA ineffective.  Generic blanket protection has been demonstrated to have serious drawbacks in other policy applications such as the Significant Wildlife Habitat category protected by the Provincial Policy Statement. For example, habitat of Special Concern species is protected as Significant Wildlife Habitat; however, in practice, nobody is willing to protect 100% of this habitat. Instead, Ecological Impact Studies typically recommend that some amount of significant habitat can be destroyed, as long as some vague proportion of the habitat is retained, and the size of this vague proportion is rarely backed by rigorous science. It has become standard to write-off inconvenient blocks of habitat as long as 'similar habitat' is available nearby. This could easily happen to a landscape-scale approach for the ESA. For species with very specific habitat needs, such wishy-washy policy risks destroying crucial habitat features. Furthermore, a 'landscape approach' makes it too easy to chip-chip-chip away at Endangered species habitats, as it allows too much discretion and vagueness, and there is no clear cutoff point at which habitat becomes categorically protected. Clear habitat regulations are required, and if there is a problem with them, these habitat regulations can be changed individually.  If anything, putting a landscape approach over top of existing habitat regulations would be the only way to improve protections.
I think it is wrong-headed to interfere with COSSARO's reporting and COSSARO should be left to operate as it has been doing. The government should maintain a science-based listing by COSSARO, and prevent any appeal process to COSSARO assessments and subsequent listing on SARO.
The Authorization process for enabling activities prohibited by the ESA is only egregiously problematic/onerous/overbearing for a few key common species such as Butternut. This is not the case for the majority of species, which are significantly rarer and benefit from the red tape and administrative slowdowns, which afford them proper consideration. The ESA is not intended to be easy to bypass for the benefit of business; conservation is not a convenience. We are talking about actual living species which could be destroyed by our ignorance and cavalier habitat destruction.  The Ontario countryside is extremely valuable and is an important piece of heritage passed down over generations of people who have lived here.  There are things that we will lose permanently if we destroy them now.  It is not the right of developers to turn all of our countryside into endless suburbia for their own personal gain. Development is not a right, it is a privilege, and should only be undertaken with the future of Ontarians in mind, not catering to the pocketbooks of the rich.
I also think you should strengthen the ESA through the following:
- Repeal the exemptions created in 2013 to permit forestry and mining industries to conduct harmful activities to species at risk.
- Repeal the exemption created in 2016 to allow hunting and trapping of the Threatened Algonquin wolf.
I do not want substantial changes to occur to the ESA and I am concerned about the intentions of the current Ontario government, which has made it clear that they want to make Ontario 'open for business'. Ontario is not a convenience, and our future is not a trivial matter. Please only make genuine improvements to the ESA, and do not remove its protective capacities.

Re:	Response to Environmental Registry of Ontario Number 013-4143 – 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act:  Discussion Paper
Dear Mr. Phillips,
The Sustainable Forest License (SFL) Managers in Northwest Region collaborated to develop the following response to the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act:  Discussion Paper, which is posted on the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO).  All of the SFL Managers are Registered Professional Foresters and endorse the information contained within this response with their professional designation stamp.  The implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) will dramatically affect the economic sustainability of the forest sector in Northwestern Ontario, which is detailed in the attached slide deck (1).
Collectively, the facilities that utilize the wood supply from the forests in the Northwest Region directly employ thousands of Northern Ontarians.  These direct jobs in forest resource processing facilities generate indirect and induced jobs throughout the region and province.  These forest managers previously provided their concerns to the former Liberal government and their Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry in the hopes of starting a dialogue about the effects of this policy.
Given the lack of consultation with the forest sector prior to the ERO posting, the SFL Managers in the Northwest Region deemed it necessary to consolidate their concerns into a singular message.  The scope of the prescriptions contained within the ESA and the associated long-term deferrals threaten the long-term sustainability of Ontario’s forests.  Long-term deferrals and the associated lack of harvesting activity change the forest ecosystem in Ontario from a carbon sink to a carbon source; thereby negatively contributing to climate change.
The more immediate and overwhelming impact of the ESA and the associated long-term deferrals of large tracks of forested land are job losses.  In the Northwest Region, the currently available wood supply can be reduced by as much as 2.15 million cubic metres.  The impacts of this reduction could result in the closure of 6 mills and the loss of 875 direct jobs in these forest resource processing facilities.  All of these potential impacts are documented in a socioeconomic impacts study completed by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry in 2017, which is attached with our response to the ERO posting (2).
The loss of 875 direct jobs in forest resource processing facilities in the Northwest Region will also result in the loss of 2,039 indirect jobs in the region and 1,514 induced jobs in the province for a total of 4,428 jobs lost in Ontario.  These job multipliers were developed by the Minister’s Council on Forest Sector Competitiveness in 2005.  The multipliers are documented in the Final Report from the Council and is also attached with our response (3).  The Registered Professional Foresters that authored this response and created the attached PowerPoint presentation cannot endorse the prescriptions within the ESA when the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) provides the most stringent regulatory environment in the world.
The last Progressive Conservation (PC) government in Ontario understood the importance of protecting the three pillars of sustainability in Ontario’s Crown forests:  economic, social and environmental values.  To that end, in 2002 the PC government commissioned the Ontario Forest Accord Advisory Board (OFAAB) to establish the baseline for permanent, long-term wood supply necessary for the forest industry.  Their final report, which is enclosed, established the baseline wood supply at 11.8 million cubic metres (4).  The predicted losses resulting from the ESA policy can reduce the baseline wood supply available to the forest industry to just under 7 million cubic metres.
We are prepared to work with you and your staff to discuss our response to the ERO posting and help organize a meeting with all SFL Managers in the Northwest Region to fully discuss the impacts of the ESA policy.  The negative impacts outlined in our response can be avoided while maintaining the world class standard of long-term sustainability of Ontario’s Crown forests and all species that inhabit them.  We have created numerous solutions that will provide flexibility in the application of government policies and recognize the protection provided by the CFSA.
Please contact me at (807) 632-1732 or bthennessey@hmeenterprises.ca to organize a meeting to discuss the recommendations and solutions developed by the Registered Professional Foresters that authored this response.

This is important to protect the unique and varied creatures that live in Ontario.  The animals, birds, plants and other species that live in Ontario provide jobs, add value to the economy, support our way of life and bring joy and pleasure to many people.  At a time when human impacts on the environment are pervasive and in many ways irreversible, protecting species, especially those that are already threatened or endangerd is of paramount importance.  The ESA is strong because of the automatic protection of species, automatic habitat protection and strong permitting system.  Reducing or watering down these aspects of the ESA as is suggested in the discussion document will put vulnerable species at further risk.  Business and industry should have to justify why they need to harm species when undertaking development, and should have to mitigate harm, as they do now.  I do not support weakening the the permitting system.  In fact I understand that some industries and sectors have been granted exceptions from the ESA and I think these should be reversed to strengthen species protection.

- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;

I have read the discussion paper of the 10 year review of the Endangered Species Act.
The third paragraph of the preamble of the current act recognizes the precautionary principle, which urges prompt action when there is a threat of significant loss or reduction of biodiversity.  The current act embodies this principle.  The discussion paper does not.  From my reading I conclude that the issues raised in the discussion paper are issues of implementation, which are better addressed through adequate notice than through rewriting the act.  Many skilled writers (see, for example, the submissions by Ontario Nature, or CELA, links below) have provided the details better than I can.
One additional comment: Ontario's biodiversity, of which species at risk is a part, is a public asset and should be protected and enhanced as such.  Citizen science and bioblitzes get communities involved in understanding their natural heritage.  If they were promoted and supported the claim of surprise that protected species are present in a given area would lose credibility.

23807,/comment/23807,"You say that ""the Act has been criticized for being ineffective..."" and list complaints. I think it is not the Act that is ineffective, but how it has been implemented. The failure to protect and recover, and the complaints of people, come from bad implementation.
In this review you suggest changes that would weaken protection more, on top of the history of poor implementation of the Act. You say nothing about fixing the massive weakening of protections in 2013 caused by a permit-by-rule system which exempts industries from having to get permits for many common harmful activities and does not monitor compliance with the rules. This system was implemented in a way which reduces protections for species at risk, does not require overall benefit, and lacks oversight, enforcement, and public information about use of the system and harms being done.
This review does not address the 10-year failure to implement the ESA effectively. Instead this is a proposal to change the ESA to help the government to further delay real commitment and action to protect species at risk, and to help business interests to more easily exploit the exemptions allowed under the Act and its regulations, and even offer them new ways to get around compliance.
Species at risk will not be helped by longer timelines for listing, ministerial discretion to interfere in listing, weakening automatic protection, and subjecting the findings of COSSARO to ""review"". Species at risk will not be helped by delaying response to assessments and delaying review of progress toward recovery. Species at risk will not be helped by providing more ways and simpler ways to obtain exemptions from provisions of the ESA.
I would suggest instead to implement and administer the existing provisions of the Act in a way that is effective. Enforce the provisions of the act. Fix the permit-by-rule system that should not be used for major industrial activities at all, and should not allow industry to self-monitor and hide the impact of their activities.
Most of all what is needed is a government commitment to actually stand up for species at risk. Treat species at risk as a matter of urgency and importance. Do not cave in to industries who place their interests ahead of species at risk. Invest far more resources in species and habitat protection, assessment, response, recovery, monitoring and communication.

23808,/comment/23808,"The Endangered Species Act has already been limited by actions taken years ago. The Permit-By-Rule system of MNRF in relations to species at risk means that there is already 1) no oversight to ensure that habitat is being protected once a permit is issued, 2) there are no required harm prevention activities prior to receiving a permit, and 3) the conservation of endangered species in Ontario is already secondary to business interests. By stripping this legislation further, the government might as well say that they have no value for preserving the heritage that is Ontario's natural environment for the next generation. What are you going to tell your grandchildren when they find out that you are the government responsible for the disappearance of the INSERT:Caribou, Loggerhead Shrike, Algonquin Wolf (oh but wait, you won't list this species because wolves are too popular with hunters).

The current system fails our endangered species. The proposed changes will only further erode Ontarians belief that our government truly wants to protect our environment, preserve our natural heritage features and protect our species at risk. Our experience has been that if left up to Ontario government agencies, endangered species will be allowed to die in order to allow for development, even when many species at risk will die and just a few taxpayers will benefit.
Though I support the stated intent to provide more stringent protections for species at risk, the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal. On the contrary, for the most part they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Our struggle as follows, demonstrates how the current system failed endangered species in Ontario:
For over three years now concerned residents have attempted to have an application denied for an ESA Overall Benefit Permit that once approved, allows for the killing, harming and harassing of species at risk on Johnston Point, Loughborough Lake and/or to damage or destroy their habitat.
Two thousand, four hundred people signed a petition to have this permit denied.
Six species at risk (SAR) have been acknowledged by the MNRF as living on Johnston Point. The developer presented two Environmental Assessments to authorities and both of these assessments claimed that no living species at risk existed on Johnston Point.
It was only through the tremendous efforts of local citizens and at much personal cost that it was proven at least six species at risk live on Johnston Point.  It is very possible that there may be as many as nine more.
Local citizens early on reported evidence of species at risk on site at Johnston Point. They advised Township, County and attempted to present evidence on living SAR at the OMB hearing. They were however, denied. Frustrated that officials were approving residential development in protected Provincially Significant Wetland and in an ANSI, (Area of Natural and Scientific Interest, recommended for protection by the MNRF in 1993), these citizens went to work. They held conference calls with the MNRF, attended Township meetings and attended County meetings. They commissioned independent scientific reports. They sought out expert opinions, scientific and legal. They drafted a petition. They publicly commented on the proposed permit through ER 013-1130. They asked for delegations and presented evidence of breach of Conditions of Draft Plan approval to the Township and to the County and the CRCA. They wrote numerous letters to Township, County, the MNRF and the Cataraqui Regional Conservation Authority (CRCA) and their locals MPPs, both current and former.
They did all of this, and more much. All this to protect species at risk that were living in area Ontario had already designated as protected.
None of their letters to the Township, County or the CRCA were ever answered. The Township asked the MNRF to come to a Council meeting and explain what is an Overall Benefit Permit. The MNRF cancelled the very morning of the agreed meeting. For months the MNRF did not re-schedule and eventually replied that they could not attend due to financial cut backs. The Township offered to pay their expenses. The MNRF never came.
In the end, all of the citizen’s efforts were in vain. There has never been an Overall Benefit Permit denied and this one was no exception. It was issued October 28, 2018 and officially announced three weeks later. The permit provides no details of any overall benefit to the two species at risk listed on the application, and no mention at all of the four species at risk that will be impacted by this development but have never been addressed.
We have been told that the permit was issued on Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks letterhead.
Tragically, it appears that development, even unnecessary development, will continue to triumph over endangered species, even in Ontario's most environmentally sensitive and protected areas.
For this reason, I ask that any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to genuinely protect species at risk and:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

-Please provide a definition of what ""Conservation Agreement"" would mean.
-The more approaches that are available the better to cover all options.  When adding new approaches I would suggest that others ones not be removed as each situation is different.
-Municipalities may be interested in being able to set aside particular areas suitable to SAR in their jurisdictions in which proponents can then buy into or use for their offsetting areas allowing other portions of the municipalities to be developed.
Butternuts
•	Unlike southern Ontario, Butternuts are locally abundant in Eastern Ontario with some sites having several hundred individuals.  This includes a large number of what are classed as “Category 3” by MNRF’s current Butternut Tree Analysis Protocol for assessment butternuts.  This is because trees only need to have a diameter at breast height of 20cm or larger and be within 40m of a heavily cankered tree to be classed as Category 3.  However, it is very important to note that more often than not they are not truly archivable.  When the “Category 3” individual is assessed by an MNRF approved archiver, the individual is usually deemed not worthy of being archived.  We estimate that only 1 in 50 of our ""category 3s"" are considered archivable.  When the tree identified as a category 3 on-site is found not to be archivable, the proponent is still required to pay 17-22K (2018 prices) per archive despite the fact that the individual was not archivable.  The MNRF approved archiver uses this money to archive a surrogate tree.  We suggest that any tree found to be non-archivable by the MRNF approved archiver be downgraded to a Category 2.
•	The overall benefit measures for projects that impact more than ten Category 2 trees or one or more Category 3 trees are standard.  Yet, this is still a process that requires permitting under the Act and signature by the Minister.  This involves a large number of staff in the MNRF offices and for the developer a long delay (minimum is 18 months in the Kemptville District).  Since the overall benefit measures are standard, we see no reason why this could not be done via the existing on-line registration process (Notice of Butternut Impact).  This would remove the uncertainties and long delays to development and reduce the red tape associated with this permits.  It would also reduce the workload of the Minister.  Further, in the existing circumstances, if a permit has been obtained or the maximum number of Category 2 trees registered and another butternut tree is encountered during construction, then there can be a delay of 6 – 18 months while an updated permit is obtained.  These kinds of timelines simply don’t work for construction.  Not only do the contractors and the owners have certain commitments that affect their contracts and lenders, there are also several other timing windows that they are working around (in-water timing, bat roosting periods, breeding birds, reptile active season…..).  As such delays just become compounded.  Leading to issues with lenders.  This issue would be alleviated if all butternuts could be registered on-line.  You could have a longer review period on the online registrations when dealing with more than 10 Category 2s or a single Category 3.  You could ask for more information such as – distance between tree and various activities (to help confirm that harm versus kill is accurate), deadlines for work etc…  We’d be very willing to help work out details.
•	Would government consider reducing the replacement plantings?
•	There is currently no General Habitat Descriptions available for Butternuts.  As a result, some District Office utilize the 25m distance rule whereas other utilize a 50m distance rule for determining whether there is a potential to harm a Butternut.  The current Butternut Health Assessor guidelines states that inventories should be complete in and within 25m of any disturbances.  These inconsistencies should be remedied as it leads to uncertainties.
Bobolinks/Meadowlarks
Similar to the butternuts, question the need for the maximum size for using the online registration instead of permitting.
GENERAL COMMENTS:
I understand from that the focus is on the Legislation.  However, please consider the following:
- There needs to be better feedback loops from the information that is being collected by various people (consultants, researchers, government) .  Since, every time that anyone completes any research involving SAR they need to get a permit from (currently MNRF) and with that permit comes a reporting requirement, this offers an excellent opportunity to create a feedback loop.  Include a mandatory requirement in the report for two things: 1. Researchers should review their results in respect to the existing information and GRS and indicate whether their results supports these or not (simple check list with option for comments would suffice) and 2. What their new recommendations would be.  This would provide a mechanism to help close the datagaps and give you a way to collect information and be ready for the COSSARO reviews….
-The Government Response Strategies are fine but the timelines sometimes means that you don’t have the correct information for be creating them.  In these instances I would suggest that what gets published immediately is more of an information package on the species, what is known, identify the data gaps that you need filled to complete the GRS and identify threats.  If this is published, I’m sure that researchers and academics will use this to help them focus their studies.
-Overall benefit doesn't always need to be fancy, sometimes just protecting the habitat in another area is enough, especially in areas that do not have tree cutting bylaws.
-The online registration process is a very good tool as are the mitigation plans.  These should be continued and expanded.  Mitigation plans are much more flexible and able to deal with new science than agreements or permits.

23816,/comment/23816,"EBR 013-4143: 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Endangered Species Act (ESA) review discussion paper. On behalf of the Citizens Environment Alliance of Southwestern Ontario, my comments are provided below. General comments about the discussion paper are followed by responses to the specific focus and questions of the discussion paper.
The overall direction of the options under consideration in the discussion paper is environmental deregulation to make it easier for industry and development proponents to proceed with activities that harm species at risk and their habitats.
There is a fundamental difference between revising the law and improving its implementation. To improve outcomes for species at risk, Ontario needs to improve ESA implementation not weaken the law.
The “activities” referred to throughout the paper are by-and-large harmful activities prohibited by the ESA (e.g., killing members of threatened or endangered species, damaging or destroying their habitat). Proponents can proceed with harmful activities only if they have an authorization (e.g., a permit which requires an overall benefit to be provided for the species) or an exemption (which should be an exception, not the rule).
Landscape Approaches
Landscape-level planning is already provided in the ESA through Sections 13 and 14, for example through multi-species recovery strategies. Therefore, no change to the law is needed. The law should not be changed to allow landscape approaches “instead of” species-specific approaches. The fine scale of species-specific status assessments, listings and protections is needed.
Listing Process and Protections
Science-based listing of species at risk by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) (sec. 3 – 8) and automatic protection of listed species and their habitats (sec. 9, 10) are cornerstones of the ESA and must remain intact. There should be no change to the ESA regarding the listing process and the role of COSSARO. The law sets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of “the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.” (sec. 5(3)).
Improving notification is an implementation issue which should be addressed through better communications. In its listing process, COSSARO is required to consider species listed by the federal Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) (sec. 4(2)a); there are years of notice embedded in this process, from the release of COSEWIC status reports to the listing by COSSARO.
There should be no alternative to automatic species and habitat protections (e.g., through ministerial discretion to remove or delay protections).
Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce Government Response Statements (GRS) within nine months of the release of Recovery Strategies (sec. 11(8)). Failure to meet the legislated deadline is an implementation issue.
The required five-year reporting on progress is reasonable and ensures transparency and accountability. It provides an impetus for action, ensuring that effectiveness is assessed, and contributes to institutional learning and adaptive management.
The ESA already allows the Minister to delay the development of a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)b) or to not proceed with a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)c). No change to the law is needed.
There should be no changes to the legal provisions for habitat regulations, which describe specific boundaries or features of areas deemed to be habitat and provide enhanced certainty for ESA implementation and enforcement. They can include areas where a species “used to live or is believed to be capable of living” (sec. 55(3)b), presenting a significant opportunity for protection and recovery efforts to extend beyond places where species at risk currently persist.
Authorization Processes
There are already sufficient authorization tools. No new tools are needed. Challenges should be addressed through improved implementation.
Proponents of harmful activities should not be allowed to simply pay into a conservation fund - an easy way out that reduces accountability and facilitates harm to species at risk and their habitats. Retain the current requirements to provide an on-the-ground, overall benefit to species harmed.
Do not simplify requirements for sec. 17(2)d permits. These are intended to be available only for projects that “result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario” and that will not “jeopardize the survival or recovery of the species in Ontario.” These are appropriate requirements and ensure that such permits are issued only an exceptional basis.
Do not simplify requirements for exemptions through regulation. That would only make it easier for harmful activities to proceed, without public scrutiny, government oversight or enforcement.
The ESA (sec. 18) already provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. No legislative change is needed. This is an implementation issue.
Conclusion
In southwestern Ontario there has been a staggering loss of habitat for species. Any changes to the ESA should focus on repealing the 2013 exemptions to forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development industries. Additionally, section 57(1)1 should be amended so that any future exemptions cannot endanger the recovery of endangered and threatened species. If there is a pathway to recovery for species at risk then the priority of the ESA must be on protecting and recovering species at risk, exclusively.

We support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.

Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23818,/comment/23818,"Re: ERO #013-4143 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper
Biodiversity in general, and the protection of species at risk and their habitat in particular, are critical to maintaining healthy ecosystems across the province’s wilderness and other natural areas. Therefore, a strong and properly implemented provincial Endangered Species Act should be a governmental priority.
The 2007 Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been a major step towards protection and recovery of species at risk of extirpation from Ontario, or extinction. However, since that time the Act’s function has been seriously impaired, as in 2013, with the introduction of the permit-by-rule system with exemptions from the prohibition on harming species at risk or their habitat for many industries and developers.
In 2013 the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario (ECO) addressed the new permit-by-rule system in a report: Laying Siege to the Last Line of Defence: A Review of Ontario’s Weakened Protections for Species at Risk. The Commissioner was concerned about reduced protection for species at risk, lack of enforcement and reduced public consultation.
In 2017 the ECO issued a report, Good Choices, Bad Choices. Environmental Rights and Environmental Protection in Ontario, examining the ESA’s effectiveness. She concluded that the “Survival of Ontario’s species at risk has been greatly compromised by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s (MNRF) expediting of its ESA approvals. Instead of individual permits requiring “overall benefit” to species. The MNRF now allows harmful activities under the permit-by-rule system requiring only that proponents minimize (not eliminate or compensate for) harm. The MNRF tends to ignore whether proponents comply with the weakened provisions. Meanwhile it is difficult to hold the Ministry to account, as it does not disclose what activities it allows to harm species at risk.” The Report concludes that, though the ESA is sound, MNRF “utterly failed to implement the law effectively” and fails “to not just protect species at risk… but also to lead effective recovery programs”, and “the ministry’s compliance monitoring and enforcement actions… are deficient”.
The David Suzuki Foundation, Ontario Nature and Ecojustice issued a joint 2017 report: Without a Trace? Reflecting on the 10th anniversary of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, 2007, it describes how the regulatory exemptions fundamentally change how MNRF approaches harm to species at risk. Exemptions allow activities without review or approval, as long as development proponents register online and meet conditions set out in regulation. There is no requirement to provide an overall benefit to the species harmed. The report concludes that “MNRF has chosen to put the interests of industry first, over the recovery of Ontario’s most imperilled species”.
The ECO’s most recent (2018) Environmental Protection Report, titled Back to Basics, issues a warning that “Ontario’s species are under tremendous pressure from habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation, pollution, disease and parasites, and climate change”.
Thus the fundamentally effective ESA has been seriously compromised by the recent exemptions, by lack of proper implementation by MNRF, and inadequate compliance monitoring and enforcement. The deficiencies raised by the various authors and NGOs cited above should be addressed.
I support the purposes of the Act: Identifying species at risk using scientific and traditional knowledge, protecting these organisms and their environments to promote their recovery, and engaging in stewardship.
Unfortunately, the Discussion Paper accompanying the ERO posting focusses on fundamentally undermining the ESA. It does this at a time when over half the world’s wildlife has been lost in a few decades, and when the pace of destruction of our ecological support system in Ontario is accelerating massively. The discussion paper promotes the interests of developers and the reduction of protection for designated species at risk in the Act. It promotes elimination of science-based procedures for designating species at risk, it extends timelines for producing recovery strategies and it further simplifies the permitting process at the expense of our community’s natural environment. These changes will be deleterious for the species at risk and for our province.
Turning to the foci of the discussion paper:
Focus 1 – Landscape Approaches
As the former chair of an Ontario ministerial panel on Caribou conservation, I support recovery strategies that are aimed at both the landscape (or ecosystem) level and the individual species level (both of while are available in the present ESA). A landscape approach can help many species by, for example, helping to maintain or increase habitat connectivity. An approach aimed at the needs of individual species is also critical if they are to survive and recover, as in the case of many insects. The landscape and species approaches complement each other.
Focus 2 – Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
The current timeline for listing species at risk is too lengthy, thus threatening their recovery, and it should not be extended.
The Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) currently determines listing through a rigorous scientific process. Any change toward making these decisions political will strongly tend to the arbitrary and will be focussed on the wishes of vested interests.
Focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
Recovery Strategies and Government Response Documents are currently often delayed for years at a time, so harming species at risk. The timelines should not be increased. Rather sufficient resources should be available to ensure timely completion.
The reviews of progress produced every 5 years are critical to assessing each species’ recovery and to timely identification of problems with the recovery strategy. These review timelines should not be extended or eliminated.
Focus 4 – Authorization Processes
The requirements of overall benefits for subject species are foundational in protecting species at risk. Developers should not be permitted to pay into a fund as compensation for harming species at risk or harming or destroying their habitat.
The proposals to simplify the process for obtaining authorizations will harm species and their habitats.
Compliance monitoring is inadequate, as discussed in the ECO’s 2017 Environmental Protection Report. Monitoring and enforcement should be made more effective.
Recommendations:
The current review should incorporate the following principles to protect the growing list of species at risk in Ontario.
•	Exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and other industries that were enacted in 2013 must be eliminated. They are inconsistent with the aims of the Act to protect and restore endangered species and their habitat.
•	The science-based COSSARO listing process should be retained, and must not be replaced with political ministerial discretion.
•	The COSSARO review and listing process should not be lengthened
•	 Time lines for development of Recovery Strategies and Government Response Documents are critical to species at risk recovery, and should not be lengthened. Current documents are often years late, and more resources must available to meet the deadlines.
•	The 5-year Review of Progress schedule should be maintained, so as to understand the success or failure of a recovery program.
•	Mandatory protection of habitat for threatened and endangered species must be maintained, and must not become an arbitrary ministerial discretionary area.
•	Current requirements for overall benefits for species at risk must be retained, and developers must not be permitted to pay compensation for harming species at risk or their habitats.
•	Strategies must be developed and resources allocated to address the currently inadequate implementation of the ESA, to ensure adequate compliance monitoring and enforcement, and to increase public consultations.

23824,/comment/23824,"I reviewed the document, and found it confusing - that is, it seems to be heavily biased in favour of changes to the Act in order to support development with no recognition of the consequences to the natural world. This seems short-sighted to me. To get a better read, I consulted a professional biologist, who submitted the following comments:
My reactions to the discussion paper are mixed. I agree that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) could be
improved; I do NOT in any way support changes to the ESA or its administration that result in reduced
protection for Species at Risk (SAR). I agree that the administration and implementation of the ESA’s
policies and regulations is sometimes slow; I do NOT believe that the way to improve review times is to
make the review process less comprehensive, but rather that more staff should be hired to facilitate.
My overall impression from this document is that you have little interest in actually improving
protections to species at risk in Ontario, no matter how much lip service is paid to that goal, and that the
focus is instead on making it easier for businesses to circumvent protections in order to make money.
But financial gain is never sufficient reason to compromise the survival of a species or the health of the
environment. “Efficiency” should not be used as an excuse for cutting out vital steps in a system that
provides protection for the most vulnerable parts of our ecosystems.
I find the statement that “the Act has been criticized… for creating barriers to economic development”
frankly absurd. What the Act does is ensure that developers and businesses cannot destroy or
irreparably harm SAR and their habitat in the pursuit of higher profits, and yet somehow the government is attempting to spin that as negative.
With respect to some specific discussion points mentioned in the document:
- P.3, re: utilizing a “landscape approach instead of a case-by-case approach”. Firstly, as a general
rule, environmental assessments in Ontario are already required to look at both the landscape-
level and the site-level in order to assess connections and trends. It is disingenuous to present
“landscape approaches” as a new tool that you intend to introduce as an improvement.
Secondly, SAR frequently require very specific habitats – often, part of what makes them rare in
the first place is a dependence on uncommon habitats or site conditions. Even those that
require large tracts of habitat on a landscape level can also have site-specific requirements.
Therefore, I do not believe it’s possible to only look at a landscape level and still provide
appropriate habitat protection.
- P.4, re: the suggestion of longer timelines before a species is listed. What benefit would
increased timelines provide to SAR? If a species has been designated a SAR, it is in danger and
protection is appropriate; in some cases a rapid response may be necessary. Providing more
advance notice prior to listing would, quite frankly, just allow businesses or people with conflicts
more time to conveniently erase those conflicts without fearing legal consequence. I’m not
against a certain amount of “grandfathering” for projects that are near completion (although I
still believe these should be reviewed and that ways to minimize impact should be
incorporated), but a broad blanket policy to delay listing is not an improvement to the ESA.
- P.7, re: the suggestion of creating a conservation fund. I wholeheartedly disagree that this
should be allowed. Firstly, money coming out of a “conservation fund” has no guarantee to
address the specific site or species that is being affected. And secondly, putting a set dollar value
on compensation simply makes habitat destruction a line-item cost that gets added in to the
project budget as a first choice rather than a last resort. Avoidance should always be the first
choice – per your own document, “avoiding impacts to species at risk and their habitat is an
integral part of protection and recovery”. Compensation – i.e., the idea of enhancing or creating
habitat elsewhere to replace what is lost – should always be the last option (as it is often
ineffective) and should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if is it even feasible
from a conservation standpoint, and if so then how best to go about it.
The discussion paper as a whole is filled with leading questions and pro-development bias that does not
lead to productive discussion regarding actual improvements to SAR protection in Ontario. This is
particularly apparent in, for example, discussion question #3 on pg. 7: “what changes to authorization
requirements would better enable economic development while providing positive outcomes and
protections for species at risk?” Economic development should not be the driving factor in determining
what is appropriate for SAR protection. The focus of legislation pertaining to SAR should always, first and
foremost, be on the PROTECTION OF SAR AND THEIR HABITAT. Appropriate protections for specific
areas or species can be determined through science-based analysis, and no amount of simplified
applications or exemptions can or should allow more “economic development”

23825,/comment/23825,"As the General Manager of a First Nation Owned Forest Management Company, and as a resident of Northern Ontario who lives in a part of the Province which appears most negatively affected by the Endangered Species Act, the view of the Act is fairly negative.  Although the Act's aim to protect and conserve Endangered Species and their habitat is a worthwhile endeavor, the way it has been implemented for species with large spatial ranges is limited in effectiveness, infringes on First Nations Rights and has major economic consequences.
To ""Protect"" habitat such as for Woodland Caribou, large areas are placed into long term deferral areas off limits to forest harvesting. The boreal forest does not remain healthy when protected, and ages into habitat which is unsuitable to the species it is meant to be created for.  Without new habitat being created, either through harvesting or wild fires, Woodland Caribou's habitat will continue to disappear.
The implementation of various policies as a result of the ESA has resulted in negative impacts on local First Nation Communites who have not had Meaningful Consultation on how the act impacts their traditional use of the landscape, future economical potential or utilizes traditional ecological knowledge from the individuals with the longest knowledge of the area. The imposition of the Act onto First Nations against their will has led to vocal dislike of both the Act and species its meant to protect.  Couple suggestions is that First Nation representation should be included on the COSSARO Committee, Meaningful Consultation occur when species protection infringes First Nation Rights and include Traditional Ecological Knowledge in the Protection and Recovery Strategies of Species.
As a forest manager looking at the volume reductions occurring in the FMP we are currently writing  due to Woodland Caribou management, it worries me about the impacts on the local economy, workers and communities. Many of these areas are where Caribou have not resided in since prior to 1950's, and the job losses which will occur will cripple communities through the closing of local mills as not enough fiber will be available for harvest.  Under this Act and the resulting policies, I feel like Northern Ontario is being forced to become a welfare state and not as a result of limited resources which could allow it to prosper.

To Whom It May Concern:
Please accept this letter as the formal submission from Forests Ontario on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143.
Forests Ontario is the voice for Ontario's forests, working towards a future of healthy forests supporting healthy communities and a healthy economy through forest and ecosystem restoration, stewardship, education, and awareness initiatives. Among our restoration work is the administration of the government of Ontario’s 50 Million Tree Program (50MTP), an initiative designed to significantly increase our forest cover on Ontario’s fragmented landscapes. In addition to that, the 50MTP has enabled Forests Ontario to roll-out Ontario’s new Grassland Stewardship Initiative, developed to improve the quantity and quality of grassland habitat.
Firstly, our organization strongly believes that the management of species at risk would be greatly improved through a landscape level/ecosystem-based approach, as opposed to a species by species framework.  As noted in the discussion paper, species-specific policies can often limit the ability to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk or may result in situations where protection and recovery approaches for individual species can limit or conflict with one another. While we believe that species-specific elements (e.g. calving or nesting sites) can always be incorporated (i.e. a fine filter approach), a landscape level approach (i.e. coarse filter) should be given priority consideration during the development and implementation of species at risk related policies.
Secondly, we believe that ongoing provincial level support for afforestation and grasslands programs, including the 50MTP and the Grassland Stewardship Initiative, will have significant and long-lasting benefits to many species located across southern Ontario’s fragmented landscapes including but not restricted to; Butternut, Acadian Flycatcher, Flying Squirrel, American Badger, Ginseng, Eastern mole, Cucumber tree, Algonquin Wolf, Cherry Birch, Bobolink, Kentucky Coffee Tree to name a few.
However, we also recognize that in an extremely fragmented landscape, an ecosystem approach may not be practical and as such specific considerations needs to be available to mitigate the loss of individual species habitat.
Our organization would be pleased to discuss these positions in more details with the province in support of the government’s efforts to ensuring the recovery of species at risk in an effective and efficient manner.

23827,/comment/23827,"1. Landscape Approaches
I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is still warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat as a priority, and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

23828,/comment/23828,"I want to live in an Ontario where it's recognized that if we want healthy, happy people, we need nature. Children and adults both need to be able to appreciate the wonderful biodiversity we have. For this to happen, protection of wildlife habitat has to be mandatory. The #1 reason for extinctions, which are happening across the world, is destruction of habitat. An increasing number of plants and animals in Ontario are now at risk of extinction, and with the changes we anticipate with global climate change, that number will only increase. This is absolutely not the time to weaken protections for them; on the contrary, the exemptions for logging, mining, hydroelectric and commercial interests that were put in place in 2013 should be struck. The proposals that MECP  is proposing make no sense at all if we still care about the future of most wildlife in this province. Here are some of my concerns specifically:
•	Using “ministerial discretion” to decide whether species or habitat protections should apply assumes that untrained elected officials are capable of knowing what species and habitat should be protected. This work needs to be done by scientists with specific training and should NEVER be politically based. We have a system in place that works; there is no need to ""fix"" it.
•	Implementing a review process to second-guess the science-based listing decisions of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO)--absolute lunacy!  COSSARO has qualified people and use science to make decisions. Why create another layer of bureaucracy?
•	Simplifying requirements for industry permits or exemptions to undertake harmful activities- The fact that we knowingly allow industry to harm species or wildlife is hard enough to believe, but assuming that there are some activities that cannot be prevented, don't we need to know as much as possible about how these harms can be reduced? Shouldn't industry be held to the highest standards?
•	Extending or removing legislated timelines for planning and reporting-this is worrying, since planning and reporting could easily be put off indefinitely as more and more of an endangered population is wiped out.
•	Allowing proponents of harmful activities to simply pay into a conservation fund rather than meet current requirements to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species that they negatively impact. Paying doesn't bring back dead animals or restore habitat. You can't undo death with money, and it takes centuries, in most cases,  to truly remediate habitat destruction. Our wildlife can't wait for that. Our wildlife is in jeopardy now.
The challenge for the MECP is to find a way to implement a strengthened Endangered Species Act in a better way; that means looking at the bureaucracy and fixing its efficiency. Please strengthen rather than gut the ESA.

23829,/comment/23829,"Comments on Endangered Species Act Review
Thank you for the opportunity to comment.  My comments on the discussion document follow:
Government’s commitment
•	“The government is committed to ensuring that the Endangered Species Act provides stringent protections for species at risk, continuing to work with stakeholders and Indigenous peoples to improve its effectiveness, and modernizing the program based on best practices in other jurisdictions” (p 2)
•	This is a vital commitment: vital, extensive and diverse species represent a socio-economic asset that Ontarians cannot afford to lose (species being key to innovative technologies based on study of their natural abilities, agriculture, pollination, tourism; recreation, health, fishing, hunting, clean air and water, etc.)
•	As well, the commitment to working with stakeholders and Indigenous peoples and to drawing on other jurisdictions’ best practices in protecting species are both valuable
•	It would be good to set this commitment in the global context – the rapid world-wide loss of species being a serious contemporary problem shared by all countries
Species diversity
•	There is recognition (p 1) of the Province’s “incredible diversity of more than 30,000 species of plants, insects, fish and wildlife”
•	This is the pivotal point of the Endangered Species Act: other considerations (business opportunities, timing for assessments and authorizations, exceptions, public information, etc.) should be secondary to this one
Economic development
•	The Government is looking for “ways to streamline approvals and provide clarity to support economic development” (p 2)
•	The economic development that occurs in areas crucial to species survival must be based on cutting-edge technologies (construction and operational designs that ensure a zero or near-zero ecological footprint)
•	The Government should undertake an review of the ESA provisions created in 2013 to allow forestry, hydro, quarry, drainage, mining and wind-power activities in sensitive ecosystems – this with a view to ensuring the application of development approaches that give priority to species protection
Recovery strategies
•	243 species are listed at risk, but there are only 140 recovery strategies (p 1)
•	Why not 243 recovery strategies?
Scientific basis of decisions
•	One desired outcome of the review is to “ensure species assessments are based on up-to-date science” (p 2)
•	Plus the document asks whether we should be able to “request an additional review and assessment in cases where there is emerging science or conflicting information” (p 4)
•	Yet the document states (p 1) that “COSSARO is an independent committee with up to 12 experts that use best available scientific and Traditional Ecological Knowledge to assess native plants or animals that may be at risk, and to provide a classification”
•	If COSSARO somehow does not have access to up-to-date science (surprising if true), we need measures and funding provisions to ensure that happens
Landscape protection
•	The document asks, “Are there existing tools or processes that support managing for species risk at a landscape scale that could be recognized under the Endangered Species Act?” (p 3)
•	It’s not really clear what is meant by ‘landscape protection’, but it seems best to allow both intensive and extensive land designations to protect species
•	In “Protecting not-so-wild places helps biodiversity,” Faisal Moola, Jessica Lukawiecki and Robin J. Roth note that a “recent global synthesis of conservation studies shows that even small habitat patches are important for biodiversity and should no longer be neglected for conservation” (https://news.uoguelph.ca/2019/02/protecting-not-so-wild-places-helps-bi…)
Notification process
•	The document asks whether there should be “longer timelines before a species is listed” (p 4)
•	It would depend on how urgent the situation is and how long it has taken to reach the designation stage
•	If there is a problem with notification, provisional/interim protections can be put in place
Ministerial discretion
•	The document contemplates “ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat” (p 4)
•	This should not occur if it goes against available scientific advice and the primary commitment to protect the Province’s endangered species
Other statutes
•	“The Act adds duplication and delay for activities that are subject to other legislative or regulatory frameworks, like forestry under Ontario’s Crown Forest Sustainability Act” (p 7)
•	If one of the Province’s other statutes provides measures that will serve to protect species, they could be used – there’s no need to duplicate administrative requirements (e.g., multiple permits)
•	But we need to ensure that those companion measures can be relied upon to achieve ESA objectives – we need to make sure all the measures in play serve the purpose of species protection
Conservation fund
•	The document raises the prospect businesses could circumvent species protections in one area by “paying into a conservation fund dedicated to species at risk conservation” (p 7)
•	This seems to defeat the ESA objective of protecting endangered species – how can we sacrifice the individual habitats of species that are teetering on the edge of extinction?  We need as wide a margin of error as possible
Conservation banking
•	The document asks whether to “allow conservation banking to enable addressing requirements for species at risk prior to activities” (p 7)
•	There should be an explanation of what is intended by ‘conservation banking’:
	          - if it’s about pooling multiple mitigation resources into a larger reserve, it sounds good
	          - if it’s about a ‘no net loss’ calculation, the precariousness of these species makes any loss
                    or trade-off unacceptable
Conservation agreements
•	Organizing local conservation agreements would have some merit if they allow all local players an opportunity to buy into a shared plan to protect species of importance to the local community and local economy
•	These agreements would take time at the front-end to set up, but would provide more effective protection over the long run (e.g., lower costs for inspection and compliance)
Inspection and compliance powers
•	“In what circumstances would enhanced inspection and compliance powers be warranted?” (p 7)
•	Where the species are in serious trouble

Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge MECP to:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.

23835,/comment/23835,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the 10-year review of the Endangered Species Act (ESA; ERO No. 013-4143). However, I am concerned that the Discussion Paper is a thinly veiled proposal to remove existing protection for the growing number of species at risk in our province and make it easier for industry to continue to degrade and destroy habitat and species-at-risk directly.
Economic development is irrelevant if there is no healthy environment left for Ontarians. The ESA is in place to protect our most vulnerable biodiversity, and is rightly strict. It SHOULD be difficult to get around regulations that are in place for protection. Increasing clarity and transparency is doable through better communications with stakeholders - the Act itself does not need to be changed, other than to be strengthened and to repeal previous exemptions that degrade our environment. Science-based legislation that protects our species is not red tape that needs to be cut - it's necessary to ensure we do not destroy our environment for the sake of short-term economic gains.
The ESA exists to protect and recover species facing extinction in Ontario. Therefore, I support only the direct strengthening of this ESA by:
- Maintaining that every species gets assessed by COSSARO, and if necessary receives a science-based Recovery or Management Strategy, a Government Response Statement and a Progress Report within existing mandated timelines. Any ""landscape approach"" must exist over and above species-specific regulations.
- Maintaining science-based listing by COSSARO, and abandoning the idea of allowing ministerial discretion regarding habitat and species protection under section 9 and section 10 of the ESA
- Preventing any appeal process to COSSARO assessments and subsequent listing on SARO
- Requiring all proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground, monitored and enforced overall benefit to impacted species and abandoning your proposal to create an option for such proponents to pay into a conservation fund to compensate for conducting activities that are harmful to species at risk
I ask that you commit to actual strengthening the ESA by:
- Repealing the exemptions created in 2013 to permit forestry, hydro and mining industries to conduct harmful activities to species at risk
- Repealing the exemption created in 2016 to allow hunting and trapping of the Threatened Algonquin wolf
- Amending section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and/or recovery of Endangered and Threatened species
- Affording section 9 and section 10 protection to any species that has been assessed as Special Concern in two consecutive assessments by COSSARO until such a time when the species' assessment results in downlisting to Not At Risk
Economic development can be achieved in a sustainable way that benefits all stakeholders without sacrificing our endangered species and vulnerable habitats. Once they are gone, they are gone forever. That is an unacceptable outcome when we have the power to prevent it from happening, if only we choose to value a holistic approach that does not provide a free pass to development and ongoing urban sprawl. We are better than this. Let's prove it by protecting our species rather than constantly trying to put a price tag on them.

23836,/comment/23836,"1. Landscape level approaches are already possible under the ESA. It is important that SAR protections are species-specific and site-specific otherwise the needs of species that occupy very small amounts of habitat or have very specific habitat requirements may be left out. In addition, simply having habitat available is not always enough to make a species able to use that habitat, therefore habitat where the species is known to already exist must be protected for some species. If new tools for landscape approaches are created then great, but they should NOT replace species specific or site specific tools.
2. There is absolutely no need to lengthen the process for listing a species; it can already take several years during which time the species may decline further. Secondly, automatic protection for the species and it's habitat is critical otherwise what's the point in having an ESA to begin with? Thirdly, additional review of COSSARO reports seems redundant as COSSARO is already made up of experts and their reports are based on available science. This seems to be an attempt to undermine science, which again would make the ESA pointless.
3. The time limits of nine months for a government response statement and five years for a review of progress is appropriate. Rather than extending the deadline, the government should commit the necessary resources to meet it. If data is available over a longer time period or stewardship actions will take place over a longer timeframe then simply state that in the progress report.
4. As pointed out in the government's discussion paper, there are already numerous provisions under the ESA to allow activities that would otherwise be prohibited. Therefore new authorization tools seem redundant, especially as the ministry always approves permit applications. Rather than creating new ways to get around the ESA, the government should be tightening existing protections by, for example, repealing the broad exemptions given to several industries including the forestry industry. Enforcement of the ESA has been extremely weak and the government should also commit to providing the necessary tools and resources for compliance monitoring and enforcement.
The discussion paper implies that of Ontario's 30,000 species, all are thriving except for a small number. In reality, current research suggests that somewhere around 50% of species are declining (Living Planet Report Canada, 2017). In the decade since the ESA has come into force there are very few success stories and more and more species are becoming at risk. However, the discussion paper suggests that we should be making it easier for business to destroy species at risk and habitat. Weakening the ESA will not help to achieve ""positive outcomes for species at risk."" As others have pointed out, this is not the Endangered Business Act but rather the Endangered Species Act.

Endangered species protection was created to ensure our most vulnerable species are not further harmed or put to extinction/extirpation. The update to the ESA in 2013 resulted in less protection for our flora and fauna, and these new amendments would almost certainly cause irreversible harm to them. The government should not go ahead with the proposed changes to the ESA, and should be more focussed on implementation and protection of our native species. Without a properly functioning ESA, this government will be responsible for the decline and elimination of species throughout Ontario.
I respect the government's plan to create jobs and restore the finances of Ontario, but we should not do so at the risk of doing major damage to our environment.

Land is at a premium in southern Ontario particularly but also for resource extraction in the north. What we can not afford to do is to lose any more valuable lands that are essential to recovering species at risk. Habitat loss is the number one threat to species across the globe, with climate change this will only worsen. We need natural species to allow species to adapt, give species the remaining habitat it has to persist. The questions asked of Ontarians in the discussion were one-sided and misleading, specifically to address development.  Not one of the questions addressed concerns voiced by Environmental groups or concerned citizens - only the woes of the industrial sector.

23844,/comment/23844,"The  proposed change in direction to the Endangered Species Act seems to minimize protection of species and the habitat necessary for their survival in favour of industrial activity and ""efficiency"" of the process to obtain approvals for commercial interests. That change in emphasis worries me.  The changes talk very little about the protection of species and habitat, which I think should be the main emphasis of the Act.
I am concerned about pollution of watercourses and groundwater especially in sensitive areas like the Oak Ridges Moraine that provides clean drinking water for a major urban population. I am concerned about the effects on indigenous populations when species like caribou disappear. I am concerned about companies going into northern areas to develop mines and leaving behind devastation to soil, water and wildlife habitat when the resource is no longer profitable to take out. Government needs to set reasonable standards for development, encourage enlightened planning and monitor results, by using scientific evidence, not simply profitability to determine what is in the interests of species, habitat, the local population, and the province as a whole. When the interests conflict, there need to be laws and regulations that determine solutions rather than politicking, as the Liberals have learned to their cost. The language of the document talks about ""positive"" actions but does not mention evidence or science. There is little sense in this document that the Act sees either protection or more importantly recovery of species numbers as a priority. This seems a glaring omission.
Efficiency is not a bad thing if it means a reduction of duplicate procedures and if it entails hiring more biologists to conduct environmental assessments that results in quicker decisions. However, it will have a negative outcome for endangered species and the environment as a whole if  'efficiency' means a short-cut around protections for species and habitat  without engaging companies to come up with viable solutions and hold them to account.  Past Conservative governments were responsible for mandating that forestry companies  produce plans for reforestation and environmental rehabilitation and the same governments protected wetlands and watersheds through the development of the Conservation Authority system in reaction to Hurricane Hazel. That system stopped the building of houses on many flood plains and the removal of trees, which keeps soil from eroding into watercourses, reducing the potential of future major flooding to destroy lives and property.  I hope this Conservative Government will take a broader outlook to economic activity and not concentrate on short-term gain. Development can also include eco-tourism and environmental sustainability, which should not be anathema to a conservative philosophy.
For these reasons and concerns, I do not agree with the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act and hope it will be improved before it is passed.

Also within the proposal it says ""looking for ways to streamline approvals and provide clarity to support economic development.""  I find it hard to believe that this government-the one who is open for business and clearly has intentions to weaken environmental protections  will take a balanced approach. In fact, when does the environment ever win or even has the same regard as economic growth?  It doesn't. Which is why we are in the mess we are in with climate change and the fact we are in the 6th mass extinction.  This extinction event is much faster than background rate and is different in the fact that is has been caused by us-humans- and not natural events. Biodiversity loss is just as important as climate change. A U.N. Report states we have 2 years to turn around biodiversity loss or we could face our OWN EXTINCTION.   I don't understand why governments don't seem to get it and fail to take drastic steps. Climate change will accelerate biodiversity loss as some species will not be able to migrate or adapt quick enough. We depend on so many species for our food, fuel and fiber.  So many species are in trouble-bees, butterflies, bats and birds.  I spend a lot of time in nature and I can see the changes here in Ontario. I use to see so much wildlife and now there are numerous times I go into a forest and see and hear nothing.  Silent Spring does not seem so far away it seems.  We need to be strengthening our protection of species, not making things easier for developers. I have heard that developers dictate to farmers what crops they can grow so that they do not get threatened or endangered animals on the properties they wish to develop. It is wrong to weaken this regulation. Instead  use the tools to protect species. It is wrong that the Minister can make the ultimate decision. Decisions should be based on science not friendship or economics.

23853,/comment/23853,"It is good to review the ESA to ensure that it continues to do what is was initially set out to do, i.e. strengthen the protection of each and every species under its jurisdiction, from the Grizzled Moss to the Algonquin Wolf.
Every species count in making Ontario’s biodiversity vibrant and efficient. So does every ecosystem, including the Wolf Lake red-pine stand in Northeastern Ontario. Interactions in the natural world are so complex and intricate that, when species disappear , it will consequently affect the health and resiliency of the whole ecosystems in which they live. And, consequently, ours, as we depend on nature to live. “Living systems keep the air breathable and water drinkable, and provide nutritious food. To continue to perform these vital services they need to retain their complexity, diversity and resilience.” (World Wildlife Fund. Living Planet Report 2016:Risk and resilience in a new era, p. 12.)
Another reason the ESA should be revisited is to correct the 2013 regulatory changes leading to exemptions to the Act – exemptions that allow activities known to impact species at risk and/or their habitats. These exemptions weaken the intent of the ESA; therefore every precaution should be taken before granting them. Lives, even though they may not be human lives, depend on judicious decisions. And these decisions must be made in light of current scientific data as well as, when applicable, on Traditional Ecological Knowledge.
The development of timely strategies for the protection and recovery of species at risk also needs to be re-evaluated. When a species is threatened, time is of essence in helping it to recover and to continue to play its role in the ecosystem – whatever its role may be. And the management plans need to take into account the scientific data relating to the specific species they are designed for.
Finally, the ESA’s role is to speak for those wild lives that do not have a say in decision-making in Ontario but, yet, are affected by it. Please revise the Act in a way that will give a strong voice to the voiceless. They matter, too.

It is clear that businesses quests for profits is the the reason for the decline of so many of our species who are slaughtered, driven from their homes, prevented from reaching breeding grounds or find their native habitat so disrupted that it is no longer usable by them.
The science is clear and our government needs to be well informed with accurate data and not with overriding political decisions.  There needs to be mandatory habitat protection, timelines for reporting, and recovery strategies.
It should not be easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of ""protected"" endangered plant and animals.
If clarity and certainty are being sought - it is clear that our duty is to nature and ensuring the survival of entire species.  The Endangered Species Act is to protect and restore - not to further facilitate the destruction and elimination...
Exemptions should not be allowed to forestry, mining, commercial development or others - not even in the most extreme situations.  Recovery plans need to be completed and carried out in a timely manner and more data/research is needed on species, habitat and restoration strategies.

23857,/comment/23857,"I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Endangered Species Act (ESA) review discussion paper. I am for more stringent protections for species at risk.  However it is my opinion that the proposals being considered will not accomplish that goal.  Conversely, they would make it easier for developers and industry to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.
Any amendments to the ESA must support its purpose of protecting and recovering at-risk species. To that end, I urge the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) to:
- Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries;
- Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
- Maintain COSSARO’s current science-based listing process;
- Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion; and
- Maintain the requirement for proponents of harmful activities to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species impacted with no backdoor option to simply pay into a fund to compensate for harm.

23859,/comment/23859,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposal.
I would like to start this response by providing a bit of background on my involvement with the provisions of the ESA. I am currently an environmental consultant who is employed by an engineering firm. My experiences with the ESA, and its various provisions, authorizations etc. primarily fall into the following sectors:
•	Private development
•	Infrastructure development
•	First nations
•	Research and policy development
I am currently a certified butternut health assessor and have practical experience with a wide range of Endangered and Threatened species currently protected during the ten years the ESA has been in effect, by the provisions of the ESA in Ontario including: Blanding’s Turtle, Butternut, Least Bittern, Henslow’s Sparrow, Hill’s Thistle, Kirtland’s Warbler, Pugnose Shiner, Wood Turtle, American Eel, Lake Sturgeon (Great Lakes – Upper St. Lawrence Population), Redside Dace, Silver Shiner, Bank Swallow, Barn Swallow, Bobolink, Eastern Meadowlark, Eastern Whip-poor-will, Little Brown Myotis, Eastern Small-footed Myotis, Eastern Foxsnake (Georgian Bay population), Eastern Hog-nosed Snake, Gray Ratsnake (Frontenac Axis Population), Tri-colored Bat. In addition to this list of species, I have also been involved in projects which involved species of Special Concern (including species previously listed as endangered or threatened but which have been down listed over time).
I am also certified in several disciplines which involve or overlap the provisions of the ESA in some aspects, such as wetland evaluating, fisheries assessment (MTO/DFO/MNRF protocol) and ecological land classification, and have experience with regards to the overlap with Federal SARA legislation, preparation of policy and management documents. I have engaged with MNRF at the district level (biologist, planners), at the policy level (head office policy) and Conservation officers from an enforcement perspective.
I offer this information to support some specific examples of where I have seen the provisions of the ESA work well, or not so well and to emphasis that while I may be experienced with certain species or taxa (i.e. expert with some species or certain types of projects), I am not an expert on all of Ontario’s Endangered or Threatened species and I hope this information provides better context for the comments, examples and recommendations provided below sections outlined in the 10th year review of Ontario's Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper.
1.	Landscape Approaches;
2.	Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk;
3.	Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations, and
4.	Authorization Processes
The comments provided in the accompanying pdf. document (included in this format due to the wide scope of this ERB posting) are founded on experiences in the past 10 years as it relates to my own personal interaction with the ESA, its regulations and authorizations within the landscape of Ontario. These comments are based on my position as a professional biologist, a naturalist and citizen of Ontario with a vested interest not only in the protection of SAR and their habitat but also in the continued economic development and growth of the Ontario economy in particular as it relates to development, transportation infrastructure, resource management (forestry, aggregates, mining). Given the purpose of the Endangered Species Act, it is my opinion that a moderated approach to revisions, deletions or general changes to the act, the regulations or the permitting and approval process (authorizations and regulatory exemptions) is the most responsible approach to balancing needs of Ontarian's and needs of species considered to be at risk. While the immediate benefit to many species may not be apparent at this time in terms of economic factors, all SAR represent natural resources which should be responsibly managed by government, organizations, corporations and private citizens within our province.

Ontario's current government puts a great deal of emphasis on development; however, the Act already has exemptions and permits for industry. Despite this, the need for permits has been removed entirely for some activities that negatively impact species at risk.
To quote the Canadian Wildlife Federation: ""Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.""
I support a consistent application process, and streamlining of decisions. This must include decisions that delay or  prohibit an activity that would harm a species or its habitat.

23866,/comment/23866,"The Canadian Wildlife Federation is please to take this opportunity to provide comments on the Ontario government’s review of the Endangered Species Act.
Ontario’s Endangered Species Act is a last line of defence against extinction in an era that scientists have termed the sixth mass extinction on the planet.  Canada’s wildlife depends on innovative regulations, policies, and programs that make conservation of species at risk the primary goal. Unfortunately, the ESA to date has not adequately protected species at Risk in Ontario nor led to recovery for a majority of listed species.  We welcome the opportunity to improve the Act and its implementation to improve outcomes for species at risk. We also appreciate the need to do so in a way that is efficient for government, business and the public; however, we are concerned that most of the discussion points presented in this review appear to focus on making the act more efficient for economic development rather than improving outcomes for wildlife and habitat.  Several of the ideas presented would lead to negative outcomes for species at risk.
Stronger and more effective action is the key to protection and recovery of Ontario’s endangered species, not building further holes in the Endangered Species Act. We agree that business requires efficiency, clarity, and certainty, but these must not come at the expense of species that are already on the brink of extinction.  The Act already contains exemptions and permits for industry and the need for permits has been removed entirely for some activities that negatively impact species at risk.
Improved protection and recovery of species at risk must be at the forefront in the implementation of the ESA. The Act in its current form has the ability to balance species protection and economic opportunities through the tools that were built into the initial drafting. CWF does not support changes that could potentially weaken this legislation and has the following recommendations for the Ontario government to consider:
1.	Landscape Approaches
It must be clear that a landscape approach with respect to protecting species at risk means making decisions that maintain or restore the intactness of the entire landscape on which the multiple species depend. Accomplishing this provides benefits for multiple species, creating major efficiencies in the delivery of the ESA.
CWF is in support of a landscape approach, where appropriate, that will maximize efficiencies and target recovery activities in a fulsome manner. The ESA in its current form allows for this.
There are situations where a species-specific approach is warranted for those with specific threats or unique life history needs. In either case, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are taken into account. American Ginseng, for example would continue to decline under a landscape approach to habitat protection because harvesting is a primary threat. Freshwater turtle recovery would benefit from landscape-scale habitat conservation, but threat-based conservation is also essential to alleviate the impact of road mortality.
Multi-species, landscape or threat-based approaches can be incorporated into the ESA implementation process by strategically batching COSSARO assessments by geographic area, or by species threats. Recovery Strategies and Government Response Statements can then be interrelated to address multi-species needs and link recovery actions together, while still considering additional conservation steps required for individual species.
A landscape approach would be particularly warranted in areas of high concentration of species at risk (such as southern Ontario) or for species with large home ranges.
2.	Listing Process and Protections for Species At Risk
The ability of COSSARO to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the ESA. Whether a species is at risk of extinction is a function of the species population, distribution, life history and threats; irrespective of socioeconomic factors.
The discussion paper cites longer timelines between assessment and listing as one example to improve the notification process. We disagree that delays will improve outcomes for either species at risk or the economy.  It is more cost-effective to provide a swift response when species decline, because recovery costs increase as species and their habitat deteriorate.
We do appreciate the need for transparency and sufficient notice.  After COSSARO provides assessment results, these could be promptly publicized to give appropriate notice. This allows planning for conservation actions and understanding the implications from an economic perspective. This can be achieved through better communication on which species are coming up for assessment, when to expect results and the implications of protection.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. It is therefore essential that this is addressed through action to reduce the impact of human activities. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development. The initial drafting of the ESA understood this critical connection and was designed to balance species protection and the economy. Ministerial discretion is appropriate in order to achieve this balance and comes into effect with respect to the publication of the GRS and issuing of permits. Rather than questioning the validity of automatic habitat protection a focus needs to be placed on expedient recovery strategies defining the habitat, comprehensive GRS and efficiencies for authorizations (see the following sections for recommendations).
In situations where habitat is not limiting, habitat protection could be differently prioritized to allow some disturbance. When the reasons for designation provided by COSSARO do not involve habitat, then automatic habitat protection can be less of a priority and defined during the recovery strategy and GRS process. However where habitat is a factor, which is the case for most species, automatic protection of the habitat upon which the species depends must not be delayed.
Considering the area on the ground where business and the public operate and the amount of automatically protected habitat, there is a small fraction of that impacts business and the public. Yet a few examples of uncertainty are causing anxiety over all species at risk habitat protection. Certainty and understanding can be increased by improved and early communication. CWF recommends the development of a public mapping tool that would delineate current, upcoming and anticipated protected habitat.
A landscape approach can help to provide certainty with respect to automatic species and habitat protection. Species at risk are highly concentrated in southern Ontario and associated with the most populated areas. If the species in this landscape are already receiving protection, new additions to the ESA likely fall within these already protected landscapes, minimally increasing protected areas. The protection of habitat within this landscape will conserve species not yet assessed, leading to a decreased likelihood of becoming at risk and removing the need for additional habitat to be protected.
CWF supports the idea of improved public notice and communication with respect to COSSARO’s assessments. The information around the assessment and classification can and should be transparent and provided as soon as they are available.
3.	Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
The difficulty in meeting legislative timelines speaks to a need for adequate resources and priorities placed on recovery of species at risk. The Government Response Statement is a key component in this process, as it sets the stage for actions that will be undertaken. Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty because business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to provide resources to develop and implement a framework for protecting habitat and taking action.  We recommend that the government of Ontario hire sufficient staff to finalize each GRS within the 9-month time period.
Granted there are limited, specific cases where GRS timelines may need to be extended such as the requirement for extended consultations with Indigenous people. Situation-specific exemptions need to be identified and along with conditions under which they could apply.
By the time a species is assessed and listed as at-risk, there is a need to act quickly. Activities should be well underway in time for a five year review of progress on protection and recovery. The recovery process must be a long-term plan.  A review every five years provides an update of actions, their effectiveness and allows for adaptive management.
In some situations, regulated habitat may not be essential, but this must be addressed on a case by case basis. Where habitat is not limiting, general habitat descriptions could suffice. But where habitat is a limiting factor to survival and recovery, a habitat regulation is critical. A consideration for recovery is the desire to return the species to an historic distribution, in which case habitat beyond the current distribution may be required. A habitat regulation can account for this to define areas beyond where the species currently occurs, where a general habitat description does not.
4.	Authorization Process
We are in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. In order to recover species at risk, there must be some situations where decisions favour the species over development.
CWF acknowledges that the authorization process can be time consuming for development activities. The vast majority of such permits are overall benefit permits (aka C-Permits). We are highly supportive of improvements to provide efficiencies for business, as long as these include improved protection and recovery for species at risk. To accomplish this we suggest a review of historic permits combined with expert consultation to devise proven conservation measures that will provide an overall benefit to the species.  If previous permits can show with, scientific confidence, that benefit has been achieved for a given situation, then it can be replicated as conditions for similar situations. This must also include the implementation of additionally such that there actually is an overall benefit, and not merely avoidance of further loss. Ultimately, if a proponent cannot provide solutions that result in an overall benefit to a species, or if the means of providing an overall benefit are too long, onerous, or unpredictable, then requests for authorizations should be declined.
The discussion paper refers to the potential for tools such as contributing to a conservation fund or conservation banking to achieve overall benefit. These tools have potential conservation benefits, but may be of limited applicability for the conservation of species at risk.  Habitat banking may be suitable in providing credits for single species or groups of species, as long as the benefits of the habitat are realized and demonstrated prior to the sale of credits.  Such credits must also be applied in a like-for-like manner (e.g., for projects that harm the same species that the bank benefits).  Contributions to conservation funds are generally inappropriate as compensation for the destruction of habitat. In other situations, such as the fight against white-nose syndrome in bats, financial contributions towards actions that address the primary threat may be suitable. This must be determined case by case.
CWF can attest that applying for and receiving scientific permits (aka b permits) is straightforward and not burdensome, as we have done this several times. B permits are signed off at the district level, removing time and resource constraints of ministerial sign off.
The Ontario government must bear in mind that allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk.   Comprehensive requirements to avoid, reduce and mitigate this risk must be upheld. Implications of failure could be irreversible harm to the species, habitat and their potential extirpation from Ontario altogether.
CWF is receptive to innovative approaches to integrate the ESA with other legislative frameworks such as the Crown Forests Sustainability Act. It must bear in mind that managing for forestry is much different than managing for species at risk. A permit to cause harm to a species at risk must meet a much higher test than one for forest harvest, since there is a very large inherent risk with endangered species. Synchronizing actions and timelines with between legislative frameworks is supported as long as the requirements for each individual piece of legislation is respected.
Beyond the scope of the Discussion Paper:
There are several areas for improved protection of species at risk beyond the challenges presented in the discussion paper. CWF recommends:
1.	Removal of exemptions that were instated in 2013 for forestry, hydro power, infrastructure and mining activities.  There is little evidence that self-regulation with minimal oversight has led to the recovery of affected species at risk.  The evidence that we have reviewed indicates that this has contributed directly to further declines in affected species.
2.	Promptly finalizing the Government Response Statements and Recovery Strategies that are currently overdue
3.	Improving alignment with the Federal Species at Risk Act in line with the Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk, including
a.	Implementing the ESA in a manner that would meet the test of SARA
b.	Support for federal Action Plans
c.	Development of Boreal Caribou Range plans
d.	Promote and provide for stewardship activities
e.	Ensure lack of full scientific certainty is not used as a reason to delay measures to avoid or minimize threats to species at risk.
4.	Improved, consistent monitoring and enforcement of permit conditions and infractions of the ESA
5.	Provide considerably increased support for stewardship activities and recovery actions, including to private landowners to protect and recover species at risk
Our economy will benefit by clear regulations, swift responses and improved communications, not by delays and exemptions in the backstop against extinction. The ESA in its current form allows for these challenges to be addressed. CWF would welcome the opportunity to further discuss a balanced approach to protection for species at risk. As a national conservation organization with a vested interest in species at risk, there are areas within the discussion paper we could endorse provided advancement is made for increased protection and recovery of species at risk in Ontario; and there are other aspects of the ESA review we strongly advise the MOECP to cast aside.

23867,/comment/23867,"I am dismayed that it seems necessary to remind you, the government, of the original purpose of the ESA:
1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.
2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.
3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.
The discussion paper’s tone and wording, especially of the discussion questions, seems more like a thinly veiled way to guide the readers to think how best to help developers.
-	For example, such as when the discussion paper states “There is not enough public notice before a new species is automatically listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List.” Not enough notice? According to who? Wouldn’t being swiftly listed be a BENEFIT to a species, especially one that is dwindling, rather than slowing the process?
-	As another example, when the discussion paper states “In some cases, the time limit of nine months to develop the Government Response Statement for an endangered or threatened species is too short, and there is no option under the Act to extend this timeline when needed”. Too short - really? According to who, exactly? If you (government) had the political will to put more staff on the GRS work, the GRS’s would get done on time. I say ‘political will’ rather than ‘funding’, because you’ve got the money, you just don’t want to spend it on species at risk. I’ve seen multiple events and areas and initiatives where the government wasted massive amounts of money; one need only check the ‘Teddy Awards’ at taxpayer.com for even a handful of examples.
-	As another example, when the discussion paper states “The requirements that applicants must fulfill to obtain an authorization can be extensive, creating barriers to economic development (e.g., in some cases achieving an overall benefit to a species as required under a s. 17(2)(c) permit can be long, onerous, and unpredictable).” Well, this is less a thinly veiled intent than it is an open admission that businesses and developers see the preservation of biodiversity as a hindrance to their profits. However, Government, it is also your job to account for the Tragedy of the Commons. Our biodiversity is not a buzzword; we literally, factually, scientifically rely on a healthy system, a strongly bio-diverse system to provide us with nutrient-rich topsoil, free crop pollination, swimmable water, as well as beautiful spaces. In China, right now, there are areas where a lack of industry oversight and a lack of effective protective environmental legislation has completely removed the natural pollinators from the landscape such that they are now having to pollinate their crops by hand with little paintbrushes. The China press releases lie and say ‘it’s actually cheaper this way’, but they seem to think we don’t realize that nothing is cheaper than free. Let’s not go down the road they’ve gone, it leads to things literally disappearing off this planet, permanently. Extinction is the result of local extirpations carried out repeatedly across a landscape.  Giving people license to go ahead and tear down/pave over an area here, and there, and elsewhere, without paying due attention to ways to avoid or mitigate damage, does just that.
-	There are multiple natural places I used to visit when I was a teenager, and I remember seeing numerous species in droves in those places – Bobolink, Barn Swallow, Eastern Meadowlark, Chimney Swifts, Wood Thrush, Monarch Butterflies…when I visit those places now, those species are no longer there, (they're all listed species at risk now), and I’m not even 40 yet.  The woodlots and forests and ponds near where I grew up no longer have Butternut, and now all the ash is gone too. That frightens me, and I’m deeply concerned that the people in charge of driving this boat don’t actually care about where it’s going…
Regarding “Should there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections? (e.g., longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat”
-	DON’T YOU DARE. I’m disgusted that this idea was even uttered. Ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove, or delay protections? Are you hearing yourself? Say those words out loud and realize that there is really NO difference between a dictator and someone who is given complete discretion to override science to serve their own or industry’s interests. Political sway varies too much to leave that much power in one person’s hands. I am at a minimum deeply disturbed that the government would even entertain the notion of introducing ministerial discretion into decisions regarding habitat protection. Tell me Government, how would that NOT weaken the science-based listing process? At a minimum, it would allow politically motivated decisions to override evidence in favour of ideology. We are supposed to be a democracy.
If it wasn’t for the Environmental Commissioner saying the Liberals were ‘undermining the survival’ of species at risk, I’d think the Ontario government wasn’t interested in sustainable development.
Oh wait, the government dismissed the Environmental Commissioner…and didn’t replace him…I guess an unpopular statement, despite ample evidence supporting it, is an incorrect one worthy of dismissal?
Are you, the Ontario government, at all interested or invested in genuinely pursuing truly sustainable development? As someone who was employed by various “‘environmental’ consulting companies’” to ‘examine areas for environmental constraints’, I can assure you that leaving it up to developers to make the decisions that will affect the success of conservation efforts is NOT the way to go. I was paid to, and repeatedly explicitly instructed by multiple supervisors in various companies, to merely exploit the loopholes in protective environmental legislation and policy, rather than ensure either the spirit of it, or even the letter of it, is implemented.
I urge the Ontario government to recognize the self-evident logic of working within ecological limits, rather than pretending or hoping those limits do not exist. Pretending is lying to everyone, including yourself; and the hope that things will work out is not a plan to ensure it does. Which side of history do you want to be on – the side that bowed to political pressure, or the side that used defensible and credible scientific evidence to guide and support their decisions?
Even though I’m not a member of the Green Party, I support the recommendations as stated by its leader Mark Schreiner:
-Remove the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, aggregates, and mining industries that allow them to harm species at risk and destroy their habitat;
-Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of endangered and threatened species;
-Restore an ‘overall benefit’ approach to species protection consistent with the 2007 Act before the Liberal government replaced this with a ‘minimize harm’ approach;
-Maintain the independent and expert-based system for listing species by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO);
-Increase user fees to achieve full cost recovery for implementation of the Endangered Species Act;
-Maintain mandatory habitat protection with no ministerial discretion and ensure that protection and recovery approaches are driven by science, not political interests;
-Close the door to options that would allow businesses to simply offset their harm to biodiversity by paying into a conservation fund or other actions unrelated to their activities.
I’ve personally seen too many activities where existing legislation was muzzled and not enforced. The strength of that legislation’s effectiveness relies heavily on everyone pulling their weight; if industry wants to let go of what they’re pulling so they can make more money, I understand the need to support economic development, but unchecked growth is the definition of a cancer.  Don’t remove the checks and balances. Please, Minister, I urge you to strengthen the ESA, not weaken it, and to place more effort on actually enforcing the ESA’s tools rather than making them a box for developers to check.

First, I would like to introduce ourselves thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143.  We are a logging company based out of Northwestern Ontario, known as St Onge Logging. We currently employ 53 men and woman, and have about a dozen haul brokers haul alongside us throughout the year. We look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.
The most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA); either through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.
Once this essential first step has been accomplished, we must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:
1.	Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy
2.	Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy
3.	Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented
It is our understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. It is our expectation that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.
Further, we remain extremely concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with us well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity.
In order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.
We would be happy to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the best path forward to ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk while keeping people in this province working.
Sincerely,
Joel St Onge & Elizabeth Bernier, St Onge Logging

23869,/comment/23869,"1. Landscape Approaches
I support recovering species by looking at the entire landscape and taking actions that will contribute the most to improving habitat and protecting species from harm; however, care must be taken to ensure the individual needs of each species are still taken into account. There are situations where a species-specific approach is warranted.
2. Species Listing Process and Protections
The ability of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to determine the status of species, independent of government, is essential to the proper functioning of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Improved communication and transparency in all aspects of species assessment and protection is warranted to provide clarity for the public and business.
Habitat loss or degradation is a primary cause for species decline. Automatic protection, combined with clear communication on where impacts can and cannot occur, would protect species while providing certainty of what to expect for economic development.
3. Species Recovery Policy and Habitat Regulations
Delays and inaction are detrimental to species while at the same time providing little economic certainty since business is uninformed of the parameters under which they must operate.  What is needed for species and economic development is for government to focus resources on quickly providing the framework for protecting habitat and taking action.
4. Permitting Processes
I am in favour of consistent application and streamlining of decisions, which must also include decisions to deny a permit for an activity that would harm a species or its habitat. Permits allowing harm to endangered species or their habitat poses considerable risk so need to come with strict conditions. Extinction is permanent.

What we need is greater protection of endangered and threatened species, not less. We need to make every effort to ensure their recovery, by focusing on habitat protection, minimizing the effect of industry on our lands and waters, and repealing the numerous exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development that were introduced in 2013. We will not get a second chance once these species are gone. The time to save them is now.

23871,/comment/23871,"Four key take-home points
1. *Based on my experience with many SAR across many areas of Ontario, it is clear that the ESA does NOT currently provide adequate protection for the habitat of these species. Key habitats for SAR get developed with only a token effort at a meaningful “overall benefit.” If the ESA is going to be changed, then habitat protection for threatened and endangered species should be strengthened, not weakened.*
2. *The overall benefit process could be so much better, precedent setting. Imagine an overall benefit process involving expert provincial biologists travelling around the province (paid for by the proponents pf development, as part of the permitting process) to conduct site visits, assess the reality of ""overall benefit"", write site-by-site recommendations, oversee some of the development, conduct follow-up benefit monitoring, enforce adherence to the overall benefit. This is a rigourous permitting procedure!*
3. *I strongly oppose changes to obtaining a D permit, or Significant Social or Economic Benefit Permit. D permits were never intended to be a common tool to allow development to over-ride SAR. D permits should only be considered in rare cases where there is overwhelming social benefit. They should not be granted for draining a wetland to build a parking lot for a strip mall. Even in the cases when a D permit is granted, the mitigation efforts expended on SAR should also be significant, such as the example of the Herb Gray Parkway in Windsor which has created habitat for SAR and improved connectivity of habitat patches. Obtaining a D permit should NOT become a rubber-stamp process under any circumstances.*
4. *Protection for SAR also requires stable, long-term funding. We strongly encourage the government to continue to fund the Species at Risk Stewardship Fund, and the Species at Risk Research Fund. Both of these funding programs leveraged a significant amount of funding from the private sector, providing valuable extra funding for protecting SAR informed through scientific research, and making the investment from the provincial government very cost effective. Cutting these funding programs would greatly harm the recovery of SAR in Ontario.*

Dear Minister Phillips,
Cc: Environmental Registry of Ontario
Re: EBR 013-4143: 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the discussion paper about the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The following comments represent my views.
Many species are declining across the world and in Canada; species in Ontario are not immune to these declines. There are now more than 200 species at risk (SAR) in Ontario. The main purpose of the ESA is to protect species, NOT to expedite development. Any changes to the ESA should be made with great care, as without diligent conservation of our SAR there is a significant risk of further loss of populations and their key habitats. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extirpated from Ontario. Multiple SAR, such as the Eastern Fox Snake and Wood Turtle, have a large proportion or most of their global geographic range in Ontario. Therefore Ontario has the disproportionate responsibility for the conservation of these species and their habitats.
Area of Focus 1 – Landscape Approaches
	Recovery activities focusing on specific landscapes or ecosystems can be beneficial for many species. Activities, for example, which aim to reduce forest fragmentation, and increase forest connectivity and the amount of core forest area in the Carolinian Zone would benefit many species. At the same time, many recovery activities must be focused on individual species given the threats facing certain species (e.g. Butternut canker). There should be a mix of ecosystem and species-specific recovery actions. At the same time, an ecosystem focus on SAR recovery should NOT be used as a justification to “support a proposed activity” (p.3). Too often development proposals argue that a species is widespread in an area and therefore the loss of one habitat patch will be inconsequential to the species’ long term survival. This kind of thinking is ecologically unsound and furthers the notion that populations can persist in small isolated patches of habitat, when really long term survival requires many connected populations across a landscape. Changes to the ESA should NOT make it easier to destroy habitat for SAR. Development proposals should be reviewed on a site specific basis. Determining what is an appropriate overall benefit should be based on the magnitude of the effect of each project.
Area of Focus 2 – Listing Process
Currently the COSSARO review process is slow. Timelines before new listings of a SAR should not be made longer. If the government wishes to provide more advanced notice about potential additions to the list of SAR, then the species to be reviewed by COSSARO should be made public as early as possible. This would let the public know which species may be listed after the review process.
I disagree with any change to the automatic listing of SAR after review by COSSARO. The decision regarding whether a species is at risk is NOT a political decision. It is a science-based decision and this should NOT change. Removing the automatic listing of new species at risk would undermine the ESA and weaken the protection for declining species. Similarly, there should be NO change to the automatic protection of habitat for newly-listed Threatened and Endangered species. Without habitat protection, there can be no true protection for SAR.
I do NOT believe that the COSSARO review and assessment process should be changed in such a way that would further delay species evaluations, listings, and protective action.
Area of Focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies
Modest delays in the production of Government Response Statements (GRS) are not a significant cause for concern. This, however, is not the central issue, given that the government of Ontario has frequently been late in preparing Recovery Strategies or GRS documents. According to a recent analysis, fewer than half of the GRS documents for birds and mammals, and fewer than 60% of the GRS documents for plants, have been prepared on time (Ontario Nature 2019). A GRS is not prepared until a Recovery Strategy has been published, and many species still lack a Recovery Strategy several years after listing. The ESA specifies that a Recovery Strategy should be produced within 1 year of listing for Endangered species and 2 years for Threatened species. The Spotted Turtle was already assessed when the current ESA took effect in 2008 and yet there is still no provincial Recovery Strategy for this species, more than 10 years later. Such inaction is entirely unacceptable. Rather than trying to delay the release of GRS documents, the government should commit to publishing Recovery Strategies and other recovery documents in a timely manner.
Conducting a 5-year assessment of progress on recovery of SAR is a vital part of the recovery process and should not be changed. Recovery for many, and perhaps most, species will take decades, but that does not mean that a 5 year review is not worthwhile. Each 5 year review provides valuable information on the status of recovery. Without the 5 year review, it would not be apparent if species are continuing to decline despite recovery actions, and given development pressures across much of southern Ontario, a 5 year review provides ongoing “snapshots” of the current status of each species.
Habitat regulation may not be required for all Threatened and Endangered species, but this should be addressed on a case by case basis. General habitat descriptions are adequate for identifying the core areas used by SAR but only regulated habitat “may include areas currently unoccupied by the species, such as areas where the species formerly occurred or areas where there is the potential for the species to become re-established” (Government of Ontario 2012). Hence, at a minimum, regulated habitat is required for those species that need to expand their current range to become down-listed. Habitat regulation should also be mandated for those species with limited current distributions in the province to ensure that the current habitat, and adjacent potential habitat, is protected. Species with few populations left in Ontario are the most vulnerable to any future habitat loss or the negative effects of development pressure. We also recommend that habitat regulation be mandated for all species found in the Carolinian Zone given the lack of natural habitat left in this area.
**Area of Focus 4 – Authorization Processes**
A variety of permits currently exist under the ESA. The most common permit is the C permit, or Overall Benefit Permit (C permit), and obtaining one can be a time consuming process. We encourage the government to develop standard overall benefit actions to compensate for specific actions for particular SAR. These compensatory actions should provide tangible benefits to the species in question and clearly provide an overall benefit to the species on the ground, not just funding for research. Furthermore, it is not enough to simply stipulate compensatory actions in a permit and leave this responsibility in the hands of the proponent. Rather, a monitoring regulatory framework is necessary to ensure that the permit stipulations (i.e., an “overall benefit”) are undertaken in completeness. It is necessary that the governing agency (Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks) follow-up with he proponent to ensure that satisfactory “benefit” has been achieved, as outlined in the proponent’s permit. For long-lived species, such as trees and turtles, monitoring commitment by the proponent needs to truly reflect long-term assessment. Finally, it is encouraged that monitoring/overall benefit reports be made publically available (an exception being for location-sensitive species/populations) so that evaluations of “benefit” can be tracked and critically evaluated. To date, there has been no transparency about how overall benefits are being undertaken or have been achieved despite a sizable number of Overall Benefit Permits being granted across Ontario. Naturally, this had led many to questions the effectiveness of laxly-regulated Overall Benefit Permits.
*The overall benefit process could be so much better, precedent setting. Imagine an overall benefit process involving expert provincial biologists travelling around the province (paid for by the proponents pf development, as part of the permitting process) to conduct site visits, assess the reality of ""overall benefit"", write site-by-site recommendations, oversee some of the development, conduct follow-up benefit monitoring, enforce adherence to the overall benefit. This is a rigourous permitting procedure!*
I strongly oppose changes to obtaining a D permit, or Significant Social or Economic Benefit Permit. D permits were never intended to be a common tool to allow development to over-ride SAR. D permits should only be considered in rare cases where there is overwhelming social benefit. They should not be granted for draining a wetland to build a parking lot for a strip mall. Even in the cases when a D permit is granted, the mitigation efforts expended on SAR should also be significant, such as the example of the Herb Gray Parkway in Windsor which has created habitat for SAR and improved connectivity of habitat patches. Obtaining a D permit should NOT become a rubber-stamp process under any circumstances.
Forestry under Ontario’s Crown Forest Sustainability Act should NOT be exempt from the ESA. The ESA should be fully enforced on Crown Land with regards to any destructive or commercial activity. Crown Land should protect habitat for species while also permitting public access to these natural areas.
Other changes to the ESA should also be made to truly strengthen the protection  of SAR in Ontario:
1)	It is time to repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and development industries. These exemptions allow the widespread destruction of SAR habitat.
2)	Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and recovery of Endangered and Threatened species.
3) 	Proper enforcement of the ESA must also occur. Too often there is no government monitoring of development projects, which can lead to violations of ESA permit conditions, and especially a lack of follow-through on required overall benefit activities. Even when charges are laid under the ESA, the penalties have often been lax. Fines simply become the price for doing business, rather than a deterrent.
*Based on my experience with many SAR across many areas of Ontario, it is clear that the ESA does NOT currently provide adequate protection for the habitat of these species. Key habitats for SAR get developed with only a token effort at a meaningful “overall benefit.” If the ESA is going to be changed, then habitat protection for threatened and endangered species should be strengthened, not weakened.*
*Protection for SAR also requires stable, long-term funding. We strongly encourage the government to continue to fund the Species at Risk Stewardship Fund, and the Species at Risk Research Fund. Both of these funding programs leveraged a significant amount of funding from the private sector, providing valuable extra funding for protecting SAR informed through scientific research, and making the investment from the provincial government very cost effective. Cutting these funding programs would greatly harm the recovery of SAR.*
In summary, I strongly support the current ESA. It is a powerful piece of legislation that can protect Ontario’s rarest species, and the province should be proud of this gold standard of SAR protection. I strongly disagree with any proposed changes to the ESA that would: 1) weaken protection for SAR and their habitat, 2) delay the production of Recovery Strategies or Government Response Statements, and/or 3) reduce the obligation of developers to genuinely provide an overall benefit to SAR in their permits. We implore the government to continue to uphold the core values of the ESA and ensure the continued protection of Ontario’s many SAR that play vital roles in  the province’s ecosystems.

23873,/comment/23873,"Firstly I would like to point out that protecting endangered and at-risk species benefits all Ontarians.  By protecting habitats we help protect the air, water and natural spaces for ourselves too.
In the 4 years that I have been surveying birds for the Eastern Loggerhead Shrike Recovery programme, I have noticed a marked reduction in the number of Bobolink, another species at risk, in my survey zone.  I can’t determine the cause but I do know that if the farmland that they return to each year is developed they will never have a chance to recover.   It is in our interest to restrict development of farmland to ensure a food source for ourselves as well as preserving habitat for species like the Shrike and Bobolink.
I understand that there has to be a balance between the needs of all inhabitants of the land (plants, animals and people) and that this balance is a difficult to find.  The existing legislation is already a compromise which tips the balance towards people.   I would ask that the government not ‘water down’ this legislation.  There are always other business opportunities but once a habitat or species is gone it is gone for good.
Thank you for your time.

23874,/comment/23874,"We need to create a review that puts endangered species first.    Since 2013, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has watered down the ESA.    The Crown Forestry Sustainability Act does not go far enough to protect species.  We should not be discussing how we can erode the ESA for the benefit of business.  As Diane Saxe, the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario stated in  her 2017 report  the MNRF is using the approvals framework  to ""sacrifice the protection of species at risk for the convenience of industry.    We must no longer put the needs of business ahead of the needs of the planet.  Because of policies like this, we are now on the brink of extinction ourselves.    We must not erode the ESA and try to make up for it by setting aside some money and a bit of land as a ""conservation"" area.  The questions this discussion paper entertains are a blatant threat to wildlife in Ontario.  These questions propose a horrific vision of mismanagement and neglect for the precious wildlife in this province.  This is not how we should be preserving  the environment for our children.

23877,/comment/23877,"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper. I am submitting this feedback in my professional capacity at the Rebanks Family Chair in Pollinator Conservation at the University of Guelph, with over 20 years of experience researching the behaviour, ecology and conservation of bees and other pollinators around the world.
Loss of biodiversity, and the key ecosystem services associated with biodiversity, is a key issue that we face as a global society. Species at risk (SAR) represent a small fraction of the total number of species that we initially recognized, named and then had sufficient long-term data to be able to determine they have undergone sufficiently serious declines to be listed as a conservation concern. As such, protecting SAR is a key responsibility we have as stewards of our landscapes.
Having read this discussion paper, I was pleased to see some rhetoric echoing my sentiments above (for example, “The government is committed to ensuring that the Endangered Species Act provides stringent protections for species at risk, continuing to work with stakeholders and Indigenous peoples to improve its effectiveness, …”). However, other ideas and language expressed in the discussion paper seem to open the way to increase the time taken for a species to be included on the Species at Risk in Ontario List, to move away from species-specific recovery strategies (to more generic landscape approaches), and to move towards ways in which developments could be granted that render harm to SAR provided mitigations are in place in another location. These appear to be ways to erode protections that currently exist for SAR under the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA). As a society, we should not be looking at ways to reduce the effectiveness of the ESA, rather looking at ways to use it to better protect those SAR already protected by it, and to further accelerate the slow and cumbersome process of getting conservation priority species assessed and listed (through the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) and the Species at Risk Program Advisory Committee (SARPAC)).
Areas of focus 1 – Landscape Approaches
Landscape approaches to “support a proposed activity while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk” should not be necessarily considered as an adequate replacement for species-specific assessments. The current ESA contains the tools to deploy a strategic broad-scale (landscape) approach, and these could be considered for the benefit of multiple SARs that in the same places and are subject to the same environmental threats. In reality there the degree of ecological niche overlap between the 243 SARs listed in Ontario is low, and specific ecological needs of each SAR need to be fully understood to develop effective species-specific recovery plans for each. In reality this is expensive, and should receive additional funding to allow quicker development of the recovery plans for the 103 SARs for which none currently exist.
Areas of focus 2 – Listing Process and Protections for Species at Risk
The timelines for public notice before a new species is listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List should not be increased. Communications and outreach to relevant stakeholders, Indigenous communities and organizations, and knowledge holders could, and should, be improved.
There should not be a “different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections”. It is concerning to see here that the document is proposing allowing “ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat”. If such discretions were exercised this would effectively make the SAR designation functionally useless.
The process regarding assessment and classification of a species by the COSSARO can be improved by making the selection criteria and membership of the committees more transparent and to provide greater secretariat support to allow technical experts in the committee to undertake the actual conservation assessment as rigorously as possible based on the evidence base. This would, if anything, speed up the current slow pace of assessments in this process.
Areas of focus 3 – Species Recovery Policies and Habitat Regulations
No changes should be made to the legislated timeline to develop any Government Response Statements (GRSs). The focus should instead be to improve coordination between these documents and the recovery strategies to enhance protection for SARs. Similarly, no changes should be made to the legislated timeline for conducting a review of progress towards the protection and recovery of species.
Evaluate the efficacy of general habitat protections to species recovery, and reconsider the use of the habitat regulation in circumstances where more stringent habitat protection is required, in keeping with lessons learned from critical habitat protection in the US.
Areas of focus 4 – Authorization Processes
The proposal to allow payments into a conservation fund dedicated to species at risk conservation, or allow conservation banking “in lieu of activity-based requirements” strikes me as deeply concerning. This seems to be an offset payment scheme to simply ignore the potential harm that proposed development or activity could do to SAR without considering the ramifications. This should not be considered as an alternative to impact assessment of proposed developments/ activities during the planning phase prior to permissions being granted.
Where conditional development authorizations are granted it is vital that extensive, long-term monitoring is implemented to determine the trajectory of SAR populations at that site, and more widely, to determine the extent to which authorizations are working, and where and when they need to be modified to enhance protection goals.
Implement authorizations in the context of comprehensive habitat protection regimes for each species (or groups of species), rather than in the current isolated approach.
Final overall comments:
Proposals to modify the ESA outlined in this paper here as discussion questions should not be adopted. The focus of this review should be to improve the way in which the ESA is implemented to protect and support SARs, where possible through greater integration of recovery strategies for different SARs (that could bring potential cost savings) and enhanced communications with diverse stakeholder groups.

Unfortunately, with species at risk, often emotions take over common sense and in some cases, overrules science.  There is ample evidence now that the Algonquin wolf is really a hybrid between wolves and coyotes and yet, it was listed for protection.  The concerning piece is that even in the face of DNA evidence, there are groups that continue to push to protect a ""species"" that does not truly exist.  The same happened during the ban on the spring bear hunt.  Whatever process is implemented, it should not permit interest groups from within or outside of MNRF to overrule/ignore science.

More transparency and more notice before automatic listing of additional species is a worthwhile goal but not it ""transparency"" ends up preventing decision for several years that should be taken soon because they reflect a solid evidentiary basis and a consensus or at least a strong majority of the qualified scientific community.

I am certain that you are well aware that, by its very nature Endangered Species legislation is intended to protect the living members of species at risk and to improve and increase their habitats. The legislation is required in order to place the needs of at risk species above the needs and / or desires of human endeavours. The existence of Endangered Species Legislation is recognition that species at risk are more important than human social or financial development. Consequently, the only changes to Endangered Species legislation that are justifiable are changes that place more restrictions on human made pressures on nature.

I am extremely worried about allowing the Minister to consider alternatives to prescribed automatic species and habitat protections. Any compromise or alternative ""solution"" will logically mean less than ideal protection for the species at risk.  If we are having an act to protect our biome, we need to rigorously protect all of nature which can't vote and lobby the Minister.
Worst of all is the notion that developers and polluters can somehow ""mitigate"" their destructive activities by paying into a conservation fund.  The underlying belief seems to be that profits (framed more benignly as ""economic development"") are more important than the longterm survival of the natural world.

Re: Comment on MECP Discussion Paper about the E.S.A. review (ERO# 013-4143)
Dear Sir/Madam,
Thank you for providing opportunity to comment on the Ontario Government Endangered Species Act (E.S.A.) Review. It is my view that a review of the E.S.A. in Ontario is needed. However, it needs to be reviewed in the interest of strengthening natural habitat conservation at the local site level, and the regional level to ensure wildlife species conservation in Ontario. It is not a time to weaken and introduce discursive and idiosyncratic alternatives to development interests, to avoid their corporate and individual responsibilities to the goals of all Ontarians, in ensuring Ontario has a strong Endangered Species Act, and that it is strongly and consistently enforced everywhere in the Province.
In Ontario today we are at a critical time for endangered species. Some of Ontario’s most valued  animals are at risk of endangerment and even extinction. Woodland caribou, Polar bears, many songbirds including grassland meadow species, and turtle, amphibian and related species are in decline in this province, now! This is not breaking news to hardworking Ontario Government wildlife staff employees I am sure. Even iconic and familiar Ontario species like Moose and Gray wolf among others are in decline and the reasons for this are not well understood, so even more reason to act now to tighten our Endangered Species Act legislation for those that are at risk, not relax or undermine it!
The consultation Discussion Paper which I have reviewed reads more like a Business Plan about how to get around enforcing the existing Ontario Endangered Species Act than seriously facing and implementing this important Act that “… sets requirements that must be met for each species that is listed as endangered or threatened“ stated at the beginning of the Discussion Paper.
It is well-known that the list of endangered species is growing, especially in the southern part of the province, south of the Canadian shield (which has been going on for decades). This, at a time with our greatest threat to landuse change in history, Climate Change, that has undeniably been documented by the world, and Ontario scientific community.
In South Lake Simcoe, members of our conservation community are very concerned by these changes. Clearly, this review is going the wrong way to seriously improve Ontario Government actions in the interest of strengthening natural habitat resilience and conservation at the local site level, the regional and provincial scale level to ensure at-risk wildlife species conservation in Ontario.
Below I have highlighted some obvious short-comings of the Discussion Paper and elaborated on the real research, scientific, planning and policy work needed in this review. It has been my experience and knowledge that these same shortcomings have also been pointed out by many others in this short review period, including Ontario Nature of which SLSN is a fully federated member.
The biggest problem with the Endangered Species Act is that it has never been properly enforced. Successive governments ignored deadlines, made minimal efforts and watered down its provisions. This has to stop NOW!
Most concerning is that the proposed options may weaken requirements for authorizations to undertake harmful activities. Industry and developers can proceed with harmful activities (e.g., killing members of threatened or endangered species, damaging or destroying their habitat) only if they have a permit or exemption. It is clear the proposed options are looking for ways to make these authorizations less onerous so that they don’t stand in the way of economic development.
The “conservation fund” in the proposed options may replace on-the-ground reparation for permitted harmful activities. Paying into a “conservation fund” may be the new easy-way-out for proponents of harmful activities. This option would make it easier and more likely for harmful activities to occur and will do nothing to protect at-risk species and habitats.
The overall direction of the E.S.A. review is environmental deregulation. The consultation document claims that it wants to improve protections for species at risk, the options for change proposed for consideration clearly make it easier for industry and development proponents to damage or destroy the habitats of species that get in the way of so called “business”.
It seems to me the options under consideration would undermine the very cornerstones of the existing Act law. The proposals of alternatives to the fundamental “gold standard” requirements of the E.S.A.: science-based listing of species at risk (including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge), mandatory protection of threatened and endangered species and their habitats, and legislated timelines for planning and reporting, are not helpful or needed.
It would seem the science-based process for listing species at risk is in jeopardy with these proposals. Though the E.S.A. already allows the Minister to request a review of a listing decision on the basis of “credible scientific information,” the proposed options provide even more freedom to meddle on the basis of “conflicting information.” This is clearly the wrong way to go!
It seems from review of this consultation Discussion Paper there may be broad authorizations for harmful activities allowed. Landscape-scale authorizations for harmful activities may replace project-specific authorizations. This sweeping approach with the proposed options doesn’t lend itself to addressing site-specific or species-specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.
Poor implementation of the E.S.A. is the problem, and everyone is very aware of this, not the law itself. According to the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario’s 2017 report, the government “has utterly failed to implement the law effectively.” Challenges should be addressed through improved planning and investment in communications, program development and staffing, not environmental deregulation. Then “Business” interests would be clearly aware of problematic site locations of development in endangered species locations and their habitats and be able to make their present and future business decisions, reflect that reality, to support the conservation of Ontario’s Endangered Species.
Many of the more innovative aspects of the E.S.A. have never been fully implemented. These include stewardship agreements and ecosystem or multispecies approaches to recovery planning. Putting these tools into practice offers much more promise for species at risk than streamlining approaches to damaging and destroying their habitats.
Protecting species at risk and their habitats may be left up to the Minister. The proposed options suggest consideration of alternatives to automatic species and habitat protections, including removing or delaying these protections at the discretion of the Minister. Such changes would leave our most vulnerable plants and animals subject to political whims and the influence of powerful industrial lobbyists.
Ontarians have a global responsibility to conserve biodiversity. It is well-known that the list of endangered species is growing, especially in the southern part of the province, south of the Canadian shield as is obvious to all citizens of the province. This, all at a time with Climate Change being a driver of future wildlife change that needs immediate research and policy attention now. The proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act in this process will no do what is needed.
Planning research by experts, and our own knowledge of local area and municipalities confirm that there is an excess of economic “Business” development land in Towns and in Cities Secondary Plan areas across the Greater Golden Horseshoe and Southern and Central Ontario, that have been identified for that use, and that are not affected by the Endangered Species Act. There is no need for these proposed options for change to the E.S.A., the appropriate lands are already identified as we have previously advised, in existing approved municipal Official and Secondary Plans. Open for business in Ontario is not being constrained by the E.S.A.
Clearly this review is going the wrong way to seriously improve Ontario Government actions in the interest of strengthening natural habitat conservation at the local site level, the regional and provincial scale level to ensure wildlife species conservation in Ontario. Finally, under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, we all have a deep responsibility to maintain and restore the web of life on our planet earth. We start here at home in Ontario!

23893,/comment/23893,"Although I'm in favour of improving protection for species at risk it seems like this proposal is completely inadequate for doing so. Below I list 11 of the biggest problems with the proposal as written:
1. The overall direction of the ESA review is environmental deregulation.
The options under consideration appear to make it easier for industry and development proponents to damage or destroy the habitats of species that get in the way of business.
2. The options under consideration would undermine the very cornerstones of the law.
The “gold standard” requirements of the ESA - science-based listing of species at risk (including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge), mandatory protection of threatened and endangered species and their habitats, and legislated timelines for planning and reporting - are not something that should be altered because of their evidence-based nature.
3. The science-based process for listing species at risk is working so don[t try to ""fix"" it.
Though the ESA already allows the Minister to request a review of a listing decision on the basis of “credible scientific information,”  you seem to be expanding on the basis of “conflicting information”
4. Protecting species at risk and their habitats should not be left up to the Minister.
Considering alternatives to automatic species and habitat protections, including removing or delaying these protections at the discretion of the Minister, would leave  our most vulnerable plants and animals subject to political whims and the influence of powerful industrial lobbyists. This is definitely not the actions of a ""government for the people"".
5. You shouldn't weaken requirements for authorizations to undertake harmful activities.
Currently, industry and developers can proceed with harmful activities (e.g., killing members of threatened or endangered species, damaging or destroying their habitat) only if they have a permit or exemption. These authorizations should not be made less onerous so that they don’t stand in the way of economic development.

We are now in the throes of the largest mass extinction since the disappearance of the dinosaurs more than 65 million years ago. We must do our utmost to honour our collective responsibility, under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, to maintain and restore the web of life.
11. The environment is a wholly owned subsidiary of the economy and this has to be recognized - without a healthy environment so many aspects of the economy will ultimately suffer!

23894,/comment/23894,"I am writing to comment on the Species at Risk 10 year review and wish to make clear my interest in maintaining a stringent system for environmental review and habitat protection for endangered species.  Evaluation and authorization for activities near natural areas should be rigorous, it should be conducted thoroughly and it should take time.  Natural areas that provide habitat for species at risk (in addition to the myriad of other species) are far too valuable to risk the potentially harmful consequences of fast-tracking development proposals without complete scientific review.
I do not support delaying protections or extending the timelines before a species is listed.
I am interested in further exploring what a landscape approach would look like.  I believe it is important to have a natural heritage plan with goals for protecting critical habitat and for enhancing connectivity between natural areas.
I do not wish to see activity based requirements deferred or delayed or ignored through payments-in-lieu to a conservation fund.
Penalties for violations of the Act should be harsh enough to be significant deterrent.
The value of healthy eco-systems with species diversity should not be underestimated.

23895,/comment/23895,"It is 2019 and it has never been so clear at any other point throughout history that humans are failing the planet and the multitude varieties of life that call our Earth home. Unless it is abundantly clear that the sole purpose of this review is to strengthen legislation to limit human activity and direct more efforts towards protecting species at risk, then The Endangered Species Act must be left alone. I am dubious that the current government's intentions are pro-environmentalism in nature, despite the desperate attempt to make it sound just so. The discussion paper published by the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks makes that quite clear when they state that one of the challenges of the current legislation they are concerned with is how it has created, ""barriers to economic development"". Economic development should never be prioritized over the health of our environment and the fragile ecosystems that we all depend on. The economic development campaigners, many of whom are politicians without a scientific background, appear unable to see the forest for the trees. What will economic development matter when food chains start to collapse and our lives all become at risk due to our inaction over environmental issues such as the protection of endangered species?
Do more to protect animals, do more to protect the environment, think long term about sustainability, and make sure you're on the right side of history, otherwise there will be no history at all.

Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks
Minister Rod Phillips.
RE:  ERO #013-4143:  10th Year Review of the Ontario Endangered Species Act.
Introduction
Concerned Citizens of King Township (CCKT) is a well-established citizens’ group which has been active in King Township for 48 years.  CCKT represents approximately 150 households.  CCKT advocates for sound progressive planning, well-planned thriving communities, preservation and enhancement of natural heritage systems, protection of waterways and prime farmland, and engagement of citizens in public consultation.
CCKT would like to highlight two key points / principles:
1.  The purpose and goals of the Endangered Species Act.
2.  Key proposed changes.
Purpose and Goals of the Endangered Species Act.
The purpose and reason for the drafting and approval of the Endangered Species Act (the Act) in 2009 were to recognize and protect species-at-risk in Ontario, and to take actions to protect the species in its native habitat and to improve the health, status and numbers of each species.
The purpose of the Endangered Species Act is not intended to streamline planning approvals and support economic development.  These matters are best addressed in other provincial legislation.
It is clearly understandable that implementing the policies of the Act will result in hurdles and challenges for specific planning and development applications which are tied to economic development.  Ontario has implemented a number of forward-looking policies which protect wetlands, water courses and other significant natural heritage features often through buffers and protective linking zones.  Of course all of these will put some limitations on planning and economic development proposals, but all for good long term purpose.
CCKT recognizes the importance of economic development approvals which are part of forward long term planning which also are carried out while meeting the significant purposes and policies of the Endangered Species Act, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act and other legislation intended to protect and enhance natural heritage systems and the many species-at-risk which live and thrive in these protected areas.
We ask that Ontario keeps its focus on the intended purposes of the Endangered Species Act, and not view the Act as an impediment to economic development, and thus diminish the strength and purpose of the policies which are intended to protect species-at-risk and help each species thrive.
Proposed Key Changes to the Endangered Species Act
CCKT supports the several of the desired outcomes of the proposed changes to the Act, specifically:  Enable positive outcomes for species at risk; Ensure species assessments are based on up-to-date science; Address multiple objectives for ecosystem management through stewardship and protection activities; Increase efficiencies in service delivery; Provide clarity for those who need to implement the Act; Maintain an effective government oversight role.
CCKT raises strong concerns about the focus and related changes that seek to steamline the process, reduce the cost and take away barriers for economic development.  Of course if there are opportunities to reduce unnecessary time and financial costs while completely maintaining the integrity of the purpose of the Act in enabling positive outcomes, these should be pursued.  However, there should be no compromise on the intended purpose of the Act in order to foster economic development.
CCKT intends to provide additional comments on the four key areas of focus in the Discussion Paper when the draft document with the proposed changes is released.
Thank you for your consideration of our submission.
Sincerely, J. Bruce Craig
Chair, Concerned Citizens of King Township

23899,/comment/23899,"The 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper presents a poor and incomplete summary of challenges faced by the subjects of the act, i.e. a) the species and habitat requiring protection and b) the users of resources/those carrying out activities in those habitats and c) the enforcers of the act.  Also,
1. there are no specific examples for the challenges presented, especially specific examples for what is meant by a landscape approach to ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk. Therefore it is unlikely the government will obtain a adequate feedback from the public. Ontarians will have been poorly consulted at this early stage should changes be undertaken based on the review, and the process will have been not very transparent at all at this early stage.
2. The 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper fails entirely in its omission of discussion points for the challenges faced by species in cases where activities are carried out by industries exempt from the requirements of the act.
2- The 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper fails entirely in it’s omission of discussion points for the inherent disaster in the act being administered by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. This situation is akin to an agency involved in ensuring quality of day care centre being the same one to regulate how child molesters can have access to those children. Therefore, consideration needs to be given to splitting up the two conflicting interests of listing, defining and monitoring protections for species and regulating industrial/commercial activity impacting protected species and permission to destroy habitat. As I have indicated in writing to the ministry in the past, I believe that the Endangered Species Act should be looked after by the Environment and Climate Change Ministry which regulates other things relating to the natural environment, and not by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. The natural resources are part of the environment of all Ontarians. It is time to recognize that the current joint responsibility by MNRF is not working and clearly the failures and poor discussion points in this discussion paper reveals this, albeit in a round about way. In my interaction with a local MNRF office the staff’s conflict between an obligation to protect species and to support commercial development when pressured by business is so evident and sadly has forced staff to use less than honourable means to force the decision and appear to be negligent in proper enforcement of the act.
I outline below my comments addressing specific discussion points raised by Ontario in the document.  I first wish to comment in general, that it is time for such discussions to acknowledge that there may not be enough healthy wild intact ecosystems left in Ontario to protect wild species in a perfect manner, while also allowing “business as usual” to continue for individuals or industries whose activities are causing harm to endangered species and their habitats. However, we do need to try, and we need to take drastic measures to be successful. The wording and the types of questions raised in this discussion paper exemplify a ministry in denial of realities, and not only this, the wording at times appears to be an attempt to obfuscate what is really being considered and also makes it difficult for the lay person to understand what is being asked for in terms of discussion and therefore makes it unlikely a good enough effort can be said to have been made to seek consultation from a wide range of Ontarians. This is unfortunate because, I fear, the same kind of problem alluded to in your section 2 in relation not species being listed, will arise in relation to the act itself i.e. the unclear wording in this discussion paper will result in any proposed changes to the act arising without most people having a heads up. Most people will not have had enough public notice before changes are made to the act and the process will not have been transparent at all - or at least not to most people.
1) Landscape Approaches
a) Discussion paper asks: “In what circumstances would a more strategic approach support a proposed activity while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk? (e.g., by using a landscape approach instead of a case-by-case approach, which tends to be species and/or site-specific.)”
ANSWER: is this question related to mitigation of risk or ? Can the species be relocated nearby?  A landscape approach can support a proposed activity in addition to a species and/or site-specific approach, but a landscape approach cannot replace these. Does the landscape approach assume that you will then protect other area for the species and what if there isn’t any nearby and/or the species cannot migrate or be relocated? Does habitat protection instead of species mean that, for example the habitat of all turtles will be protected? Does the habitat approach suggest, for example, that perhaps a municipality would be given a certain number of “credits” and then no more of that habitat would be permitted to be damaged or compromised from the perspective of endangered species viability in that habitat?
Or alternatively perhaps the activity, instead could be viewed on a landscape approach, for example if there are already other similar activities such as a nearby dam then it could be not allowed if the sum in that landscape do not support integrity of the habitat.
In cases where there is habitat to replace the habitat lost, perhaps.
ANSWER: already the ESA allows for landscape approaches and so these need to be better understood and utilized by Ontario and those who administer the ESA.
b) Discussion paper asks: “Are there existing tools or processes that support managing for species risk at a landscape scale that could be recognized under the Endangered Species Act? “
ANSWER: Yes and no. For woodland caribou, for example, recognition of the need for whole landscape consideration has been included already in the ESA as mentioned above. However, for many other species this may not be the case. Where new habitat cannot be re-created because of the uniqueness of that habitat, or for species where overall one needs to have connectivity between habitats (where this connectivity is being lost and is affected every time a municipal planning decision is made poorly or otherwise - it would be overlooked, too complex, too late), and so these requirements by species would not be adequately covered by an overly simplistic landscape approach alone, i.e. not for all species or for all habitat types.
2) The Listing process and protection for species at risk
a) Discussion paper asks “What changes would improve the notification process of a new species being listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List? (e.g., longer timelines before a species is listed.)”
ANSWER: there should be publication of the full information about the species at risk listing and recovery strategy in a peer-reviewed publication before official listing of the species, as well as public release of the same in a lay person publication. This would allow for a) everyone, including those in the scientific community to be aware that the new species listing is coming. Importantly it would also allow for the known experts cited in the documents to view the information and to comment and/or be prepared to comment on what is there and be aware of what was finally included. NOTE: that there are cases where quoted experts in recovery documents were not aware at all of what was said in the final report and this has led to, I have observed, erroneous information included in the listing documents. Thirdly, it would also allow for the process to be transparent, or at least a little more if the members of the COSSARO panel involved for that publication are included there i.e. increasing awareness that there is such a body and who are the people on it and b)
b) Your discussion paper asks: “Should . . . we sometimes just say they are not going to be protected?  . . . there be a different approach or alternative to automatic species and habitat protections? (e.g., longer transition periods or ministerial discretion on whether to apply, remove or temporarily delay protections for a threatened or endangered species, or its habitat.)”
ANSWER: No, it should remain as is, with no additional ministerial overruling /politicization element to an already flawed act. If the science shows that a species should not be listed as endangered, then it would not be under discussion so such an over ruling or alternative should not be needed. To be clear, there should be no additional “alternative” beyond those already built into the flawed act, i.e. the existing imperfections of the industrial exemptions added in 2013 and the conflict of interest inherent in the enforcement of the act.
c) Discussion paper asks: “In what circumstances would a different approach to automatic species and habitat protections be appropriate? (e.g., there is significant intersection between a species or its habitat and human activities, complexity in addressing species threats, or where a species’ habitat is not limiting.)” . . .
This begs the question,  appropriate to who or what? Should the question really be: when can we just say to hell with the rule and the species?
ANSWER: When the minister or other industry with pull stands to gain a lot.
ANSWER: Where the situation is hopeless and no one cares about the animal (or whatever species) anyway.
ANSWER: When it is not in the ideal habitat and the protections are going to lead to a bad outcome for a different species or a different important sensitive habitat.
d) Discussion paper asks: “How can the process regarding assessment and classification of a species by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario be improved? (e.g., request an additional review and assessment in cases where there is emerging science or conflicting information.)” . . . improved for who? Or what?
ANSWER: The answer depends on who one is trying to improve the process for. One way to improve it and to ensure it covers new and/or conflicting information is to ensure that the assessment and classification process by COSSARO is reviewed by people who know the content and after it is created. Again, publish the documents in a peer-reviewed scientific publication and other public news sites to ensure transparency, to give all a warning that it is coming, to allow for people to refute it there is conflicting information and to be sure that those who are used as references have a chance to see whether the information is complete and conveys what they know to be the most up to date. Also to give industries a heads up to register complaints and to see how they can do more damage or mitigate damage (as the case may be) early on in the process of planning “activities”.
3) Species recovery policies and habitat regulation
a) Discussion paper asks: “In what circumstances would a species and/or Ontarians benefit from additional time for the development of the Government Response Statement? (e.g., enable extending the timeline for the Government Response Statement when needed, such as when recovery approaches for a species are complex or when additional engagement is required with businesses, Indigenous peoples, landowners and conservation groups.)”
ANSWER: as the example included in the question states, if it is complex and there is new information arising and data is often outdated. In these cases more time may be needed. However, if one had released the original pre-release document in a public transparent manner, more information would be revealed, early on and errors corrected, potentially reducing such cases.
b) discussion paper asks: “In what circumstances would a longer timeline improve the merit and relevance of conducting a review of progress towards protection and recovery? (e.g., for species where additional data is likely to be made available over a longer timeframe, or where stewardship actions are likely to be completed over a longer timeframe.)”
ANSWER: time is often needed for study of any biological system but at no point would this indicate that there would be merit in considering stopping it - if that is what you are implying. Take the time needed and meanwhile be careful and diligent and stringently protect where protection and recovery are needed.
c) Your discussion paper asks: “In what circumstances is the development of a habitat regulation warranted, or not warranted? (e.g., to improve certainty for businesses and others about the scope of habitat that is protected.)”
ANSWER:  To improve certainty to a business is not a circumstance where it would not be warranted. When would it not be warranted? Perhaps when the habitat is gone or all hope is lost. When no one cares about the species? Example recently was a developer who said of an endangered species whose habitat they sought authorization to harm: “it is just a little bug in the middle of nowhere” So, ya, in cases where industries are twisting government officials arms then perhaps it is NOT warranted to develop a habitat regulation!!!! Are we talking about the ESA here or not?
4) Authorization for species harm process
a) discussion paper asks: “What new authorization tools could help businesses achieve benefits for species at risk? (e.g., in lieu of activity-based requirements enable paying into a conservation fund dedicated to species at risk conservation, or allow conservation banking to enable addressing requirements for species at risk prior to activities.)”
ANSWER: say what? There are many tools that could be used such as negative authorization or much larger “fines” to dissuade the “activity” thus protecting the species; talks to children’s groups about protecting endangered species when they grow up or why they are no longer there; jail time; trade harm “credits” with another in your municipality who wants to commit activities that will harm a species i.e. the business that wants to harm the species is permitted to do so if he convinces another business to not carry out an activity that is going to harm the species - or perhaps another species.
ANSWER: another authorization tool that would benefit species is for the business to pay the true cost of species harm, the true monetary cost of say a wetland or a viable river ecosystem or viable forest ecosystem. What is the price of the priceless, i.e. a healthy planet? The businesses that are deemed to do irreparable harm to ecosystems need to be prepared to balance their gain with the eternal loss of integrity of the natural world in Ontario. What is the dollar value of these complete ecosystems or of a child’s healthy development that is known to require healthy nature as part of their life?
ANSWER: authorization could be given to find new habitat for the species to be relocated. If there is not enough habitat left elsewhere nearby, or in the municipality or the province of Ontario, then suggest the payment for rehabilitation/relocation of the species or alternatively of the proposed activity requiring authorization, to another planet.
b) Your discussion paper asks: “Are there other approaches to authorizations that could enable applicants to take a more strategic or collaborative approach to address . . . the harm . . .  impacts to species at risk? (e.g., create a new authorization, such as a conservation agreement.)”
ANSWER: possibly, as mentioned, but why consider ways to take an approach to avoiding more proactive to help? If the act is appropriate and they already have an exemption anyway if they are one of several industries, then why should there be more exemptions.
c) Your discussion paper asks: “What changes to authorization requirements would better enable economic development while providing positive outcomes and protections for species at risk? (e.g., simplify the requirements for a permit under s. 17(2)d, and exemptions set out by regulation.)”
ANSWER: the example you give i.e. simplify requirements does not at all address positive outcomes for species. How to simplify and at the same time provide positive outcomes. To simplify here, would be to simply say NO that activity is not permitted.
ANSWER: just go ahead and allow the activity and endanger the species with no consequences; that solves the challenge does it not? Why not make more industries or activities exempt from the law. Of course at this point I am mocking the discussion paper questions, but this is so cynical for all Ontarians that it is not funny.
d) Your discussion paper asks: “How can the needs of species at risk be met in a way that is more efficient for activities subject to other legislative or regulatory frameworks? (e.g., better enable meeting Endangered Species Act requirements in other approval processes.)”
ANSWER: this question can really only be answered by asking it the only way I can interpret it, i.e. as follows: How can the needs of the species at risk be met in a way that is more efficient for the people who want to ensure their needs are not met?
The only answer is to ensure that the activity does not take place at all. The answer is a flat out NO would clearly be best for the species at risk. However, there must be the acknowledgment that there is not enough Ontario left now for recovering endangered species and making it efficient for businesses that are doing activities that interfere with them to thrive. Surely there are activities and circumstances where the species is so important or the ecosystem is so important that there will be cases where the activities can not be regulated in an efficient manner.
e) Your discussion paper asks: “In what circumstances would enhanced inspection and compliance powers be warranted? (e.g., regulations.)”
ANSWER: where complaints have been received that the granting of the authorization is not in the public interest.
ANSWER: Where the activity is at a site or in a habitat where a species has been extirpated.

As elected officials you have the power and the responsibility to makes changes that are in the long-term best interest of all members of the community, which means protecting our wildlife and our wild spaces from damage and encroachment.

23901,/comment/23901,"I am commenting as a Master of Environmental Science candidate from the University of Toronto, Scarborough.
The government stated in the discussion paper for this review of the ESA that ""the act has been criticized for being ineffective in its aim to protect and recover species at risk, for being unclear, administratively burdensome, time consuming and costly for applicants, and for creating barriers to economic development."" I agree that the ESA has not been sufficiently effective in recovering species at risk - however, improvements need to be in the direction opposite of the one I fear the government is taking. For example, Section 17(2)(d) states that ""a significant social or economic benefit permit may be issued for an activity that will result in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario, but the activity would have impacts that are otherwise prohibited under the Act."" I am concerned that the Ford government will make use of this loophole to keep pushing through development projects that fragment and/or destroy crucial species at risk habitat, under the guise of ""economic benefit"". At some point, there is no economic benefit that outweighs the value of Ontario's biodiversity and ecological integrity.
There are 243 species at risk in the province, including many reptiles and amphibians and one of Canada's most iconic large mammals, the Boreal caribou. With climate change on track to worsen and make many species more vulnerable to decline, we need bold action now, not weak legislation that capitulates to business interests. Ontario's economy is strong and I see little evidence that our already-ineffective ESA constitutes a significant burden to business. And if the government is serious about protecting our wildlife, that means it will often have to say ""no"" to development projects and business practices that cause harm to wildlife and habitat.
Our species at risk are far too important to be de-prioritized in favour of business and development interests. I hope the government will close loopholes in the ESA, raise the standard for exemptions and enhance enforcement of compliance.
Thank you.

23905,/comment/23905,"ESA_ProtectNatureTO’s Submission-ERO #013-4143 Review of the Endangered Species Act, 2007_March 4 2019
The government launched their 10 year review of the ESA under the premise of promoting “positive outcomes for species,” despite also apparently wishing to see “efficiencies for business.” Worryingly, the language in the accompanying discussion paper points to a red-tape cutting agenda that could put species at further risk.
We are very concerned about the plight of endangered species in Ontario and worry that this latest proposal for comments on the Environmental Registry of Ontario is another environmental deregulation exercise to make it easier for industry and development proponents to proceed with activities that harm species at risk and their habitats.
Endangered and threatened species in Ontario have already been deprived of protections due to sweeping exemptions for industry in 2013; now the Ontario government is proposing to further streamline approvals.
The world is facing a biodiversity crisis. The extinction rate is 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than the natural rate. Literally dozens of species are estimated to go extinct every day. Ontario is not immune. Southern Ontario has the highest number of endangered species in Canada.
“The biodiversity imperative is different from other social challenges and we would argue is even more critical than, although certainly related to, climate change. Why? There is no recovery from extinction, it is forever and unlike climate change whose impacts will be felt by many of the world’s population in the future, biodiversity loss is here now in the present, there is no future discounting.”  BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION-A Call for Action for Canadian Decision-Makers https://www.changingtheconversation.ca/biodiversity-action-agenda
The fact that provincial government is choosing a course that we can reasonably know will create more pressures on an already stressed Ontario’s wildlife habitats pushing more species toward extinction is obviously a very serious issue. At this point, these problems are knowable. The consequences for the environment, the species at risk and Ontario biodiversity are predictable. How the government at this point chooses to proceed raises profound questions about our collective obligations to one another, to our society and the entire ecosystem. It raises profound questions about the choices this provincial government is making now as reflected in discussed Review of the Endangered Species Act, 2007.

23906,/comment/23906,"Area of focus 1: Landscape Approaches.
While it is true that focusing on single species is more time-consuming and may overlap with other species conservation or protection plans, I do not believe the solution would be to solely implement landscape approaches. This is because focusing on a landscape scale would gloss over important details that conservationists must focus on that are specific to that species. Each species is different, and while they may face similar issues within the same geographic region, that does not mean that they have the same protection measures. Rather, it would be the most effective to keep the species-based approach, but to make sure that there is another section within the species reports that focuses on how the specific protection measures for that species will overlap or interact with other species in the region/landscape, and work from there. This way, you are implementing a case-by-case approach to define and address the specific needs of each species at risk, while also additionally looking at the case through a landscape lens to ensure that this plan does not overlap with other plans, and to find areas where the protection measures between species may benefit each other.
Area of focus 2: Listing Process.
I think it would be helpful to notify farmers or owners of large areas of land first, whenever there is a change in the listing of a species. Since the listing of the species automatically protects the species, it is important for landowners with large pieces of land to be aware of this, especially if they are in the agricultural field. I do not think that anyone would benefit from a longer timeline before a species as listed - if the species needs to be listed at all, it means that it is endangered or on the way to becoming endangered, and there is no time to lose. On the topic of the length of the COSSARO listing process, I believe that releasing statements (either on the site or even through social media) in order to keep the public updated would help with increasing transparency.
Area of focus 3: Species Recovery Policies.
As stated earlier, when a species is considered for listing or is in the process of being listed, it means that the species is already at high risk, and at this point, there is no time to lose. While 9 months may be a short amount of time to prepare a report, it is possible to cut this time shorter by consulting other scientists and professionals (such as professors, researchers, etc) in order to gain the most perspectives and start to narrow them down. It would also help to increase interdisciplinary approaches and ensure that everything related to the policy (such as the possible repercussions for the rest of the habitat) is taken into account. I also think that there would be few circumstances where extending the timeline of the review of progress would be beneficial - I believe that even if the review happens earlier than is needed, even if the review is a shorter and less in-depth review, it would still be helpful in collecting as much data as possible and to gain more insights into the future steps to be taken into protecting the species. In many cases, species recovery may be slow until it hits a point where rapid change occurs, in which case, it is very important to keep monitoring and reviewing the policies on a regular basis. Lastly, the development of  habitat regulation is absolutely needed - no species can survive if the habitat it lives in is constantly being burdened by business affairs and other human activities, especially those that are listed.
Area of focus 4: Authorization Process.
In order to streamline the administrative process, I think that it would be helpful to minimize the amount of forms needed to be filled out, and to make sure that there are clear, accessible instructions using layman terms on how to fill in the forms. I do agree that the process is tedious and onerous, however I think that simplifying requirements or simplifying any portion of the policy/process should be treated with high attention to detail. If enforcement powers are limited, it would be helpful for each of the enforcement powers to have a better communication system between them so that they are on the same page and know the general species protection measures that need to be taken. Ideally, there should be unified enforcement because species habitats do not follow geopolitical borders, however this would be difficult.
Overall, I do not believe that it is wise to lessen efforts in species recovery and conservation to offer spots for businesses. It is important for species protection to be carried out and managed by knowledgeable people such as conservation authorities.

Act: Endangered Species Act , R.S.O. 2007
Posted by: Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks
Dear Sir or Madam:
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment regarding the 10th Year Review of the Endangered Species Act, 2007.
As noted in your ""Proposal details"" text, 243 species are currently listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List.  This is an alarming number and one that is growing rather than declining.  One would think that, given this situation and the alarming decline in the populations of many species worldwide, the focus on this review would be on strengthening protections under the Act and improving enforcement.  Governments at all levels have an obligation to protect the long term interests of citizens which include a healthy environment and the protection of biodiversity.
However, in reading the Discussion Paper, it appears that the majority of proposals put out for discussion relate to expediting the approval process for activities that may prove harmful to species at risk and weakening the government's obligations with respect to the protection of such species.
I support the comments and suggestions put forth by Ontario Nature with respect to this review process and strongly encourage the government to give priority to enhanced  protection for species at risk rather than proposing measures that exacerbate an already alarming trend of species decline.
Thank you, once again, for the opportunity to provide input.

23908,/comment/23908,"Smart Prosperity Institute welcomes the opportunity to provide comments to the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks on the Discussion Paper for the 10th Year Review of Ontario's Endangered Species Act (ESA).
Over the past several years Smart Prosperity Institute has undertaken extensive research and convening on policy tools for recovering Canadian species at risk . Although tailored to the federal Species at Risk Act, many of the insights gleaned from this research are applicable to the Ontario statute and context.
The key message of our commentary is that while the Ontario government can significantly improve how it implements endangered species conservation in Ontario, the Ontario Endangered Species Act already contains the tools needed to stabilize and recover Ontario’s endangered species – and so amendments to the legislation are not necessary at this time. Our submission instead focuses on how to use the existing legislation and associated policy instruments to more effectively and efficiently protect endangered species in Ontario, with an emphasis on promoting stewardship on private lands, making better use of multispecies/ecosystem-based management approaches and, in cases where regulatory exemptions are being considered, providing transparent and publicly accessible analysis of the harms to endangered species – and the relevant economic costs and benefits – that would likely accrue through these exemptions. Given that Ontario has a disproportionate responsibility for conserving and recovering species at risk in Canada  (many species at risk are concentrated in Ontario), improving implementation of the Ontario ESA is essential.
Although our commentary is based on a selection of issues where we have particular expertise, we share many of the concerns raised in the commentaries submitted by organizations such as the Wildlife Conservation Society Canada – that the Discussion Paper places far too much emphasis on expediting development, and as a result, risks weakening the ESA’s main purpose of conserving and recovering endangered species.
Our submission begins by highlighting what Smart Prosperity Institute considers to be a significant missed opportunity in the Discussion Paper – stewardship on private land – followed by our commentary on specific questions raised in Areas of Focus 1 (Landscape Approach) and 2 (Listing Process and Exemptions Protections for Species at Risk) of the Discussion Paper.

Subject : Response to ERO number 013-4143 10th Year Review of Ontario’s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper
To whom it may concern,
Introduction:
The opportunity to consider how to better enable the Endangered Species Act in Ontario is very welcomed by us. There is a lot to unpack here and even more going on.  Globally, we are moving towards an unprecedented time in humanity.  From an endangered species lens, we are assumed to now be in the Anthropocene and in the sixth mass extinction event,  in which current extinction rates vastly exceed (conservatively, up to 100 times)  natural background rates .  In mass extinction events, there are serious consequences for ecosystems and ecosystem services, leading in most cases to ecosystem collapse.  The rebound of species diversity and ecosystems can take thousands of years . No one knows how close we are to the tipping point but one has to assume we are inching (if not running full speed) towards ecosystem collapse that is firmly on the backs of species extinction.  There are more indicators of unsustainable practices but our focus here is on species at risk.
In considering the above, there is ample attention, and solutions, to the loss of species occurring around the world.  Using this lens, we believe that there are exciting approaches available as we consider the question, “what actions can we consider to both enhance endangered species survival and support a 21st century economic transition?” We believe that the opportunity is ripe to consider emerging approaches for recognizing financing the economics of ecosystems and BioDiversity, the shift in accounting and subsidies. This slow and steady course correction in economic development is resulting in green jobs, green bonds, payment for ecosystem services, financing for protected areas, enforcement options, ecosystem based adaptation, nature based solutions for disaster risk reduction, restoration economy, and,  biodiversity finance, to name a few.  This shift is underpinned by multiple drivers based on the understanding that there are finite limits to development on our finite planet, and that we are in overshoot .  In essence we are drawing down our natural capital, dipping into our “principal”, not living off the interest.  If we continue, we will eventually bankrupt the planet.
The global response to this has been evolving for 50 years, and continues to evolve.  This collective consciousness shift has resulted in a staggering array of frameworks, approaches and agreements, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, Multilateral Environmental Agreements, The Future We Want,  changes in food systems, circular economies, the list goes on and on. In the works for approximately two years and declared officially on March 1, 2019, is the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem restoration   from 2021- 2030.   With the above in mind, our goal in this submission is to give a sense of what actions could be considered to both protect and enhance the endangered species act, while looking at emerging approaches that could foster economy in Ontario.
In this submission, we will use the frameworks and approaches above as we consider the questions posed.  While this will not be an exhaustive treatment of the consultation document, we hope to at the least, build a basis for further development of emerging approaches.  If the information presented is of interest to the work being undertaken by the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks, we would be happy to assist in any way we can.  We firmly believe that the time is now for Ontario (our sub national Government) to consider overshoot as an economic driver sand shift the course to address this wicked problem.
General Comments: on the discussion paper
Our overall response to intent of the consultation
	“The Ontario government is currently undertaking a review of the Endangered Species Act to improve 	protections for species at risk, consider modern and innovative approaches to achieve positive 	outcomes for species at risk, as well as to look for ways to streamline approvals and provide clarity to 	support economic development.
	The desired outcomes of any proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act are to:
	• Enable positive outcomes for species at risk
	• Ensure species assessments are based on up-to-date science
	• Address multiple objectives for ecosystem management through stewardship and protection activities
	• Increase efficiencies in service delivery for authorization clients
	• Streamline processes and provide clarity for those who need to implement the Act
	• Maintain an effective government oversight role” (pg 2 complete para 2 and 3)
We believe that the primary goal must be to ensure threats and drivers to species are decreased, meaning that we move towards delisting of species and that no species are added to the species at risk list in Ontario.  This must be the primary outcome.  The duty to all life in Ontario should not be taken lightly. While it is hard to hear, the threat of “genocide” of species is occurring in Ontario as is evidenced by the some 243 species currently listed.  If we are to address this, we have to stop, in some instances, sitting idly by, or maybe turning a blind eye, as we try to squeeze all the “value” out of the landscape. The thing we should recall is that we are all species and cannot separate ourselves from the web of life.  All life depends on ecosystems for air, water, food, shelter, range, security and prosperity.  What we are striving to introduce in this submission  is that there are alternate equally important values that can be considered and can lead to economic development in Ontario, while protecting spaces for species and ecosystem function.
We would also like to note that species habitat (pg 1 paragraph 2) is also found within urban and peri-urban areas, not only “in the wild”, and that the urban ecosystem     be included in the ecosystem description.
Finally we note that much of what we are putting forward underscores, and we believe invited, the statement on page 2 paragraph 1 (complete), line 5 “to improve its effectiveness, and modernizing the program based on best practices in other jurisdictions”.
Area of Focus 1 – Landscape Approaches:
“The Endangered Species Act sets requirements that must be met for each species that is listed as endangered or threatened. Landscape approaches may provide new tools for managing species at risk within specific geographic areas or ecosystems where the needs of multiple species at risk can be addressed” (pg 5 consultation document).  Before we address the questions and challenges noted in consultation document, we would like to make two general comments:
1) We would like to see the ministry consider gathering all the information pertinent to endangered species in Ontario, including the recovery strategies, offenses, regulation, act, etc, be organized into a single one stop website. The current platform is neither complete nor clear.
2) It was our understanding that based on the work done by both the Canadian ( in conjunction with the Provinces) and Ontario  (Ministry of Natural resources and Forest [MNRF]) Governments are moving towards a landscape approach through the BioDiversity lens. As such, we are somewhat confused in the introductory comment (above in quotations) as it appears that this direction is that of both the Canadian and Ontario Government.  In particular, we believe that the “Pan-Canadian Approach to transforming Species at Risk Conservation in Canada”  (Canadian government, Ministry of Environment and Climate Change),  through the consideration of the principles, priorities, results and benefits  begins to address much of the preamble to this area of focus.  We would appreciate clarity on this please, especially as to how the Pan Canadian approach is being brought to bear on the Endangered Species Act Ontario review.
Challenges outlined in consultation document:
1) The case-by-case and species-specific policy approach to implementing the Endangered Species Act can sometimes limit the ability to achieve positive outcomes for species at risk. More broadly, protection and recovery approaches for individual species can limit or conflict with one another. For certain species or habitats, the ability to take a more strategic approach maybe preferred.
Comments: While we concur that case by case may not be sufficient, it is an underpinning of conservation and can’t be abandoned.  The basic tenant of ecological science deals with abundance and distributions of the particular species.  Further the trio of units studied through ecological sciences are individuals, populations and communities. To explain distribution and abundance of a single species, science studies what happens to the individuals.
To understand population changes you must consider the individuals, within the community matrix.   If you consider that all species (humans too) live within communities with other biotic and abiotic factors, to explain community change the analysis of how populations have altered has to be in the mix. Finally, it is important to remember that a) for all species good and poor places exist for every species and all species and individuals in the population are affected by environmental factors of weather, nutrients, other species and shelter; b) over exploited or pressured populations can collapse; c) communities can rebound from disturbances; d) keystone species may be essential to a community. In any approach, the above core principles of ecology must be enshrined in any work done on endangered species.  Moving too quickly to “seeing the forest and not the trees” can be damaging to single species futures.
2) For species that depend on habitat across wide ranges, a landscape approach that enables planning and authorizing activities at a broad scale may be preferred.
Comments: Species dependence across wide ranges is, in our minds, similar to considering the criteria outlined in the Pan Canadian Framework, and could also be considered in an approach in which landscape/ecosystems are the more appropriate level of organizing that could result in multiple benefits for multiple species.  However if the intent is to facilitate authorizing activities at the expense of BioDiversity, this is not acceptable.
Questions outlined in consultation document: Focus Landscape Approaches
1) In what circumstances would a more strategic approach support a proposed activity while also ensuring or improving outcomes for species at risk? (e.g., by using a landscape approach instead of a case-by-case approach, which tends to be species and/or site-specific.)
Comments: The case for supporting proposed activities needs to turn from resource extraction and landscape changes (current economic approaches) to ones that are considering the 21st century possibilities that can shift the economic model in Ontario.  This is particularly germane in specific industries such as mining, forestry, agriculture, infrastructure development, and land use change from rural to urban, even more relevant when dealing with Crown Land in Ontario.    As noted in the introduction in an effort to unpack evolving shifts in direction, we want to bring forward, the below.  Please recognize that there are numerous other resources that could be added to this list.  We will review the three outlined below separately with some suggestion as how they are relevant within the question outlined.
a) Taking a Broader Landscape Approach - A Policy Framework for Modernizing Ontario’s Approach to Natural Resource Management (OMNR, 2013),
b) IUCN Red List of Ecosystems    , and , Guidelines for the application of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria (v1.1)
c) CBD Guidelines – The Ecosystem Approach
a) Taking a Broader Landscape Approach is a framework for a strategic approach in which outcomes for species at risk could be considered at a landscape level.  This Ontario government document has a good solid basis, and response, to the question under consideration. The document is well developed in several areas, and can be considered a flexible framework within which case by case consideration of endangered species, within a landscape lens, could be considered.  The basic elements to be considered are,  i) Manage at appropriate scales;  ii) Integrate and coordinate; iii) Assess, manage, and mitigate risk; iv) Focus science and information resources; v)Manage adaptively.  This basis which is currently used within MNRF, which also has responsibility for SAR in Ontario, should be included in developing landscape approaches to endangered species.
b) IUCN Red List of Ecosystems and Guidelines for the application of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Categories and Criteria (v1.1).  This new approach to considering species within ecosystems, is underpinning the current real trajectory of ecosystem collapse globally.  The intent of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems is to give us a tool to consider how to assess ecosystems/landscapes health.  From the criteria document , Particularly  section 5. Criteria and thresholds, should be investigated as a robust approach, that is globally vetted, in the pursuit of considering landscape approaches for species at risk.  If, and as you review this tool, perhaps one of the questions we should be considering, is designating not only species but ecosystems entirely.  At the least, the criteria can act as a framework within which to consider landscape approach.
c) CBD Guidance – The Ecosystem Approach, again has an array and multitude of things that can be brought into the mix in a landscape approach.  Particular to crown Forest Land in our Province,  I would like to draw your attention to Annex II on the relationship between sustainable forest management and the ecosystem approach, which we fell  is particularly relevant in the Ontario context.
Before moving on to question two, we would like to pause and begin to introduce the opportunities to shift toward sustainable emerging economic drivers and possible methods of financing that moves beyond resource extraction and permanent land use change.  The treatment of each will be at a general level. In this section, we will touch upon the economic drivers of the restoration economy, the Sustainable Development Goals, ecosystem based adaptation, and ecosystem based disaster risk reduction.  From a financing lens, we will briefly look at Business Model Innovation for Sustainable Landscape Restoration,  directions from  insurance companies and others, green bonds, the work of the Katomba group (specifically proactive investment in natural capital), financing for protected areas, and BioDiversity Financing.
A Note on BioDiversity Offsetting   . Within the  bucket of potential directions for economics and financing, BioDiversity offsetting is included.  However, BioDiversity Offsetting, as articulated at the international level is not a trading scheme, it is an effort to address the residual efforts of a project/change in land use, any consideration of BioDiversity Offsetting must pay and heed the mitigation hierarchy.  In Ontario, the efforts to enable BioDiversity offsetting have led to a lack of understanding in what theses market mechanisms are. It is our belief that if offsetting is to be considered within an endangered species tool kit, it has to be well understood by those who will be responsible for oversite, and not applied as a trading scheme.
A note on Natural Capital:
In our minds, at the basis of much of what we have and will present, if based on the idea that Natural Capital  is as significant a contributor to human well-being and prosperity as is financial capital.  We believe that bringing Natural Capital into the discussion on landscape approaches for endangered species is critical to move the bar towards sustainability.  Agreeing on what the definition is of natural capital and how to use the direction is underscored and developed in footnote 17, which reflects the international Natural Capital’s work.
Economic Drivers:
The development and possible size of a restoration economy       is a response to the decreasing capacity of the natural world to supply the goods, and ecosystem services we depend on.  Directly linked to the global direction from numerous multilateral environmental agreements, with multiple agencies organizing around the lens, the trickledown effect to Ontario is getting closer.  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and associated targets  , which are being taken up around the world form individual to national governments, and civil society actors.  They are considered part of the way forward for a sustainable future.  Aspirational and agreed to by a multitude of countries, including Canada, they are a system against which many are exploring as a way to align ourselves globally.
Across a multitude of goals and targets, the investigation into the global land assessment and ways towards the economic driver of the restoration economy has evolved.  To give support and underscoring this critical need to stop continued degradation of the earth, the United Nations, after several years of negotiations, has pronounced 2021 -2030 as the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration , this has the potential to set in motion a growing change to counterbalance extractive and destructive business practices that continue to push species and ecosystems over the brink of recovery.  This,  coupled with Ecosystem Based Adaptation to Climate Change   , and Nature Based Disaster Risk Reduction      the global economy appears to be setting the stage for real dollars to flow to benefit the planet and species, which will help secure the future for people.
Methods of Financing:
Business Model Innovation for Sustainable Landscape Restoration is a course based “exercise to explore the potential for a positive role of business model innovation for landscape restoration is an emerging area where all sized businesses are beginning to assess project opportunities within the restoration economy”.  Lead by ENABLE  out of the University of Rotterdam, the business model creation taps into creative business approaches in support of the restoration economy.  While not a specific method of financing, it is clear from the work through the course that there is a real potential to develop and deliver services that will help restore the planetary ecosystems. One of the collaborators in the consortium, Commonland , uses an innovative model   in which 4 returns (inspiration, social capital, natural capital and financial capital) connects 3 landscape zones (natural zone, combined zone, economic zone) to create market based solutions for landscape restoration. The approach being take through Commonland is something that could be developed in Ontario for a landscape approach for endangered species security.
Directions and voice from insurance companies and banks, among others are also lending support to restoration economy activities      .  Banks too are beginning to consider natural capital and risk to natural capital in their investment and lending practices  . Green bonds, already on the table in Ontario  , increasing in Canada    and around the world , are growing in availability and momentum.  With the green bond system in place, the thought of shifting parts of the bonds to land restoration is poised to help address the decade on ecosystem restoration, which in turn will assist in species protection in a landscape lens.
The Katomba Group   realized in 1999 was the first collaborative exercise of its kind that brought together multiple contributors to consider the complex idea of payment for ecosystem services.  Over the years much of the basis for natural capital, natural accounting and payment for ecosystem services, has evolved form this group.  There are many threads to investigate through the Katoomba Group work, we have elected to only bring forward the work on proactive investment in natural capital , an approach that is at the core of the restoration economy.  Financing for protected areas,    is a concept that could be customized to suit conditions in Ontario for both parks and protected areas and for open landscapes in need of protection. Finally, BioDiversity Financing   a project of the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Network, is a relatively new approach, which appears to be in favour with sub national governments as they strive to conserve landscapes and species in their jurisdiction. If you do go to the link provided as reference in the foot note, many more tools and frameworks can be accessed.
Conclusion:
The comments on question one are the most developed in our submission.  We believe we have given you some practical examples of tools, approaches, frameworks and directions that could help create the conditions by which a landscape approach to endangered species could be considered.  We do note, however, there are many more real world examples we could of suggested – the trick is to do an assessment of what is available, and create the approaches that will work in Ontario.  To do this assessment properly, a more developed table of contents, or questions to be considered is needed.  We would be happy to explore a more detailed investigation with you.
While we have treated focus are 1 question 1 in some detail, we cannot give the same treatment to the balance of the focus areas, even though we would have liked to.  If you feel it is justified and warranted, we would take a bit of a deeper dive into the focus areas. As such, The balance of our comments for the focus areas are not as in depth and are more in the form of recommendation with benefits and solutions. We have elected not to answer all questions as  we just did not have the time needed to do so.
2) Are there existing tools or processes that support managing for species risk at a landscape scale that could be recognized under the Endangered Species Act? We are not prepared to make any firm comment on this question for several reasons including that the time is not sufficient to review the plethora of approaches.  We feel the above, and numerous other directions under way, could upon closer review for whether a pick up and use approach, or a combining several elements of different approaches could work. To do this question the justice it deserves would benefit greatly from review through multiple lenses, including a sector specific consideration (i.e. mining, infrastructure, urban development, etc), land ownership perspective (crown, private, treaty), and a species and ecosystem lens.  Again we would be willing to develop a more salient response if given more direction and is welcomed by the Ministry and Minister.
AREA OF FOCUS 2 – LISTING PROCESS AND PROTECTIONS FOR SPECIES AT RISK
Question #2:
There should be a different approach in automatic species and habitat protections. There should be a creation of a larger team of people in the field and shorter timeline to assess all the areas that are protected.
Why is this beneficial?
By creating a larger team, it will create more jobs for those in the environmental science field or those who have extensive knowledge of endangered species in Ontario. In other words, this will create more “green” jobs.  Those who can be involved include:
-	Environmental scientists
-	Indigenous peoples
-	Citizens with knowledge of endangered species
Proposed solution
The creation of a Rapid Response for the Assessment of Protected Areas (RRAPA) would allow for large teams across the province to assess whether areas that are automatically protected need this protection lifted. Areas should be assessed from the highest to the lowest human-species or business-species interaction in order to minimize any impact on businesses, citizens and species. The most beneficial way to organize these priority areas is through categorization.
Sample categorization
Category #1: High human-species and/or business-species interaction
Category #2: Moderate human-species and/or business-species interaction
Category #3: Low human-species and/or business-species interaction
Question #3:
As mentioned in question #2, a rapid response team could be considered in order to create a different approach to automatic species and habitat protections, under certain conditions. However at all times the first line of defense for the species would be immediate protection.
Question #4:
COSSARO should be a more transparent body where making information more accessible will help in creating trust with the general public. The Endangered Species Act should also be written in simpler text so average citizens can understand it. There should also be more communication with the board. COSSARO should also have fixed dates to meet and evaluate the progress of species currently on the list and determine whether there should additions or removals from the list. Finally, COSSARO should communicate with other entities such as the federal government.
AREA OF FOCUS 3 – SPECIES RECOVERY POLICIES AND HABITAT REGULATIONS
We will submit comments on this section.  Unfortunately it will be after you prescribed deadline for the comments. As such we will develop the response in anticipation of the next consultation.
AREA OF FOCUS 4 – AUTHORIZATION PROCESSES
Question #1:
Stop making the Endangered Species Act prioritize businesses! That is NOT the point of the Act. The Act is intended to help species not make it on this list to begin with and reverse the effects on those who are already on it. Businesses should be made aware of the species around them and of the consequences that come with endangering them. Businesses should also be charged where an offense is committed.  In the event that a particular practice has triggered an addition of a species to the Endangered Species Act, serious consequences should result by way of offenses.
Question #3:
In order to enhance revenues for enforcement of the Act, stricter enforcement and possibly enhance penalties should be considered.  Section 40(1) of the act outlines the monetary benefit for the provincial government if they were to fine more culpable individuals. This money can be used to pay individuals who are working in the assessment of protected areas, again creating more jobs for Ontarian’s while securing our Province’s future for all.
We are jointly submitting these comments.  While we are both active with matters pertaining to a sustainability, firmly believe that we have a duty to all life and the planet itself, we believe that there are opportunities to foster increased awareness and collaboration. The duty to all life in Ontario should not be taken lightly.  It is our belief that this consultation could help foster conditions to shift towards a more just and equitable future for those who call Ontario home today, and for those that will call it home in the future.

23912,/comment/23912,"Dear Minister,
The endangered species act is an important tool to protect our threaten wildlife. As we are now approaching the 6th extinction I hope the government understands that the public is not in favour of relaxing the endanger species act because of the ""red tape"" it may cause industry. Clearly, with climate change and the extreme weather we are experiencing the government must realize that endangered species are now fighting development, aggregate extraction and climate change.
I am also shocked at the aggregate industry and its recent 'red tape"" argument concerning endangered species interfering with extraction applications. The description of their solution to removing the ""problem"" is to have a complete review also of the endangered species act and remove any restrictions that might interfere with their ability to make a profit and by the way also destroy farmland, our water and ignore our endangered wildlife. Since industry really only cares aboutmaking a profit why would the ministry then consider the removal of the red tape that protects our endangered species by reviewing the endangered species act???
The red tape is there for a reason. Keep it there and stop making it easier for multi-nationals to destroy our natural resources.
