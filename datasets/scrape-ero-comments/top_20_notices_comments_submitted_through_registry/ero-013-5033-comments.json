        "comment":"I was semi-prepared for a short-sighted, self-serving response of our current provincial government to the processes surrounding species' protections in Ontario - after all, who would expect much from an absolute disaster of a premier with no post-secondary education, no empathy, and no ability to think beyond his own short-term needs - and I remind you that your government was not voted for by the majority.  Nevertheless, these proposed revisions are way beyond what I expected.  Some comments below.\n1) There are multiple delays embedded in this proposal that seek to extend the time within which action is required.  For example, i) \"extend the time from when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to when listing is to occur from three to twelve months\", and ii) \"Minister discretion to extend the nine-month Government Response Statement development timeline\"\nResponse: This document has clearly been prepared by people who are entirely ignorant of the reasons for, and potential solutions to, our biodiversity crisis.  An introductory course on ecology would educate the authors so that they would realize that many of this work is time sensitive.  This is just a delaying tactic.\n2) \"De-couple the listing process from automatic protections and provide greater Minister\u2019s discretion on protections, while keeping the assessment as a science-based process at arm\u2019s length. While the role of classifying species would remain with COSSARO and listing of classified species would continue to be required, the proposed changes would provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species.\"\nResponse: Wow.  Here you are saying that a minister with absolutely zero background in biology, science, ecology, land management, or any other relevant area will have the power to override the carefully deliberated recommendations made by an appropriately educated and experienced committee.  What will be in place to prevent the minister for altering species' protections (to the extent that they are effectively nonexistent) in exchange for back room (or front room) deals he will make with his cronies who much would rather make money than protect our biodiversity.\n3) Creation of Regulatory Charge and Agency\nResponse to this entire section:  This entire section once again reflects the lack of education (relevant and otherwise) of our provincial government.  In simple language: money does not compensate for lost habitat or lost populations.\nThese proposed changes show a total disregard for the biodiversity of Ontario, and the minister and other relevant parties should be ashamed of themselves.  Do you ever stop to think about how you will explain to your grandchildren your roles in biodiversity loss, climate change, and the catastrophic conditions that will follow?\n",

        "comment":"Although I believe that no amount of public input will alter the current government's intent to pass these proposed changes, I would like to note the following:\n1. Allowing a government minister to use their discretion in adding species to the endangered list, or in delaying actions that protect them, completely politicizes the process. This is not at all in keeping with an arms-length decision based on scientific facts.\n2. The consideration of a species' status throughout its wider geographic range is misleading and inappropriate. It has been clearly established that the resilience of most species is dependent on interactions among separate populations, such as allowing for the flow of genes and movement to favorable habitats depending on year-to-year conditions (e.g., drought, forest fires, etc.). Letting some populations decline is therefore usually the first step in endangering the entire species.\n3. It is discriminatory to citizens in certain regions of Ontario to not have access to protected environments, including the organisms that live there, due to exemptions. Should the experience of wildlife by citizens therefore be limited to those residing in areas with relatively little economic activity, or involve traveling outside of their region? All citizens have the right to experience nature - this is not for the government to arbitrarily decide on their behalf.\n4. Allowing parties to \"pay a charge\" in lieu of actual acts that promote the conservation of species directly affected by their activities will clearly result in local biodiversity declines. The use of the proposed fund resulting from such charges is poorly described, and it is not apparent that it would be even be used to promote local conservation. If it is part of some general fund that funds conservation elsewhere, once again citizens in the affected area bear the brunt of negative impacts with no say.\n5. Based on the wording of the proposed changes describing conflict with \"economic benefit,\" the latter is not defined in its scope. Would economic benefit need to be demonstrated with a dollar amount? Would it be a one-time benefit, or on-going? How does the scale of harm to endangered species compare to that of the economic benefit? Is any economic benefit enough to outweigh harm to endangered species?\nIn sum, I view these proposed changes as a significant weakening of current policies to shift from an automatic process with concrete timelines that is conducted by an arms-length agency employing actual scientists who use data to a politicized process full of exemptions and weak timelines to support a vaguely-worded goal of economic benefit. It is not all in keeping with the well-established guidelines and policies used by conservation agencies worldwide, and it is fairly shameful that we are moving away from evidence-based decision-making.\n",

        "comment":"As a biologist, an Ontarian, a farmer, a landowner, and young person who has great hopes for Ontario's future, I oppose the proposed changes to the endangered species act. You are weakening the act in favour of economic greed and small economic gains This is short-sighted. Giving up any small piece of Ontario's biodiversity is not wise policy and you should be doing better. You should be doing everything you can to form economically sound ways to conserve SAR.\nReducing protection for species whose geographical regions stretch outside of Ontario is unwise. For example, the carolinian species, whose ranges in Ontario are small, and many of whom are currently listed as SAR, should not have their listing status downgraded sinply because they exist outside of this country. Species that we have been working to protect should not lose protection in our province in the hope that the United States will protect them. Species such as the Hognose snake and five-lined skink carolinian population are valuable and incredible resources in this province, and to step back from protecting them is unwise, and will be regrettable.\nAdditionally, the loss of automatic habitat protection accompanying the listing of a species is going to be a huge and costly, inefficient move to make. Having standardized habitat protections that accompany listing a species is helpful in understanding and implementing the ESA. These habitat protections have been developed with science and best practices in mind. To remove these and move to a \"case by case\" discretionary basis will cause a great rise in T\\the cost and length of each species listing process, an economic inefficiency sure to be unappreciated by Ontarians.\nYou should be working to create policies that pay rather than punish land owners for having SAR habitat on their property. Having a SAR on your property is currently seen as a burden by many of my peers, and instead of weakening the ESA you should be working to incentivize conservation. For example, for many farmers, a badger on their property is essentially a huge loss of profit to them, as they lose the use of some of their land. What, do you think, happens to those badgers? Do you think they are reported, or do you think that they are more likely to mysteriously \"disappear\"?\nEconomic activity at the cost of SAR habitat is not worth it. Develop the economy here responsibly, and with an eye to conservation and longevity rather than short term gain.\nThese changes to the ESA do not have my support.\n",

Instead, this appears to be a proposal designed to allow the minister to simply ignore the recommendations given by COSEWIC, and I do not wish such a change to be implemented.\nRegarding 2)A), I feel that three years is an unreasonable length of time to delay the implementation of species protections when COSEWIC has determined them to be necessary. The protections on a species should not be delayed by any more than a year at most, even when important industrial considerations are at stake.\nRegarding major proposed change #4, I don't see any reason why the creation of a new organizing body to handle funds for environmental improvements would be better or more efficient for anyone involved. Considering that the cost to the project will remain the same (as it should, or perhaps it should even increase), it would be much more efficient to keep the current system where the project is expected to spend that money on environmental initiatives exactly where they are needed (I.e. in the place being developed), rather than creating a new middle man to do the same work somewhere else.\n",

The changes are a blatant attempt to undermine the ESA in intent, effect and enforcement.\nI object to lengthening the time from when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to listing the species on the SARO list from 3 months to 12 months.  The situation must be dire before COSSARO adds a species to the list so this proposal would steal a critical 9 months of species and habitat protection.\nI object to limiting COSSARO\u2019s ability to submit a request for species protection to the month of January. Once COSSARO has determined that a species should be on the SARO list, action must be immediate.\nI object to building in a delay tactic to further detriment of species by allowing the Minister of the Environment to require COSSARO to re-assess species classification.\nI object to requiring COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biological relevant geographic area, inside and outside of Ontario as the requirement is immaterial to Ontarians today and to future generations. The goal is not simply to preserve the species, but to preserve the species for Ontarians.\nI object to broadening COSSARO membership qualification to include \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d as it would reduce the scientific expertise of the panel and thus would call decision-making into question.  The highest level of scientific expertise and traditional aboriginal knowledge is required for purity of intent and credibility.\nI absolutely and utterly object to de-coupling the listing process from automatic protection and giving the Minister (most of whom are scientifically unqualified for the job and hold the office for less than 2 years) discretion on protections.\nI object to allowing the Minister to have discretion on protections with the authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to 3 years as such power would make the Act inconsistent in its application, capricious based on political climate and unfair to some applicants.\nI object to by-passing the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993, which I consider informative and useful.\nI object to transferring authority from COSSARO, an independent scientific based board, to the politically engaged Minister of Environment easily influenced by the political climate.\nI object to establishing the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, independent Crown agency [independent of what?] to allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act.\nI object to the whole premise of municipalities or other infrastructure developers being able to \u201cpay to slay\u201d species of concern.\nI object to moving enforcement from the Ministry of Natural Resources with a network of already trained and respected conservation officers to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Environment.\nI object because the proposed changes to the ESA are entirely contrary to my review and comments submitted in January 2019.\nThe current government was elected based on Doug Ford\u2019s promises to be \u201cFor the People\u201d and to \u201crestore accountability, respect and trust to Queen's Park\u201d.  I don\u2019t see those promises being fulfilled in these proposed changes.\nPlease do not enact the changes as proposed.\n",

If you bulldozer over a marsh with Blandings Turtles, you don't get to teleport the turtles to another location first, they die.

As an environmental consultant, it is currently very difficult assisting clients through the ESA permitting process; a very uncertain process in terms of time and monetary cost. The pay-in-lieu option might provide a much clearer path toward establishing overall benefit. Consolidating funds to a central trust that will coordinate SAR recovery efforts seems like a great idea that I expect will be a more effective and efficient way to promote species recover.\nI highly applaud the move toward incorporating considerations of a species' overall range (not just its Ontario range) into COSSARO rankings. I has been troublesome and unnecessary that species that are widespread and common outside of Ontario should receive cumbersome and expensive protections within our province simply because Ontario happens to represent a northern extreme of its range.\nWhile it might be unpopular to some, but I also applaud greater flexibility for the government to temporarily suspend the implementation of protections for newly listed species. It is not always clear how to implement protections for newly listed species and rushed protections can (and sometimes do) result in strong adverse impacts on industry while not necessarily resulting in the desired recovery for the species. Ecology is nuanced and we often do not fully appreciate how much we don't know about a species until is appears on the SAR list. First focus on filling knowledge gaps, then implement smart, efficient and effective protections.\nThank you for this opportunity to comment.\n",

Here are the reasons why the proposed changes are not the right path to take.\n- Ontario Specied at Risk often require very specific and long-standing habitat. Take salamanders for example. These vulnerable creatures need vernal pools that are hard to come by in order to reproduce. Allowing development in these areas is a bad idea and could completely decimate our amphibian populations. Allowing companies to simply pay more money for \"mitigation\" causes is NOT helpful - you cannot simply recreate specific and delicate ecosystems without disrupting other ecosystems.\n- Do not open more hunting\/collection permits to at risk species. This is a bad plan as it directly harms already low population counts and can disrupt, again, highly delicate ecosystem balances.\n- Furthermore, we always need to protect species at risk in our province EVEN if population counts are high in other provinces. Species have various habitats that, if one is not protected, their range will narrow and effectively destroy overall populations.\nObliterating the health of our wilderness directly influences citizen's mental and physical wellbeing, our water systems and our ability to draw clean well-water, and Ontario's ability to create sustainable ecological tourism, which is a negative economic choice.\nAll in all, we need to protect our species. We cannot be greedy. Ontario must have other ways to open up business and econmic growth without destroying our natural heritage and our beautiful environments. The plans that are being made are short-sighted, uneducated, and (I can assure you) is not supported by the vast majority of all conservationists in Canada.\nDo better for our ecology, or animals, and for the province, and do not go forward with these changes.\n",

A monitoring requirement should be implemented, similar to the four year monitoring and reporting requirements for wetland remediation\/replacement in Alberta (2015), making the organizations taking on this work accountable for satisfactory results. The implementation of in-lieu payments can also help to fund university\/private research projects that find new or better ways to protect Ontario's species at risk, which is an important step to achieve the end goal of removing these species from the list.

You should be making changes to further protect species and green space rather than to help big corporations continue building up and pushing wildlife out of their homes.

To what benefit would extending this window bring \u2013 destruction of further habitat, longer and drawn out processes that waste even more government resources.\n2.\tProposed change 1c, similar to my comment above, limiting the time at which the SARO list to only one month a year enables permanent destruction of habitat.\n3.\tProposed change 1e, considering a broader biologically relevant geographical area.  Newer and deeper scientific knowledge consistently reveals sub-populations.  By broadening the areas by which we consider the status of animals reduces protection for these sub-species.

These are species that are already in jeopardy. When ill we go to doctors because they are the people who have the best training to ensure that we get well again.

If dedicated researchers have determined that a species is endangered, it is not a matter of politics whether it is or is not, it is only a matter of political will whether that species will indeed receive protections. A politician with no knowledge of a species' needs simply cannot, by definition, be sufficiently expert to decide if a species is at risk or not.\nThe new changes not only broaden that discretion to add a species to the list but also allows discretion, to a political person with no expertise, on HOW to protect the species and whether corporations may simply pay a small fine not directly correlated to the cost of the harm caused to the species to circumvent the rules altogether.\nIt is further troubling that the proposed legislation would seek to remove species on the list on the basis that we have harmed a species more extensively than our neighbouring provinces. It is irrational and may result in ecosystem collapse in other provinces because we are not carrying our weight.\nFurther, it continues to harm the province's green industry, which has already seen huge losses as a result of the government's reckless reversals on renewables, arbitrary contract cancellations, and antagonistic relationship with nation-wide conservation efforts.\nThis proposed legislation must be revised under supervision by conservation officers and scientists that would be best suited to advise the government on where red tape can be eliminated and where the legislation requires strengthening. Legislation reliant on scientific knowledge must rely on that knowledge in self-review as well or it is meaningless.\n",

        "comment":"I have a number of concerns with this proposed legislation.\n- It extends the time from when a species is classified as 'at risk' to when it becomes protected by the act, from 3 months to YEARS. Currently, an independent group of experts classifies species' at risk. Once classified in this way, the species becomes protected within 3 months. The proposal extends this time to 12 months, and allows the Ontario Minister of the environment to use his\/her discretion to ask the group of experts to 'reconsider' their classification, effectively extending that 3 month period to multiple years.  Not acceptable.\n- It requires the group of experts to consider the status of a species OUTSIDE of Ontario, before classifying a species as at risk. This means that if a species is dying off in Ontario because we are destroying its habitat, but it is doing OK in, say, the Yukon, we will simply let this species become extinct in Ontario.  Think about that - what would happen if every geography managed their species at risk in this way? Do we really want to let species like the Snapping Turtle die off in Ontario?  Not acceptable!\n- It allows the Minister of Environment to interfere in species protection. Here is one example of that in the proposal: \"Remove the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert in the \u2018D\u2019 permit process\". There are several other examples. This is will effectively allow political and lobbying influences to dominate decisions, as opposed to scientific influences.  I am already  embarrassed at the extent to which our government goes to deny facts and silence its detractors; this bypassing of science-based regulation is not acceptable.\n- It introduces a pay-to-proceed fee that allows developers to bypass protection activities that would otherwise be required. A direct quote from the proposal: \"... allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act\".

As an ecologist, I am deeply worried by the changes relating to the creation of regulatory exemptions and regulatory charges.  I believe these changes will make it easier for infrastructure developers to disregard the impact of their projects on endangered species. Developers will be able to pay a fee instead of altering their project to be less destructive to endangered species. As a result, habitat will be destroyed and endangered species will go extinct.\nWe are currently in the midsts of a mass extinction event. This should be a huge concern to us as the loss of species diversity makes ecosystems less resilient. The more species we lose, the more vulnerable ecosystems are to natural disasters, climate change, or disease. Ecosystems provide essentiel services such as agriculture and other food sources, recreation, tourism, and air quality preservation. When we lose species, we put our ecosystems in peril and risk losing these services.\nAs a young Ontarian, I find this government\u2019s lack of concern for endangered species and environmental protection to be deeply disturbing. I hope to work, live, and start a family in this province one day, but the current management of our natural resources makes me question whether that will be possible.

A properly classified at risk species could go extinct in this period, and although there is a provision for this, it is unclear how it would be reliably determined in advance that a species could survive the waiting period.\n- Allowing developers to essentially buy out the need to adhere to protections for at risk species is problematic at best.

This loophole is only going to to doom our environment, and corrupt our society further.\nI understand the need to get things rolling when development needs to happen but think logically about why this rule is in place in the first place. Species at risk act needs to be there. Go watch a damn episode of David Attenborough with your family tonight and think about this. Adding in this loophole will only set the precedence for the direction things will go in the future. As soon as you introduce this law it will be a mistake, people will take advantage and this law which once held meaning will now be dispelled to nothing.\n",

        "comment":"I am professional ecologist, and have worked as a researcher and planner on more than 200 projects involving ecological management in Ontario.\nThroughout my 10 years of experience, the Endangered Species Act has provided a framework for meaningful long-term management of our most threatened species.\nThe proposal to gut this act is deeply worrying.  And this gutting would greatly limit our ability to properly manage and sustain many declining wildlife species that are ecologically, economically and culturally significant to Ontario and Canada.\nFurthermore, endangered species represent the overall quality of the ecosystems they inhabit.  Their management should be considered a crucial part of protecting the fundamental water, air and soil systems that we all depend on.\nThe most troubling proposed changes to act are listed below and my rebuttal is provided:\n1. Species listed as threatened or endangered may no longer be automatically protected\nThis would mean that many species in need of immediate attention and management, would experience a purgatory of the \"protection approvals process\", wherein major harm and declines may occur completely unnecessarily.  Secondly, this would undoubtedly lead to disposal of all scientific, and expert information in favour of political advantage for any given species at risk.\n2. Changes to \u201cedge of range\u201d species means considering populations outside of Ontario when listing a species at risk.  This includes many Southern Ontarian species, allowing Ontario to simply opt out of protecting species at home.\nOntario is not an \"edge of range\", it is a full and important part of the range for many ecologically important and endangered species - especially in our carolinian zone.  These carolinian Ontario species are quite often found nowhere else in Canada.  And, despite representing a small areal percentage of our entire country (~1%), the carolinian zone in Ontario is larger than Souther Korea - or roughly the size of the entire nation of Iceland ~100,000 ha: which can not, in any way, be considered a \"small\" or \"insignificant\" area for endangered species management.\nIn addition to our southern \"edge of range\" representing a vast area, it also represents a very significant part of the global range for many of the species that occur there, and a very significant part of Ontario's overall biodiversity.  Lastly, we can not take for granted that these species will be properly managed internationally and therefore \"not our problem\".  We MUST to continue to endeavour to manage these unique species in our own province - and our own country.\n3. Introducing pay-to-proceed system on harmful activities. Developers and proponents should not be allowed to pay their way out of protecting endangered species\u2019 habitats.\nIt is absolutely wrongheaded to assume that every project, regardless of its costs or impacts, is good for Ontario.  Costs and impacts quite often outweigh benefits to the people of Ontario, and an analysis of the impacts to endangered and rare species is an important part of the impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis for any project.\nThis change would be devastating to our shared ecological systems.  Payment would not - could not - be sufficiently charged or collected to undo the damage of certain types of projects barging forward in certain types of locations.  This loophole must not be opened.\n4. Opening the scientific committee to non-scientist members. This change could allow people with no knowledge or scientific background to be involved in decisions for species.\nThis is so obviously an indecent part of the proposal that it seems ridiculous to me to need to speak to it.  If non-experts intervene in rocket launches - rockets explode.  If non-experts intervene in bridge construction - bridges collapse.  In non-experts intervene in judicial decision-making - lives are unnecessarily ruined behind bars.  If non-experts intervene in healthcare - people stay sick, or get sicker.\nFor ecological protection, the damage that is done, is chronic and has a time lag but is every bit as real and damaging as the situations I describe above.  After a poor ecological management decision due to non-expert interference, people don't typically die the following afternoon in a fiery explosion.  However people will be harmed in many tangible ways.  Degradation of our ecological systems, means that our air, water and soil (all clearly fundamentally important and irreplaceable) are of poorer quality.  Agricultural pests increase.  Climate change is exacerbated.  Flooding risk increases due to wetland loss.  Wildfire risk increases.  Invasive species, which often causing massive damage to fisheries, forestry, agriculture, parks, hunting etc. proliferate.\nAnd at the end of the day, quality of life for all people in Ontario decreases.  Endangered species management is a critical link in the chain of proper ecological management.  Non-experts should have absolutely no ability to interfere with the process, just as surely as they must be barred from their opinions on how to build a bridge.\n5. Giving the Minister the discretion to interfere with the listing of at risk species, bringing politics into the protection of endangered species.\nThis is simply another catch-all way that these proposed changes gut the legislation and increase access for non-experts to interfere in potentially very harmful, costly, and quality-of-life-diminishing ways.  Keep the corrupting desire for power (i.e. being re-elected), or money (for your investments, your friends, your own companies etc.) from supporting a harmful project far away from our shared environmental system.\nIn conclusion - these proposed changes are deeply disturbing.  They completely ignore the vast costs of poor environmental management and assume that someone else will pay these costs in the future - while profits are streamlined from detrimental projects being pushed forward in the present.\nThe changes attempt to bypass a critical part of an effective and meaningful planning process.\nEndangered species are not simply rare creatures with negligible aesthetic value.  They represent the quality of the ecosystems that they inhabit: which in turn represents the quality of the crucial ecological services that we all require to live (water, air and soil systems).\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I copy these points from the previous website and comment on each in particular.\nOn proposed change A: ...Also, extend the time from when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to when listing is to occur from three to twelve months (i.e., when a species must be added to the SARO List).\nI think this will have the effect of negating a lot of the value of protecting species at risk, because it gives operators 9 more months in which to clear the land they are interested in of the species to be regulated. Where I live this is very common: wetlands are being declared significant, so they are drained as rapidly as possible before the regulations take effect. Same thing: destroy the regulateable area or species before the regulations to protect them come into force. This change simply enables such activity. One cannot and should not pretend it does not occur.\nE: Require COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened. If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition.\nThis is biologically naive. Organisms adapt to their surroundings, and local populations have genetic specialties allowing them to survive. Just because a species is common in the United States, doesn't mean the genetics of that population would allow it to survive in Ontario and re-populate it when the time comes. Population fragmentation is also a concern -- if we do not attempt to keep a species across its entire geographic range, we increase the population fragmentation and increase the chance that populations elsewhere will be harmed. Finally -- all species have a role to play. A species that is present elsewhere but extirpated in Ontario cannot play its ecological role in Ontario. What these roles are run from primary producer to primary consumer, and organic recyclers. How many ecological specialists is the province content on losing, as it accepts the loss of species from Ontario?\nF. Broaden COSSARO member qualifications to include members who have relevant expertise in ecology, wildlife management, as well as those with community knowledge.\nIs the province going to accept biologists and ecologists on economic boards? What about plumbers and taxi drivers into the regional health boards? What is 'community knowledge' and why is it relevant? This is simply an attempt to bring non-science into scientific decision-making. If the government wishes to overrule COSSARO's scientific advice when making policy, then be transparent about it. Over-ruling it by introducing non-science into the actual advice-making is not transparent, and is not justifiable. This proposal should be deleted.\nSection 4 \"Creation of Regulatory Charge and Agency\": Ontario is also proposing to create Canada\u2019s first independent Crown agency proposed to be called the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, to allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act. The funds would support strategic, coordinated and large-scale actions that assist in the protection and recovery of species at risk.\nThe major concern here is that money is not what species at risk need. They need habitat protection, they need regulatory protection. Recovery strategies could benefit from money, but recovery is a last resort, and protection of habitat is much more efficient and less costly. To allow actors that wish to destroy habitat to pay their way out is not a deterrent to those seeking this 'out'. Their costs are simply passed on to their clients \/ consumers of their products. It makes no difference to them, and I predict there will be many requests to simply buy one's way out of habitat protection. The money is not going to have the desired outcome regarding species retention on the landscape. Not to mention that so much of the money will simply go to overhead for this new independent Agency, and not at all to species recovery, research or any useful activity in support of conservation. This amendment should be deleted.\n\"Additional changes related to issuing permits\", part C: Provide a new transition provision for existing Endangered Species Act permit- and agreement-holders to continue to operate for twelve months following the application of new species or habitat protections while they seek amendments to their permit or agreement to address newly listed species. Currently, existing holders would, upon the species being listed and protected, need to stop their activity that impact the species or its habitat and wait for their permit or agreement to be amended.\nHere I can make the same comment as earlier: this only provides for a longer 'destroy while you still can' time, and to believe it will not be abused is to be naive. Already we see far too many instances of 'act first, apologise later'. This amendment only supports such thinking, and will not in any way improve protections for species.\nDitto, Part E:Create a new landscape agreement that takes a strategic, coordinated and consolidated approach to authorizing clients undertaking multiple activities, and which could allow for limited conservation banking to achieve positive outcomes for species. The issuance of a landscape agreement would be dependent on conditions, including:\nthe agreement requires reasonable steps to minimize adverse effects of the authorized activities on the impacted species under the agreement,\nthe agreement requires actions to benefit one or more species,\nreasonable alternatives have been considered, including those that would not adversely affect the species specified in the agreement, and\nthe beneficial actions required by the agreement outweigh the adverse effects to the impacted species under the agreement.\nHere I don't understand the use of the word 'considered' -- to consider is to do nothing. It is not binding, it is not useful. To require 'reasonable alternatives to be considered' is an empty statement. The alternative that would not adversely affect the species should be the one *chosen*, not just *considered*.\nSince I was born, the number of birds, that is, their population size, not the number of species, has dropped by two-thirds. That is equivalent to a human population loss in Ontario of 6.6 million people. Only twenty years ago, I still needed to use the window-washing station at the gas pumps when I drove at night in the country, due to the accumulated insects on my windscreen. Not any longer. I used to have bats in the barn. Swallows too, and on the power lines. I used to hear frogs in the spring. I live outside of Ottawa, in a rural area. We have allowed the loss of so much already, all in the name of 'balance'. The balance sheet is so far out of whack, any talk of 'balance' is naive. We will continue to lose species no matter what we do, but the proposed amendments here will speed that process up, and enable individual companies to profit even more from the public good -- nature and all that lives in it. I think the changes you propose are not in keeping with conservation philosophy, with biological reality, nor does it cast a critical-enough eye on the natural activities of business interests. Regulations exist to uphold certain standards, and are not just 'red tape'. Smart regulatory design is good. Loose regulatory design that allows for loopholes, stacking of advisory bodies with non-specialists to hide pertinent advice from Ministers, and removal of protections for species across their range is not good, not productive, and counter-intuitive.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\n",

It simply is not rooted in sound science. It seems to be grounded in thinking that if we destroy a bit of habitat in one area, we'll just spend money and improve\/build habitat somewhere. This is an extremely flawed concept which has been studied numerous times.\nHabitat compensation projects rarely (if ever) come close to achieving the same sort of ecosystem productivity as what was there in the first place. The federal government has been trying this idea for decades with wetland compensation. A study of 16 habitat compensation projects found that AT LEAST twice the area that was destroyed needs to be created in order to achieve the same level of productivity; and that was only for the best projects. In order to ENSURE that productivity was compensated for, projects needed to create\/improve 4.8x as much area as was destroyed. I will refer you to this paper for details: Quigley, J. T., & Harper, D. J. (2006). Effectiveness of fish habitat compensation in Canada in achieving no net loss. Environmental Management, 37(3), 351-366.\nIt's just foolish to think we can impact habitat in one location and reconstruct it elsewhere and everything will simply balance out. This policy needs to be avoided and no changes to the ESA should have anything to do with a payment in lieu policy.\n",

Consequently, I have a level of first-hand knowledge as well as a deep love for the natural world.\nThere are a number of very problematic and cognitively jarring issues with the proposed changes to legislation:\n1) The reason that we HAVE endangered species is largely due to heedless development and extraction.  Trees are being replanted because industry has not done so and habitat is being carefully restored because development has taken native habitat and replaced it will flora and fauna that is not native and causes harm to native species.  Much of this happened before we realized the damage we were doing.  WE DO NOT HAVE THAT EXCUSE ANYMORE.   We, as a society are fully aware, or certainly should be, of the damage that we have done and  the point of this legislation is to signal that industry and development must actually stop in certain cases, not that it should be given a license to continue damaging land or animals in return for paying financial compensation.  Money cannot assist us here.\n2) Science must be in the forefront of this legislation and consultation with the community (that would be people such as myself, an avocational entomologist who participates in citizen science,  alongside actual scientists) that is informed on the subject, although important, should be in auxiliary to the facts.\n3) changes to 'edge of range' definitions is particularly wrong-headed in light of quickly changing ranges in the era of climate change - in Ontario the ranges of birds are shifting dramatically every season.  Breeding grounds are changing for multiple species.  Plants are moving north.  We cannot look to another location and site it as holding the majority range with any kind of assurance.  Thus range is becoming a very poor indicator.\n4) Ministerial 'discretion' is a political term that should not apply here at all, nor is it a responsibility that should be unfairly foisted onto a politician whose qualifications are not primarily science.  We need stable, secure planning in order to protect Ontario's vast natural heritage and the political climate is never stable.  The minister has enough responsibility without being put in the risky situation to act in a politically motivated fashion that is not in the best interest of our natural heritage.\n5) There should be no approval available for industry or development projects that precludes ERO approval.  This is a necessary safety check that must happen in order for honesty and integrity to prevail.  Utilizing other laws as a 'back door' for approval damages our reputation as a society along with bringing almost certain harm to natural world.\n6) We are in a time of climate emergency and a great extinction event, world-wide.  Weakening the laws to protect native species of animals and plants that are under threat would be a tragedy that many, many citizens of Ontario will go to great lengths to avoid.\n",

This has been called a \u201cpay to slay\u201d proposal by many critics.\n\u2022\tOpen the species at risk assessment process for non-science-based decision making.\n\u2022\tSuspend species at risk protection if the species is common outside of Ontario. This opens the door for extirpation within Ontario and the disruption of local ecosystems.\n\u2022\tIntroduce longer delays for the protection of new species. This includes increasing the length of time it takes for a new addition to the Species at Risk list to be protected from 3 months to 12 months.\nMany of these changes could make it easier for development to occur on fragile and ecologically sensitive habitats.

In particular, it is ludicrous that the Minister has the right to make  COSSARO reconsider the classification of species--the opportunity for partisanship and lobbying by industries wanted a particular species downgraded in order to build on land, or exploit resources is far too great. These decisions should ONLY be made by non-political entities, scientists and researchers dedicated to the good of the planet and the environmental health of our province.\nSecondly, while the idea that COSSARO should take into account a species \"broader biologically relevant geographic area\" before listing a species as endangered sounds good, in fact it encourages other provinces to de-list certain species and does not take into account habitat islands that make it virtually impossible for certain species to travel\/migrate in order to actually grow by breeding with populations farther away.\nSo while a species overall in say Ontario and Quebec might warrant a large enough population to not be considered endangered, those populations are often sequestered in smaller and smaller habitats meaning that population groups could easily die out due to in-breeding regardless of the whether the same species exists nearby.\nIn general, the removal of independent experts and non-partisan and of course the payment-in lieu nonsense (which would still involve the creation of red tape--your \"board-governed provincial agency\" to allocate funds) are all steps backward in a time when we can not afford to wait any longer to protect our environment.

Having to pay a fee similar to the cost it would otherwise incurred through meeting the species-based conditions of authorization does not reduce the cost of doing business in Ontario. It may fast-track development bit a small margin of time, however, the long-term detriment to the affected at risk and endangered species does not outweigh a minor change in development timelines. In addition the proposed change states that the activities used by the funds would be with an agency that would \u201censure informed, unbiased and exert decisions\u201d, however, the Minister is set to be able to \u201cestablish guidelines (e.g. objectives and priorities) for funding and set standards for activities that receive funding\u201d. This provision makes it impossible for the agency to be unbiased\/non-partisan while conducting this work.\nSection 4.A & 4.G - These provisions give far too much control to the Minister and should removed. Making Ontario open for business means making a consistent set of rules that businesses can rely upon. Having the Minister maintain so much control over the permitting process and proposed regulations impact on species removes the consistency needed by business. As governments change, Minister\u2019s opinions on matters will alter widely. Having the Minister always consult an independent expert removes partisanship and gives stronger consistency for businesses.\n",

        "comment":"Section 1:  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nE)  Evaluating a species range based on its geographic range outside of Ontario lessens the acts ability to protect a species in numerous areas across Ontario e.g. some species are isolated, at the Northern end of their range or are impacted in different ways in Ontario than outside of Ontario.  In addition, species sensitivity and local adaptations impact whether a population of the same species can survive in different habitats even within Ontario (e.g. populations of Red Mulberry in Pt. Pelee vs. Niagara Escarpment) so assessing them outside of Ontario, does not speak to impacts on the species within the province.  Similarly, this can result in loss of biodiversity of species in Ontario.  The current act already speaks to protect individual populations in Ontario despite other populations in Ontario sufficiently safe (e.g. Lake Sturgeon, River Darter, Northern Sunfish, Caribou, Five-linked Skink-different ranks for each population).  Considering species populations outside of Ontario is not needed in order to continue adequately identify appropriate species ranks.\nSection 2:\nA)\t While extending the period after a COSSARO report is received to when it is listed would allow proponents to prepare for any related restrictions, a 12 month period is too long and allows for projects to continue on without proper protections for species at risk.  Instead it is proposed that a list of species be provided by COSSARO of species that will be reviewed annually, so that proponents are aware before a report is provided to the minister what species may potentially be added to the SARO list.  This would allow proponents to prepare ahead of time so that once the report is received and the species is listed, transition to address the new protections of the species is considered and is smooth and with appropriate timing.\nF)  Broadening the qualifications of COSSARO members is supported however minimum requirements need to be in place to ensure protection of the species.  Those who gain politically, socially or economically from changes in listings of the committee should be restricted from membership on the COSSARO committee.\nSection 2:  Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nAi)  While temporary suspension of species prohibitions for social and\/or economical reasons so additional time is provided to determine the best approach to protect the species makes sense however, it is important that any new activities should also be suspended for the same reasons.\nB)\t Species impacted by disease should not have species protection removed, unless it is determined by a qualified expert that an individual of that species is already diseased\/unhealthy e.g. Butternut and Butternut canker. While some species at risk are protected for different reasons, removing species that are threatened by disease further impacts their ability to survive.  Similarly, healthy individuals should be protected, especially those that show resistance so as to further provide resiliency for the species.\nC)\tWhile the development of a habitat regulation is a length process, the proposal does not speak to how habitat protection will be completed in the absence of individual habitat regulations.\nD)\tProviding the Minister the rights to make species specific habitat regulations in the absence of science and expert recommendations, impacts the ability to protect the species and allows such protection to become political rather than science based.\n3.  Developing species at risk recovery policies\nD)  Removing the requirement of posting policies, products and changes to the act from the EBR and moving them to an unidentified government website impacts the publics ability to comment and review such changes.\n4.  Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\n Creation of a Regulatory Charge and Agency\n\u2022\tThis part of the proposed changes to the act, is very limited in detail and provides little to the protection of species and instead provides provisions for developers and municipalities to pay for the destruction of species at risk and their habitats.  While it speaks to providing \u201creasonable alternatives\u201d if allows for the bare minimum mitigation and therefor little protection for species at risk.\n\u2022\tSaid agency should also be science based and un-biased and not influenced by politics or economic gain\n\u2022\tWhile the proposal speaks to a conservation trust to benefit the species, a Species at Risk Stewardship Fund and a Species at Risk Research Fund already exist and supports research and on the ground projects to improve species at risk habitat.  Providing a fund that is managed by politicians does not help the protection of the species.\nAdditional changes related to permits etc.\nC)  If public notice is provided regarding listing of species in advance of providing a list to the minister (see comment Section 2A), then an additional 12 months would not be required after listing as proponents would be able to incorporate and begin mitigation prior to the official listings.\n",

Ignoring science-based listing decisions, information and fully rejecting science is nothing short of the worst type of libertarian 'theory' of economics one could possibly imagine. Ontario's greatest economic value is its natural resources, and as with ALL natural resources - when it's gone, it's gone. Biodiversity is essential for all life - including all Ontarians, even Minister Phillips, or anyone who is part of our 'Ford Dynasty' government.

The ecosystem is fragile and must be protected. Even if the government of Ontario doesn't want to protect endangered species because it is the moral thing to do for those animals and future generations of Ontarians, do it for all of us who depend on things like birds and bees to pollinate our food. Do it because protecting habitat protects the environment and our lives. Do it for EVERY PERSON who wants to continue to live. Protections for endangered species should be STRENGTHENED, as should ALL environmental policies. The last endangered species act didn't go far enough in protecting species. Moreover, people or corporations who break them should be held accountable with hefty fines and lengthy jail time. Cutting protections for endangered species is wrong and you know it.

Furthermore I do not think this is in alignment with the Federal Governments commitment to sustainable development.\nGiving the Minister more freedom to make decisions without requiring the consultation of independent experts, to support social and economic development, reduces regulatory transparency and inhibits the voice of the scientific community. More comprehensive and credible decisions are made when feedback from independent experts is incorporated into decisions and made publicly available; It gives the public the ability to understand the impacts from a non-bias perspective. The proposed changes would impact the credibility of the information being provided to the public, therefore reducing their ability to provide meaningful feedback on projects. By removing that step, decisions will likely be short sighted and ineffective.\nWith regards to the criteria for the exemptions proposed, I think it is important to specify who is responsible for deciding if a project meets the criteria or not. It\u2019s my opinion independent experts should be incorporated into this part of the process, to ensure regulatory transparency.\nI also think there are many ethical flaws with the concept of letting corporations pay to kill SAR, and the tradeoff being the implementation of another new provincial agency to manage these transactions.

Firstly, I do not agree with a policy that would allow developers or others with a vested interest in destroying protected land and the vulnerable species that live on it to pay there way out of the situation. This is sending a message to developers (and the citizen's of this province) that it is okay to damage the environment and kill off species in the process IF you are willing to pay for it! My goodness, what year is this? Last time I checked it's 2019 and we are surely more educated and aware of the importance of protecting our collective environmental resources (land, water, air, habitats, species)!! Some things are not for sale. This is one of those items for which there is no appropriate price to pay. Things feels like yet another attempt by greedy developers to get their hands on land that should be protected, not bulldozed!\nSecondly, I read about the numerous changes to how policies will change when interpreting what species should be protected and who will decide. I am concerned about:\n- Species listed as threatened or endangered may no longer be automatically protected.\n- Changes to \u201cedge of range\u201d species means considering populations outside of Ontario when listing a species at risk. This includes many Southern Ontarian species, allowing Ontario to simply opt out of protecting species at home.\n- Opening the scientific committee to non-scientist members. This change could allow people with no knowledge or scientific background to be involved in decisions for species.\n- Giving the Minister the discretion to interfere with the listing of at risk species, bringing politics into the protection of endangered species.\nI vehemently oppose this Ontario government\u2019s shocking and irresponsible proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act. I feel it will effectively remove all safety nets for species at risk in this province and will give industry a free pass to exterminate species in Ontario.\nWe should be strengthening our polices and enforcing rules to protect, not open the flood gates for destruction!\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the ESA are irresponsible, and irreparable. Just because a species is rare in Ontario because it is at it's northern limit or is found elsewhere does not justify removing protection. Don't be so stupid and shortsighted. You are setting us up to lose precious biodiversity, genetic and ecological. (look up the meaning of biodiversity if you are unaware of the implications or reduction to it). Also, adding non-scientists to the COSSARO group is ridiculous. Would you invite a person with no experience in engineering to make decisions on how to engineer your home? Finally, there is no suitable justification for delaying protection for economic reasons. There are already caveats in the law that allow for development to go ahead when necessary (for non-imminent and imminent health and safety reasons), and there is a solid process for developments to get approvals under the current system, that although not ideal as developers are hiring their own biologists to conduct the studies (sort of like letting a fox guard the henhouse), still generally serves to protect species at risk in Ontario to a small degree. The law should actually be stronger, as we are still losing species and habitat at an enormous rate.  There are other ways to support continued economic health. This is completely the wrong thing to do.\n",

The idea of allowing a species to die off in one area simply because you can find an analogous population elsewhere is ridiculous as animals adapt individual traits and speciate locally to become unique.  Darwin's original works proved this centuries ago and as such each population should be considered a unique subset unless proven otherwise with proper scientific rigour.\nThe proposal to Purchase the right to destroy habitat and not provide a suitable rebuilding is also a crime against our responsibility to protect our environment.  Greed and profit should not be the soul driving force of an economy as we are envied world wide for our continued possession of wild spaces which generate tourist income and buffers against environmental change.  While the government struggles to admit that climate change is occurring the protections offered by green space and wetlands offset the dismal efforts of the current administration to hide from the future by burring their heads in how they used to be able to pollute and destroy without concern for the damage they did.\nI hope these thoughts and not the large monies of the corporations guide the reform of this document even as I know that they will have little impact on the amoral greed that is directing the current regime.\n",

The protection of endangered species and all habitat in this area is of the utmost importance. Your short-sighted ideas that destroying these habitats in exchange for short-term development clearly demonstrates the lack of post-secondary education of the premier and those working for him. I am appalled at the current state of my once-beloved province. You better believe if these changes go through the people of the north will not let this go quietly. Everything south of Sudbury has already been destroyed by industrialization, the entire area of southern Ontario is an eye-sore and has been slowly encoraching and impacting the species of this province already much too greatly. I\u2019ve been working for years to protect what little wilderness is left in Northern ontario. If these changes go through there will be massive reprocussions for species that we will never be able to get back.\nPlease at least pretend to have some forethought and I know whoever is reading this is likely facing their own mortality a lot sooner than I, but I still hope you can at least have a drop of empathy in your soul for the rest of the population, especially us youth.

You are placing money over the environment, this is not how the environment can be treated any longer. Endangered areas should be protected, especially from developers who would destroy the local habitat.\nI strongly disagree that the goal of protecting and restoring habitat should be abandoned. This is exactly the opposite of what Ontario should be doing. These habitats provide important ecological services to humans that we as tax payers will have to end up paying. I would much rather my money goes towards protecting and restoring these habitats as opposed to dealing with the consequences of getting rid of them.\nI do not agree that endangered species should not be guaranteed habitat protection. These species play an important role in our food chain. Although it may be hard to see, if a species goes extinct, it can majorly effect the surrounding ecosystems and the food the humans consume. Endangered species should continue to have their habitat protected.\nI STRONGLY disagree that animals should be allowed to be locally extinct as long as they are not extinct on a national scale. If everyone introduced this legislation, then who will take responsibility of taking care of these animals and our ecosystems? We are shifting this responsibility to other provinces and that is a terrible action to take. We are ALL responsible for the health of the climate and our ecosystems.\nFinally, this proposal suggests decrease of transparency of government recovery efforts. Given the previous reasons, I do not trust this government to make the right decisions regarding climate change so I find this deeply disturbing.\nAll signs point to the fact that we HAVE to start taking care of the planet if we want to continue living here. This proposed change does not imply that this is the goal of this government and I am deeply disappointed as a citizen in Ontario.

        "comment":"My wife and I have comments which are provided for each numbered part of the proposal.  I hope you actually read and consider them because we spent quite a while thinking about the issue.  It is very important.\n1.\tAssessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nWe believe that extending the delay for listing of species from three to twelve months is too long when one considers that species may be at critical risk.  Therefore we believe a reasonable compromise would be to extend the listing delay to six months.\nWe agree with the consideration of the distribution of species populations outside of Ontario.\nWe are against including non-experts in COSSARO.  While knowledge of ecology, wildlife management or community is valuable, membership in COSSARO needs to be limited to experts qualified in determining the endangered status of species.  People without those qualifications should not decide on the endangerment of species.  Those subjects (ecology, wildlife management and community knowledge) are appropriate for developing and managing species protections, but those considerations would seem to be independent of the information (i.e., population data) needed to determine species endangerment.\n2.\tDefining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThis seems reasonable except for 2.C.  We do not agree with removing the mandatory requirement and timeline to develop a habitat regulation proposal for newly listed threatened or endangered species and retaining the option to develop a habitat regulation when needed.  Firstly, \u201cwhen needed\u201d is not defined, nor is there any description of how such a determination would be made.  Secondly, it give the option to do nothing, and that is wholly unacceptable.  The proposal introduces more flexibility to develop and implement management plans, and this is reasonable.  What is not reasonable is to have the option of doing nothing.\n3.\tDeveloping species at risk recovery policies\nThis part of the proposal does not put a limit on extending deadlines for developing Government Response Statements or progress reviews, and effectively would allow these deliverables to be put off indefinitely.  Obviously, this cannot an acceptable way to address the needs of threatened or endangered species.  The proposal should be revised to quantify new extended time limits.\nHowever, a five-year review of progress does not seem to us to be unreasonable so we do not understand why the government would need to extend that time limit.\n4.\tIssuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nRegulatory Charge\nTo us, this is the most problematic part of the proposal.  We can envision situations where the type of flexibility described here would be desirable; i.e., projects which have already received investments when a new threatened or endangered species listing is made.  We can also understand the need to balance economic needs with the need to protect species.  A win-win situation would be to allow progress both in economies and species-recovery.  Our concern is that if not managed properly, the proposal can be abused to the detriment of species at risk, and also conceptually the proposal seems flawed.\nThe concern about \u201cabuse\u201d relates to the potential situation of always allowing the payment of the Regulatory Charge because there are no limits mentioned in the proposal.  It seems that underlying this proposal is the flawed assumption that something can always be done elsewhere for a species with the funds obtained from the Regulatory Charge.  Clearly, such as with a limited distribution of a species or the disruption of a migratory route, this cannot always be true.\nThere will be situations for which the payment of the Regulatory Charge, with compensatory species protection and recovery actions elsewhere, may be appropriate, and other situations for which such an arrangement would not be possible.  Therefore, the proposal needs to be amended to include conditions under which the payment of the Regulatory Charge would be allowed and under which it would be prohibited. The proposal needs to be revised to include definite limits to the ability to pay a Regulatory Charge.\nDespite the proposal claiming to use Canadian best practices, the proposed Regulatory Charge, as stated, would be a first for Canada.  To be embark on such a course is risky and should be done very cautiously.  There should be a follow on study to determine the effectiveness of this new scheme, or better yet, some pilot studies should be undertaken to assess the effectiveness before employing the scheme across the province.\nAdditional Changes\nAllowing a transition provision for existing permit or agreement holders to continue to operate for twelve months while the permit or agreement is amended to accommodate a newly-listed species is problematic because irreparable damage could be done to that species during that time.  Twelve months seems like a long time.  A shorter period (e.g., three months) would allow for some flexibility while limiting damage to the newly listed species.\n",

To modernize the SAR act you first have to know that these species are already at risk of extinction due to primarily loss of habitat, mostly through industrialization  forestry and mining and expansion of roads in Ontario's north and wilderness areas. The  protected areas are not geographically limited and all SAR throughout Ontario where this law has jurisdiction should be protected.\nQualified scientists are the authority using science based assessment to determine SAR. What is this \"community knowledge\" proposal for inclusion on the COSSARO? The local lumber company executive? This is not acceptable.\nTo delay listing of SAR, planning for their recovery and reporting on the facts further delays  SAR  protection and habitat renewal, at the front end of the problem.\n Our government needs to get the best scientific evidence from experts before permitting harmful acts and making regulations, not give ministerial discretion. In this government, ministerial discretion  is to rubber stamp forestry, mining and industrial roads to accommodate their needs which further destroys habitat.\nIn this era of devastation due to climate change, green house gas emissions, decline of biodiversity and the anthropocene, there is no room for exemptions from regulations that try to protect and restore SAR. The exemptions already in place are too extensive to allow this act to protect SAR.\nClients of this act are the SAR, not the  corporate clients of this government. Once again your streamlining favours developers and industry, not the People of Ontario and the necessity of all of us to protect and promote biodiversity .To allow Clients\/applicants\/industry\/developers\/ to pay to be allowed to expand their ruin on our SAC habitat is simply outrageous and unconscionable. And this by a government who spends $30,000,000  tax dollars  to sue about cap and trade? Really!\nThe SAR Act should be the primary legislation to protect SAR and enable their habitat to recover. Activities should not be allowed  under other legislation that would not be allowed under this act.\nEconomic considerations to postpone or deny protection should not take priority over protecting our SAR. The dollar is not the priority on the devastation of our environment and the nature we are all a part of.\nIf this government is truly of and for the PEOPLE of Ontario, and not corporate interests, it will withdraw this harmful legislative proposal forthwith.\n",

        "comment":"I am very concerned about proposed changes to ESA.  It seems to me that the main theme of the changes is that Ontario government wants to give too much decision making responsibility to the minister.  Ministers typically do not have a background or understanding of ecology and therefore will have difficulty making decisions that truly benefit the species.  Furthermore ministers are changed frequently through cabinet shuffles and therefore I fear new species will not get listed when a new minister is trying to get 'up to speed' with their new portfolio.  The extra timelines and ministerial discretion will mean that there will be considerable delays in species listings, habitat protections and recovery strategies.   Some specific comments:\n1A - minister should have no more than 6 months to make listings public.\n1E - a species status in jurisdictions outside of Ontario should not overide their status here.   If species is  legitimately at serious risk in Ontario, it should receive protection here, irrespective.\n1F - someone with community knowledge but limited understanding of species or ecological principles should not be accepted into COSSARO.  Appropriate expertise is needed.\n2A - 3 years is much too long to suspend habitat protection, species may go extinct with such lagged timelines\n2A iii (4) - \"other criteria\"  this caveat leaves it too wide open.  New species may never receive protection with such an open ended clause.\n3 - allowing minister to significantly extend the timing requirements and relegating recovery strategies as merely \"advice to government\" will likely not give sufficient protection to species.\n4 - Permits.  This sounds like developers and municipalities will be able to get out of having to protect species or even need to complete necessary studies by paying into a conservation fund.\nOntario has an exemplary Endangered Species Act, that although not perfect, is offering a lot of protection to species and has slowed down the decline of many listed species.  I fear that the proposed changes will water it down too much and provide many loopholes that will make the Act largely ineffective.\n",

        "comment":"Good morning. I would like to draw attention to a logistical problem with the proposal pertaining to exemptions. See my comments below.\nThe proposal describes the following exemption:\n\"The proposed changes would provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species when the following specified criteria are met:\"\nBy what expertise will the Minister assess whether the conditions are met? These criteria are entirely subjective and there are no checks and balances guiding the Minister's decision.\n\"1) applying the prohibitions to the species would likely have significant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario so additional time is required to determine the best approach to protect the species and its habitat;\"\nLosing or endangering a species is an invaluable loss and the ecological implications outweigh social \/ economic factors. That's why we have the concept of \"endangered species:\" to remember to prioritize them.\n\"2) the temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario;\"\nIf that were truly the case then that species would not be endangered. Can you name a single example where this exemption is logically consistent and sound?\n\"and 3) one of the following further criteria is met:\n 3a) the species has a broad distribution in the wild in Ontario;\n3b) habitat availability is not a limiting factor for the species;\n3c) additional time is needed to address the primary threats to the species, or co-operation with other jurisdictions is necessary to reduce the primary threats to the species,\n3d) other criteria that may be specified by regulation.\"\nThere are major problems with 3c and 3d.\nIn the case of 3c, for any species that has already reached such a critical level of threat as to be listed as endangered, all protections to their habitat and ecological network must be implemented urgently. It's ignorant and ineffective to note that a species is endangered and wait three years before enforcing protections. Three years is several lifetimes or an entire generation for some species and this exemption will allow the Minister to delay protections, on a whim or due to pressures from biased parties, until it is far too late. As for criteria 3d, that point opens this proposal to all sorts of undemocratic, corruptions, unfounded activity. Any Minister with any level of interest can choose to create exemptions whenever and for whatever reason she chooses. That's irresponsible and destructive.\nIf this proposal goes forward you will lose much more than the respect and trust of your voters. I look forward to hearing that either several key changes have been made or that this absurd, in-useable, ill-advised and short-sighted proposal has been abandoned. Thank you for your consideration.\n",

        "comment":"Note:   Same information already submitted in the area that does not require registration so our names are removed from this version to allow publication.\nRod Phillips\nMinister of Environment, Conservation, and Parks\nAgain we write to you about the conservation and restoration of the Lake Superior caribou.  Today our concern is that your proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (the Act) will obstruct efforts to conserve and restore this caribou population.\nOur concerns are also broader than just caribou and just Ontario.  Your changes will also have potentially serious detrimental effects on all the other species in Ontario that are at risk of extinction.  Your approach could also become a template for other governments to weaken their legislation, and thereby continue to allow the decline of caribou and many other species over a large part of Canada.  This is not a legacy to leave.\nMost of your proposed changes significantly weaken the Act and need to be removed.  As it stands now the changes do not appropriately protect species at risk of extinction in Ontario \u2013 so the revised Endangered Species Act will not fulfil its purpose.  However, we encourage you to start again with an approach that will effectively conserve and restore these species.  The best way to reduce conflicts between development and species at risk of extinction is to get those species off that list and manage our lands and waters to keep them from getting on the list in the first place.\nThis letter is also our comment on the Environmental Registry of Ontario posting of your proposed changes.  We will be sending it to other people as well.\nOur concerns are:\n1.\tAssessing and listing species at risk:\n-\tTiming:   A to D -  These changes seem to be designed to just delay the listing of species and therefore delay the application of protections for these species.  The obvious problem with this is that it would allow people to destroy the species or their habitats, for whatever their reason, before the legal protection for the species comes into effect.  This is clearly a huge loophole in your proposed legislation and needs to be removed.\n-\tGeographic considerations:   E -  This change ignores both principle geographic mechanisms of species loss:\n-\tLoss from the periphery -   One of the main principles of conservation ecology is that the process of species extinction is the loss of individual populations.  These losses of populations often start in the periphery of the species range where the conditions for their survival are less suitable or their habitat is less abundant than in the core of their range.  It would be the case for many species that populations in parts of their range are endangered while the species as a whole might be threatened or even doing well.  For example, southern Ontario is very heavily developed in terms of agriculture and urbanization, and many species that occur there are now endangered.  They may be less endangered in other parts of their range, but that doesn\u2019t help them in Ontario.  The loss of their peripheral range in Ontario is one step in the progression to extinction from their entire range.  As a Province, we should be keeping all of our native flora and fauna as part of their total range and resilience.  This can best be done by placing all species in their most appropriate protection category for the conditions here.\n-\tLoss from the core -  Population losses can also start at the core of the species range if changes to conditions there become detrimental to that species.  Climate change would be one example of this.  For example, there are many species endangered and threatened with extinction in southern Ontario that have the core of their range further south in the United States.  However, if climate warming makes these core areas unsuitable, then the cooler periphery areas to the north in Ontario will become very important to these species.  It is incumbent on us not to preclude the ability of these species to continue to exist by allowing them to disappear from Ontario now.  There may be good populations of these species in areas outside of Ontario now, but that may not be the case in very few years.\nThis proposal of diverting the focus from Ontario must be dropped to prevent range retraction from the periphery and provide future core range for species at risk of extinction.  Species conservation and restoration requires an inter-jurisdictional, holistic approach to be successful.\n2.\tSpecies and habitat protections:\n-\tProtection suspensions:   A -  The 3 year delay in protecting species or their habitat is inappropriate.  Another basic principle of conservation is the need for immediate and decisive action.  By the time a species has been designated as at risk of extinction it is already in tough shape.  Any further delay is likely to worsen its condition.  The conditions for suspensions are equally problematic:\n-\ti :   Socio-economic impact -  The problems facing the species affected will not be suspended while socio-economic impact is mitigated.\n-\tii :   Provincial survival -  Again, the importance of retaining all local populations as the key to preventing range retraction and eventual extinction is dismissed.\n-\tiii :   1.  Distribution -  Again, dismisses the importance of all local populations.\niii :   2.  Habitat availability -  This is of no importance if the individuals or habitat destroyed are in the only area occupied by the species.\niii :   3.  More time required -  Apply protection in the interim.  When the primary threats to the species are not addressed, the losses from secondary threats are even more important.\nThese suspensions put effective conservation at risk and should be dropped.\n-\tSpecies protection scoping:   B -  If a species is at risk of extinction, all the individuals should be protected regardless of where they occur.  Here again there seems to be a desire to relax protection in places where the species is still holding its own.  Using the precautionary principle of conservation, all populations of the species should be protected until recovery of the species is achieved.  The species are listed because they are declining or they are already very low in number.  There is no room for further declines.  Therefore scoping for protection should not occur.\n-\tTimeline removal:   C -  This could easily result in delays that prevent the necessary habitat protection of a species at risk.  This is an inappropriate way to address the urgency of conserving species at risk of extinction and should be dropped.\n3.\tRecovery policies:\n-\tTime extensions:   A and C -  These are additional potential delays for conservation action to protect a species that might be in urgent need of protection.  All species at risk of extinction deserve prompt action and regular review.  These changes should be removed.\n-\tRecovery strategies vs. Government Response Statements:   B -  Why not just adopt the recovery strategy as the government policy direction?  This would be a huge savings in time and effort.\nEnvironmental Bill of Rights (EBR) vs. website:   D -  What is wrong with posting in both places to provide wider notification?  It is the same information and requires little additional effort.  It must be noted that posting on the EBR allows people to look in one place for proposed changes to legislation rather than having to search the websites of all government Ministries and Agencies for changes that might affect them.  This change needs to be removed and EBR posting retained.\n4.\tPermits, Agreements, Exemptions:\n-\tSpecies at Risk Conservation Trust:   This approach runs against one of the basic principles of species conservation.  Species at risk are often so designated because their habitat has been reduced to the point where it cannot support enough individuals to ensure the species can continue to exist.  This means that the habitat where they exist now could be the last of their habitat and essential to their future existence.  Because this habitat is still occupied, it is also by definition the best of what remains for those species \u2013 so it is invaluable to them.  It is therefore the most important habitat to retain to protect these species.  It is inappropriate to allow this best habitat to be destroyed in exchange for a fee.  It is very risky to assume that equivalent quality habitat can be created elsewhere and that it will be occupied by that species \u2013 an additional risk that should not be put on a species already at risk of extinction.  The appropriate approach would be to maintain the existing habitat and try to create new habitat elsewhere to begin restoring the species \u2013 not trade off the best habitat for a fee.  This \u201cextirpation expense\u201d needs to be halted.\n-\tNew approach:   You state:  \u201cThis new approach will give greater certainty to business and better enable positive outcomes for species at risk compared to the current piece-meal industry-led approach.\u201d  Again the focus of this legislation must be the protection of species at risk of extinction.  But if this is not happening now with the current piecemeal approach, then strong measures to protect and restore these species need to be implemented.  It is inappropriate to just change the Act to facilitate business and weaken the protection for the species affected by this development.\n-\tExpert consultation:   A -  Why would the Minister not want to consult with experts about something that he\/she is not knowledgeable about?  This needs to be removed.\n-\tSpecies vs. individual focus:   B -  Here again, this approach violates basic principles of conservation.  Again, the process of extinction is the loss of individual populations, and this extirpation of populations is through the loss of individuals.  It has already been determined that all the species on the species at risk list are headed for extinction if we do not intervene to protect them.  Your proposal implies that a population or number of individuals would be allowed to be extirpated as long as other populations continue to exist.  By extension, that could carry on until only one remnant group is left \u2013 hardly the desired result of legislation that should be conserving and restoring these species.  The appropriate conservation approach is to protect all remaining populations to prevent range retraction and eventual extinction.  The restoration approach, which is what we should be taking for all species at risk of extinction, is to protect all remaining populations and expand their range to get them off the SAR list.  This species approach needs to be removed and the individual approach retained.\n-\tTransition provision:   C -  Again, this is just another delay and weakening as discussed in the very first point.  This needs to be removed.\n-\tLandscape agreement:   E -  Again, this appears to be similar to the other changes that advocate relying on the species existence in other areas.  This does not fit with standard conservation principles for species at risk of extinction.  The conditions for these agreements are also problematic:\n-\tspecies at risk should not be adversely affected \u2013 reasonable steps to minimize adverse effects is not enough;\n-\tall species at risk should benefit \u2013 not just some species;\n-\talternatives that would not adversely affect the species at risk must be implemented \u2013 it is not enough just to consider them;\n-\tbeneficial actions must outweigh adverse effects for each species \u2013 not just in aggregate.\n-\tReplacing Section 18:   F -  This appears to be just a way to weaken and circumvent the regular process to protect species at risk of extinction in Ontario.  This has a strong likelihood of being less effective and should be removed.\n5.\tEnforcement:\n-\tEnhance and streamline:   A -  The changes proposed in the second point in this section are not clear.\n-\tEnforcement officers:   B -  Conservation Officers must continue to be able to enforce the act.\n-\tExemption from EBR posting:   This appears to be just hiding the suspension of protections from the public.  The last sentence could be translated as:  \u201cThis is being proposed in to preserve the ability of the Minister to act swiftly and facilitate associated impacts on species at risk.\u201d  As with our very first point, this needs to be removed.\nOverall:\nOne of the main purposes of having laws is protection.  They are often geared to the protection of people and their property, but in the last decades we are moving to protect other things.  These other things include the animals we live with or use; the land and water we rely on for food and a wide range of social, cultural, and economic benefits; and also those species in the world that are not doing well in our presence.  Laws are also often designed to protect the vulnerable in our society and the vulnerable things in our world that are important to us.  This is the purpose of the Endangered Species Act \u2013 it is to protect those plants and animals that are most vulnerable to our activities.  The purpose of the Endangered Species Act must not be to give a leg up to individuals and corporations to destroy these species or their habitats.  You need to start again and look at things from the point of view of those vulnerable species that are endangered and threatened with extinction, not from the point of view of the people who want to destroy the last places where those species exist.\nYou are to be commended for reviewing this legislation.  However, the purpose of a review is to improve  -not to make worse - the thing you are reviewing.  As citizens of Ontario, we want all of our species at risk of extinction to be conserved, restored, and eventually come off that list.  What you have proposed will not do that and will facilitate their continued demise.  We can safely predict that the list of species at risk of extinction will continue to grow and that the conservation status of the species on that list will only be downgraded.  This whole process needs to be halted now and resumed with the objective of successfully conserving and restoring all the species at risk of extinction in Ontario to the point where an Endangered Species Act is not required.\nEven though you had consultation, your proposed changes clearly show that you did not get or heed advice from experts in the field of conservation.  This is surprising, because you have people in your Ministry who administer your species at risk program now and should be experts in that field \u2013 were they not consulted?  Legislation needs to be effective for the purpose it is drafted.  You need to get broad expert advice on how best to conserve Ontario\u2019s species at risk of extinction for the Endangered Species Act to fulfil its purpose.  Would you not seek out experts in health for health legislation, or other experts for legislation affecting their fields?\nYour government has quickly developed a reputation for being anti-environment and pro-development.  We do not think this dichotomy is necessary, and we do not think that is the legacy you want to leave your family or your fellow citizens.  Development can still occur where species at risk are not present, or in ways that do not extirpate them.  But it is also important to recognize that many species at risk cannot survive in the face of development, and the remaining habitats of these species need to be protected.  There are ways to mitigate these conflicts when they do occur, and your revised Endangered Species Act should consider measures to do that.  For example, it would be very beneficial to have an aggressive program of land acquisition for critical species at risk habitat before development pressures reach these areas.  Similarly, there should be an acquisition fund to acquire land that people later find they cannot develop.  These acquisitions of high-value ecological lands would be a tremendous legacy for your government to leave to Ontarians now and to future generations.\nIn conclusion, many of the changes you propose to the Endangered Species Act do not fulfil the purpose of the Act, which is to protect species at risk of extinction in Ontario.  These changes need to be abandoned.  However, there is a need to improve the Endangered Species Act and we encourage you to do so.  There are ways to better protect species at risk of extinction and their habitats and mitigate any impacts on people.  We can live sustainably on this planet and we need to start doing that.  Making an effective Endangered Species Act is one place to start.\n",

        "comment":"Hello,\nI do not agree with the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act. I have many thoughts and I will list my top concerns for you.\nThe minister should have limited to zero discretion when making decisions regarding species-at-risk. If the minister is capable of overriding the input given by independent, third party scientists...then what is the point of consulting them? I would think, especially in this case (where the minister has no academic background in Biology or Ecology), he would appreciate advice given by qualified professionals in relevant fields of biology, ecology, and conservation.\n\"The proposed changes would also authorize the creation of a new board-governed provincial agency. The agency would receive the funds and ensure informed, unbiased and expert decisions are made to disburse the funds to third parties that will undertake the activities in accordance with the purposes proposed to be set out in the statute. The proposed amendment would restrict the funds to fund only those activities that are reasonably likely to support the protection and recovery of prescribed species. The Minister would have the ability to establish guidelines (e.g. objectives and priorities) for funding and set standards for activities that receive funding.\"\nIf the minister has the ability to establish guidelines, then how are we to guarantee that he chooses guidelines that encourage the perpetuation of endangered species?\nFurther, the Minister should have zero input into classifying species. He should also not be able to suspend the classification of species under any circumstances. (Perhaps, if I was not so certain that the minister was so biased towards industrial and commercial industries, I could understand giving the minister more discretion, but given the actions of the Conservation government, I am inclined to believe this discretion is only suggested so that the minister may do as he wants and destroy any potential for our children to experience and know Canada's native biodiversity).\nUnder no circumstances should any business or company be able to buy their way into destroying habitat for species-at-risk. The minister and the premier should be ashamed of themselves to even consider it.\nExtending the review period from 3 months to 12 months may mean the difference between perpetuation and extirpation\/extinction of a species.\n\"E.\tRequire COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened. If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition.\"\nAs a biologist in southern Ontario, it is apparent to me that this suggested change specifically targets species in southern Canada that exist in the northernmost part of their range, like five-lined skinks and blue racers. If the minister and the premier had done their research (see why I do not trust the minister's discretion?), they would know that the Canadian populations of these species represent the most hardy of their species, as they are able to tolerate Canada's tougher climate. Ensuring the survival of the Canadian populations of these species strengthens the entire geographic population, especially as we enter an era of changing climate and weather patterns.\nEtc, etc, etc.\nMy preference would be to see the ESA remain as it has since its inception.\nThank you for your time and attention. I sincerely hope the minister and premier reconsider their proposed changes. Their recommendations reflect the \"here and now\", and the ESA should consider not only the species of today, but the species of tomorrow.  The actions of humans caused the decline of all Ontario's endangered species, and it is our duty and responsibility to ensure we do everything we can to improve their odds of survival.\n",

        "comment":"Under the new law, industry will be able to pay a fee instead of doing their part to protect species that will be killed or have their habitats destroyed by the project. The government\u2019s statements that funds could be used for research on how to protect the species elsewhere is a non-starter, as we know that habitat loss and degradation is the number one reason species are ending up endangered in the first place. This provision will give the green light to irreparable habitat destruction.\nIf a species exists elsewhere the world, they could no longer be protected in Ontario. In the new rules, if a species has healthy populations elsewhere, we might stop protecting them in Ontario even if they are extremely endangered here. This change will have devastating consequences for migratory animals, and many who live in Southern Ontario at the northern extent of their range. This will lead to species not only being lost to the province (and on the path to extinction), but will also reduce their genetic diversity and resilience at the population level, further exacerbating the global biodiversity crisis. Globally, we\u2019re losing species at a rate 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate, with 30 to 50 per cent of all species on the track to extinction before mid-century.\nUnder the ESA, important decisions about which plants and animals are at risk, and their category of risk (whether threatened or endangered), is made by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO). The committee is made up of expert scientists, and those with aboriginal traditional ecological knowledge.\nUnder the new rules, COSSARO membership will be opened up to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d. This means individuals with no background in ecology or endangered species would be allowed to sit on the committee. We know from comments made by the Mayor of South Bruce Peninsula that there are unqualified people who\u2019d relish the opportunity to kick species off the endangered species list and influence decisions on COSSARO. COSSARO must remain a science-based decision making body and not be opened to those representing industry or those who dismiss the findings of scientific research and ecology.\nFinally, the new rules allow the Minister to halt protections for newly listed endangered species for up to 3 years to allow projects to go ahead without having to worry about the endangered plants and animals in their way. This change effectively makes species protection a political decision, and if an animal is discovered as critically endangered in the path of a project, delaying action for 3 years could mean they\u2019re gone from Ontario or even go extinct before we even try to save them.\n",

        "comment":"I understand some of these proposed amendments. For instance being able to delay the protections (although 3 years seems like a significant delay), while current business owners work to address concerns over newly listed species. But I can not get over the pay your way out of \/ in lieu of protections.\nThis is dangerous and has shown to not work effectively in the past. When it comes down to it I believe most Project proponents would be inclined to pay a one time or multi year penalty to have a species at risk issue overlooked then have to follow through with remediation or monitoring commitments. If this becomes standard practice species at risk will suffer (more then they currently are).\nEven if the fines\/payments are collected by our government, and somehow effectively utilized (not a specialty of the Government whether Conservative or Liberally run). The fines would have to be large enough to cover the costs of some type of remediation\/compensation, and the ongoing monitoring to ensure whatever remediation is serving the purpose to carry on the current level of species protection. In general, it would be cheaper for the Project owner to carry out this work by hiring a private consultant to carry out this work, as opposed to paying the government to get it done (again running\/spending efficiently is not a specialty of the government). If the fines\/payments are not suitably large to fulfill all the necessary work, either tax payers will be required to pay the remainder or the Species will ultimately receive reduced or no protection (more likely).\nOverall this change will reduce the effectiveness of the legislation at fulfilling its purpose, protecting endangered and threatened species. A tradeoff for some potential marginal economic benefits.\n",

If there are too many concerns about a proposed project, and if it is too complex, extensions should not be granted at the minister's discretion. Simply put, the project should be stopped. For example, when an application is made for a permit to mine or extract minerals, especially when critical habitat will be destroyed (ie., provincially significant wetlands) the permit should be denied with no Overall Benefit Permit allowed. After all, to protect a species means to protect its habitat not to allow the destruction of it.\n",

It is absolutely unacceptable to accept any form of payment in lieu of protecting vulnerable species or the habitat they require. It is also unacceptable to grant discretion to override environmental protection to a single person, even if that person is the minister (MECP). Not requiring advice from experts ensures that the Minister will make uninformed choices. Adding members to COSSARO who will not necessarily have any scientific knowledge of the species or habitat in question is simply ludicrous and cannot be justified.\nThis proposal is not the route to economic prosperity. Previous governments have dug a deep financial hole that limits the current government's ability to achieve fiscally responsible budgets. That is understood by most, however attempting to balance the books on the backs of the most endangered species and habitats is not the answer.

The outcome from this review will prove to be critical for the future health and viability of the Ontario Forestry Industry.\nMcRae Lumber Company was started in 1885 and I am currently the 5th generation of my family to operate the business. We currently employ 65 people in the mills and have another 40 contractors in the forest operations. A high percentage of our employees identify as first nations, and our employees form the backbone of our small community.\nOur company has been a proud part of Ontario\u2019s Forest Industry for the past 134 years. We have survived depressions and recessions, world wars and fires. Throughout, we have maintained our commitment to sustainable forestry and our community. We have long since learned that proper forest management can provide a balance between environmental, social and economic interests. With a holistic broad-based approach to forest management, we can have a forest with high levels of ecological integrity that is still able to provide recreational opportunities, wood products for the forest industry and jobs for the local communities.\nThe Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) is a fantastic example of legislation that looks at the forest as a whole and manages on a macro scale.  The ESA works in the opposite fashion; it manages on a micro scale and in my opinion has a hard time seeing the forest for the trees.\nOnce again I would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper, ERO number 013-4143. We look forward to working with your government to improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and ensure a balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy.\nThe most important action the government must take is a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This can be accomplished through a permanent Section 55 Regulation. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.\nOnce this essential first step has been accomplished, we must also ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:\n1.\tConsideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy\n2.\tCumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy\n3.\tSocio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented\nIt is our understanding that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) is responsible for species at risk prescriptions currently being delivered under the CFSA. It is our expectation that unworkable prescriptions will be addressed and improved regardless of any future changes made to the ESA.\nFurther, we remain extremely concerned about role of the Federal Government and potential negotiations with Ontario on Conservation Agreements. For example, a MNRF socio-economic analysis determined that up to 2800 jobs could be lost and 8 mills could close as a result of the province meeting the federal disturbance thresholds for caribou. It is our expectation that Ontario will consult with us well in advance of any draft and will not enter into a Conservation Agreement with the Federal Government that will result in lost jobs and lost opportunity. It is also important to note, that this socio-economic analysis was only completed on one species and there are currently 100+ species on the listing.\nThe government must decide: how important are the over 57,000 direct jobs to the province, how important are Northern and Rural Ontario, how important are sustainable and locally produced wood products?\nWhen answering these questions it is also equally important to remember that none of these questions has to come at the expense of our forests, our wildlife or our species at risk. The CFSA manages for all wildlife, including species at risk, and has been doing so for over 25 years.\nIn order to avoid serious socio-economic impacts, we need permanent recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy, and sending a strong message to the Federal government that Ontario will manage our own resources.\nI would like to thank you very much again for the opportunity to comment on an issue that is of critical importance to not only my company but the entire forestry sector. The ESA is the one issue that can truly make or break Ontario\u2019s Forest Industry.\nSincerely,\nJamie McRae\nMcRae Lumber Company\nWhitney, Ontario\n",

Overall, I am disappointed in this change.  As you will likely know, the David Suzsuki Foundation (https:\/\/davidsuzuki.org\/), World Wildlife Fund (WWF)  (http:\/\/www.wwf.ca\/newsroom\/?29421\/Species-at-risk-habitat-shouldnt-be-o\u2026), and many local organizations (such as local branches of DUCKS Unlimited, GreenUP, and others) throughout Ontario have all spoken out about the danger of habitat loss, degradation, and the consequences of removing legislative projects for wildlife.\nThe alterations suggested will place the more than 230 species in Ontario are currently at risk in significant danger.  As you will also note, The Endangered Species Act already provides significant exemptions to industry. In a time where Ontario, and our neighbours in Quebec, are facing significant flooding that will alter the habitat for years to come it is important to place environment and green-planning at the heart of all of our economic development decisions. Any government that fails to recognize sustainable planning, environmental protections, and our wildlife and habitat at the centre of its economic development plan fails to understanding the critical and valuable relationship of the economy and our environment.\nI, therefore, am asking you to:\n- Prioritize the recovery of at-risk species over the demands of developers.\n- Repeal the industry exemptions under section 55.\n- Ensure that habitat is protected and restored to facilitate species recovery, instead of merely mitigating the adverse impacts of harmful activities.\nI am all for supporting economic development in our region this, however, must not come at the cost of our climate, our planet, and our wildlife diversity.

This is not okay.\nThe current actions and wait times for permits are there to make sure that there are no concerns upon building in certain areas and for a good  reason; to protect our at risk species.\nMaybe instead of being paid off by funds  to let people build in at risk areas or any areas for that matter, there could be a fee to put a rush on permits to assess locations faster,  but not to overlook the protections that are currently in place.\nI also don't agree with slowing down the process of making something an at risk species. By making it harder to classify such beings makes it easier for developers to swoop in and not care what beings get wiped out before they can be classified properly.  We don't know how fast something can change in the environment and cause a species to become endangered or at risk. There should be no time line on that classification as things are constantly changing and these species may already be at risk of becoming endangered or extirpated. Ontario has the best protection for at risk species in all of Canada, and we the people want to keep it that way!\nI feel like the environment and at risk areas are not being taken seriously with these proposed changes and it needs to be looked at more closely and maybe with more input from  provincial biologists, relevant ministries and conservation authorities.\nThank you for reading.\n",

I feel being financially healthy is a necessary step to fund other key programs such as education and health care.  And having strong and growing businesses are key to the vitality of our population, and future generations.\nThat said, there is something even more important : leaving a healthy planet for our children and future generations.  We have one planet.  If we screw it up, no amount of cash will be able to fix it.\nTo note - I share your parties' concern regarding the federal carbon tax.  It is a regressive tax, and will not help drive significant consumption reductions.\nHowever, I have grave concern over these proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act in Ontario.   I have read the text of the proposed changes in detail.  It is clear to me that they will very significantly reduce protections, to the point of making the existing Act virtually useless.   I have listened to attempts to explain how the changes would actually help endangered species, but find those attempts disingenuous.\nHow can allowing developers and municipalities to pay a fee to bypass protections help endangered species.  (That is certainly what the proposed changes will allow, despite claims to the contrary.   From the proposed changes, literally: \"allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act\".)\nThe proposed changes will also negate protection for species that are endangered in Ontario but not elsewhere.  That is, we will allow our habitats to be destroyed and species to become extinct in Ontario just because they are not (yet) endangered elsewhere.    This can only be described as short-sighted and irresponsible.\nAnd, the proposed changes extend the time from when a species is classified as 'at risk' to when the species becomes protected by the act, from 3 months to years.  Currently, an independent (non-political) group of experts classifies species at risk.  Once a species is classified as at risk, the species becomes protected within 3 months.  The proposal extends this time to 12 months, and allows the Ontario Minister of the Environment to use his\/her discretion to ask the group of experts to 'reconsider' their classification, effectively extending that 3 month period to multiple years, and introducing a risk of political and lobbying interests to dominate decisions.\nIt is not my style to be emotional or to make threats.   But in this case, it is difficult to avoid.  I am currently doing everything I can to educate other Ontarians on these proposed changes.   If the proposed changes are enacted without significant changes, I will do everything I can to vote a party in, in our next election, which will take a more responsible attitude towards the health of our planet and environment.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to you to express my deep concern regarding the proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) regulations. The Progressive Conservative government appears to care more about short-term gain than safeguarding our province's biodiversity and the environment which all Ontarians depend on.\nThe ESA exists to protect and recover species facing extinction in Ontario; it is already weak and allows harm to be caused to species at risk. The Progressive Conservation government is wasting an opportunity to strengthen its implementation by proposing these changes during its 10-year review.\nThe EBR exists to protect the environmental rights of Ontarians and enable us to participate in environmental decision-making. By taking our right to be notified and participate in decisions to remove, reduce or pause protection for endangered and threatened species, you are undermining the value we place on our environment. This is unacceptable.\nSpecifically, I oppose the following amendments presented in this posting:\n1. A) Extending the timeline between the Ministry receiving a COSSARO report and legal listing of assessed species from 3 months to 12 months;\nD) Allowing the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species where the Minister forms the opinion based on scientific information that the classification is no longer appropriate;\nE) Requiring COSSARO to adjust a species' classification to reflect its overall condition across all jurisdictions if it exists beyond Ontario;\n2. A) Decoupling the listing process from automatic protection, allowing the Minister to suspend the protection that should be afforded to threatened and endangered species;\nB) Limiting species protection via \"scoping\" with the Minister's discretion;\nC) Removing the mandatory legislative requirement and timeline to develop a habitat regulation proposal for each newly-listed threatened or endangered species;\nD) Enabling the Minister, rather than LGIC, to make species-specific habitat regulations;\n3. A) Giving the Minister discretion to extend the 9-month Government Response Statement development timeline for some species;\nC) Allowing the Minister to extend timelines for conducting the review of progress towards protection and recovery based on individual species\u2019 needs;\nD) Removing specific reference to posting under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993 and instead requiring that certain products under the Act be made available publicly on a government website;\n4. Creating the Species At Risk Conservation Trust, and the regulatory charge that applicants seeking to destroy species at risk habitat will pay;\nA) Removing the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert in the \u2018D\u2019 permit process and replacing the requirement for LGIC approval with Minister approval;\nB) Broadening the approach to minimize adverse effects for permits and agreements to ignore risk to individuals rather than whole species at risk;\nC) Providing a new transition provision for existing Endangered Species Act permit-and agreement-holders to continue to operate for twelve months following the application of new species or habitat protections;\nE) Creating a new landscape agreement for clients to use to destroy species at risk habitat;\nF) Weakening the test for a s. 18 provision;\nG) Removing the requirement for the Minister to consult with an expert if the Minister forms the opinion that a proposed regulation is likely to jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario or to have any other significant adverse effect on the species.\nI oppose any amendment to the EBR that reduces our rights to be notified or consulted with for any environmental decision-making.\nClearly these amendments serve to open up species at risk habitat to development and destruction, and remove protections of the imperiled species themselves so that special interests will not be punished for killing them. There are also serious and transparent attempts to undermine science as part of the listing and protections process in these amendments.\nI urge you to abandon the above amendments and strengthen the implementation of the ESA in the following ways:\nA) Repeal the exemptions created in 2013 to permit forestry, hydro and mining industries to conduct activities that negatively impact species at risk;\nB) Repeal the exemption created in 2016 to allow hunting and trapping of the threatened Algonquin wolf;\nC) Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and\/or recovery of endangered and threatened species;\nD) Amend the ESA so that all permits that allow habitat or species destruction pass the overall benefit test, and are monitored and enforced to ensure the benefits support species at risk recoveries.\nProtecting Ontario's endangered species is vital to the future of our province's biodiversity, the health of our environment, and the ecosystem services which all Ontarians rely on. I feel very strongly about this issue and that the new proposals that are being made to these acts are so detrimental to our environment . I will be monitoring this important issue closely.\n",

While I appreciate the need to encourage development, we can\u2019t do so at the expense of habitat and wildlife, or soon we will have nothing left. Limits must be set. Businesses of the future will demand healthy, thriving ecosystems in which to function. By opening for business at any expense, we will soon be paying the ultimate price through destruction of the nature that sustains us.\nI, therefore, am asking you to:\n- Prioritize the recovery of at-risk species over the demands of developers.\n- Repeal the industry exemptions under section 55.\n- Ensure that habitat is protected and restored to facilitate species recovery, instead of merely mitigating the adverse impacts of harmful activities.\nA strong Endangered Species Act will mean a stronger Ontario now and in the future.\n",

        "comment":"The creation of a \"Species at Risk Conservation Trust\" to allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act is a disgusting way of skipping regulations that have been put in place for the protection of our SAR species.\nWith these changes, developers (Aka friends of Doug Ford) will be able to pay-in-leu of needing to conduct on the ground surveys, which provide several jobs for ecologists such as myself. So yet another change that will lead to the loss of jobs within Ontario, specifically in the environmental field.\nIf \"the price for the payment-in-lieu (i.e. regulatory charge) will be within the range of costs that a client would have otherwise incurred through meeting the species-based conditions of an authorization\" then there would be absolutely no reason for developers to have to take the extra time and risk what these current on-the-ground monitoring requirements would uncover in order for them to be approved for development. Therefore, I believe that no developer\/client would be choosing to take the path of conducting these on-the-ground surveys, therefore the protection of our SAR species would be compromised.\nFurthermore, looking at if SAR species have higher and more stable populations in other geographical areas should NOT be a deciding factor in if they deserve protection under the Act. Just because they are not in danger in other areas, does not mean that we don't need to protect them in others. That is ridiculously short-sighted. EVERY species plays a vital role in the ecosystem, if we stop protecting ones that have populations elsewhere, we will continue on a slippery slope to losing many, if not all, eventually.\nTherefore, I am STRONGLY against the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act as proposed by the current provincial government that will destroy our species and the jobs that are there to protect them.\n",

        "comment":"I am definitely against the proposed changes to the Species at Risk act. This new legislation provides the Minister overreaching powers to avoid and delay protection of a species to the point where its habitat could be destroyed through development.\nThe Minister can delay protection by asking the experts on COSSARO to reconsider their listing decisions if the Minister believes that the listing is no longer appropriate.  The experts on the committee tend to be leading scientists in their field, therefore why would a Minister have greater expertise?\nThe Ford government wants to remove species from the list if their population is not threatened in other areas of Ontario\/North America. This action does not acknowledge that habitat loss is the primary reason for species extinction and that if a population is in decline in one area \u2013 it is in decline \u2013 period. Proposing protection only at a critical point \u2013 when the species is on the brink, is unscientific and ridculous.\nThe COSSARO members will also be \u2018dumbed down\u2019 by including members outside the fields of expertise such as community members. Community members are not defined but it is reasonable to assume given the direction of this new legislation that \u2018community members\u2019 will include industry, sport hunters and farmers \u2013 interests that are self-serving rather than an arms-length unbiased approach.  It also does not provide a ratio of community members to experts.\nThese changes are very dangerous for species at risk. No one so ignorant should have any authority to decide which species have biological value and which ones can go extinct.  This new legislation will allow the Minister to override COSSARO\u2019s listing, forcing the committee to delist any species whose population is not threatened in other areas of Ontario.\nMoreover, this will give the Minister supreme authority over the Species at Risk Act and since the authority is being shifted from COSSARO to the Minister, there will be less transparency, as some Minister decisions will no longer be posted on the Environmental Bill of Rights Registry.\nI sincerely hope that these changes will not go through!\n",

        "comment":"The Endangered Species Act (ESA) already covers all necessary fields to effectively protect and assist in recovery of species at risk. The main issue with the ESA currently is lack of implementation, not lack of regulations or guidelines. The length of time it takes to list a species at risk and develop a recovery strategy is part of the problem. Improvements should be made on equipping agencies that write recovery reports with enough people to shorten the time it takes to assess species and begin the protection process. Providing more funding to the implementation and creating more jobs for scientists to research recovery strategies would help make the ESA more successful as it is currently written. There is no need to change the ESA.\nThe ESA already covers a multi-species approach which is ultimately a landscape approach. There is no need to change the ESA in this regard. Science-based evidence of decline and recommendations for recovery are vital along with automatic protection of species and their habitats.\nThe role of COSSARO and the ESA listing process should remain the same. The ministry should have no say once the science shows that a species is at risk, those species should be automatically protected including their habitat.\nThe recovery policies and habitat regulations that are currently in the ESA are effective and should remain untouched. The current issues in this section, again, are related to implementation, and there is no analysis that explains why these timelines are not currently being met.  The government should be legally responsible to create the Government Response Statements on time. Again, this issue could be solved with an increase in the number of people tasked at writing these statements and reports.\nThe ESA currently provides enough authorization tools, and challenges should be handled by improved implementation. Paying into a conservation fund to conduct harmful actives is not a fair compensation. Ecosystems take a long time to reach their stable state and once they are disturbed, it can take decades for them to recover.\nLastly, listing species based on their range across North America is not a sustainable way to protect species long term. Individuals at the edge of the species range (I.e. if a bird lives in the southern US for winter and flys to Ontario to mate, but most of the individuals of the species stops in Detroit to mate, the Ontario population is at the edge of the species range) have adapted to different climates, food sources, and habitats than those at the centroid of the species range. These individuals could have novel evoluationary potential and may be the ones that can survive in the unknown conditions that anthropogenic climate change will bring.\nIn general, I feel that without a healthy, thriving natural environment, industry will collapse eventually in the face of anthropogenic climate change. We need healthy natural environments for the ecosystems they provide. Permitting industries to destroy species at risk habitat should be made more difficult as it is very rare that companies can restore those habitats to the same quality of habitat function and services. The ESA is not the place to put industry first. There is no need to weaken the law but rather a need for better implementation. We are not seeing species recovery because we are not actually following the laws already in the ESA and ensuring that once a species at risk is located, their habitat is then protected. The purpose of the ESA should first and foremost be to protect species at risk and their habitats, not encourage business development.\n",

        "comment":"Many of the proposed changes go against the key reasons for having an endangered species act in the first place. The change of having industries pay fees rather than following regulations will completely negate the importance of having regulations to protect endangered species. Many of these industries are large scale corporations that barely batt an eye at paying a fee for something they don\u2019t care about. Having the regulations in the endangered species act is to prevent rich corporations from just paying away their responsibilities towards the environment. This callous thinking and approach to protecting endangered species is an absolute travesty of justice. We are called to protect the vulnerable and fight for a healthier environment which includes protecting biodiversity. This is the same as Alberta\u2019s \u201cwetland protection\u201d where ecologically and hydrologically important wetlands are drained because developers can pay a fee rather to drain protected wetlands rather than just protecting them. This change to the endangered species act is not protection; it is just a greedy money grab from the provincial government. I am appalled that this is being proposed. Furthermore, the proposal that the Minister is deciding whether or not a species can be listed as endangered rather than scientists is ridiculous. The Minister has no formal scientific training and even if they read the best available scientific evidence, I fail to see how they will grasp the intricacies of scientific research and ecosystems above financial gain. The endangered species act is made to protect endangered species, but by giving the final say to a politician the proposed change will become a political leverage point. Endangered species should not be used to gain political leverage, but should be protected on the merit of the ecosystem services and biodiversity they provide in a region. Speaking further on this idea of providing ecosystem services and biodiversity, there is a proposed change to look at a broad geographic area to determine the merit of protecting a species in a specific region. This is not well thought out because individual species can provide unique services and biodiversity improvements to small regions. Considering a broader geographic area outside of Ontario will completely negate the importance of maintaining species habitat within Ontario. I am proud to live in Ontario for it\u2019s amazing natural landscapes and beautifully diverse ecosystems. These proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act will undoubtably ruin the natural beauty of this province and I am ashamed that this is the best that this government could come up with. I am disgusted by the proposed changes to the act and I strongly encourage the government to reconsider their position on PROTECTING endangered species.\n",

        "comment":"There are ten main points to the revised ESA I would like to address. The \"pay to slay\" where developers can pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on the ground reparation for damage done to an area. This should be an actual representative number calculated by non-government hired ecologist that determine the price using the importance of each species both plant and animal, the number of individuals that will be affected by the changes and the area that will be lost due to development. Typically when other governments have put a law like this one in place the price is extremely low in comparison to the value of each individual of each species in that area. For example one honey bee is worth more to our food, agriculture and society than a ten story apartment building.\nRejecting science, there should be zero input from any person without a background in the environmental and ecological field. Our environment can only success if science is accepted and put forward to change laws. By rejecting science you will cause the environment to no longer exist and the human race will be extinct. In order for the human race to survive this century we need to protect more than 50% of the earth's natural habitat and the remaining species, if we do not succeed we will have no oxygen, no way of farming our food and extreme weather events that will destroy cities. do not reject science, it is the last thing that stands between our salvation and our extinction. Unfortunately this is no longer just a worse case scenario, this is what is happening and the only way to stop it, is the save the environment, save as many species as we can and we can only do this by accepting science and using it to form a plan to help the environment.\nLimiting protections, as I stated before if we don't try to help every species we can, we as Ontario citizens will suffer the consequences. We need to make sure we prioritize important habitats and species and protect them.\nEdge range species are just as important if not more important since these species show resistance to a change in their ideal habitat. These species are critical for future persistence of the species as our climate continues to change. Species should receive protection especially if their population is low in Ontario even if the population is high elsewhere. We need to protect as many species as we can.\nHarmful activities and dodging requirements should be avoided at all costs and there needs to be a remediation plan that doesn't just restore another area to the same status that was destroyed or pay a fee. We need to make it so the environment benefits. Change this so any harmful activities must be reduced as mush as possible and all damage to the environment must be restored by double. Also at no point in time should requirements be avoided or dodged. If an endangered species or habitat is in the spot you want to build you cannot build there, you cannot do whatever you want. There is a reason why the species is endangered, on the endangered species list and there is red tape.\nAt no point in time should expert input be put aside. For each inquiry that involves the endangered species act there should be a panel of independent expert scientists in the ecological or environmental field that puts the survival of species in Ontario as their top priority and advises the minister on what action the minister should take.\nThe minister should not have greater discretion on protections. The minister should not have the power to veto protections. There should not be a suspension of protections ever especially for more then three months. Also public and expert consultations should always be required.\nThe minister should not be allowed to interfere with the listing of a species. The panel of independent expert scientists in the ecological or environmental field that puts the survival of species in Ontario as their top priority should be the only people making science-based listing decisions.\nThere should be no delay or little time between proposing a listing, planning and reporting on a species at risk using a panel and scientific research to back up the decision. If you delay in any of those steps you can undermine species recovery.\n",

        "comment":"In general, there are numerous proposed changes that wont benefit species at risk in Ontario; however, I will discuss 2. First, climate change is forecasted to drastically reduce which areas many species are found. Ontario is the most northern range for many species, and climate change will eliminate much of their southern ranges. Thus, by de-listing and not protecting some abundant species, we risk the chance of loosing then completely when climate change pushes them northward (because they may no longer exist here). Another issue is the vast discretionary provisions allowed to the Minster. These include: 1) not requiring consultation with independent expert in \u201cD\u201d permit process, 2) allowing the Minister to reconsider the listing of species, 3) giving the Mister more leeway in automatic listings, 4) allowing the Minster to set the scope of new listings, 5) allowing the Minster to make species-specific habitat regulations (as opposed to the LGIC), 6) allowing the Minster to extend the 9-month Government Response Statement, 7) allowing the Minster to extend timelines for review of progress towards protection and recovery, 8) allowing the Minister to decide what constitutes as a guideline to direct funding, and 9) allowing the Minster to postpone protection for 3 years. These discretionary changes would not just allow for bias in the process, but absolutely removes the scientific rigor that should inform which and when species are listed. Scientists have employed tried-and-true methods to ascertain when species are threatened and at risk, and even when uncertainty is high, a precautionary approach ensures that these species are not extirpated. SARA is supposed to be centered on protecting Ontario species, not on fast-tracking business deals (which is likely the outcome of the discretionary provisions for the Minister).\n",

        "comment":"The direction that the Ontario government is taking with these proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act is reckless, irresponsible and will weaken Ontario's commitment to protecting endangered species. Every suggestion in these proposed amendments weaken protections of endangered species, so I do not support any of them, but below are comments on a select few.\nWhen a species' is listed in Ontario they are typically already in a perilous state. This means that immediate action is required to keep populations from declining further - the amendments to the ESA completely undermine this tenant of conservation. Extending the time between the Minister receiving a COSSARO report and said species being listed from 3 months to 12 months is an unnecessary delay that will result in far more species becoming extirpated in Ontario.\nThese proposed amendments result in too much discretion being given to the Minister. Allowing the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider classifications of species is irresponsible, made more so by the fact that species that are not listed or are of special concern cannot be added to the SARO list or listed as a more endangered status. This is blatant in that it allows the Minister to undermine COSSARO decisions and reduce protections on species at risk.\nThe Minister is not a trained scientist - without background in conservation, species at risk, ecology or a similar discipline they are not qualified to make decisions regarding the preservation of species at risk.\nCanada, and Ontario specifically, does not exist in a vacuum. Due to the effects of climate change, connectivity in a species' Northern range may prevent said species from becoming extinct. Species should be assessed based on their range within Ontario only, regardless of their population size or expanse elsewhere.\nThere is *absolutely* no reason that the process of habitat protection should be de-coupled from a species being listed as at-risk. This again is an opportunity for business and development to over-ride the needs of our most vulnerable species. If a species has been listed it is, again, in need of immediate protections. There is more to be lost if protections are delayed, for any of the reasons listed in 2A i - iii, than if protections are immediately put in place. Extending or removing mandatory timelines is a recurring theme throughout these proposed changes. This sends the message that Ontario does not care about preserving our unique environment or the species that call it home.\nFinally, in lieu payments for not following protections\/regulations\/guidelines etc. have never been an effective way of balancing business interests and native species. There is ample evidence from within Canada and the US where payment does not lead to the creation of equivalent habitat or offset habitat loss. Currently we know the OMNRF has often permitted exemptions for activities that violate portions of the ESA - what is required is stronger enforcement of the current Act.\nThese changes are, across the board, a weakening of Ontario's commitment to being a leader in conservation. In a world where we understand the value of nature and the invaluable services provided to us by intact ecosystems it is irresponsible to weaken environmental protections.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to address the potential changes to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act.  As a citizen of this province I am gravely concerned with the proposed changes to the ESA, an act which by its nature is designed to protect one of our greatest resources, our ecosystem and our biodiversity.  Our natural systems, including endangered species, are an interwoven web that sustains life in Ontario, including the lives of the people that live here.  Allowing for the encroachment on endangered species and their habitat does a great disservice to the people of Ontario and their children who will inherit a landscape altered by the choices being made today.\nAs written, the current ESA is a scientifically sound tool for classifying the species in our province that are at the greatest risk of extinction.  The proposal to shift away from a scientifically based approach to endangered species classification and protection sets a dangerous precedent going forward in Ontario.  Our Ontario wilderness and biodiversity is a source of pride for many citizens of the province, and nature itself provides its own direct revenue (in the form of tourism, be it skiing in Blue Mountain, or camping in Algonquin Park) and indirect revenue.  It is this indirect revenue that needs the most protection.  Preserving habitat not only preserves the homes of species at risk, but also protects the pollinators that keep our farms and orchards in production, the birds and bats that control pest populations, the plants that purify our air and water, the wetlands that store carbon and prevent flooding, and the spaces that people use for hiking, boating, fishing, hunting and camping.\nThe changes proposed to the ESA are signalling that the government is willing to sacrifice the future of our province, and Ontario\u2019s greatest asset, to push forward an agenda that serves to enhance the lives of a few at the expense of the many.  Responsible government is one that accepts the necessity or protecting the environment and adapts an environmental policy that works with industry and business to move forward in a sustainable direction that allows growth without sacrificing the very thing that makes our province special.  Some specific thoughts:\n\u2022\tKeep science in policy.  The decision whether projects should go forward or not needs to be informed by scientific knowledge not by a minister or government official who doesn\u2019t understand the context and importance of endangered species.\n\u2022\tThe law should not be changed to allow landscape approaches \u201cinstead of\u201d species-specific\n\u2022\tapproaches. The fine scale of species-specific status assessments, listings and protections is needed.\n\u2022\tRegarding landscape planning, the ESA already provides for this. No change to the law is needed.\n\u2022\tWith regard to authorizing harmful activities at a broad scale, such an approach is inappropriate for endangered and threatened species. It doesn\u2019t lend itself to addressing site-specific or species-\n\u2022\tspecific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril\n\u2022\tScience-based listing and automatic protections provide certainty.\n\u2022\tThere should be no change to the ESA regarding the listing process and the role of COSSARO. The law sets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of \u201cthe best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\u201d (sec. 5(3)).\n\u2022\tImproving notification is an implementation issue which should be addressed through better communications. In its listing process, COSSARO is required to consider species listed by the federal Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (sec. 4(2)a); there are years of notice embedded in this process, from the release of COSEWIC status reports to the listing by COSSARO.\n\u2022\tThere should be no alternative to automatic species and habitat protections (e.g.,through ministerial discretion to remove or delay protections)\n\u2022\tThere should be no change to the legal requirement to produce Government Response Statements (GRS) within nine months of the release of Recovery Strategies (sec. 11(8)). Failure to meet the legislated deadline is an implementation issue.\n\u2022\tThe required five-year reporting on progress is reasonable and ensures transparency and accountability. It provides an impetus for action, ensuring that effectiveness is assessed, and contributes to institutional learning and adaptive management.\n\u2022\tThe ESA already allows the Minister to delay the development of a habitat regulation (sec. 56(1)b) or to not proceed with a habitat regulation (sec. 56 (1)c). No change to the law is needed.\n\u2022\tThere should be no changes to the legal provisions for habitat regulations, which describe specific boundaries or features of areas deemed to be habitat and provide enhanced certainty for ESA implementation and enforcement. They can include areas where a species \u201cused to live or is believed to be capable of living\u201d (sec. 55(3)b), presenting a significant opportunity for protection and recovery efforts to extend beyond places where species at risk currently persist.\n\u2022\tThis is the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act. The priority must be on protecting and recovering species at risk.\n\u2022\tThere are already sufficient authorization tools. No new tools are needed. Challenges should be addressed through improved implementation.\n\u2022\tProponents of harmful activities should NOT be allowed to simply pay into a conservation fund -an easy way out that reduces accountability and facilitates harm to species at risk and their habitats.\n\u2022\tDo not simplify requirements for sec. 17(2)d permits. These are intended to be available only for projects that \u201cresult in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario\u201d and that will not \u201cjeopardize the survival or recovery of the species in Ontario.\u201d These are appropriate requirements and ensure that such permits are issued only an exceptional basis.\n\u2022\tDo not simplify requirements for exemptions through regulation. That would only make it easier for harmful activities to proceed, without public scrutiny, government oversight or enforcement\n\u2022\tThe ESA (sec. 18) already provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. No legislative change is needed. This is an implementation issue\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t ignore climate change.\nThe decisions you make today will have a lasting impact on the children of tomorrow.  The environmental well being of our province is of growing important to the people of Ontario.\n",

Giving one person the authority to ignore all the work of scientists is never a good idea. The Minister is not a trained environmental scientist!!!!\n- Once a species is deemed a species at risk, it needs to be protected immediately. The Minister should NOT be able to suspend species and habitat protection for up to three years. By this point, irreversible damage to habitats could have been done!\n- Species at the edges of their range should not be deserted. They should be actively protected, especially because as the climate changes, these northern populations are essential as the species adapts to changing conditions.\n- Finally, I am concerned about the delays to species protection. Species at risk need protection NOW (or even better, 10 years ago), not three years from now.\nPLEASE, do not underestimate the natural, economic, and social value of a healthy and thriving ecosystem! Under the United Nations Convention of Biological Diversity, we as Ontarians have a responsibility to maintain and promote biodiversity. The proposed amendments to the ESA do exactly the opposite of that. Please, listen to scientists and experts in species assessments and conservation.\n",

Firstly, with climate change and human land use substantially affecting habitats, extending the timelines of putting a species on the SARO list and other policy deadlines could be catastrophic in conserving their populations.\nSecondly, I question what factors the Minister would consider that would be better informed than the COSSARO and experts in making the decision to put a species on the SARO list, and which stakeholders or political parties they may be influenced by when making this decision. The decision to list species should not depend on economical considerations, and the Minister should not have the authority to remove requirements without consulting an environmental expert. The Minister does not have a background in the environment or conservation, and should be mandated to work with COSSARO and experts to make these decisions. Decisions should not be based on the opinion of the Minister: whether these decisions are beneficial or antagonistic to species, the Minister should always be consulting experts.\nThirdly, if a species is endangered or threatened in Ontario, this status should be independent of whether that species is endangered or threatened across Canada or worldwide. Many of these species may have some benefit locally, may have local adaptations that will help them respond to climate change, particularly if they are at the northern extent of a species\u2019 distribution, and may be impacted by species that are not found elsewhere\nLastly, introducing a payment instead of having stakeholders complete on-the-ground activities takes away the responsibility of the stakeholder to restore the habitat that they have disturbed. These stakeholders should not be allowed to buy their way out of regulations, as this would impose no limit to what these stakeholders could do to endangered and threatened species and their habitats. There should be on-the-ground monitoring that stakeholders are complying and that their activities are not harming species or damaging habitats.\n",

Individuals of a species that are located at the northern edge, as many species in Canada are, may be genetically different from those at the rest of the range.

Charging companies money to destroy habitats that took millions of years to create is not equal. There is no amount of money that can replace vital habitat to many species at risk. Once that habitat is lost, it is lost forever. Companies that already cause damage to wildlife and the environment should be charged this now, while companies hoping to the destory habitat of species at risk should never be permitted to do so.\n5. Enforcing the Endangered Species Act\nThe Minister of Environment is not a trained environmental scientist or biologist. The minister should not be allowed to extend protection order powers during the intervening period. If COSSARO recommended a species should be listed, the species should be listed without the say of the Minister.\n",

        "comment":"I am a member of a wetland ecology research lab at an Ontario university, though more pertinently I am a concerned citizen. I am concerned that the revision of the ESA will result in politicization and loss of protections for endangered species in Ontario. Protecting species diversity, including those currently endangered, across Ontario is vital to the protection of our ecosystems which not only provide ecosystem services like groundwater quality but also represent the identity of Ontario as a biologically diverse ecosystem. After consulting literature produced by the Environmental Commission of Ontario, I have a few points I would like to bring to your attention:\nThe proposed changes to the listing of species would politicize a process which should be completely and only based on scientific evidence as concluded by COSSARO, not finally on the discretion of the minister who may not have a sufficient scientific background and thus would be unqualified to make such a determination. Further, requiring COSSARO to consider a broader geographic range in the listing of species is misguided. Species which may be abundant and prospering in an area outside of Ontario could be threatened within Ontario, though this does not mean that these species are not to be protected within Ontario. All species do provide services and it is important to maintain local diversity within Ontario, regardless of their broad distribution.\nRemoving the immediate automatic protections on species listed by COSSARO is a misguided decision. Species on the list do need these protections because they are already in danger of population declines in the status quo. By enabling the minister to suspend action, they threaten the species with extinction. Furthermore, the criteria for which the minister would be allowed to leverage to suspend action is not scientifically based and goes against the purpose of the ESA: to protect endangered species at all times, not only when it is convenient. More so, by giving the minister discretion to extend the time for which the government has to develop a recovery strategy only allows for the continued damage to endangered species habitat. The minister is unqualified to make such decisions.\nLastly though possibly most importantly, the proposed changes to the act would allow for violators of the ESA to simply pay a mere fine, despite this being contrary to the mission of the Act, instead of using that money to comply with the conditions specified in the act. Further, the changes remove the requirement for consultation of independent experts, which is contrary to the act's important dedication to science based conclusions.\n",

        "comment":"In respect to section 2, suspending species listing for up to 3 years of meeting a certain criteria made by the minister. How can habitat availability be quantified for a species in Ontario? How can a species not have habitat loss as a limiting factor? If this is the discretion of the minister and there is no longer a requirement for consulting an expert, then how will you deem a species doesn't need a habitat? Further on the topic of losing the requirement of consulting an expert and the minister can choose their own course action. How can a person who is an untrained in environmental science be able to make decisions on environmental science? If this requirement is taken way then we are leaving our decisions to a person who will not be able t make accurate assumptions of our endangered species. Science needs to be fact driven, and without experts to advise a person who is untrained in this field the wrong decisions will be made.\nThis point of a person who is untrained in environmental science making all of the decisions holds true in section 3 as well. How is someone who is untrained in these matters able to extend the timeline for reviews of that species? With this point many endangered species will likely be pushed for reviews to save money, as their will be no person who is educated to assist the minister in the process of this decision making.\nIn respect to section 4, the minister is not a trained environmental scientist and does not know how to properly assess any of the proposed rules. This will lead to incorrect information and the loss of our endangered species. If this goes through we are giving power to one person who will likely make all the wrong decisions, we need to have advisors that are educated in the matter and have rules set that the minister has to follow in regards to these advisors comments.\nIn section 5 we have the same issue, all the power is supposed to go to the minister even for hiring conservation officers. This person is not trained in environmental science and is also not trained to be hiring officers that are needed to maintain the protection of our endangered species. This proposal is trying to give to much power to a person who is not educated in the environment. If these changes are made we will likely lose a lot of our already endangered species and we will likely see more species needing more conservation soon after.\n",

        "comment":"The ability to pay a fee to harm habitats of species at risk and\/or the species themselves does not protect species at risk, even if the money goes back into helping them. If an area containing a population of a species at risk is wiped out, that population is very likely wiped out for good. Adaptation seldom happens that quickly. Even if the fee to destroy that habitat goes towards helping that species elsewhere, the fee (assuming it is not extreme) likely will not be enough to help replace the initial damage. The best thing we can do to help species at risk is to keep their habitat as abundant and pristine as possible, and many areas of this new act ignore that fact. If the Ontario government truly cares for species at risk, they will do what they can to protect them, not come up with loopholes and excuses for continually wiping them out.\nFurther, the authority given to one person (minister) who has no background in environmental science is ridiculous. Why does the Ontario government fund scientific environmental research projects, yet give the final decision on environmental issues to one person of limited scientific or environmental knowledge? A panel of environmental scientists who review and discuss extensive research on the subject should have that responsibility.\n",

        "comment":"It is with great concern that I have read the proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act (ESA).\nThe overarching theme of the proposed changes is the extension of timelines. For example, the time between when a report is given by COSSARO to the minister and when the species is listed under SARO will be extended from 3 months to 12 months. Also, rather than a species being immediately protected upon listing, the proposed changes \"will provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species\". These two extensions combined could mean that a species and its critical habitat are left unprotected for 4 years following the submission of a COSSARO report - the drafting of which report is itself a lengthy and involved process. This is an unnecessarily long period of time, and many changes and impacts could occur within this window, putting these species at greater risk.\nThe second point above (the potential delaying of protection for three years) lists a series of criteria for the delay to occur. However, it is unclear how these criteria would be assessed and how much time the governing bodies would be provided to make this assessment. Without these items clearly defined, the process will lack robustness and delays will likely be implemented without adequate support.\nAnother timeline extension is proposed in giving permit\/agreement holders the ability to operate for a full year following new listings and habitat protections. This would further extend the delay above to a total of 5 years, and would allow operators to work in areas where they knowingly are having impacts on listed species. While understandably inconvenient to those permit-holders to cease activities while waiting for permits to be amended, projects have constant delays for a multitude of reasons, and waiting to ensure the most appropriate decision is made before continuing activities is the ethical approach.\nOne of the most concerning proposed changes is the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, which would allow developers to pay a fee rather than follow ESA requirements. The cost would be within the range of costs typically incurred; however, there is no mention of how this would be determined. As someone who has worked on several infrastructure projects in protected areas, I am well aware that initial quoted or estimated costs are often substantially below the actual costs of performing a job safely, effectively, and with meaningful results. By charging a fee rather than determining compliance through measured benefits and results or long-term monitoring, the achieved offsets are unlikely to match those expected or required. Also, it is unclear how this agency would be funded. Would these funds be coming from the fees paid by developers (thereby even further reducing offsetting or remediation efforts), or would it be independently funded by taxpayers?\nI am also concerned by the removal of the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert. The Minister cannot be expected to be an expert in these matters, and they should rely on the opinion of those who are. Leaving more decisions to the Minister's discretion without appropriate consultation and council from experts in the field is irresponsible.\nLastly, making a habitat regulation proposal optional rather than mandatory is inadequate. If these regulations are not always required, then the exceptions should follow a specific suite of criteria. In other words, the onus should be on the proponent to demonstrate that a regulation is not required, rather than relying on individuals who already have full workloads to find the time and resources to draft optional regulations. Making this requirement optional would, for all intents and purposes, lead to the elimination of habitat regulations.\nThank you for the opportunity to provide comments on these proposed changes. I hope that the changes are strongly reconsidered, and that species at risk do not lose any important protective measures.\n",

        "comment":"I am a citizen of Ontario who values biodiversity and protecting endangered species. I do not believe that the proposed changes to the ESA will properly provide the protection needed for the endangered species of Ontario. I do not support the changes that are proposed to the ESA.\nI have particular concerns with the following proposed changes:\n1. The Minister can decide to suspend protection action for up to three years based on social and economic considerations, and decisions on these delays would be without public consultation, allowing those with political connections to undermine species protections without anyone knowing.\n2. Companies can pay into a fund rather than fulfilling on-the-ground compensation for destructive activities that harm species at risk. If a species and its habitat is lost, than the species is lost. Putting money in a fund does not make up for this.\n3. Opening up COSSARO to members without a science background is unacceptable. Decisions for placing species on the endangered species list should be founded in objective facts based on science, not from a subjective point of view.\n4. Just because a species has healthy populations in other parts of its range outside of Ontario does not mean it should be discounted for protection if it is suffering within Ontario. \u201cEdge-of-range\u201d species are of equal value to any other and add to Ontario\u2019s total biodiversity.\n5. Giving the final say for a species listing to the Minister is wrong. The Minister is not a trained environmental scientist. The Minister should not have the ability to require COSSARO to reconsider their listing, when COSSARO has the most informed opinion. This would slow the process of listing.\n6. MECP proposes to create \u201clandscape agreements\u201d for proponents undertaking harmful activities in multiple locations. Such an approach does not lend itself to addressing site-specific or species-specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.\n7. The Minister would be able to limit ESA protections so that they apply only in specific geographies or under specific circumstances. This could exclude important habitats and species from protection.\n8. MECP wants to allow projects approved under other laws to not also have to be approved by the ESA, allowing forestry and other industries to have exemptions from the ESA.\n9. The new proposal would delay the listing of species to 9 months after assessments are public. This is much too long and species could be significantly harmed in this time period.\nThe ESA needs to make sure species listings are based on science, and avoid the input of biased parties. It needs to have listings be efficient and implementation of protection be strict. We do not need to revise the law, and deregulate. We need to improve the implementation of the laws.\n",

        "comment":"I am utterly appalled and outraged at the proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act. This legislation is supposed to PROTECT species, not make it easier for developers to make a quick buck off their habitat.\nSpecies at Risk can't speak for themselves. Rather, they rely on intelligent people to speak for them. In this capacity, I would like to express the following concerns with legislative changes proposed in the 10-year review:\n1) Species at Risk habitat should be off-limits, no exceptions. Has MECP not learned from DFO's experience that habitat compensation doesn't maintain, let alone improve, habitat and the health and viability of species? Any clause that allows developers to pay to destroy Species at Risk and their habitat should never have been considered.\n2) As people of Ontario, we are stewards for the biodiversity within our provincial boundaries. If a species is \"at risk\" in Ontario, its status outside out boundaries shouldn't matter in how we protect it within our jurisdiction. To exclude \"edge of range\" species from protection is just lazy, short-sighted government. News flash: Our climate is changing, and species that may currently be doing OK elsewhere may not fare so well as the future unfolds. They need us to save space for them.\n3) All decisions regarding Species at Risk and their habitat should be science-based. Enabling and supporting research and monitoring, and letting scientists guide protection and recovery is critical for improving outcomes for threatened, and Endangered species. COSSARO needs to be comprised entirely of scientists, not opened up to non-scientists with \"community knowledge\". Don't worry about missing out on \"community knowledge\" -- scientists are community members and can therefore cover that aspect of Species at Risk \/ habitat consideration.\n4) The Minister should have NO say on species and habitat protections recommended by COSSARO and\/or established in the legislation. If the Act is based on the precautionary principle, its based on a solid reason. Listing decisions should not be forced for reconsideration. Only under site- or species-specific, case-by-case review should there be ANY consideration whatsoever for proponents wishing to undertake destructive activities in protected habitat -- and any such review MUST be advised and guided by scientists, landscape ecologists, and other qualified experts.\nWe should be feeling lucky to have so much biodiversity in Ontario. We should be showing gratitude and respect toward all the native species that call our province \"home\". Do we not know better?? I would like to think that the intelligent people of Ontario DO know better, and DO appreciate and respect our provincial biodiversity.\nAnd I hope Minister Phillips has the sense to REJECT these damaging proposed amendments and replace them with strengthened enforcement and habitat stewardship.\n",

        "comment":"Message sent to my local MPP:\nI have no expectation that a politically motivated, ideologically-driven decision will be re-considered by providing facts, but I still feel obliged to point out that your governments assertions about improving outcomes for endangered species ring extremely hollow (unless you consider the development industry to be an endangered species). Suggesting that decisions will be science-based are under-mined by the following:\nhttps:\/\/ero.ontario.ca\/notice\/013-5033\n1. ....the proposed changes would provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species when the following specified criteria are met:\napplying the prohibitions to the species would likely have significant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario so additional time is required to determine the best approach to protect the species and its habitat;\n        the temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario; and\n        one of the following further criteria is met:\n            the species has a broad distribution in the wild in Ontario;\n            habitat availability is not a limiting factor for the species;\n            additional time is needed to address the primary threats to the species, or co-operation with other jurisdictions is necessary to reduce the primary threats to the species,\n            other criteria that may be specified by regulation.\nThis totally politicizes the process. Who gets to define a \"significant social or economic implication\"? Suspending protections for three years would be fine if this also applied to suspending development approvals pending the decision -- this absence is glaring. The bullet \"...other criteria that may be specified by regulation\" is particularly fishy since it basically allows you to play a wild card at any time in the future to justify a decision to suspend protection.\nHaving worked in government, my doublespeak radar is instantly triggered by the phrase \"scoping of... protections where appropriate\". Who gets to decide where this would be appropriate? Despite your attempts to paint this otherwise, this is clearly another means of politicizing the process to allow specific development approvals to proceed.\nC.  Remove the mandatory legislative requirement and timeline to develop a habitat regulation proposal for each newly-listed threatened or endangered species and retain the option to develop a habitat regulation when needed.\nD.   Enable the Minister, rather than LGIC, to make species-specific habitat regulations.\nEnough said. It doesn't get more political than this.\nCreation of Regulatory Charge and Agency\nOntario is also proposing to create Canada\u2019s first independent Crown agency proposed to be called the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, to allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act. The funds would support strategic, coordinated and large-scale actions that assist in the protection and recovery of species at risk.\nThe proposed changes would authorize the creation of a regulatory charge that could be paid by persons who are permitted to carry out otherwise prohibited activities under certain permits, agreements, and regulations. The charge would be paid in lieu of fulfilling certain potential conditions that could otherwise have been imposed under the permit, agreement, or regulation. The proposed charges would only be available in respect of species prescribed by regulation. The price for the payment-in-lieu (i.e. regulatory charge) will be within the range of costs that a client would have otherwise incurred through meeting the species-based conditions of an authorization. Clients would still need to fulfill some on-the-ground requirements, including considering reasonable alternatives for their activity and taking steps to minimize the adverse effects of the activity on the species at risk.\nThis is where your administration really shows its hand. The notion that paying a charge determined by politicians (seriously, how do you determine the cost of meeting species-based conditions of authorization in a situation where there would have been a prohibition on development) will somehow compensate for carrying out prohibited activities is utter nonsense and you must surely know it.\nWhat's notable about your plans to de-fund agencies like Conservation Ontario while supporting the development industry is that nobody buys your propaganda about economic development and the creation of more affordable housing. If this were true it would be occurring within the existing urban footprint. Cutting funding to Conservation Ontario and weakening the ESA suggests that the future development that your government wants to encourage will occur in green field locations. As a constituent who lives in the rural portion of your riding, I would like to point out that there are many others who are deeply concerned about the prospect of paving over natural lands and diminishing the ability of Conservation Authorities to provide programs. There may not be enough of us in the riding to cost you your seat in the next election, but if your other deeply unpopular policies alienate enough of Burlington's urban electorate you will find yourself out of a job come 2022.\n",

I grew up in the Cambridge area and spent many days picnicing, swimming, and hiking at Grand Valley Conservation Area parks. When I was raising my own children in Toronto we bought TRCA memberships, so we could visit Conservation parks in the GTA. It was a chance to have a day in nature  for children growing up in downtown Toronto. We know our quality of life is directly tied to a healthy and intact natural world.  We want the natural world to be protected, not just far away in the north, but within walking distance of our own homes and schools. We value knowing that vulnerable species like Monarch Butterflies and Trumpeter Swans can return and even thrive in our province.  We know that nature must be well-protected in law.\nIn concert with legal frameworks, schools, communities and individuals across Ontario have been protecting and restoring habitats, aiming for the return of vulnerable species of trees, birds, mammals, reptiles and wildflowers, across Ontario.  Today I must urge you to stop your government\u2019s unprecedented attacks on Ontario's natural heritage.  In recent days, you have put in play three fundamental rewrites of existing laws, which together would undo decades of progress on nature restoration. These changes include the gutting of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act  (ERO # 013-5033); exempting developers from protecting most of Ontario\u2019s threatened and endangered species and their habitats (under omnibus Bill 108 ERO# 019-0021); and cutting away much of the natural heritage mandate of conservation authorities (ERO# 013-5018).  Together, these changes would reverse painstaking, collaborative progress by hundreds of groups and innumerable volunteers, working over generations.\nIt is highly alarming to see the legal framework for species protection now on the chopping block. With regard to the rewrite of the Endangered Species Act (ERO# 013-5033), the proposal contains so many deeply troubling elements that I can highlight just three top concerns:\nDevelopers whose projects would damage or destroy critical habitat would be allowed to simply pay into a fund rather than making their projects greener by accommodating vulnerable species.\nSpecies experts would find their best science advice on habitat protection overruled by politically convenient decisions.\nSpecies near the edge of their range in Ontario would lose their protection in law.  Ontario would essentially be saying: \u201cLet other jurisdictions step up and protect regionally rare animals and plants. Ontario no longer cares.\u201d\n",

The vast majority of commenters strongly stated that if the Act is to be changed, it should to create stronger protections for species at risk, and it should NOT weaken the rules. However, all of these proposed changes are obviously just loosening SAR protections:\n-extend the time from when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to when listing is to occur from three to twelve months\n-provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species\n-remove the mandatory legislative requirement and timeline to develop a habitat regulation proposal\n-enable the Minister, rather than LGIC, to make species-specific habitat regulations\n-removing specific reference to posting under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\n-allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act\n-remove requirements for the Minister to consult with an independent expert\n- give the Minister the power to make regulations limiting the application of the prohibitions with respect to a species.\nMaking these changes is extremely short-sighted, unethical, and will only cause damage to our natural world at a time when we cannot afford to do so. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report that was just released indicates that 1 million species will go extinct within the next several decades if we don\u2019t act to change that.\nPlease listen to your constituents and don\u2019t make these changes.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act continue to gut the effectiveness and even the existence of the Act.\nThe 2013 changes under Premier Wynne exempted large industries; this was a terrible decision.  It was not supported by any science.\nThe 2019 changes under Premier Ford will compound that mistake.\nThe ESA is often criticized for getting in the way of business.  That is why it exists in the first place.  Not to be obstructionist as is often stated. It is to ensure any business cannot act with impunity on environmental matters and externalize or communize costs while privatizing profits.  What is often demonized as \u2018red tape\u2019 is a check and balance.\nThe notion of a compensation fund might seem attractive but as is obvious a species at risk is already at a low population viability; if more individuals are removed, paying into the fund to do more research or compensation\/mitigation banking is moot because there is a real risk that removals will cause the species to go extinct. This is probably one of the intentions. Species now extinct? No need to list them or worry anymore about impacts on development. Problem solved in terms of business concerns; problem exacerbated in terms of environmental degradation.\nThe proposal to focus on habitat or landscape level protections could be legitimate except there is no serious intent to fund and complete the needed data collection that is \u2018made in Ontario\u2019 required by other changes to the Act.  What will happen is that a government simply rules out protection because there are no data; there are no data because the Government will not fund any data collection.  This is a careworn strategy; ignorance is not only bliss, it is also great at regulatory capture.  What it is not great at is ensuring species at risk may survive and thrive \u2013 rather ironic, given the intent of the ESA.  It is also clear that this strategy of ignorance is a feature and not a bug.\nThe demand for expanded participation in the now-clearly named \u2018advisory\u2019 COSSARO would be welcome except it is not clear what criteria would be used to select members.  There are vague references to ecologists (which are already on COSSARO \u2013 and those should be population and other sub-specialities of ecologists).  The demand for non-experts to have a seat at the COSSARO table to examine economic implications of listing SAR. That is not acceptable. The very point of the Act is to protect species. Period.\nOne can still examine the indirect impacts of several ESA listed species to individual farmers is still part of the compensation payouts administered by OMAFRA (recently amended). And It would be very useful to systematically examine how the ESA and development interests affect one another and to find best win-win approaches.  But the proposed changes are one-way: they ignore that the issue is that business and development cannot take priority above all else. The language used (Open for Business) clearly indicates that privilege is indeed the intent.  Financially, this will not lead to economic prosperity either.\nAs the recent IUCN report notes, biodiversity and ecosystem services losses far outpace any incremental or marginal financial gain by building yet another strip-mall, for example.  Given the retail and employment lands shift that has left brownfields and greyfields aplenty (and already serviced by infrastructure), it would make far more sense economically to leave greenfields protected - the species protected \u2013 and advance Ontario\u2019s already extensive knowledge economy at redevelopment of those grey and brownfields.  It means no enormous new costs to underserviced areas; no new taxes at the municipal level to pay for those developments but there will be new revenue from redevelopment (a large benefit to cost ratio even within the short term).  The economic arguments for changing the ESA simply make little sense in terms of prosperity.  Couple that with the recent experiences of what happens when human caused climate changes enlarges floodplains and shows the consequences of removing wetlands and forests, then one can see a scenario where those areas become undesirable and uninsurable.\nFurther, the notion of considering delisting or waitlisting species that are less endangered in nearby provinces or states is not supported by science at all.   One can argue that recovery plans for species at their current northern range limit or species that have disjunct populations because they are endemic would be minimal. But they still should have legal protection because the genotypes within those populations will be rare and represent a genetic reservoir \u2013 especially important with human caused climate change moving the possible range of species northward.\nWith these changes to the ESA, one immediate consequence will be that no environmental organization or likely even independent scientists will ever work again with such organizations. There will be no win-win explorations for the foreseeable future. If that seems desirable to some, consider that it means a social and political backlash that probably will take time but when it does, revenge is the likely outcome.  I don\u2019t advocate that at all. But human nature is rather predictable, and history is replete with examples of failing to heed the warning of \u2018being careful what you wish for\u2019.  It also means the battles will erode the environmental and economic situations over time. As much as some politicians bray at \u2018social licence\u2019, this is a very real driver for a lot of businesses, especially those that cater to ecotourism or recreation.  Financial and insurance institutions also pay attention to that concept, not least of which because there is now physical and then stakeholder\/consumer financial risk to them within jurisdictions that ignore the impacts on biodiversity or climate.\nA most serious problem is allowing the Minister veto power.  As a political appointee, the Minister \u2013 regardless of who they are, or which party is in power \u2013 is rarely qualified by training and education to be able to make decisions based on science. This is the reason an independent scientific advisor was previously required in making any decision to overrule COSSARO.\nClearly, the intent is to subvert the entire process even further than it was under the previous government and subordinate it to a political or even ideological position.  This makes a mockery of the rule of law.  While proponents of the changes likely cheer this on now, consider if an election delivers a different outcome and that Minister goes much further than COSSARO in favouring protection for endangered species.\nGiven the recent indication of the current government to effectively immunize itself from most legal action, there would be little avenue to challenge such a decision. Again, right now that probably seems like a wonderful notion; it is not only undemocratic (it is anything but For the People) but leaves another weapon that the current government\u2019s ideological opponents could wield after a new election.\nNo government should have absolute power. Government by fiat and wilful destruction of the environment will lead to a deeper crisis.  This is not a future that Ontario should consider but is hurtling towards.  One suspects these critiques will not find favor in the end. If not, Ontario will find itself at an economic and ecological disadvantage that in the latter case will be devastating.\n",

Already governments around the world do not have strong enough policies in place to adequately protect species at risk. While the Government's review of the ESA is timely, it's time to strengthen protections, not weaken them. We need pollinators for food production, biodiversity for ecosystem services, and policies that protect the environment from uncontrolled development.\nIn Ontario alone, 234 species are currently at risk. Habitat loss and degradation are the major drivers of decline. That is why it\u2019s more important than ever to strengthen protections for wildlife, especially those already at risk.\nThe Endangered Species Act (ESA) already provides significant exemptions to industry (i.e., forestry). We need legislation that makes it harder for habitat to be destroyed. We need to strengthen the ESA so that critical habitat is protected, especially from major developments. Habitat cannot be replaced. It takes decades to remediate sites, centuries for old-growth habitats. While I appreciate the need to encourage development, we can\u2019t do so at the expense of habitat and wildlife, or soon we will have nothing left. Limits must be set. Businesses of the future will demand healthy, thriving ecosystems in which to function. By opening for business at any expense, we will soon be paying the ultimate price through destruction of the nature that sustains us.\nI, therefore, am asking you to:\n- Prioritize the recovery of at-risk species over the demands of developers.\n- Repeal the industry exemptions under section 55.\n- Ensure that habitat is protected and restored to facilitate species recovery, instead of merely mitigating the adverse impacts of harmful activities.\nA strong Endangered Species Act will mean a stronger Ontario now and in the future.\n",

As I was reading it I kept shaking my head thinking, what kind of world do I live in where the provincial government is putting business ahead of the environment and endangered species.  The sections I had the most problems with were:  2.A.  Giving power to the Minister to suspend protection of species and their habitat.  Seriously???  No one person should have this kind of power.  They can easily be swayed and bribed into doing what businesses want at the expense of the environment.  This is not a good idea and I completely disagree.  We have already destroyed so much natural habitat.  We should be doing whatever we can to protect MORE areas of our beautiful land so our endangered species can bounce back and no more species are placed on the list.  Secondly, section 4, allowing businesses to basically buy their way out of having to do their due diligence in protecting the environment, species at risk and their habitat.  This kind of passing of the responsibility on to another organization is most likely going to end up in the environment suffering and , who is it going to be run by? Doug Ford\u2019s friends?  I envision a lack of responsibility with this new proposed model.  Thirdly Section 4. C.  The current regulations in place should hold true.  Allowing businesses\/developers to continue for a year after discovering a species or habitat that needs protecting??? Unbelievable.  In a year the damage done could potentially be irreversible.  If a species at risk or their habitat is discovered, OF COURSE that business or developer should immediately stop what they are doing!  This is common sense!  If you are doing damage to ANYTHING you should stop immediately.  I am just in complete shock that this would even be a consideration.\nThese are just my top 3 complaints about these proposed changes.

        "comment":"I am writing to express my extreme opposition to the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, 2007. The proposed changes will utterly undermine the important purpose of the Endangered Species Act, which is to protect species at risk and their habitat, and support their recovery in Ontario. Instead, the proposed changes to the Act will lower protection for species and hinder their recovery, while making processes simpler for business and development to impose threats on our natural heritage. As an Ontarian, I cannot stand for this. The proposed changes will have a devastating impact on our species and natural spaces, features that are invaluable and irreplaceable. Biodiversity is, and must be considered as, a valuable asset to Ontarians, yet the proposed changes to the Act do not reflect this fact.\nI am particularly concerned with the following proposed changes:\n1)\tRemoving automatic protections for listed species, allowing the Minister with authority to suspend prohibitions for species that would likely have significant social or economic implications. This proposed change would target species that commonly intersect with human interest, which are species already at high risk of harm as a result of human impacts. This proposed change will not improve the Endangered Species Act for species at risk, the true intent of the Act, but instead will jeopardize the recovery of vulnerable species.\n2)\tCreating a new landscape agreement that allows authorized persons to execute beneficial actions that may not apply to the species impacted by the authorized activities. This proposed change will be devastating for species that commonly intersect with human interest. What safeguards would exist to ensure certain species are not repeatedly impacted by authorized activities without any beneficial actions taking place to support their recovery?\n3)\tEstablishing a Species at Risk Conservation Fund to allow for a \u201cpay to slay\u201d approach to species at risk conservation. Again, this proposed change will have hugely negative impacts for species at risk, while improving the process for business and development, which is not the intent of the Act. Charging a payment-in-lieu within the range of the costs that a client would otherwise incurred through meeting the species-based conditions of an authorization is essentially negligible in relation to the local extirpation of a species or habitat. What methods will be used to assign a price to a species?\nThe proposed changes to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act come at a time when urgent actions are needed to reverse rapid population declines in our species. This month, the United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released their assessment indicating that one million species across the world are currently facing extinction largely due to human impact. This panel of 132 government experts clearly and uniformly indicate that biodiversity should be at the top of the global agenda. While this is the most comprehensive assessment of its kind, it is not the first. The State of North America\u2019s Birds report was released in 2016 and clearly indicates that one third of all North American bird species need urgent conservation action due to rampant threats to birds and their habitats. Ontario is not immune to these threats or warnings. However, the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act DIRECTLY contravene these repeated and evidence-based recommendations. Ontario supports a vast array of species, and it is not too late to act. Rather than removing protections for species from the Endangered Species Act, we need to increase protections and help safeguard our natural heritage from human-mediated threats. This approach would indeed be a modern approach to species conservation, not the approach that the Ontario government is currently proposing.\n",

        "comment":"After reading the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act, I am very disappointed that so many protections are potentially being removed from the current act. There also seems to be many provisions being suggested that would allow developers to effectively build wherever they choose, regardless of the plants and animals on the land. This would be absolutely devastating to many populations (example, the casino in North Bay, being built on wetlands that house Blandings turtles, even though there are other viable location options). We are supposed to be stewards for the environment, preserving it for future generations. We should be protecting the habitat of at-risk and endangered species. Paying down the deficit should not come at the price of environmental destruction. Not everything can or should have a dollar value assigned to it; some things are priceless and cannot be replaced once they disappear. According to the Sierra Club of Canada (https:\/\/www.sierraclub.ca\/national\/es\/endang.html), close to 80% of species at-risk in our country are in this position because of habitat loss and fragmentation - the very things that will be supported should the amendments to the Act be made.

I am a big supporter of a more efficient government, but not at the expense of wildlife that is already disappearing.  I understand economics very well, but there needs to be a way that protections are in place where both conservationists and business people meet and work together to make sure projects happen in a sustainable way.\nMany businesses are aware of the environment and their business footprint and believe in the bottom line first, but also understand that the environmental aspect of our world is only becoming more important. Astute businesses know that their reputation is better served working within the environmental rules and guidelines. It may take a little longer, but bridges\/infrastructure\/buildings are regularly built with people working together to make sure environmental protections are put in place and adhered to.\nI am pleased to see that decisions are still going to be science-based and that inviting others to the table who have knowledge in these areas is being considered.  I think these are both a great basis for working with each other.\nI don't believe giving the Minister more delegation and authorities is in anyone's best interest.  This could go in any number of different directions depending on personalities, special interest groups, lobbying by business etc.  Let's keep decision making based on science and a group decision-making environment that is criteria based.\nOur endangered species are all part of a balanced ecosystem.  We already have tampered with it, let's give our wildlife a fighting chance, which gives our forests and wilderness better balance and a better chance of being there for decades to come.  And this supports our industries that rely on our natural resources as well.   Logging, hunting, fishing and tourism, especially in northern and eastern Ontario rely on our natural world for much of their revenue\/income and jobs.  Whether it's logging or ecotourism, these rely on having a balanced ecosystem.

        "comment":"Many of the proposed changes essentially make the act useless for protecting endangered species. There may be ways to make it such that the process of evaluation is more streamlined, but what this act does is simply eliminate aspects that would allow species to be protected.\nA few examples\n1) \"Require COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened. If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition\"\nThis would exclude many edge of range species that are rare in Ontario, but might be common elsewhere. These species still play a role in Ontario's ecosystems and biodiversity, and are of value to Ontarians. The act should consider the species as they are in Ontario, not other jurisdictions. Furthermore, if every jurisdiction thought like this, it might encourage species to be eliminated because \"well, they're more common somewhere else, so we don't need to protect\". Ontario should not set that precedent, and should only consider the status of the species within our borders.\n2) \"Allow the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species where the Minister forms the opinion based on scientific information that the classification may  no longer be appropriate. For species that are not yet on the list or are listed as special concern, the proposed changes provide that the species would not be added to the SARO List or listed to a more endangered status during COSSARO's re-assessment.\"\nUnless the minister has a background education in this field, this does not seem practical. It does not seem reasonable that one minister should be granted the equivalent scientific authority to a body of experts. It also opens up the possibility that the \"opinion\" of the one minister comes from selectively chosen science.\n3) Section 2A\nProtections should be automatic, regardless. The economic and social impacts of implementing them for endangered species will not be so vast that they require any reconsideration. Not to mentions that \"applying the prohibitions to the species would likely have significant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario so additional time is required to determine the best approach to protect the species and its habitat\" and \"additional time is needed to address the primary threats to the species, or co-operation with other jurisdictions is necessary to reduce the primary threats to the species,\" seem contradictory. If more time is needed to assess the best protection measures, then the species should receive automatic protections to offset damage in the meantime, not have them delayed.\n4) Creation of Regulatory Charge and Agency\nPaying in lieu of conducting the required activities to offset harm does not help protect species, no matter what fund it goes into. Development will not stop, and if we want to preserve species on the landscape, we need to take measures to keep them there, not put money into a fund for unspecified conservation measured elsewhere.\n5) \"Broaden COSSARO member qualifications to include members who have relevant expertise in ecology, wildlife management, as well as those with community knowledge.\"\nThe first two fields of ecology an wildlife management are reasonable, but \"community knowledge\" is vague, and does not relate to expertise with respect to managing endangered species. While it is without a doubt some have an intimate understanding of the wildlife in a region, unless there is someway to verify the accuracy of that knowledge, it does not compare to the scientific expertise required to make assessments and recommendations for the management of endangered species.\n",

These proposed changes have been needed to bring a balance to some of the species that have been designated either special concern, threatened or endangered. Some of the assessments that the members of COSSARO have used to recommend changes to species designation that are common not only Ontario but surrounding jurisdictions bordering Ontario should not been allowed. I support that COSSARO's recommendations will after this ERO deadline closes will only be considered as advice to the minister and government. These changes will bring logic back to the for front in my opinion and only truly native species that are at risk will be properly designated and common sense will be used in the recovery strategy for such species. It is appalling to me how the liberal minded protectionist organization has been able to have their way with COSSARO and the ESA process. I thank the current government to have recognizance how these processes and Act have been miss used for anti minded agendas. I also thank the current Minister and current Conservative government for bringing to task those that are responsible for making sure these process are transparent and science based decision in the future. There are many examples how the considerations of a specie needs to be looked at to a broader lens to understand that a specie may appear to be at risk in portions of Ontario but in other Canadian and US jurisdictions is considered stable and very common. I applaud the changes proposed and look forward to some species designations being taken of the threatened or endangered list  like the grey fox, wolverine and Eastern wolf. The government may have to weed out the individuals that are  influenced by anti consumptive use groups and get back to listen to trappers, hunters and fisherman who are the true conservationist as demonstrated in the early 1900's when it was these groups not environmentalist that developed the North American Conservation Act. The government needs recognize trapping and hunting as a valuable management tool for resource managers to use to have health, sustainable populations of wildlife and fur-bearers that are managed for disease also. We need to manage these valuable species for the carrying capacity of the land and for people to harvest for organic food to feed their families and for wise use of pelts from as a value added part of trapping furbearers for management purposes. Hopefully this ESA will get back to be used properly for what its function and purpose was intended.Lots of user groups have become cynical of researchers and their biased based science that has been used for many species. Hopefully the Minister and government will demand that the government researcher remove their personal biases and let the research lead to the true conclusions or results of the work.

        "comment":"As a professional working in the field of environmental conservation, working directly with species at risk approvals, and as a Ph.D. in Ecology, I directly oppose the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act. I have selected a few key points to address below.\n\u201cRequire COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened.\u201d\nOntario is at the northern end of the range limits for many species assessed under the Endangered Species Act. Individuals of a species at the limits of their ranges are uniquely positioned to develop adaptations to the extremes of their climate and habitat requirements, potentially allowing range expansion into new geographic areas or climates. It has been demonstrated over and over that climate change is forcing species to either move with the changing climate or perish \u2013 with the increase in temperature this most often required species to expand range limits north to maintain the climate conditions in which they can survive. De-listing species at the northern edge of their range limit simply because there are more of them outside Ontario is missing the larger picture of the species requirements, and is short-sighted in that it is hampering the ability of species to adapt to future environments, and therefore putting them at greater risk in the future.\n\u201cthe proposed changes would provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species when the following specified criteria are met:\ni.\tapplying the prohibitions to the species would likely have significant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario so additional time is required to determine the best approach to protect the species and its habitat;\nii.\tthe temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario;\u201d\nSuspending protections of species under the Act for three years would be tantamount to dismantling the Act altogether. This discretionary power of the Minister to suspend protections for \u201csocial or economic implications\u201d leaves the door wide open for interpretation or manipulation of species protections when it becomes inconvenient for major development or industry. Species cannot be protected if we expect to be able to carry on as usual despite the presence of Species at Risk, and \u201cdeal with it later\u201d.\nThe second point, in suspension of protections will not jeopardize the survival of the species is nonsensical. The Act, and the species protections included exist because without them, the survival of the species is in jeopardy. If suspending species protections would not jeopardize the species, they would not be listed as Species at Risk.\n\u201cOntario is also proposing to create Canada\u2019s first independent Crown agency proposed to be called the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, to allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act. The funds would support strategic, coordinated and large-scale actions that assist in the protection and recovery of species at risk.\u201d\nThe vagueness of this \u201cConservation Trust\u201d has the potential to allow many species to fall by the way-side while the discretion of the Trust can direct funds to projects with a greater public appeal, or economic benefit. Any cash-in-lieu program should require regulations and oversight to ensure that the funds paid are directed toward recovery of the species put in jeopardy by the activity. It is too tempting, and human nature to fund projects that will support species the public are familiar with or already have affection for.\nAll Species at Risk require protection to maintain the diverse balance of our ecosystem. The changes proposed in this Bill leave the door open to focus on a few favourite species, and suspend protections or de-list species causing inconvenience.  The biodiversity of our ecosystem supports the balance of the planet. The species can be likened to the rivets holding an airplane together.  If one rivet pops out, that airplane is almost certainly still safe to fly. But keep popping more and more rivets, and where is the point at which you are not going to get on that plane? Given the recent release of information by the UN on the global state of Species at Risk, it would be embarrassing for Ontario to take such a huge step backwards with regards to protection of the species that have the misfortune to live within our political boundaries.\nPlease reconsider. Without our healthy ecosystem, there is no economy, there is no society. We need to protect from the ground up, for the future.\n",

They will not improve outcomes for species at risk. On the contrary, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.\nMore specifically, I do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting (eg. sections 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 16.1).  This includes opposition to the broadening of the potential membership of COSSARO beyond professional voices in the sciences of ecology and related areas. The proposed members with \u201cknowledge of the community\u201d could easily be chosen from groups with vested interests that run counter to the best interests of local species at risk.\nIn particular, and most especially, I strongly oppose the provisions, set out in sections 20.1-20.18, that allow developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats. This is a de facto hunting licence for endangered species. No amount of money in any fund will reverse the legally permitted local extirpation or broader extinction of a species at risk.\nImproving outcomes for species at risk requires reinforcement, not weakening, of the law. Species at risk have no voices to speak for themselves to government. Nor should developers, with vested interests that are very frequently in conflict with the existence of these species, be given a stronger voice in their fates. Protection of species at risk requires continued investment in science based stewardship rather than the writing off of species at risk and their habitats as impediments to \u201cprogress\u201d.\n",

The wording in the bill for increased responsibility wielded by \u201cthe minister\u201d.  This wording surrenders responsibility for listing endangered species from an arms-length, scientific body to a politician and is not acceptable.  The opportunity for exploitation by interested parties is astronomical based on this absolute power settled in one person\u2019s hands;\n2.  The extension of timelines makes the Act useless in protecting species at risk and allowing building proposals to go ahead before analysis of an endangered species is complete will lead to more extinctions;\n3.  The 2013 revision (O.Reg 242-08) allowing industry exemptions from the requirements of the act should be rolled back.  More protection is needed, not less.\n4.  The United Nations has recently issued a report warning of the potential and very likely extinction of over one million species.  This is not the time for Ontario to relax its standards on this important environmental initiative.  Humans are at risk when their natural environment is at risk.\n5. At the current time, and for many years Ontario has been economically prosperous even while maintaining the ESA in its current form.  The proposed changes are attempting to do more than \u201cfind efficiencies\u201d.  The proposed changes will gut the ESA and will cause the extinction of many of our at-risk species.\nThank you for reading my comments and please do the right thing.\n",

        "comment":"Comments on \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d ER Posting 013-5033\nThe Ford governments\u2019 false premise is that \u201cthe Endangered Species Act is getting in the way of development\u201d, which is why these changes have been proposed.  This is a complete untruth.  Not a single development application in Ontario has ever been denied because of the Endangered Species Act or because protected species were present.\nHere is another outright lie I have seen.   A spokesman from MECP commented that the government is making these changes based on what they have learned from a decade of implementation of ESA.  This is completely false because 1) the ESA was being implemented by MNRF and not by MECP, and 2) MECP refused to accept any of MNRF\u2019s advice regarding recommended changes that would improve ESA implementation.  MECP currently has 1 month of experience with ESA and the proposed legislative changes were released prior to transition of the legislation from one Ministry to the other.\nAnother false premise was stated online by The Ontario Federation of Agriculture.  The OFA claims they would like the ESA to be changed because it is a regulatory burden to farmers!!?  In my 10 years of experience implementing the ESA, there have not been ANY ESA permits issued to farmers, and to my knowledge the presence of a protected species has never prevented a farmer from continuing to farm their land.  The two species that are affected most by farming (Bobolink, Eastern Meadowlark) are subject to a PERMANENT ESA exemption, allowing farmers to kill them during the breeding season with impunity.\nChallenges in ESA implementation should be addressed through improved planning and investment in communications, program development and staffing, not environmental deregulation.  The government has moved the ESA to a new Ministry, cut the staff responsible for implementation by 2\/3rds, forcibly moved a number staff with no ESA implementation background to MECP from MNRF, and now proposes to gut the legislation even more, instead of following the recommendations provided through the ER consultation process and the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario\u2019s 2017 report (which was extremely well done and absolutely accurate in its examination of the poor implementation and enforcement of the ESA).   This is just completely irresponsible and certainly doesn\u2019t achieve the stated goal of increasing the efficiency of ESA implementation by any means.\nSince 98% of those who commented on the ESA Discussion Paper were in favour of INCREASED rather than decreased protection for species at risk, it is clear the government does not care what the \u201cPeople\u201d think.  Clearly this consultation and the previous one are meaningless, as the proposed changes included in Bill 108 will not be modified prior to enactment.  Even though our comments on the 10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper were completely disregarded, and that we believe this entire consultation process to be a sham, we are submitting additional comments on proposed Bill 108 so that our extreme concern with these changes will at least be a part of the public record.\nAssessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nThe current 3-month period allows for more than enough time for notification to proponents that are undertaking projects for which there may be additional requirements under ESA.  Putting rules\/regulations in place that would not necessarily prevent the development from occurring but would still require the proponent to explore options to mitigate impacts or protect known species occurrences to the extent possible seems reasonable and would achieve the goal of species protection without significantly delaying projects.\n3 months is more than enough to review status changes.  Increasing to 12 months only allows people to destroy any listed SAR before protection comes into place with no consequences.  Destruction of species and\/or habitats prior to protection being put in place has been observed extensively.  For clarification, ask any Ontario developer about the \u201cBobolink Clause\u201d, whereby they hired farmers to destroy extensive amounts of Bobolink and Eastern Meadowlark habitat on lands that were proposed for development, in order to avoid applying for permits under the ESA.\nThe Minister is not a scientist.  Most of the staff that work for the Minister at MECP are not scientists.  How are they qualified to form an opinion based on scientific information?  The Minister should NEVER be allowed to question the scientifically-based decisions of COSSARO.  Currently, COSSARO \u201cpiggybacks\u201d off of assessments prepared for the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).  As a result, several species in Ontario that are critically imperiled have never been assessed, and several species that have been assessed are extremely common on the landscape.  The government could consider investing money and\/or staff time into preparing Ontario specific status reports in order to gain greater clarification on the specific needs of Ontario\u2019s species, instead of trying to extract information out of larger Canada-wide reports that may not adequately address Ontario\u2019s species.\nLooking at the complete species range when assessing its status is a serious threat to Ontario\u2019s biodiversity and should not be part of COSSARO\u2019s assessment criteria.  This should criteria not be used to reduce the importance of protecting ALL of Ontario\u2019s species, regardless of their status in neighbouring jurisdictions.\nBroaden COSSARO member qualifications to include members who have relevant expertise in ecology, wildlife management, as well as those with community knowledge.  I offer a reserved yes, but only if these new \u201cmembers\u201d do not work as consultants or as lobbyists for development companies, as that is a direct conflict of interest and their expertise is bought and paid for.\nDefining and implementing species and habitat protections\nWhat would improve the protection process is when a species is likely to be assessed as threatened or endangered (e.g. where a species is federally listed as such), a general habitat description or habitat regulation, as appropriate should be prepared IMMEDIATELY so that it may be applied as soon as the species is listed, or shortly thereafter, to assist with habitat identification and protection.  This would allow for less uncertainty of the possible consequences of species listing.  There is absolutely no evidence that species listing or protection provides costly impacts to businesses and the public.  The environmental cost of not protecting these species far outweighs any other perceived cost.\nHabitat regulations are the preferred vehicle for delivering habitat protection, because they provide more certainty to both sides (government and proponent). However, developing a habitat regulation may not make sense for every species. For example, a species that is not likely to be impacted by land use changes or management activities.\nThe MNRF produced Taxa-based general habitat descriptions to assist with clarifying habitat boundaries for many species in 2016, but they have never been finalized and approved for distribution.  Finalizing these documents and making them available would assist greatly with improving certainty around habitat protection for species.  It would be easy to create some generic habitat regulations for species that are contained within these documents, though for some species, specific regulations will still need to be developed (usually for animals as they can have very different habitat requirements).\nIn addition, three years is FAR TOO LONG for any non-protection clause to be in place.\nThe only scoping of species protections that should be considered is for planted species at risk. At the current time, with the exception of Butternut, planted species at risk receive the same protection under the ESA as naturally occurring species. However, planting specimens are not considered during COSSARO assessments\/species listing.  It would be beneficial to create an exemption for all planted species at risk.\nDeveloping species at risk recovery policies\nWhen and why would the Minister need to extend the nine-month GRS development timeline?  Based on what criteria?  This just seems like an excuse not to produce something, with no requirements to provide any sound reasoning.\nIn many aspects, the current format of the Government Response Statement renders it an empty exercise that provides little support for clients or parties wishing to implement recovery actions.  It would make more sense to do away with the current format of the GRS and focus on creating a more prescriptive document that outlines specific implementation ideas for recovery and prioritization of actions based on the recovery plan that has been developed for a species.  This could include potential overall benefit activities that should be implemented for a species, costs of those activities, etc.  This would provide a much more useful tool to the government and to clients who are looking for species specific ideas that support species recovery.  In addition, the document should have specific timelines for when activities should be completed in order to show progress towards recovery.\nExtending the timeline for review of progress may make sense in instances where the ability to implement actions and detect results are long term. It may take more than one generation to show results and for long lived species the timeframe may need to be extended.  In addition, one could argue that endangered species should be the priority, given they are in a more imperilled state. Therefore, it may make sense to have significantly different timelines in which to provide documents such as recovery strategies for endangered and threatened species (i.e. more than just a 1-year difference).  Altering the timelines of reviews of progress will have little to no effect on the current poorly designed recovery implementation structure which doesn\u2019t allow for targeted recovery actions to be completed in a timely manner.\nIf the GRS or the recovery strategy had specific timelines included for the implementation of recovery actions, it would make more sense to do a review every 5 years to see which of those actions had been implemented and which ones should be a priority for the next five years.  As it stands now, the five-year reviews focus on permits and authorizations that have been issued for species, and there is little focus on recovery implementation.\nNeed clarification regarding which \u201cproducts\u201d are being referred to, that will no longer be posted on the EBR for comment.\nIssuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nThere is no science to support putting a monetary value on species at risk habitat. Who would be the appropriate authority to make this determination? How would habitat quality factor into this equation? If a species is \u201crarer\u201d, does this mean it is worth more?  In addition, the Ministry\u2019s avoidance-first approach may be undermined, as an option to pay for damaging\/destroying habitat and\/or impacting a species may be more desirable for a proponent then taking the necessary actions to minimize adverse effects and achieve an overall benefit through the permitting process.\nAdditional Changes relating to Issuing Permits, and to Agreements and Regulatory Exemptions\nRemoving the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert in the \u201cD\u201d Permit process seems strange considering in the 10-year history of the ESA, only one D permit has been issued.  Still, we do not agree that the Minister should be granted the power to determine whether a project is of benefit to the province of Ontario without outside consultation.\nWhy is there a need to broaden the approach to minimizing adverse effects for permits and agreements?  First, the majority of agreements referred to under the ESA are no longer applicable authorizations under the current legislation.  Secondly, this is a vague statement.  It is not clear what broadening the approach to minimizing effects means.  Also, since most of the minimizing effects applied to species are based on untested methods, this is not a recommended approach.\nThe transition provision for allowing existing Endangered Species Act permit and agreement holders to continue to operate for twelve months following the application of new species or habitat protections is absolutely unacceptable, as it would provide no protection for some species at a particularly vulnerable time.  This could allow for complete destruction of important species populations or habitats, with absolutely no requirement to even minimize the effects on species.  In ALL cases, permit applicants or holders are aware of upcoming species protections and as such, they do not need to be further exempted from legislative rules under the ESA.  Most amendments are administrative or due to the applicant failing to abide by existing permit conditions, not due to species listing changes.\nLandscape agreements could work in very limited cases, but in most cases, species at risk habitat damage\/destruction does not lend itself to habitat banking readily, because even a \u201clike for like\u201d habitat replacement is challenging. In cases where science is limited (e.g. wetland creation for Blanding\u2019s Turtle) or habitat may take hundreds of years to re-create (e.g. mature forest for bat maternity roosting), habitat banking may not be a suitable option.   However, in cases where sufficient science exists to re-create habitat in the short-term (e.g. Bobolink), habitat banking may be an appropriate authorization tool.  In such cases, habitat banking could be a niche market whereby creative and innovative people create good quality functioning habitat, and then \u201csell\u201d the habitat to an entity in need of habitat creation.\nLandscape-scale authorizations for harmful activities should rarely replace project-specific authorizations. This type of approach doesn\u2019t lend itself to addressing site-specific or species-specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.\nThe development of additional ESA exemptions is not recommended, as the current ESA exemptions are not monitored, not enforced and not based on any accepted scientific practices or documented mitigation techniques.  There is no oversight of these exemptions and no monitoring as to the prolonged detrimental effects of these exemptions on species at risk.\nAgain, the Minister is not a scientist, and neither he, nor the majority of staff at MECP, have the scientific knowledge to make these types of decisions, nor should they have the power to independently create regulations that could be harmful to species at risk.\n",

Biodiversity and the protection of species at risk and their habitats, are of critical importance in maintaining healthy ecosystems across the province\u2019s wilderness and other natural areas. Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act is a key element in maintaining the province\u2019s biodiversity and protecting its species at risk.\nComment on Proposed Changes to the ESA\nWe are dismayed by, and state our strong opposition to, the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act outlined in the ERO posting. These changes do not address the deficiencies in the current act that the Quetico Foundation and numerous other environmental organizations discussed in submissions to the previous stage of the 10th year review process in March 2019. Instead, the proposed changes are clearly meant to permit unfettered development on the part of industry and municipalities by eliminating or downgrading the limited existing protections that are currently afforded to species at risk and their habitats.\nWe object to all of the following proposals, each of which will weaken the act, increase the threats to species at risk and their habitats, and reduce the chances of recovery:\n1.\tChanging the composition of the COSSARO so that it is no longer scientifically based, by adding members with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d.\n2.\tChanging the basis of species classification from the status of a species in Ontario to its status in its overall range. This may result in the extirpation from Ontario of many species with a northern limit to their range in Ontario.\n3.\tAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers under certain circumstances the option to pay into a fund in lieu of protecting species at risk and their habitats.\n4.\tQuadrupling the time when listing of a species is to occur following submission of a COSSARO assessment (from 3 to 12 months).\n5.\tRemoving automatic protection for species at the time they are listed.\n6.\tIncreasing Minister\u2019s discretion in a number of areas. For example:\n(a) Minister can delay protection for up to 3 years for newly-listed species if protection will likely have \u201csignificant social or economic implications\u201d.\n(b) Minister can require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species. During the re-assessment the species would not be listed, delaying protection.\n(c) Minister can prescribe activities by regulation, to allow them to be carried out without requiring any additional authorizations under the ESA.\n7.\tRemoving the mandatory legislative requirement and timeline to develop a habitat regulation proposal for each newly-listed threatened or endangered species.\n8.\tExtending timelines for Government Response Statements, and Reviews of Progress towards protection and recovery.\n9.\tProviding a new transition provision for existing Endangered Species Act permit- and agreement-holders to continue to operate (i.e. to ignore the provisions of the act) for twelve months following the application of new species or habitat protections.\nBiodiversity and numerous species are currently under grave threat globally (United Nations, Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, 2019, Nature\u2019s Dangerous Decline \u2018Unprecedented\u2019: Species Extinction Rates \u2018Accelerating\u2019) and in Ontario (Environmental Commissioner for Ontario, 2018, Special Report, Laying Siege to the Last Line of Defence: A Review of Ontario\u2019s Weakened Protections for Species at Risk). It is critical that the Ontario government play a meaningful role in addressing these issues. The province\u2019s Endangered Species Act must reflect the gravity of the situation.\nWe ask that the proposed changes to the act be withdrawn, and a meaningful process be undertaken to consult with the scientific community on how best to revise the Endangered Species Act to improve, rather than downgrade, protection for species at risk. In particular, the following changes which are based on our submission of March 2019, and which are similar to recommendations made by many other environmental groups, should be implemented.\nQuetico Foundation Recommendation for Changes to the ESA:\n(1) Exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and other industries that were put in place in 2013 must be eliminated, as they are a major threat to the recovery of species at risk and are inconsistent with the aims of the act to protect and restore endangered species and their habitat.\n(2) The current science-based nature of the COSSARO listing process must be maintained, and must not be replaced by a process that includes non-scientific or political input (e.g., ministerial discretion).\n(3) In order that protection for species at risk be put in place in a timely fashion, the COSSARO review and listing process should not be lengthened.\n(4) As the timelines for development of Recovery Strategies and Government Response documents are critical to the recovery of a species at risk, these timelines should not be lengthened. Currently, these documents are often late, and more resources must be made available to meet the deadlines.\n(5) As it is important to closely track the success or failure of a recovery effort over time, the current 5-year Review of Progress schedule should be maintained.\n(6) Mandatory protection of habitat for threatened and endangered species must be maintained. Habitat protection must not be an arbitrary political decision (e.g., ministerial discretion).\n(7) The current requirements of overall benefits for species at risk must be maintained, and developers must not be permitted to evade their societal responsibilities by paying compensation for harming species at risk or their habitats.\n(8) General habitat descriptions only deal with the area currently inhabited by a species, whereas habitat regulations can include areas that were formerly occupied or where there is potential for the species to become re-established. Therefore, it is especially important to develop habitat regulations for species with a limited range or that need to expand their range to ensure their long-term survival.\n(9) Strategies must be developed and resources allocated to address the currently inadequate implementation of the provisions of the ESA, to ensure adequate compliance monitoring and enforcement, and to increase public consultations.\nSincerely,\nFraser Reeves\nExecutive Director, Quetico Foundation\n",

Just one of many species this bill risks stripping protection away from.\nWildlife biologists and conservation policy experts were most alarmed by a provision that requires the committee of scientists that recommends species-at-risk listings to the ministry to look beyond Ontario\u2019s borders at how the species is faring elsewhere. If considering the condition of the species outside Ontario would result in a lower level of concern \u2014 for example, a \u201cspecial concern\u201d designation rather than \u201cendangered\u201d \u2014 the committee must use the lower classification. (3)\nSection 6 and 8 of the bill establishes the Species at Risk Conservation Fund, otherwise called the \u201cpay to slay\u201d plan. To use the plover example, a developer can develop plover habitat and then pay towards a generic fund to protect some other random species rather than the one being impacted by the landscape agreement. How can any species be protected when there is always an option to pay to destroy habitat? Section 7 gives other options to developers to bypass prohibitions under sections 9 or 10 of the original act. Section 3 allows the MoE the ability to suspend section 9 and 10 prohibitions up to three years. In effect, Bill 108 has undermined the intention behind the Endangered Species Act, which was to preserve flora and fauna in Ontario for future generations, leaving some natural areas undeveloped.\nI am alarmed at the loss of species to date in Ontario, Canada and the world. Insects, those creatures at the bottom of the food chain that include pollinators, beneficials and soil creators, have had huge declines (windshield phenomena). A 2017 WWF study notes an 83% decline in vertebrates in Canada since 1970, and specifically a 69% decline in grassland birds, 51% insectivores, 43% shoreline birds. COSEWIC states 44% of amphibians and 65% of reptiles are endangered or threatened. Not to mention that when we remove trees and plants from the environment, we reduce carbon being extracted from the air, contributing to global warning.\nI disagree with Bill 108 schedule 5 for its providing the right of destruction of habitat with a potential to drive more Ontario species to extinction, ignoring the warning of scientists of the risks to humans from this destruction. Destruction of natural habitats causes biodiversity to fall to unsustainable levels.  In response to the notion that Ontario doesn\u2019t currently  have enough space to build cheap housing,  I observe that in Vancouver, recent taxes on foreign ownership drove down rental prices, providing reasonable options for affordable housing. (4)  Our last remaining protected natural spaces, including farmland, should not be rezoned and should be protected from urban sprawl. We should develop areas already zoned residential without targeting the last remaining pristine spaces. And yes, I want piping plover rearing their young in the Great Lakes.\nreferences:\n(1)  https:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20190423-one-million-species-risk-extinctio\u2026\n(2)  https:\/\/www.stockholmresilience.org\/research\/research-news\/2015-01-15\n(3) https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/news\/gta\/2019\/05\/04\/sweeping-changes-buried-in-\u2026\n (4) https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-6932243\/Vancouver-college-kids\u2026\n",

I have followed environmental issues throughout my teaching career and I have witnessed a steady degradation of laws and policies that aim to protect our precious environment.  This time the attack is on the Endangered Species Act.\nThe current government wants to make things easier for businesses to increase profits, but at the expense of loosening the policies to protect Ontario species.\nFor example, the MECP wants to allow developers and other business interests to pay a fee so that they can proceed with actions that can harm Ontario species. I do not believe money is the most precious thing on earth.  I believe life in all its forms is more valuable than money.  Forget the fees and protect our species at risk.\nThe new proposal aims to limit ESA protections so that they apply only in specific geographies or under specific circumstances.  This kind of loophole could exclude important habitats and species from protection.\nThe Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario is made up of qualified scientists who follow the scientific method in determining whether a species is at risk.  Now MECP is proposing to include people who are not scientists on this committee.  This could allow people who have a self interest to degrade species protection to join this important committee.\nMECP could suspend species and habitat protections for up to 3 years based on social or economic considerations.  These delays would be exempted from EBR posting and consultation requirements. Thus the public would receive no notice and no input on such decisions.\nMECP proposes to allow activities approved under other laws to be carried out without any additional authorizations under the ESA, even if they harm threatened or endangered species or their habitats.  This could lead to permanent exemptions from the ESA.\nI am tired of our government officials' relentless push to compromise our environment for the sake of doing business.  Is it not obvious by now that the health of our living environment has been decimated in the name of doing business?  To give a stark example of this decimation I recently read from \"Falter\" by Bill McKibbon published in 2019:\n\"... if you weigh the earth's terrestrial vertebrates, humans account for 30% of their total mass, and our farm animals another 67%, meaning all wild animals ... total just 3%.\"\nIn light of this brutal and depressing fact, when does restraint make its appearance in the business world? I strongly urge the current government not to gut the current ESA.\n",

        "comment":"I do not agree with the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act.  If anything, I believe the Act should be STRENGTHENED in order to protect the biodiversity of our natural environment.  A good majority of this is due to loss of habitat due to our insistence on urban sprawl.\nIn particular,\n- membership of COSSARO should not be broadened to include those with 'community knowledge' as they may have a different agenda.\n- there should be NO payments into a fund to disregard the Act and no issuing of permits to circumvent the Act.\n- there should be no limit to the Act based on a specific geography or under special cirsumstances.  The population of an endangered species needs to be protected everywhere.  If we only have one geographic location where that species is plentiful, the species is still at risk.  Especially if that one area affords no protection.\n- suspending species and habitat protections based on social and economic considerations is very short-sighted.  The costs associated with the loss of biodiversity are not just monetary.  Biodiversity is the key to our survival as a species.  There have been many examples in recent years when one particular crop\/tree\/plant is attacked by a disease or pest to a point of destroying a good portion of them.  Having additional species of plants allows us to substitute until such time as our food crop has recovered, if it does.  For example, pine beetle, emerald ash borer, dutch elm disease.  What if crops of wheat, corn and soy were hit with something?\n- the listing, planning and reporting of species at risk needs to be done in a shorter time frame.  In order to do this, the process will need to be made more efficient.  It currently takes a significant amount of time to add species to this list and during that time, their numbers are dwindling.\n",

        "comment":"Because of the potential loss of formatting in this comment box, I am abbreviating some of my comments, which are fully explained in the attached pdf document (I'm not sure if it was successfully attached...the attachment box doesn't seem to do anything).\nDear Public Input Coordinator,\nI am writing to submit commentary on the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act.\nCOSSARO Member Qualifications:\nFirst, it would be appropriate to change the term of \u201caboriginal traditional knowledge\u201d to \u201cIndigenous traditional knowledge\u201d in the ESA to reflect current preferred terminology (note the capital \u201cI\u201d in Indigenous).\nSecond, lumping the undefined term \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d in the same clause as \u201caboriginal traditional knowledge\u201d undermines any acknowledgement of the unique value of Indigenous traditional knowledge as a way of understanding the natural environment.  The addition of the term \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d in the same clause (b) threatens to harm already strained relations between the provincial government and Indigenous Peoples and is not in line with the spirit of truth and reconciliation commitments.\nIf the term \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d is added to the ESA it must be defined to ensure that the potential COSSARO member with such knowledge can contribute appropriate expertise to the committee.\nRather than add \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d as an eligible form of expertise for COSSARO membership, a much more effective way to incorporate community knowledge into the assessment process would be to create a new staff position for a Community Knowledge Liaison within the secretariat supporting COSSARO: someone to coordinate the solicitation of community knowledge and disseminate it to COSSARO committee members in a way that allows for efficient follow-up should there be questions on the nature or details of the provided information.  As is, this kind of outreach is beyond the capacity and scope of work of the current COSSARO members and support personnel.\nConsideration of Broader Regional Context in COSSARO Assessments:\nIn the assessment criteria used by COSSARO, (derived from the COSEWIC criteria, which in turn are derived from the globally recognized IUCN standards for species at risk assessment at the regional level) provisions are already in place to upgrade or downgrade species listings based on the regional context.  These adjustments take into account specific ecologically relevant situations that could elevate or lower a species\u2019 risk of extinction (or extirpation in the province) such as the likelihood of propagule migration from adjacent jurisdictions, evidence that such propagules would be adapted to conditions within Ontario, availability of suitable habitat for propagules to become established in Ontario and the dependence on outside populations as sources for a species\u2019 population that is considered a \u201csink\u201d in Ontario.\nThe complex decision framework illustrated in Figure 1 of the COSEWIC assessment criteria, which is currently used to guide COSSARO species assessments is a much more ecologically defensible way of articulating the circumstances that warrant up-listing or down-listing a species assessment.  Furthermore, at the international level, there is a committee (IUCN SSC Regional Applications Working Group) that continually reviews and updates the assessment guidelines for regional species at risk assessments.  If a change in the framework of Figure 1 is warranted, it would be updated by the IUCN (and subsequently adopted by COSEWIC) and could easily be adopted by COSSARO without any need for a future amendment to the ESA.\nRather than writing such a complex decision-making pathway into the law, it may be more worthwhile arranging a training session for COSSARO members (and open to members of the public who wish to observe) on the application of IUCN regional assessment criteria that allow for downgrading assessment categories when rescue effects are possible and plausible (and conversely upgrading categories when regional populations are known to be \u201csinks\u201d).\nAs is, the proposed blanket requirement to down-list a species solely because consideration of its status in other jurisdictions may produce an alternative outcome of the assessment process is ambiguous, impractical, and ecologically indefensible. First, it is unclear what is meant by \u201cconsider\u201d, \u201ccondition\u201d, and \u201cbiologically relevant geographical range\u201d outside of Ontario.  It may be possible to interpret this to mean that COSSARO would have to conduct two assessments: one using population size, trends, range, and population projections within Ontario; and another using population size, trends, range, and population projections for Ontario and the wider \u201cbiologically relevant geographical range\u201d.\nThis interpretation of the proposed wording would require COSSARO to consider information that it doesn\u2019t readily have available.  On a purely practical level, it is already time consuming for a committee of quasi volunteers to extract the Ontario-specific information from the COSEWIC reports for assessment of a species at the provincial level (particularly when a species exists in Ontario as well as another province or territory).  If the condition of the species in American jurisdictions must also be considered in a COSSARO assessment, obtaining data from all relevant parties will be logistically very challenging and costly for the limited number of staff who provide secretariat support for the Committee.  Furthermore, the quality and format of the data may not allow for direct comparisons of the species condition in Ontario versus in its \u201cbroader biologically relevant range\u201d, however that may be defined.\nThis proposed change is likely a reaction to public comments that question why efforts must be made to protect species that exist in Ontario at the edge of their range. British Columbia used to automatically downgrade the status of species at the periphery of their range in that province.  However, this policy was repealed based on a number of scientifically supported notions that identify the ecological and social value of edge-of-range subpopulations (see Fraser, 2000  for full details).\nAnnual Report\nIt seems reasonable to request one annual report from COSSARO in January as long as the latter [Clause 3(b)] is respected and the Minister and COSSARO can agree to what constitutes \u201cimminent\u201d.  According to the definition within the ESA, \u201cA species shall be classified as an endangered species if it lives in the wild in Ontario but is facing imminent extinction or extirpation.\u201d Therefore, one could reason that COSSARO could submit an additional report to the Minister outside of the stipulated January timeframe any time that it classifies a species as Endangered.\nReconsideration\nSection 8(2) of the act already has provisions for the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider a species classification.\nPresumably the change is proposed because the stipulation of withholding a species from the SARO List while being reassessed is the salient point.  To remain consistent with the precautionary principle, the species for which a reassessment is requested should be added to the SARO List within the same timeframes as all other listings until its reassessment has been finalized.  Given that the ESA proposes a 12-month grace period for SARO Listing from the time the Minister receives the COSSARO report, conceivably sufficient time is available for COSSARO to reassess a species and submit a report to the Minister on the outcome of their reassessment (provided that the Minister has and makes available the \u201ccredible scientific information\u201d upon which he or she bases his or her opinion).\nPresumably from the wording of \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d report, that a reassessment can only be required once.  It is not clear what would happen should the Minister still disagree with COSSARO\u2019s reassessment.\nIt should be noted that the \u201ccredible scientific information\u201d upon which the Minister bases a request for reassessment should be so significant that it would indeed influence the outcome of a reassessment and is beyond the scope of information that would be considered for the regular cycle of species reassessments.  For instance, one additional year of breeding bird monitoring data should not be considered sufficient as the basis for a reassessment, since the timeframe for decline in the assessment criteria are 10 years or 2-3 generations (depending on which criteria are being applied).  This is the reason why species are re-evaluated on a 10-year cycle.\nAmendments to regulation (timelines)\nI would recommend the Minister consider a compromise on this and other extensions to timelines contained throughout the proposed amendments of the ESA.  It is understood that it has been impossible for MNR staff to keep pace with the current framework for listing species on the SARO List and the subsequent timelines for preparing recovery strategies, government response statements and progress reports.  While one solution would be to adequately resource the Species at Risk Branch to do so, I suspect this solution would not be supported by the current government.  An alternative would be to devise a system to triage efforts so that they address the species facing the most imminent risk of extinction\/extirpation and affording longer timelines for staff to address those species with lower risk.\nThe new timelines stipulated in the proposed amendments could delay SARO Listing by up to 2 years (or longer if reassessments are requested) and subsequent protections under Section 9(1) and 10(1) for up to 3 additional years.  Recovery strategies (to be created within 1 year species listed on SARO as Endangered, and within 2 years for those listed on SARO as Threatened), Management Plans (to be created within 5 years for those classified as Special Concern or when a federal recovery plan is available), Government Response Statements (to be issued within 9 months of completion of a recovery strategy or management plan) and Progress Reports (within 5 years of the Government Response Statement) retain the same timeframes as previously identified in the ESA though mechanisms to extend these timeframes remain available and the criteria that must be met in order to do so have been reduced in the proposed amendments.\nBy definition, endangered species face imminent extinction or extirpation.  For these species, time is of the essence to address the factors leading to their decline.\nPresume a species was evaluated in May 2020.  A report to the Minister would not be accepted until January 2021.  If the Minister is of the opinion that this assessment is not appropriate, it will likely take at least an additional 4 months (May 2021) before it can be reassessed by COSSARO.  The Minister then has 12 months (May 2022) to amend the SARO List. Under Section 8.1 (5)(b) a variety of rationales can allow suspensions of the prohibitions in subsections 9(1) and 10(1) to be in place for up to 3 years (May 2025).  At best, a species listed as endangered that was subject to a re-evaluation and three years of suspensions of prohibitions will have seen nearly 30% population decline in the 5 years between assessment and protection. This is in addition to the losses that would have triggered the species to be classified as Endangered in the first place.  Note that this is at the lower threshold of the A2-A4 criteria for Endangered, meaning that any Endangered species with a faster rate of decline risks losing a much higher proportion of the population over the same timeframe.\nI recommend that the current government demonstrate that it truly does wish to provide \u201cbest-in-class endangered and threatened species protections\u201d by shortening timelines for listing those species most in need (i.e., Endangered species: those facing \u201cimminent\u201d threat of extinction\/extirpation) and maintaining or extending current timelines only for Threatened species. Because threatened species have a lower rate or probability of decline, it may be acceptable for the Minister to extend timelines for the addition of these species to the SARO List only if doing so enables fast-tracking the timelines for Endangered species.\nEnvironmental Bill of Rights\nAs stated by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario (2013) , \u201cThe Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993 [EBR] has a key transparency function; the EBR entrenches the rights of the public to receive notice of and provide input into environmentally significant acts, regulations and policies\u201d (p. 34, emphasis added).  Throughout the proposed changes to the ESA where posting on a government of Ontario website is substituted for publishing a notice on the EBR, the opportunity for public input is lost.  The removal of opportunities for public input eliminates a key avenue for the government to be accountable to the public and to enable the public to participate in the protection and recovery of species at risk. To enable public input and accountability, I recommend that all references to posting information on the EBR be kept in the ESA and added where relevant to proposed amendments.\nSpecies at Risk Conservation Fund\nWhile investments in species protection and recovery as well as the accountability structures detailed in the proposed amendments related to this Fund are to be applauded, there should be a commitment that this form of \u201cbiodiversity offset\u201d is to be considered as a very last resort and, at very least, result in no net loss.\nThe ESA should explicitly commit that between the permits, agreements, and funding, there will be a net gain to species at risk in Ontario.  Mechanisms should be put in place for both the permitting and funding components of the ESA to track and quantify the net gains or losses associated with the permitting allowed by this \u201cpayment in lieu\u201d system.  If net losses are found to be the result of this scheme, it should be redesigned or abandoned in lieu of in situ species conservation (i.e., prohibiting development proposals that fail to protect the species and habitat in their current location). Net gains or losses should not be measured as simplistic areal extent of habitat lost versus created, as the quality of habitat and whether it is actually successfully occupied by viable subpopulations is more indicative of success. Although complex to measure, indicators that are relevant to the species at risk classification system should be used, such as numbers of mature individuals, survival rates, reproductive rates, area of occupancy, and long-term viability of the mitigation project.  Payments charged for the permission to undertake activities contravening Sections 9(1) and 10(1) of the ESA should reflect the cost of administering, planning, implementing, monitoring and reporting on activities that have a net benefit to the species and habitats being lost through the permitting process.  If these true costs are considered, the proponents may well find that it is more cost effective to design development projects that protect the species and habitats in their current state.\nThank you for the opportunity to provide input on the proposed amendments to the ESA.  I trust that you will give sincere consideration to these suggestions and uphold the opportunity for Ontario to offer best-in class protection to species at risk in the province.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing as a concerned citizen of Ontario to implore a reconsideration of Bill 108.  I am a 30 year veteran of the healthcare sector, as well as a zoology PhD candidate.\nThe omnibus Bill (108), offers many benefits and new opportunities to land developers and associated industries.  However, the Bill also has far-reaching consequences, in particular for the quality of our natural environments as well as the protection of our endangered species.  This omnibus Bill alters 15 existing Bills and Acts, it is noteworthy that a full third of these are Bills and Acts that enshrine environmental protections that have made Ontario the \u201cgold standard\u201d in environmental policy and brought the Ontario Government immense respect in the international conservation community as a whole.\nOur Endangered Species Act (ESA) is built on 3 important foundation blocks: an evidence-based and science-supported process to assess and list vulnerable species, immediate and automatic protections of these listed species and their habitats, and mandatory planning and implementation of recovery strategies.\nThe  proposed revision of the ESA is riddled with inconsistencies, circular logic, and a complete lack of evidence as to tangible benefits the revisions will offer justifying changes resulting in the following:\n1.\tWeakening of the classification process for species at risk\n2.\tDiscretional power given solely to the Minister to delay automatic protections for endangered species without rationale\n3.\tAssessing which species are at risk by distribution, without consideration of the many interrelated factors that define and maintain distribution\n4.\tPlacing the onus of protection outside of Ontario, relying on the assumption that such parties will engage in species conservation\n5.\t Allowing non-scientific and non-expert participants to join COSSARO\n6.\tIndefinitely delaying the release of Government Response Statements about species at risk, while limiting, in some cases eliminating, scientific and public consultation\n7.\t Reducing transparency\n8.\tCreating a pay-in-lieu fund for developers to circumvent being held accountable to recommendations under the ESA\n9.\tRemoving the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert and get cabinet approval\n10.\tCreate \u201clandscape agreements\u201d for developers who seek to build multiple projects in one area\u2014an arrangement that inherently limits oversight and accountability\n11.\tReduce or eliminate second party oversight, an essential element of transparency, and the fiduciary responsibly of a Government to its constituents\nAn Example: the case of Listing based on Species Distribution\nThe current Bill introduces numerous detrimental revisions and new policies, while providing no rationale or scientific support for their implementation.  A few weakly shingled examples (gray fox, barn swallow) are offered, based on speculative information, or incomplete presentation of scientific fact.  One example is the concept of total geographic distribution of a species.  The Bill suggests that consideration of distribution alone provides a reliable index of species condition, and therefore a useful listing criterion.  This \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 approach demonstrates a complete ignorance of the complexities of species\u2019 population and behavioural ecology.   Total distribution is a static snapshot of individual observations that are mapped geographically.  It relies on census and tracking information which is limited by available resources both for implementing population studies, and for following population dynamics over decades.  Relying on a total distribution approach to justify delisting species-at-risk omits the following factors regarding range, and whether range alone is sufficient to determine the health and\/or risk of a species:\n-\tDensity versus area\n-\tAbundance, both overall and as patterned throughout distribution\n-\tGenetic exchange\n-\tMigration\n-\tDay range, versus home range, versus population range, versus total range\n-\tGenetic diversity, both as a whole, and by local population\n-\tThe periodic effect of catastrophic and stochastic events\n-\tThe effect of disrupting historical gene flow amongst adjacent populations\n-\tEdge effects\n-\tPotential pseudoreplication of observations inflating abundance\nOne need look no further than examples of many of the great National Parks of the world where habitat fragmentation is correlated to a precipitous decline in genetic heterozygosity, immunological health, as well as fecundity and resilience in many of the world\u2019s most charismatic species. These data are easily found and can easily be provided.\nAs a concerned Ontario citizen, and in the spirit of Canada\u2019s commitment to maintaining its biodiversity, I urge the Government of Ontario to reconsider the proposed revision of the ESA as it is presented under Bill 108.  To endorse such a Bill without intense scrutiny and debate is reckless.  Bill 108 will have longstanding outcomes that will be difficult if not impossible to repair.\nRespectfully yours, a concerned Ontario citizen\n",

I want my grandchildren to be able to enjoy that beautiful land and wildlife that I have had the opportunity to live in and around.  With headlines in the paper announcing 'One million species face possibility of extinction' and 'Critics sound alarms over Ontario government review of endangered species act' (just two from the past few months), it is not an exaggeration to say that is these changes are made it will be absolutely devastating to the wild life and wild places in our province.  The is absolutely unacceptable.  We need to make better choices for not only the sake of our province, but of the planet.\nThank you.\n",

As a farmer for the past 50 years I have tried to live in harmony with nature and maintain ecosystem functions for all species while providing food for our tables. It can be done...yes, I would be richer if I simply plowed up all of the 300 acres I farm, but the fence rows, trees, fallow friends provide habitat and make our lives richer in other ways.

        "comment":"This is a stupid idea, unethical,  murderous, and will only result in the destruction of anything that makes Ontario and place to visit. Canada is known for its wildlife and multitudes of ecosystems. With this new \"strategy\" you are effectively destroying the very thing that is going to attract people to Ontario.  I have seen people look at something and complain that it is there (i.e trees along the lakeside) They demand removal and the town gives in. Then they complain about the and blowing the town build fences to create sand dunes, then the people complain more and they plant native grasses to \"solve\" the problem but now the people are complaining again because the lake levels are high and erosion had occurred. Only they are not blaming the high water instead they are blaming the grasses which do not cause erosion but prevent it.  The main point is that giving in to the people will not solve anything because people will always complain leading us to consider options, such as this, which will only create more problems than we already have. What the focus should be is with educating people in towns and communities about these this. NOT WITH SIGNS. I can tell u that nobody reads those.\nWhat you need is to have someone outside on, lets say the beaches, telling people that 'no the grasses are not bad but a good thing', or' no, bulldozing the sand will not make it better for the beach but will actually destroy it and anything that lives there' and \" yes, what lives on these beaches are important because they contribute to things, such as the piping plover, they will eat the invertebrates that live along the shoreline which include, worms, insects (fly larvae and beetles), crustaceans, mollusks and other small marine animals and their eggs.'\nThis will appeal to them since nobody wants to swat at flies while they are trying to enjoy the beach so no you do not want to ruin the shorelines because the community people and those who are unknowledgeable in ecology decide that they know better when really they don't.\nEverything in this world is connected, if you destroy one thing it will come back to bite you in the butt later on just you wait, this decision will be the greatest regret of your life if you choose to approve it.\n",

        "comment":"Ontario currently has strong protections for endangered species - something that we should be both proud of and uphold to ensure future generations are still able to experience biodiversity as we do.\nThere are so many issues currently affecting our planet, from climate change, to pollution, to overdevelopment of vulnerable spaces; each of these greatly affects the ability of flora and fauna to thrive. The proposed changes to the ESA will only make this more difficult.\nAs someone who works in the wildlife rehabilitation field, I see the impacts of human activity on wildlife on a daily basis. We continue to build in ways that is devastating wildlife - for both common and endangered species. From migratory birds (many of which are endangered) colliding with windows, to threatened turtles being hit by cars (all 8 of Ontario's turtle species are on the Species at Risk list), to a family of baby mallards falling into a sewer drain with no way to escape, to goslings jumping from the 10th floor terrace of a building built near water, to a hibernaculum of hundreds of threatened milk snakes being dug up for new development; every day wildlife have to try to survive despite human infrastructure that doesn't take wildlife into account when it's built.\nYour government is proposing making development even easier, even when it could threaten the very existence of particular species. While changes to the ESA have been craftily worded, it is clear that wildlife is no longer the priority and that your government is willing to sacrifice Ontario's beloved wildlife to help developers. I do not support this.\nWhile I do not agree with any changes to the ESA, I am deeply concerned about broadening COSSARO membership to those without specific scientific knowledge of wildlife conservation. Deciding how to protect endangered species cannot be based on opinion, the needs of business, or gaining political support; this is not an issue that can include the voice of every sector, especially sectors (e.g. development) that will reap financial gain from destroying the habitat of vulnerable species. Developers should also not be allowed to pay a fee to destroy habitat and endangered species. No amount of money will bring a species back from extinction, and, while I understand the government intends to put this money toward the protection of other vulnerable species, you cannot expunge one to save another - it makes no sense.\nFurther, appointing the Minister with additional powers to change species listings based on science, as well as suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years based on social or economic considerations could be the death knell for many species - 3 years is an incredibly long time not to act in the interest of a wild species when their very existence is threatened. And politicians should not be in the business of deciding which species are important to save and which are not. Additionally, removing the requirement for government to consult with scientific experts in the field when changing regulations that could potentially affect a species is reckless. It is important to know what we don't know in life, and I can assume that most politicians know very little about the challenges facing wildlife and vast number of plant species, and how to protect them; it's therefore bewildering why this important part of the ESA would be changed; once again, it seems it is only to benefit developers with deep pockets.\nI urge you to reconsider the proposed changes to the ESA and leave it intact, or even strengthen it further. I would like my 5-year-old son to grow up in a province that protects wild animals and plants so that he too may enjoy them into the future. There is nothing inspiring about the removal of forests, farmslands, grasslands, waterways and other habitat only to be replaced by poorly planned subdivisions , plazas and other abysmal development in it's place.\nI don't vote Conservative and I likely never will. So I'm not asking you to uphold the ESA to get my vote. I'm asking you to do it because it's the right thing to do to protect the vulnerable flora and fauna that will be deeply at risk if these changes go through. We can't go back. Please do the right thing now.\n",

My family and I have tried to create more natural habitat and encourage wildlife on our farm but this cost has come out of our own pockets. Over the last few decades I have seen more and more natural habitat destroyed to either be replaced by housing, commercial enterprise or agriculture. Why do we put more land into growing more food when almost half of the food we grow winds up in the landfill?  Personally, I am terrified. If we don\u2019t start taking drastic  and immediate action we will reach a point of no return. We need to protect MORE areas for rehabilitation. If the Canadian government can find BILLIONS of dollars for an ecological and environment travesty known as the Kinder Morgan  pipeline then why on earth can the same government not find money to compensate farmers who set aside land and invest in re-establishing wild habitats ???

I urge you to rescind the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act: keep scientific committees staffed only by scientists,rs; do not ignore threats to any Ontario species just because it happens to do OK elsewhere (for now); do not sell off critical species and habitat protection to businesses for payment to a \"fund\"; and do not add delays and reconsiderations that would waste critical time and endanger species further.\n1. Keep scientific committees staffed exclusively by scientists to avoid distorting knowledge. Community opinions are not knowledge. Science is the only way to find the facts reliably, so that everyone can check, even community members. Community members can write to scientists to explain what they think they know. Scientists can test if it is really knowledge or opinion. Adding community members to science committees can bias the results based on self-interest. Given the money at stake, some community members may even try to bully the scientists. Self-interest and policy opinions have their place - in open public discussion, in light of the best available science.\n2. Do not discount the threat to a species just because it happens to exist (for now) outside of Ontario. Habitat diversity ensures vital genetic diversity. Ontario is a critical route for species to move north due to climate change - we must not block that route just because some members of a species still survive south of us.\n3. Do not sell off critical habitat or species protection to businesses in exchange for contributions to a \"fund\". Habitats and protections are not interchangeable. Moving species can endanger them further.\n4. Do not add delays and requests for reconsideration to the Act. Foot-dragging and needless work for scientists will endanger species, not save them.\nThe planet's suffering from a Great |Extinction of species. The total number of animals (other than humans) has shrank by more than half in 40 years. And climate change is making things worse. Ontario must do its part to save Earth's life diversity - on which our own lives depend.\n",

Eight (8) years ago a proposal was made to dig a 2,400-acre quarry 200 feet deep on prime vegetable land.  Farmers, First Nations, locals, weekenders, Chefs, artists, musicians, and anyone who could see the importance of Ontario\u2019s food and water security came together to protect the land.  In October 2011, \u201cFoodstock\u201d attracted 28,000 people to Melancthon Township, just north of Shelburne.  In 2012, 40,000 people joined us in downtown Toronto for \u201cSoupstock\u201d.  The furor was so great that the quarry proposal was withdrawn in November 2012.\nToday NDACT\u2019s mandate through the Food & Water First campaign is to protect our food land and clean water sources for future generations by promoting good legislation and land-use planning.\nTo that end, North Dufferin Agricultural and Community Taskforce (NDACT) must speak out against the regressive changes proposed for the Endangered Species Act, R.S.O. 2007 (ESA):\n\u2022\tNDACT concurs with Environmental Defence, Ontario Nature, and the David Suzuki Foundation in their critique of the proposed changes.\n\u2022\tNDACT acknowledges that Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act is world-class legislation being one of the most comprehensive endangered species laws in the world.\n\u2022\tNDACT observes that the proposed changes would undermine the intent of the Endangered Species Act.\n\u2022\tNDACT is concerned that the proposed changes would open our government to inconsistency and corruption by introducing \u201cpay-to-delay\/pay-to-slay\u201d policies.\n\u201cPay-to-Delay\/Pay-to-Slay\u201d\nThe Government of Ontario is proposing changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) that would give the Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks sweeping powers.  Under the proposed amended legislation, the Minister would be able to:\n\u2022\tQuestion the classification of species as presented by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO).\n\u2022\tDelay the listing of species on the Species at Risk in Ontario (SARO) List up to 9 months, and possibly until January of the following year.\n\u2022\tInfluence COSSARO through broader member qualifications beyond scientific expertise and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n\u2022\tProvide inconsistent species protections at the Minister\u2019s discretion rather than automatic protections upon listing.\n\u2022\tTemporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to 3 years for some newly-listed species upon subjective criteria.\n\u2022\tScope species protections based on specific geographies or circumstances.\n\u2022\tMake species-specific habitat regulations.\n\u2022\tExtend and delay the 9-month Government Response Statement.\n\u2022\tIgnore Government Response Statements as \u201cadvice to government\u201d and \u201cpolicy direction\u201d rather than make a firm legal commitment.\n\u2022\tExtend and delay the review of progress towards species protection and recovery.\n\u2022\tInfluence the board of the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, a new agency proposed to allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a charge in lieu of completing activities required by the ESA.\n\u2022\tInfluence and approve funding directed by the trust.\n\u2022\tAssume the role\/avoid the oversight of the Lieutenant Governor in Council regarding endangered species.\n\u2022\tAvoid the requirement to consult with experts.\n\u2022\tRevoke existing protections.\n\u2022\tDesignate enforcement officers.\nIn summary, the proposed changes would reduce, delay, weaken, over-rule, by-pass and provide less enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.\nConclusion\nNDACT objects to the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, 2007 that open the law to arbitrary and subjective decision-making by the Minister.  With the average term of office of the Minister being less than two (2) years, decisions by the Minister are likely to become inconsistent and appear capricious based on political climate resulting in unfair application.  The Minister holds a politically engaged position and thus could be influenced by the political climate especially regarding election funding.\nToday it is too easy to wipe out decades of decision-making at the stroke of a pen.  NDACT asks the Government of Ontario to consider First Nations\u2019 seventh generation principle and look beyond the narrow view of today\u2019s \u201copen for business\u201d economy.\nNDACT would also like to acknowledge the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993, and the importance of keeping decision-making transparent and accountable through the Environmental Registry.\nToday\u2019s decisions are our legacy for future generations.\nAbout NDACT\nNorth Dufferin Agricultural and Community Taskforce (NDACT) is a grassroots group formed in 2009 by local farmers and residents to defend Melancthon\u2019s prime farmland at the headwaters of five (5) rivers from a proposed mega-quarry.  After a successful campaign, NDACT continues to fight for farmland and source water by developing awareness, encouraging people power, and by promoting better legislation for today and for the future.  Food & Water First is a campaign of NDACT.\n#ProtectPrimeFarmland #ProtectOurWater #ProtectOurGreenbelt\n#FoodAndWaterFirst\n(ero.ontario.ca\/notice\/013-5033)\n",

        "comment":"Dear Hon. Minister Phillips:\nPlease accept these comments as part of the public consultation on the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act.\nInstead of strengthening the ESA, your proposals would weaken it and make it easier for individuals and industries to degrade and even destroy critical wildlife habitat.  The objective of the Act is to protect and recover species at risk, not to merely lessen our impact on them.  There are already numerous exemptions and mechanisms for a wide variety of industries to proceed with harmful activities.  The underlying framework for the ESA must be based on sound scientific evidence and expert analysis.  This means that a number of the proposed changes are not consistent with that premise.  Here are my comments on specific items from the proposals:\n1. Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nD. Allow the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species where the Minister forms the opinion based on scientific information that the classification may not no longer be appropriate.\nMy Comment:  The authority of COSSARO must be maintained together with science-based listings and automatic protections.  There is already a provision in the Act for ministerial-initiated review should a listing not be warranted, but \u2018reconsider\u2019 in this context means \u2018change\u2019 and will lead to politicization and undermine the Act.\nE. Require COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened.\nMy Comment:  This will allow endangered species to be neglected in parts of Ontario which places stress on their resilience and impacts overall biodiversity in those areas.  Climate change makes this especially hard on species that have southern Ontario as the northern limit of their range.\nF. Broaden COSSARO member qualifications to include members who have relevant expertise in ecology, wildlife management, as well as those with community knowledge.\nMy Comment:  What does community knowledge mean?  This is vague and without clear guidelines can open the process to unqualified individuals with agendas other than the protection of species in mind.\n2. Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nA. De-couple the listing process from automatic protections and provide greater Minister\u2019s discretion on protections\u2026  provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years\u2026\nMy Comment:  As in 1.D., the authority of COSSARO must be maintained.  Furthermore, by the time the protections are granted after such a long delay, it may be too late.  This delay also opens the door to influence by those with agendas that do not have species protection foremost in mind.\n4. Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nOntario is also proposing to create Canada\u2019s first independent Crown agency proposed to be called the Species at Risk Conservation Trust\u2026 The price for the payment-in-lieu (i.e. regulatory charge) will be within the range of costs that a client would have otherwise incurred through meeting the species-based conditions of an authorization\u2026Clients would still need to fulfill some on-the-ground requirements\u2026\nMy Comment:  If the price and some of the requirements for payment-in-lieu are essentially the same as those that were required in any case under the current legislation, then what is the net benefit of the change, other than to provide interested parties an easy way out and reduce accountability?  Instead of specific, targeted action to protect species \u2018on the front line\u2019, these funds may end up being allocated in ways that don\u2019t address those immediate needs and place species in even greater peril.\nFinally, I join many other Ontarians in mutual concern for all endangered and threatened species in this province and respectfully ask that you take these comments into consideration and not weaken the Act.\n",

        "comment":"Hello and thank you for allowing me to comment on the proposed changes to the ESA.\nMany species are declining across the world and in Canada. The province of Ontario is not immune to these declines; there are currently more than 200 species at risk (SAR) in the province. The main purpose of the ESA should be to protect species, not to expedite development. Any changes to the ESA should be made with great care, as without diligent legislation there is a risk of additional habitat loss and population declines. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extirpated from Ontario, and such losses to our natural heritage are unacceptable in the face of so many other unmitigated threats to biodiversity. Ontario has an opportunity to be a leader in biodiversity conservation, with an ESA that is the gold standard to which other jurisdictions aspire.\nI agree that the public should be notified quickly of COSSARO\u2019s species\u2019 assessments, but listing should be immediate. Waiting one year after the species is listed could result in harmful effects on the species. We must stress that a lot of these species, particularly amphibians and reptiles, are already facing rapid declines, so immediate protection is strongly recommended. We also strongly disagree with the possible suspension of listings for up to three years, as such long delays could allow large developments and lack of mitigation, potentially wiping out populations of species that should be listed but whose listings have been unnecessarily delayed. Furthermore, threatened and endangered species should have habitat regulations, as these species are especially vulnerable.\nCOSSARO is an independent committee with expertise in scientific disciplines and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (TEK), and these individuals take great care and consideration when making decisions about which species should be listed as at risk. I do agree with broadening member qualifications, but this should not take away from the legitimacy of the organization. The current proposal calls for including those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d \u2013 a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have unbiased expertise in species assessment or that have a different agenda altogether. We still strongly oppose that the minister should be able to overrule decisions made by COSSARO, as such veto power explicitly undermines the arms-length scientific approach that is supposed to be used to assess species.\nI also strongly oppose COSSARO being required to base its assessments on the status of a species throughout its range, as opposed to in Ontario only. For species that have a small portion of their range in Ontario, these populations often present unique adaptations and reservoirs of genetic variation, facilitating resilience to climate change. Loss of our Ontario populations means loss of global diversity in the species. As Aldo Leopold said, \u201cTo keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.\u201d Allowing species to be wiped out in Ontario simply because they occur elsewhere is short-sighted.\nThe Species at Risk conservation trust could be a powerful tool under some circumstances, but there is great room for such a program to be abused. This trust could allow for areas facing development to be developed by simply paying into the trust as opposed to protecting the resident species at risk. Such a proposal runs the risk of jeopardizing the social license that many large companies currently have. If companies are seen to be \u201cbuying\u201d the right to destroy the habitat of endangered species, they will be viewed as poor corporate citizens and likely lose business in the long term. Under certain circumstances, SAR habitat may be lost, and such a program could result in compensatory habitat creation elsewhere. In those cases there should result a net gain in quality SAR habitat for the same species. Net gains or losses should not be measured as simplistic aerial extent of habitat lost versus created, as the quality of habitat and whether it is actually occupied by viable subpopulations is more meaningful. Although complex to measure, indicators that are relevant to the SAR classification system should be used, such as numbers of mature individuals, survival rates, reproductive rates, area of occupancy, and long-term viability of the mitigation project.\nThe proposed changes include amending the act to strike out \u201cthe environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d and substituting \u201ca website maintained by the Government of Ontario\u201d. Such a change would mean that the opportunity for public input is lost.  Removing opportunities for public input eliminates government accountability to the public and prevents the public to participate in the protection and recovery of species at risk.\n\tLastly, I agree that better enforcement is necessary to protect SAR. There is a strong need for enforcement of the ESA through fines and if necessary, incarceration.\nThe purposes of the ESA are:\n1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.\n3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.\nI believe that the proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. Given that, I strongly advise you to reconsider the proposed changes and further consult with the public and professionals, to use a collaborative and transparent approach to responsible development while also protecting SAR.\n",

        "comment":"RE: ERO # 013-5033, ONTARIO GOVERNMENT\u2019S BILL 108: SCHEDULE 5 (Changes to the Endangered Species Act)\nA. GENERAL COMMENTS\nChanges proposed by the Progressive Conservative Government to the Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA) are likely to have long-term adverse impacts (including the possible extirpation of species at risk (SAR) from Ontario).  Such changes are an insult to what was considered to be a \u201cGold Standard\u201d for protection of at-risk species and their habitats when the ESA was enacted in 2008.  The Act has already undergone severe weakening, with the introduction in 2013 of a large number of exemptions to regulations under the Act in order to facilitate permissions for industrial activities such as forestry, mining, and aggregate extraction.\nProposed changes to the ESA are far too important to be hidden in an omnibus bill such as Bill 108 (More Homes, More Choice Act, 2019).  Surely, after so much backlash against recent proposed environmental changes by the Progressive Conservative Government (e.g. Bill 66), the government must be aware of the widespread opposition by Ontarians, who take a long-term view, about the impacts of these changes on the natural environment and its associated health and economic benefits.  Short-term gain by business with short-term interests is going to mean long-term pain for future generations of not only humans but also other species.  As has been mentioned by others, this is a \u201cDoomsday Scenario\u201d for species at risk, and the proposed changes could make the amended Endangered Species Act become an \u201cExtinction of Species Act\u201d.\nIt behooves all MPPs and Ministry officials to read the UN\u2019s May 2019 \u00a0Report on the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the summary of which was approved at the 7th session of the IPBES Plenary, meeting last week (29 April \u2013 4 May) in Paris.  For details visit https:\/\/www.un.org\/sustainabledevelopment\/blog\/2019\/05\/nature-decline-u\u2026.\nB.  SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSALS IN BILL 108\nAssessing and listing species at risk\nScience-based listing of species at risk by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) and automatic protection of listed species and their habitats are cornerstones of the ESA. They provide certainty, whereas ministerial discretion politicizes the process, inviting delay and controversy.\nThere should be no change to the ESA regarding the listing process and the role of COSSARO. The law sets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of \u201cthe best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\u201d (section 5(3)).  Allowing the Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks to require COSSARO to reconsider its science-based listing decisions is an insult to highly qualified people with scientific expertise.   Broadening the COSSARO membership to include people without scientific expertise is not required, and could be detrimental to species assessments.\nEdge-of-range species should not be denied protection based on their status outside Ontario.  SAR at the northern limit of their range in southern Ontario, could result in these species receiving less or no protection, depending on their status outside Ontario.  Climate change is allowing species to move further north, so it will be important for these species to have their required habitats protected from development.  Populations at the limit of a species\u2019 range may play an important role in the evolution and overall fitness of a species. The provincial government could wipe its hands of responsibility for species such as Jefferson Salamander, Bobolink, Spiny Softshell Turtle, American Badger and Cucumber Tree.\n2.  Species and Habitat Protections\nThere should be no de-coupling of the process of listing SAR from the automatic protections provided under the ESA for threatened and endangered species and their habitats.  Nor should the Minister be allowed to suspend species and habitat protection for up to three years based on social or economic considerations.  That is, there should be no alternative to automatically protecting threatened or endangered species and their habitats upon listing.\nThe Minister should not be allowed to remove or delay protections because this would be inappropriate and could invite political meddling.\nThe Minister should not be allowed to limit protections so that they apply only in specific geographies or in specific circumstances.\n3.  Species at Risk Recovery Policies\nLegislated timelines are intended to ensure that actions needed to recover species occur without undue delay.  There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce Government Response Statements (GRS) within nine months of the release of Recovery Strategies for threatened or endangered species, or Management Plans for special concern species.  There is already a chronic problem with failure to meet legislated deadlines, and this should be addressed through improved implementation, not weakening of the law.  The Minister should continue to be required to conduct a review of the progress toward the protection and recovery of species not later that five years after publication of a GRS.\n4.  Permits, agreements and exemptions to allow harmful activities\nThis is the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act, and the priority must be on the protection and recovery of SAR.\nThe ESA currently sets a high standard for permits, based on providing and overall on-the-ground benefit to species negatively impacted by development.  The standard for exemption is much lower and requires only mitigation of harm.  Proposed changes to the ESA would make it easier for industry and development proponents to proceed with harmful activities.  This is contrary to the ESA, the purpose of which is to protect and recover species at risk.  Where harmful activities are allowed, authorizations should be premised on providing of an overall benefit to the species.\nNo new tools are needed for authorizing harmful activities.  Challenges should be addressed through better implementation of the existing tools.\nDevelopers and other proponents of activities harmful to SAR will be allowed to pay into a \u201cSpecies at Risk Conservation Fund\u201d in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the ground reparation for damage done.  This could be interpreted as \u201cpay to pave over habitat of SAR\u201d, rather than resulting in \u201cconservation\u201d of SAR as the outcome.  It reduces accountability and facilitates harm to SAR and their habitats .  On-the-ground reparation for damage done should be compulsory in order to provide an overall benefit to species harmed.\nThe existing requirement to obtain Cabinet approval or to consult with an independent expert regarding section 17(2)d permits should be retained, to ensure that such permits are issued only in exceptional circumstances.\nRetain the requirement for the Minister to seek an independent opinion on regulations that might jeopardize the survival of a species in Ontario.  Without this requirement, it would be easier for harmful activities to proceed in the absence of proper scrutiny.\nThe ESA (section 18) provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks, based on the standard of providing an overall benefit to species negatively impacted.  Species will continue to decline unless this standard is maintained.\n5.  Enforcement\nThe government\u2019s proposal to apply inspection powers to harmful activities allowed through regulatory exemptions is an improvement.  Such inspection power is lacking under the current ESA legislation.  A much more effective way to improve outcomes for SAR would be the removal of the regulatory exemptions put in place in 2013 that have enabled over 2,000 of these harmful activities to proceed in the first place, without inspection or enforcement (see comment in the opening paragraph of these comments).\nIt appears that the main goal of the changes is to make approvals speedier for the sake of businesses that plan to expand in or move into Ontario.\u00a0 Getting a fast \u201dno\" answer on a particular location is often as good as a slow \"yes\" answer.\u00a0 Businesses are often fast, flexible, and sincerely looking for Ministry and scientific expertise on questions of natural and environmental issues.\u00a0 The Ministry and review processes should be managed optimally and resourced generously in order to provide fast and solid answers for business.\u00a0 This kind of speedy government turnaround would bring laurels to Ministry leaders and the government responsible for this enlightened approach.\u00a0 Such a system should be fully optimized before any changes are made that risk harming our irreplaceable natural heritage.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\nNature London\nLondon, Ontario\n",

        "comment":"I have lived or worked in the natural spaces of Canada for most of my life and in many provinces including close to two decades in Ontario. The review of the ESA is welcome.  I was around when this legislation was passed by the former Liberal government and witnessed the gloating by the group of ENGOs that lobbied and who largely wrote the legislation.  This legislation is completely unbalanced, places single species like caribou ahead of ecosystems, northern citizens, their culture and their socio-economic welfare.\nIt has been a relief that forest management has been exempted three successive times under section 55 of the ESA.  The former Liberal government originally gave this exemption in recognition of the chaos and destruction that would result from the ESA application to broad forest landscapes.  Is a sense it was recognition of the fundamental flaws in the legislation.  Unfortunately this situation remains and the proposed amendments to Section 18 do not create certainty around our use and enjoyment of the forest for sustainable pursuits.\nI have watched successive leaders in the MNRF make promises for balance and inclusion in the development of regulations under the ESA.   Meaningful involvement by stakeholder has yet to happen despite these overtures over more than a decade.  I can only surmise that these repeated promises have been put to the side because the MNRF knew that the ESA would kill jobs, close mills and damage many northern communities.\nThis is why a Section 55 exemption for forestry needs to be permanent.  Ontario has an amazingly diverse forest which remains home to hundreds of communities and species. It has been this way for centuries.  Our policy and legal environment for the conservation of our Natural Environment is second to none.  Don't change that by imposing a new law that will put one of a few species ahead of all others.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 108 Schedule 5 and these proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act are set to leave our most vulnerable species and ecosystems without adequate protection. While the proposed changes are framed as ways to improve efficiencies and provide \u201cbest-in-class\u201d protection for species at risk, this is highly misleading: these changes would instead be massive steps backward and pose real threats to already threatened species.\nWe need to take action to strengthen, not weaken, our current protection. Many of the supposed challenges this proposal aims to address could be remedied through improved implementation of the Act, not through undermining it. Instead of adding more exemptions, the time is now to repeal the 2013 exemptions and strengthen the Act back to its original gold-standard. The United Nations recently released a deeply troubling report warning that over one million species are facing extinction over the next decade. This accelerated and \u201cunprecedented\u201d rate of extinction is driven by inaction over climate change, habitat destruction for development, overfishing, pollution, and invasive species. These are all human-caused problems with human solutions. Beyond recognising that biodiversity has its own intrinsic value, we rely on it for our clean drinking water, for the food we eat, and the air we breathe. Green infrastructure provides billions of dollars of ecosystem services that often go unrecognized until they are lost. A massive conservation effort is needed now and we do not have time for this inaction and destructive policy change.\n1. Do not instate the Species at Risk Conservation Trust. This will only make it easier for industry and development to move forward and this is inconsistent with the Endangered Species Act.  Protection and recovery must be the priority. The description that these funds would go towards activities that are \"reasonably likely\" to support protection is concerning. We need strong protection and confident language in this Act. The Minister should also not have discretion as to how and where these funds are spent: these should always be science-based decisions. The fact that these changes are proposed to give \"greater certainty to business\" speaks volumes.\n2. Do not open up COSSARO to \"community knowledge\". This is inviting corruption . We do not want to see those with inadequate expertise making decisions that will affect the protection or extinction of species at risk. Science-based assessments are critical. Do not allow the Minister to interfere with the listing of species at risk.\n3. Do not base the assessments on the status of a species throughout its range. This is Ontario's Endangered Species Act. This change would affect the majority of species at risk in Ontario. Here in Hamilton, for example, we are at the very northern limit of the Carolinian Life Zone, which makes the Hamilton area a unique biodiversity hotspot - one of the greatest areas of biodiversity in Canada. The genetic diversity of the plants and animals living here will be critical as species migrate with climate change, as these individuals are best adapted to the northern conditions. If we are completely careless with the habitat now, the populations moving north will suffer in the future too.\n4. Do not allow the Minister to have so much discretion and ability to meddle. Do not decouple automatic listing and species protection. The proposed changes invite weak oversight, less transparency, and self-regulation subject to political whims and the influence of powerful lobbyists. The ESA already allows the Minister to request a review of a COSSARO decision if credible scientific information indicates the listing is not appropriate. Maintain mandatory habitat protection without Ministerial discretion.\n5. Do not create landscape agreements. This does not address site-specific or species-specific concerns and presents unwarranted additional risk of species already in peril.\n6. Do not allow activities to avoid the ESA thanks to any other authorizations. We do not want to see permanent exemptions for industries like the forestry or mining sectors. Repeal the exemptions from O. Reg. 242\/08 and strengthen the ESA. As habitat loss and degradation are the primary factors threatening species, this is a dangerous precedent with the added hazard of reduced accountability.\n7.  Continue to require that the Minister consults with an independent expert prior to creating regulations that would jeopardize the survival of a species, or issuing permits for harmful activities that would provide a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario.\n8. Do not allow for the multiple proposed delays to the listing and reporting timeline. With the accelerated extinction rate brought to light in the new UN report, we do not have the time for this.\nTake Endangered Species and Climate Change seriously. The time is now to take action, not undermine existing legislation.\n",

The added 9 months introduces the possibility of further damage by contractors and builders looking to hurriedly build in Endangered Species' habitat. The Act should remain as follows: \"Within 3 months of receiving the report from COSSARO, the Minister must add the species to the SARO list. As soon as the species is added to the list, the Endangered Species Act immediately prohibits the killing, harming, harassing, etc. of species that are endangered or threatened and also prohibits the damage and destruction of their habitat.\"\nC] If the COSSARO is required to submit their annual report to the Minister only between January 1-31 of each year, many species will have to wait until the following year to be added to the list. Basically your 12 month timeline becomes 24 months! This is unacceptable. January 1-31 is in the middle of winter. Surely no valuable information can be obtained on any non-arctic species in the middle of winter in Canada! Species evaluated in their appropriate life-history season will not get the protections they need until much much later - this is unacceptable.\nD] By suggesting the Minister can require COSSARO and scientists to reclassify a species based on \"their opinion\" is irresponsible. Ministers are elected politicians, not likely to be scientists. What is meant by \"scientific information\"? Is the Minister going to be reading peer-reviewed journals? If so, how likely are those studies to have been conducted in Ontario, and how applicable are the findings if not conducted in Ontario, and will the Minister have the capacity to interpret that? Leave the science to the scientists.\nE] This point is ridiculous. You cannot use abundance data from other populations outside of Ontario to assess the endangered status of species within Ontario. It's foolish, and would be akin to saying \"well, we have a pretty good captive population of Polar Bears in the Toronto Zoo, so we're going to take them off of the SERO\". Of particular concern to this point are migratory animals such as birds and fish.\nF] Great, this should be applied across politics in general! Ministers should have the appropriate experience in the field for which they oversee. Eg. Education, Veteran's Affairs, Indigenous Affairs etc.\n2)\nA] So your plan is to make sure scientists conduct the assessments, but then you're going to let the Minister (with perhaps no scientific experience) have discretion on protections and veto-power? This is insane. A recommendation from the scientific community should be taken with more than \"a grain of salt\". Having criteria for suspending habitat and species protections for up to 3 years but failing to define \"newly listed\", as well as including an \"other criteria as specified\" category is literally the worst idea I've ever seen. Instead, let the scientists who conduct the assessments make recommendations on habitat and species protections. That would be the best idea, since they are the experts.\nB] See 1E] and 2A] above.\nC] What is the timeline? When the COSSARO submits their report the Minister, the Minister has 12 months to add the species to the SARO list, but how long to develop the species and habitat protection plan? This is vague and worrisome. Especially since you've used wording such as \"geographies\" which relate to my comments on 1E] above.\nD] No. The Minister will most definitely NOT be qualified to make species-specific habitat regulations. Allow the COSSARO scientists to make recommendations and have the Minister select one of the options.\n3)\nA] Extend the timeline to what? No. Don't change the 9-month development timeline\nB] Sure. But all policies moving forward should explicitly state \"on recommendation from scientists in the field...\".\nC] No. Let the scientists evaluate the progress and provide recommendations to the Minister based on species status and recovery progress. The review timeline should remain unchanged (within 5 years)\nD] I don't know what you mean by \"posting\", but public access to information sounds good.\n4)\n\"Ontario is also proposing to create Canada\u2019s first independent Crown agency proposed to be called the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, to allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act. The funds would support strategic, coordinated and large-scale actions that assist in the protection and recovery of species at risk\"\nNO. FULL STOP. This Conservation Trust idea allowing developers to pay money to circumvent actions and conservation activities required by the ESA will be catastrophically damaging to species at risk in highly sought-after areas. For example, the Carolinian Prairie Grassland and Forest habitat in Southern Ontario between Tobermory, Toronto and Niagara Falls is home to many endangered species and is itself one of the rarest ecosystems in the world. It is highly sought-after for real estate and industry (ie. farming) because of its fertile lands, and in fact 7 million people already live in it! Allowing developers to pay an up-front fee in lieu of conservation efforts would allow them to profit in the long-run and exploit this area's delicate and finite resources. Unacceptable. If you do this, you can expect MANY more environmental protests in regards to building projects such as the Niagara Falls \"Riverfront Community\" project.\nA,B,C,D,E,F] No, to all. No special work-arounds! Everyone must adhere to the current ESA.\nG] Assuming the Minister is qualified, sure. But see my above comments relating to Minister duties 2A]\n5) \"minimize social or economic impacts\", so what? - We are ALL stewards of Earth. There is no point in economic profit in the here and now unless there is a future to look forward to. What we need to do is to work together and find a solution that promotes sustainable growth. Economic, social, environmental sustainability now, to protect and preserve the environment for future generations. If we took all the money we've wasted in the last 10 years on arguing with one another over policy for the energy sector or smear campaign ads (Ontario's anti carbon tax ads costing us $30 million?!) and instead invested it in renewable and sustainable energy and technology research, imagine where we'd be as a nation and province! We'd be a world leader in conservation, sustainability and renewable energy. Canada would be GREEN, red and white. That's the Canada I want.\n",

I care about the future of endangered creatures in Ontario and I believe we should be doing our part to protect them and support their recovery. I urge you to change course and do the following:\n- Keep the scientific decisions for scientists ONLY. Do not open the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario to non-experts.\n- Do NOT allow a pay-to-proceed conservation fund that will let big business opt out of protecting species.\n- Instead of extending timelines for government action, work harder to get plans to recover species implemented right away.\nMy Ontario is a place for wildlife, and a place for rare and endangered animals to recover and survive. Do not take us back a decade in species protections with these dangerous and regressive changes.\n",

        "comment":"Re: Allen & John Lee Forest Products Continues to Ask for Permanent Recognition of the CFSA as\nan Equivalent Process to ESA by Adopting a Section 55 Regulation into the ESA; Response to ERO\nNumber 013-5033\nPremier Ford, Minister Phillips, and Minister Yakabuski,\nOn behalf of Allen & John Lee Forest Products, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th\nYear Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes, ERO number 013-5033. We look\nforward to continuing to work with your government to modernize and improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We are optimistic that this will result in improved outcomes for species at risk while ensuring Ontario is a place to grow our renewable forest sector, unleash its full potential and provide good-paying jobs for our people. However, the vagueness of the proposed changes does not provide necessary business certainty.\nThe 10th year review of the provincial Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides government with a rare\nopportunity to chart a course for the next decade and beyond. Political decisions on this will have far reaching social, economic, and environmental impacts for generations to come. Therefore, the most\nimportant action the government must take remains permanent recognition of the Crown Forest\nSustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through Section\n55. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and\nprotecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.\nIn March, we asked that this essential first step be accomplished in your Government\u2019s legislative\nchanges to the ESA. However, the proposed changes indicate that a Section 18 Regulation will be the\nauthorization process for forestry, instead of a Section 55 Regulation. For the past 10 years, we have\nconsistently asked for a permanent Section 55 Regulation as the authorization process for the forest\nsector. The former government recognized that the CFSA and the ESA cannot be harmonized and\nprovided a workable, temporary solution that was defended in court. We are asking the Ford Government to take this workable, temporary solution and make it permanent.\nWe are asking that you revise the proposed legislative ESA changes to acknowledge that Section 55 will be the authorization mechanism for forest operations on Crown lands. Instead, MECP appears to be pursuing a revised section 18 \u201charmonization\u201d instrument which is at odds with our request. This bold move, like your support for other industries and activities with the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, would send a positive message to the forest sector and Allen & John Lee Forest Products.\nIn addition to this critical revision, it also remains necessary to ensure the following requirements be\nembedded in a new, modernized ESA:\n1. Consideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy\n2. Cumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy\n3. Socio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and\nFirst Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented\nThe sector will continue to operate under the CFSA which, by law, requires, forestry operations to follow an approved forest management plan. Guides delivered under the CFSA include operational prescriptions and conditions, which may include reserves, modified operations, or specific conditions on road use and construction in the area near a species at risk and their habitat.\nSince the establishment of the ESA, we have been clearly and consistently outlining what is required for permanent, long-term certainty within Ontario\u2019s forest sector and for our northern and rural communities. In order to avoid catastrophic socio-economic impacts, we need permanent, legislative recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy. It is our expectation that these required changes will be made and adopted into the new ESA legislation that you are passing.\nWe would be happy to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the best path forward to\nensuring positive outcomes for species at risk while keeping people in this province working.\nSincerely,\nJohn Lee\n",

        "comment":"I have been reading a number of articles in the press recently regarding your government's proposed changes to the endangered species act. I don't like what I am reading. In fact I am appalled by it. Its hard to know where to start.\n- Under the new law land owners, developers and municipalities will be given the option to buy a permit to destroy habitat. This is not a theoretical risk to me. Near where I live, on the shores of Lake Huron, the town of Sauble Beach is currently prevented from destroying the habitat of an endangered species called the piping plover. The existing endangered species act prevents the town from doing this. Under the new law the town can simply pay a fee and then destroy this bird's habitat (its only habitat in Ontario).\n- Under the new law a species that is endangered in Ontario can be removed from the endangered species list if it is not endangered in some areas outside of Ontario. That would be a horrible change. It reduces Ontario's  bio diversity and robs Ontarian's of some of our natural heritage.\n- Under the new law, the committee that decides which species should be on the list, will be filled with non scientific experts in the area of species at risk determination. I can easily imagine a committee soon to be filled with developers pairing the list in order to make way for  roads, housing developments, mines, logging etc etc. No thank you.\nArguments to change the law based on \"open for business\" ,  \"good for jobs', \" improved efficiencies\", \"reduction of red tape\" are simply a price that is too high to pay.  Your government is moving in the wrong direction. The recent UN report that projects the extinction of 1 million species globally in next few decades proves this. For the sake of your grandchildren and mine please abandon this law and instead write a new law that really does strengthen the protections of Ontario's species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my deep concern and, quite frankly, absolute outrage over your government's proposed, regressive, changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act.\nAt a time where it is very, very clear \u2013 to anyone who doesn\u2019t have their head in the sand  \u2013 that species are disappearing at a catastrophic rate,  your government chooses to make decisions that set the clock back 100 years.      Obliterating the Endangered Species Act, which is essentially what these so-called \"amendments\" do, wasn't tabled at election time, so why is this being proposed now?     I understand it will be easier for developers  to bulldoze and contaminate natural habitats, but how do the rest of us benefit from this open season attack on endangered species proposed in Bill 108?\nBelow is a link to the Ontario Government's own website where it clearly states \"more than 200 species of plants and animals are at risk of disappearing from Ontario\", right now - today.      None of them will be around much longer, thanks to these proposed amendments.\nhttps:\/\/www.ontario.ca\/page\/species-risk-ontario\nThere is a reason the Endangered Species Act was created in the first place - to protect what little we had left of our biodiversity in Ontario.    Nothing has changed in that regard - we still need this Act in its entirety, more than ever.\nAllowing developers to \"pay to slay\" is criminal and a complete disregard of what the majority of taxpayers want (does this government not remember the backlash at election time when Ford was caught promising to open up the greenbelt to developers?).     And I certainly do not see the benefit in allowing a Minister, especially someone with no science background and clearly, no regard for the environment in the first place, to have some form of veto power.\nTaxpayers don't need leaders trying to run the government like their own private business. We need government leaders with vision.  Leaders who understand the long lasting and often irreversible impact of their decisions.  Leaders not in the back pocket of a chosen few beneficiaries.   Leaders who will protect our land, our water, vital natural habitats and yes, the other species we share it all with - you can't have one without the other.\nAs the  Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks,   Rod Philllips is chiefly responsible for protecting and improving the quality of the environment for all Ontarians.   He should be championing environmental conservation efforts, not dismantling them.     He and his staff should be the first ones arguing against the amendments proposed in this Bill as they are not aligned with the Ministry's purpose.\nALL aspects of schedule 5 pertaining to the Endangered Species Act should be removed from Bill 108.     It is shameful that these amendments - a deplorable attack on vulnerable species -  are even being tabled in this day and age.\n",

In addition, if MECP has any \ttrained \tbiologists or ecologists they would understand that it is difficult or impossible to \treintroduce many species to an area, so once a species is removed from an area, in many cases \tit cannot be repopulated with that species.\nb)\t\u201cProvide greater Minister\u2019s discretion on protections, while keeping the assessment as a science-based process at arm\u2019s length.\u201d\nMinisters should not ignore independent scientific information. Expert advice in the area of \tendangered species should be given the highest priority, especially given the recent UN report by 100\u2019s of experts from 50 countries who have identified over 1M spp. are at risk of extinction over the next few decades. This has implications to our food and water supplies, amongst other things.\nc)\t\u201cprovide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species when the following specified criteria are met: \u201c\nA three year period is too long and could render a species extinct. Live, endangered species should be treated just as sacred, if not more so, than finding artifacts which would render a stop work order.\ni)\t\u201capplying the prohibitions to the species would likely have significant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario so additional time is required to determine the best approach to protect the species and its habitat;\u201d\nSignificant needs to be defined. In many people\u2019s minds significant social\/economic implication could be defined as a species going extinct. Based on the responses on the EBR most would find spp. at risk to be significant. However, human population and home construction does not seem to be scarce, or at risk of decreasing.\nii)\t\u201cbroad distribution in the wild in Ontario \u201c\u2013\nas mentioned this is a short sighted and flawed line of reasoning ie. isolated populations may become a distinct spp. over time.\niii)\t \u201cadditional time is needed to address the primary threats to the species, or co-operation with other jurisdictions is necessary to reduce the primary threats to the species\u201d,\nAs mentioned, once an endangered species is identified, a stop work order should be issued until such time as protection can be established. Primary threats are usually human induced. Using a moral code with integrity vs a monetary code should expedite the assessment of these situations.\nd)\t\u201chabitat regulation\u201d-\nIf the purpose of this is an ecosystem approach for multiple spp., I think that would be a \tpositive approach to be used on a larger scale.\ne)\t\u201cGive the Minister discretion to extend the nine-month Government Response Statement development timeline, for some species\u201d.\nNine months seems excessive and could be a reflection of lack of resources to give this program the attention that it needs.\nf)\t\u201cClarify that recovery strategies are advice to government, and that Government Response Statements are the government\u2019s policy direction for species at risk.\u201d\nWhat are the enforceable actions, given that this is only advice to government and policy direction? Strong enforcement should be applied to minimize those trying to exploit endangered species areas.\ng)\t\u201cAllow the Minister to extend timelines for conducting the review of progress towards protection and recovery based on individual species\u2019 needs.\u201d\nAny extension of timeline should not be to the detriment of the species at risk.\nh)\t\u201cRemove duplicative requirements by removing specific reference to posting under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993 and instead requiring that certain products under the Act be made available publicly on a government website.\u201d\nThe EBR should be the one window approach so that the public can be notified of any changes to government instruments \u2013 that is its purpose. It is useful to obtain local, site specific information from informed individuals.\ni)\t\u201cSpecies at Risk Conservation Trust, to allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act. The funds would support strategic, coordinated and large-scale actions that assist in the protection and recovery of species at risk.\u201d\nIt is a good idea to have a fund for endangered species but not at the risk to the endangered \tspecies. That is in definite conflict of the purpose of the ESA. What price can you put on causing the extinction of a species that has taken millions of years to evolve to its current state?\nj)\t\u201cContinue to operate for twelve months following the application of new species or habitat protections while they seek amendments to their permit or agreement to address newly listed species. Currently, existing holders would, upon the species being listed and protected, need to stop their activity that impact the species or its habitat and wait for their permit or agreement to be amended.\u201d\nIt is unfortunate that stop work orders are issued for artifacts but not for endangered spp. Why is it that old or dead artifacts are more important that living creatures? Newly listed species should be just as important as pre-existing listed species. To provide the greatest protection, a stop-work order should be issued and\/or conditions provided to protect the spp.\nk)\t\u201cIf the proposal for the change to allow the Minister to order by regulation a pause of the protections for listed species passes: we are also proposing a change to the EBR General Regulation (O.Reg. 73\/94) to exempt the regulations containing Minister\u2019s orders made for the purpose of pausing protections from EBR posting and consultation requirements. This is being proposed in to preserve the ability of the Minister to act swiftly and minimize associated social or economic impacts\u201d.\nGood governance is participatory, consensus oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, inclusive and effective. This applies to all Ontario citizens, not just one sector of the population. By exempting individual segments of the population from EBR posting and requesting consultation it demonstrates that good governance is not being practised.\n",

        "comment":"Re: GreenForest Management Inc Continues to Ask for Permanent Recognition of the CFSA as an Equivalent Process to ESA by Adopting a Section 55 Regulation into the ESA; Response to ERO Number 013-5033\nPremier Ford, Minister Phillips, and Minister Yakabuski,\nOn behalf of GreenForest Management Inc, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes, ERO number 013-5033. We look forward to continuing to work with your government to modernize and improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We are optimistic that this will result in improved outcomes for species at risk while ensuring Ontario is a place to grow our renewable forest sector, unleash its full potential and provide good-paying jobs for our people. However, the vagueness of the proposed changes does not provide necessary business certainty.\nThe 10th year review of the provincial Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides government with a rare opportunity to chart a course for the next decade and beyond. Political decisions on this will have far-reaching social, economic, and environmental impacts for generations to come. Therefore, the most important action the government must take remains permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through  Section 55. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.\nThe proposed changes indicate that a Section 18 Regulation will be the authorization process for forestry, instead of a Section 55 Regulation. The former government recognized that the CFSA and the ESA cannot be harmonized and provided a workable, temporary solution that was defended in court.  We are asking the Provincial Government to take this workable, temporary solution and make it permanent.\nWe are asking that you revise the proposed legislative ESA changes to acknowledge that Section 55 will be the authorization mechanism for forest operations on Crown lands. Instead, MECP appears to be pursuing a revised section 18 \u201charmonization\u201d instrument which is at odds with our request. This bold move, like your support for other industries and activities with the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, would send a positive message to the forest sector and Greenforest Management Inc.\nIn addition to this critical revision, it also remains necessary to ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:\n1.\tConsideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy\n2.\tCumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy\n3.\tSocio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented\nThe sector will continue to operate under the CFSA which, by law, requires, forestry operations to follow an approved forest management plan. Guides delivered under the CFSA include operational prescriptions and conditions, which may include reserves, modified operations, or specific conditions on road use and construction in the area near a species at risk and their habitat.\nIn order to avoid catastrophic socio-economic impacts to Ontario\u2019s forest sector and northern communities, we need permanent, legislative recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy. It is our expectation that these required changes will be made and adopted into the new ESA legislation that you are passing.\nSincerely,\nRichard Shwedack\nGeneral Manager \u2013 GreenForest Management Inc\n",

        "comment":"The changes put forth in this proposal effectively amount to eliminating automatic protections for newly listed species, changes to the listing process, and giving the Minister greater discretionary powers. It has been proven by science that the species that are protected in Ontario require protection or face extinction. The Endangered Species Act provides for a \"science-based assessment\" of whether a species is endangered or not. Traditional knowledge as well as conventional science are included in the assessment, and as a result of that process, currently more than 200 plants and animals are at risk of extinction in Ontario.\nStated on the Ontario government's website: \"Protecting and recovering species at risk and their habitat is a key part of conserving Ontario\u2019s biodiversity. Find out what Ontario is doing and how you can help.\"\nSo I found out what you're doing and am certainly going to say something now. If science and traditional knowledge have shown that these species require protection, this new government's aims do not supersede this knowledge base. Ontario has already protected these plants and animals based on what has already been proven by people much smarter than any government party.\nIt's important that the government does not get powers that erase all the work already done by these smart people. It's important that what has already been decided, by outside, objective parties, is not up for change just because some new leader thinks that what should be done. It has already been decided what should be done. You don't get to kill things just because you get elected. Part of your job is to protect living things in this province - and that includes the most vulnerable groups and those that cannot speak for themselves. In this category are the other living things we share our space with.\nDo your job. This includes conservation. It's been proven objectively and it's the law - and you do not have the right to change it just to suit your own purposes.\n",

        "comment":"These comments are being provided on behalf of the membership of Nature Guelph; an organization that promotes conservation and education about nature to its 185 members and the public at large.\nWe find the proposed changes put forward in Schedule 5 of Bill 108 to be alarming.  We have difficulty determining what type of development would be stopped in this watered down version of the Endangered Species Act.  These changes would eliminate species at risk, not enhance their protection and the protection of their habitats! The changes would essentially leave the Endangered Species Act as existing in name only and that claims of improving habitat for species at risk are false. We find the overarching theme in the proposed changes of putting decisions in the hands of the Minister, rather than being based on science and recommendations from experts, to be particularly alarming.\nWe have the following specific comments:\n1.\tThe proposed changes that COSSARO assessments be based on the \u201cbiologically relevant geographic range\u201d rather than the status of the species in Ontario would lead to the elimination of species at the edges of their naturally occurring range. This will promote an effect where the range of the species at risk is slowly eroded over time until they disappear altogether. Populations at the edge of their range are arguably the most important as they provide a buffers for conservation and restoration efforts at the population\u2019s heart. Like a cookie, if you continue to nibble at its edges, it will disappear altogether.\n2.\tUnder the proposed changes, the Minister would be allowed to use their discretion to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years based on social and economic considerations as well as limit protections so that they apply only in specific geographies or in specific circumstances. The ESA should be a rock solid document with clear guidelines for species protection that are not vulnerable to the whims of individuals or parties in power. This proposal would never work in the favour of species at risk. These changes should be eliminated.\n3.\tBill 108 proposes that the Minister can delay indefinitely Government Response Statements after the publication of a Recovery Strategy or Management Plan, as well as delay carrying out a review of progress towards the protection and recovery of species. Clearly, theses proposed changes will allow the Minister (yet again) to circumvent the intentions of the Act. These proposed changes should be withdrawn.\n4.\tCurrently, the ESA only allows harmful activities to proceed when certain permits, agreements and regulatory exemptions are met. However, the proposed the changes would allow development proponents to proceed with harmful activities by paying into a fund in lieu of fulfilling their obligations to species at risk!! The point of the ESA is to protect species at risk and the habitats in which they live and reproduce; not by putting a price on their heads! This reduces accountability and promotes harm to species at risk. Please maintain the current requirement of the ESA that development provide an overall on-the-ground benefit to species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"Hello,\nAs a conservation professional employed by a national non-profit that works with at-risk species, I am disappointed in the proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act.\nRegarding the proposed changes to assessing and listing species at risk:\nScience-based listing of species at risk by COSSARO and automatic protection of listed species and\ntheir habitats are fundamental to the ESA and should not be changed. Edge of range species should not be denied protection based on their status outside Ontario.\nRegarding proposed changes to Species and Habitat Protections:\nThere should be no change to automatically protecting threatened or endangered species and\ntheir habitats upon listing. Allowing the Minister to remove or delay protections encourages political agendas.\nRegarding changes to Species at Risk Recovery Policies:\nLegislated timelines ensure that actions needed to recover species occur without undue delay, so there should be no change to the legal requirement to produce GRS within nine months of the release of Recovery Strategies or Management Plans. Failure to meet the legislated deadlines has always been a problem, and it should be addressed through improved implementation, not through increased flexibility of the law.\nRegarding the proposed changes to Permits, Agreements and Exemptions to Allow Harmful Activities:\nCompanies should not be permitted to simply pay into a fund to allow harmful activities-  they should provide on-the-ground reparation for damage done. Paying into a fund is an easy way out that reduces accountability and facilitates harm to species at risk and their habitats. Keep the current requirements to provide an on-the-ground, overall benefit to species harmed.\nI hope the proposed changes are brought under harsh review. The amendments should aim to help species at risk, not bring them further harm.\n",

Do not open the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario to non-experts.\nDo NOT allow a pay-to-proceed conservation fund that will let big business opt out of protecting species.\nInstead of extending timelines for government action, work harder to get plans to recover species implemented right away.\nMy Ontario is a place for wildlife, and a place for rare and endangered animals to recover and survive. Do not take us back a decade in species protections with these dangerous and regressive changes.\nIn a time when our species is causing a global extinction event, we in Ontario need to do our utmost to save biodiversity!\n",

        "comment":"To whom it may concern:\nI am concerned that the proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act will further accelerate the rate of decline of species-at-risk, and others as well across the province. The proposed changes provide way too many \"opt out\" clauses, ranging from Ministerial deadline extensions to the \"option\" that developers can pay into a trust in order to destroy species-at-risk habitat. One can only imagine the number of developers that will turn that option down--zero. The record globally of replacing destroyed habitat with recreated habitat is weak. We can only expect a net loss of functioning species-at-risk habitat in Ontario with the proposed changes permitting this practice.\nIn light of the recent United Nations report on global biodiversity that warns of an \u201cunprecedented\u201d decline in global biodiversity, one that has been quoted as having \"alarming implications for human health, prosperity and long-term survival,\" it is ironic that the proposed changes to the ESA will make this province a net contributor to the destruction of essential and irreplaceable habitat and species.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Sirs:\nThe Ontario Rivers Alliance (ORA) is a Not-for-Profit grassroots organization with a focus on healthy rivers.  ORA acts as a voice for a number of member and partner organizations, as well as many other private and First Nation members that have come together to protect, conserve and restore healthy Ontario riverine ecosystems.  We work to ensure that development affecting Ontario rivers is environmentally and socially sustainable and responsible.\nThe protection and recovery of species at risk are of great importance for healthy ecosystems in Ontario.  The ORA is alarmed at the massive and negative changes to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act 2007 (Act), that are being proposed in this 10th Year Review.  We are also concerned at the inclusion of these changes in an omnibus bill, Schedule 5 of Bill 108 (More Homes, More Choice Act, 2019), even before the public consultations on the proposed changes have been completed.  We join the chorus of environmental organizations, scientists and members of the public that are calling on the government to reject these proposed changes and, instead, request that the Act be strengthened to better protect species at risk.\nGeneral comments:\nIf enacted, the proposed changes will effectively gut the Act, result in the loss of biodiversity in the Province, eliminate most of the current protections for species at risk, and reduce the likelihood of their recovery. These draconian changes are clearly designed to restrict the number of species that are listed as at risk, to permit large-scale developers to harm species at risk and destroy their habitat, and to delay the implementation of any protection measures that remain under the Act.\nThe government\u2019s claim that the proposed changes will improve outcomes for species at risk is grossly misleading.\nSpecific Comments on Proposed Changes in ERO 013-5033:\nORA opposes all of the following proposed changes that, we submit, would dramatically weaken protection of species at risk and their habitat:\n1.\tBasing the classification of species on their status in their overall range, rather than their status within Ontario. Many species at risk reach their northern limit in Ontario and may be extirpated in the province if this change is implemented.\n2.\tAdding non-scientists to the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO). Species-at-risk assessments must be done on a purely scientific basis.\n3.\tPermitting municipalities and other infrastructure developers the option of paying into a fund instead of protecting species at risk and their habitat. This \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d proposal is clearly at odds with the whole purpose of the Act.\n4.\tDelaying protection of species at risk and their habitat by:\na.\tIncreasing the time when listing of a species is to occur following submission of COSSARO assessment from 3 to 12 months;\nb.\tAllowing Ministerial discretion to delay protection for up to 3 years for newly-listed species if protection will likely have \u201csignificant social or economic implications\u201d;\nc.\tAllowing existing Act permit\/agreement-holders to continue to harm species or their habitat for twelve months following the application of new species or habitat protections.\nAll the above proposed delaying tactics put endangered species at even greater risk. Species that are at risk must receive protection as quickly as possible. Protection must be based on science, not on economic or societal considerations.\n5.\tPermitting the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species, and to delay protection during the reassessment period. The Minister must not be permitted to second guess the scientific conclusions of COSSARO.\n6.\tExtending the timelines for production of Government Response Statements and reviews of progress towards protection and recovery. These documents are already subject to undue delays. Further delays must not be sanctioned.\n7.\tEliminating the current automatic protection for species at the time they are listed. Once a species is assessed as at risk and has been listed, it is critical that it be protected without delay if it is to have a chance at recovery.\n8.\tEliminating the requirement and timeline to develop a habitat regulation proposal for each newly-listed threatened or endangered species. A habitat regulation is often of critical importance to the recovery of a species and must be produced in a timely fashion.\nSummary:\nOntario\u2019s species at risk legislation is currently inadequate as described by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario (ECO) in a special report, titled \u201cLaying Siege to the Last Line of Defence: A Review of Ontario\u2019s Weakened Protections for Species at Risk (2018)\u201d. Instead of addressing the deficiencies that were identified in this report, the government has chosen to eliminate the position of ECO and propose changes to the Act which will dramatically reduce protection for species at risk and their habitat.\nWe call on the Ontario government to withdraw Schedule 5 of Bill 108 with its proposed changes to the Act and to engage in comprehensive discussions with the scientific community and the general public on how to best strengthen it and protect the province\u2019s biodiversity.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the very important proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act, 2007.\nI care deeply about conservation and the environment. As such, I believe, unfortunately, that the proposals are inconsistent with the track record of previous Conservative governments.  For example, past Conservative governments demonstrated leadership in protecting the Niagara Escarpment and the Oak Ridges Moraine, as well as the Lands for Life program.\nI'm very concerned that the government chose to unveil sweeping changes to the ESA in its omnibus housing bill, Bill 108, the \"More Homes, More Choice Act.\"  This is really an inappropriate way to facilitate discussion on a significant conservation issue that surely deserves to be evaluated on its own. In fact, at a time when the United Nations recently released a report warning that more than one million species are facing extinction over the next decade, a responsible government should strive to strengthen the ESA.\nInstead, the proposals threaten to weaken the ESA in many significant areas.  I fully share the concerns being raised by numerous, responsible conservation and environmental organizations in Ontario about the implications of the proposal amendments.\nThe list of damaging changes has rightly been described by Ontario Nature, for example, as long and wide-ranging.  I'm uncomfortable that the Environment Minister would have broad discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspect and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting.\nI'm also opposed to the creation of a Species at Risk Conservation Trust, where developers and industries could pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they inflict on species and their habitats.\nThese developers should be making their projects greener by accommodating vulnerable species.  There is too great a risk that developers would use the trust to dodge their responsibility to reduce activities detrimental to the environment.\nThe proposal to assess species on the full extent of their range, rather than the status of a species in Ontario, is likewise very concerning.  It could well mean that species near the edge of their range in Ontario would lose their protection in law.  This would be especially disturbing in the face of climate change, since healthy species populations are needed at their northern limits to help species adapt to changing climactic conditions.\nI am really concerned about the overall direction of the amendments. In my view, which many Ontarians share, the proposals amount to an ill-considered watering down of essential legislation to protect endangered and vulnerable Ontario species such as boreal caribou, barn owls, most of our turtles, and more.\nI urge the government to remove Schedule 5 in its entirety from Bill 108 and allow for extensive public consultation.  The ESA has established a high standard since it was first introduced. It is  incumbent upon the government to ensure it will be part of the solution to protecting already threatened species, rather than part of the problem.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"I have many concerns about the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, which I have outlined below.\n1A. By extending the time when when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to when listing is to occur from three to twelve months you provide opportunity for the act to be exploited. Within those twelve months development could occur rapidly causing irreparable damage to the listed species. There is no benefit to the endangered species by extending this time, and three months is already reasonable.\n1D. COSSARO consists of expert scientists in conservation biology. By allowing the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species you are ignoring science and delaying the protection of endangered species. This also allows the Minister to delay controversial listings, further weakening the protections of the act.\n1E. \"If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition.\" COSSARO already considers the condition of the species in a broader biologically relevant geographic area during the assessment progress. I am concerned that this change will make it difficult to list species with a broad range until they are in decline everywhere. Recovery is more likely to be successful when protections are implemented sooner. This change also ignores the many reasons why conserving species on the edge of ranges is important.\nF. It is not clear who would be included by broadening COSSARO member qualifications to include members who have relevant expertise in ecology, wildlife management, as well as those with community knowledge. Scientists and those with traditional indigenous knowledge are already included, and it seems this change is a way to non-scientists in COSSARO. COSSARO should include scientists who do not have pressures from other sources impacting their priorities.\n2A. Keeping the science-based assessment process \"at arm's length\" from decision making regarding protection of species is outright irresponsible. Further, by allowing a three year hiatus on implementing protections, you are putting the species at further risk for the sake of development. The purpose of the act is to protect endangered species, and this change is basically a giant loophole to only protect species when it is convenient. By the time the three year hiatus has finished, the species may have experienced further declines from which it cannot recover.\n3A. Listing a species is already a time consuming process, and when population declines are steep action needs to be taken quickly. Extending the response statement timeline unnecessarily lengthens the process, and provides a way to slow down the listing of controversial species. There is no reason to extend this timeline, and this amendment should be removed.\n3C. Again, extending timeline causes unnecessary delays which can provide developers to finish projects in areas that should be protected and a way to slow down the listing of species.\n4. The so called \"Pay to Slay\" weakens the act by making assumptions that are known to be untrue for many taxa. Habitat that is destroyed cannot simply be replaced somewhere else for a net zero effect. Ecosystems take time to become established, and may not provide the same resources to endangered species as the original habitat.\n4B. By shifting the approach from individual species to species more generally, the act is ignoring cumulative impacts. In most cases a species is not threatened by one thing. Rather many small impacts add up to cause a decline. Many small scale impacts will add up to impact the species as a whole.\n4E. Landscape level agreements should be used with caution because they can ignore site or species specific issues and cumulative impacts. If a landscape agreement is implemented, effort should be made to include the requirements of specific taxa that are to be protected.\n",

The government's claim that these changes will improve outcomes for species as risk is simply not true. The only improvement proposed is the proposal to apply inspection powers for regulatory exemptions. However, the 2,000 harmful activities that have occurred since 2013 shows how abusive  regulatory exemptions have been. Not allowing them would be preferable to allowing them with inspection powers.\nThere are so many things wrong with this proposal, here are just a few.\nListing of species at risk should be based on science, not politics and COSSARO membership should not be broadened.\nThe fact that a species exists outside of Ontario is not a reason to deny protection to that species in Ontario. The effects of climate change on the environment and species means we need extra caution to protect species that are currently at the northern edge of their range.\nThe Minister should not be allowed to remove or delay species protection. This invites political meddling and places vulnerable species in peril.\nDo not allow the Minister to delay indefinitely the Government Response Statements.

        "comment":"I am providing my comments on Bill 108 as a professional ecologist, hunter, fisher, and outdoor enthusiast.\nI am extremely troubled by the proposed changes to Ontario's species at risk legislation. As a province that has already seen the majority of its southern landscape converted to to a combination of sprawling cities and suburban areas, intensive agricultural operations, and industrial sites, there is ample opportunity to develop and concentrate our economic activity in these already disturbed areas. It is certainly not the time to further expand our environmental impacts to the last remaining natural habitats in our province. The proposed changes to our species at risk legislation will foster exactly that.\nEndangered and threatened species are our metaphorical canaries in the coal mine; they alert us to changes in our environment that not only threaten the endangered species, but also the human population and countless other species. Without adequate protections for our at-risk species, we will inevitably see further destruction of environmental features that provide ecological goods and services; in other words, there will be real financial costs to Ontarians, and these costs will be substantial.\nConsider that many at-risk species rely on intact wetland and riparian habitats - the same habitats that are responsible for mitigating the flood risk of major precipitation and snow-melt events. The forests and wetlands these species often depend on are critical for storing precipitation that provides Ontarians with sources of clean drinking water. The alternative to protecting these habitats include: expensive infrastructure repairs due to flooding; large insurance losses; expensive water treatment facilities; pollution of our recreational waters that attract scores of tourists and revenue to Ontario, loss of recreational space for Ontario's anglers and hunters, and so on.\nBill 108 is sold as a means of improving the status quo, but it is clear this is not the case. Independent scientific designation of species as being at-risk or not, and prompt protection of these species following listing is critical to protect Ontario's wildlife and also our human interests as outlined above. We do not need industrial and developer interests providing their opinion on species designation - it is outside their field of expertise, and the feedback one can expect from these groups will clearly not align with the broader interests of Ontarians. Furthermore, even when a species is recommended for listing, you propose giving the Minister discretion on whether to list the species and whether to protect the species. We need a firm commitment to science-driven decision making, not a regressive turn to political decisions vulnerable to exploitation by special industrial and corporate interest groups that do not reflect the interests of the broader society.\nI have reviewed the proposed changes, and frankly speaking, the entire proposal needs to be scrapped.\nThe cynic that I am, I don't expect much to come from my individual comments here. However, I can tell you that Ontario's outdoors enthusiasts, hunters, and anglers are upset about this proposed changes and others already implemented by the current government (e.g., discontinuation of Ontario's tree program). You can expect these important stakeholders to take the harmful policy decisions into account at their next opportunity to vote.\n",

        "comment":"Below are my comments on the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act as a result of the 10th Year Review\n1. Assessing and listing species at risk\n- Science-based listing of species at risk by COSSARO and automatic protection of listed species and\ntheir habitats are cornerstones of the ESA. They provide certainty, whereas ministerial discretion\npoliticizes the process, inviting delay and controversy.\n- There should be no change to the ESA regarding the listing process and the role of COSSARO. The law sets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of \u201cthe best available scientific\ninformation, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional\nknowledge.\u201d (sec. 5(3)).\n- Edge of range species should not be denied protection based on their status outside Ontario.\n2. Species and Habitat Protections\n- There should be no alternative to automatically protecting threatened or endangered species and\ntheir habitats upon listing.\n- Allowing the Minister to remove or delay protections is inappropriate and invites political meddling.\n3. Species at Risk Recovery Policies\n- Legislated timelines are intended to ensure that actions needed to recover species occur without\nundue delay. There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce GRS within nine months\nof the release of Recovery Strategies or Management Plans. Failure to meet the legislated deadlines\nis a chronic problem, which should be addressed through improved implementation, not weakening\nof the law.\n4. Permits, agreements and exemptions to allow harmful activities\nThis is the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act. The priority must be on\nprotecting and recovering species at risk.\n- There are already sufficient tools for authorizing harmful activities. No new tools are needed.\nChallenges should be addressed through improved implementation.\n- Proponents of harmful activities should NOT be allowed to simply pay into a fund rather than\nproviding on-the-ground reparation for damage done. This easy way out reduces accountability and\nfacilitates harm to species at risk and their habitats. Retain the current requirements to provide an\non-the-ground, overall benefit to species harmed.\n- Do not remove the requirement to obtain Cabinet approval or to consult with an independent expert\nregarding sec. 17(2)d permits. These are intended to be available only for projects that \u201cresult in a\nsignificant social or economic benefit to Ontario\u201d and that will not \u201cjeopardize the survival or recovery\nof the species in Ontario.\u201d These are appropriate requirements and ensure that such permits are\nissued only an exceptional basis.\n- Do not remove the requirement for the Minister to seek an independent opinion on regulations that\nmight jeopardize the survival of a species in Ontario. That would only make it easier for harmful\nactivities to proceed, without proper scrutiny.\n- The ESA (sec. 18) provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory\nframeworks, based on the standard of providing an overall benefit to species negatively impacted.\nUnless this standard is maintained, species will continue to decline.\n5. Enforcement\n- This is an improvement as this inspection power is currently lacking. However, if the government were serious about improving outcomes for species at risk, it would remove the regulatory exemptions put in place in 2013 that have enabled over 2,000 of these harmful activities to proceed in the first place,without inspection or enforcement.\nThanks for your consideration.\n",

I work in the Environmental Industry as a Wildlife Biologist and I speak from experience when I say that the protections that are currently in place are critical to preserving the diversity and abundance of our most valuable plants and animals. In most development projects I work on, the developers are still able to accomplish their projects while adhering to the prohibitions of the ESA. If you are causing harm to Endangered or Threatened species or their habitat it is completely reasonable to complete an Overall Benefit Permit for the species. \"Paying to Slay\" is not the answer.\nMore specifically, I do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Nor do I support the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme that would grease the wheels of destruction by allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats.\nIn addition, I believe that these changes would be very poor from an economic standpoint. Canadians value being in nature and having green spaces. Areas where Endangered or Threatened species reside are often strongholds for these valued habitats. They provide recreational and touristic value to residents and visitors of Ontario. Canadians do not want sprawling development, they want smart creative solutions to the environmental crisis that this planet is facing.\nIn the face of a changing environment, it becomes even more important to protect Species at Risk and their habitat. Many of these species are found in important habitats, such as wetlands, lakes, grasslands and forests. Wetlands are essential for Ontario  as they act as the kidneys of our province. They filter our water and act as a sponge to protect us from dangerous flooding and weather events. They protect us from economic loss.  Forests sequester carbon and keep our air clean.  Grassland habitat provides a home to shockingly high diversity of rare plants and animals.\nWe will never be able to get back what we will lose if these changes to the ESA are permitted. It is extremely short sighted to make such selfish changes for short term economical gain when the long term impacts are devastatingly high. Please do better for the future of our children and our planet.\nWe should be the leaders in our country for our ability to find sustainable solutions for responsible development, instead I am ashamed to call myself an Ontarian.\nI don't believe this is the answer, and I beg you to reconsider.\nSincerely,\nAn extremely concerned citizen\n",

They will not improve outcomes for species at risk. On the contrary, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.\nFirst, I do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Lengthening the time between the COSSARO's identification of a species as being at risk until it is placed on the SARO list will only  allow developers to continue to destroy habitat for a longer period of time. Once habitat is gone, it is very hard to get it back. Species can move to\n higher risk of extinction before action is taken.\nNor do I support the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme that would grease the wheels of destruction by allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats. Once again, this allows for developers to continue to destroy habitat with impunity.\nI also do not support the political interference of the Minister being able to require the COSSARO to reconsider a designation. Designations are science-based and should not be overturned by political agendas. Again, adding this step to the process only lengthens the time that species are not protected. It is clearly pro-developers.\nI am also concerned about the recommendation to \"broaden\" member qualifications for the COSSARO.  Presently, the qualifications are as follows:\na)  a scientific discipline such as conservation biology, population dynamics, taxonomy, systematics or genetics; or\n(b)  aboriginal traditional knowledge.\nIt seems to me that these already include a broad range of scientists including the fields identified by the suggested changes. For example, Population dynamics and conservation biology would encompass wildlife management and ecology. The only new category is people with \"community knowledge.\" Does that mean anyone who lives in the community, say, like a developer? I believe this is too broad a category. We already have indigenous people identified as a component. I see no need to open it up further.\nImproving outcomes for species at risk requires enforcement, not weakening, of the law. It also requires investment in stewardship, not writing off species at risk and their habitats as red tape.\n",

The law\nsets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of \u201cthe best available scientific\ninformation, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional\nknowledge.\u201d\n- Edge of range species should not be denied protection based on their status outside Ontario.  This will just promote extirpation and extinction within our own province.\n- There should be no alternative to automatically protecting threatened or endangered species and\ntheir habitats upon listing.  Allowing the Minister to remove or delay protections is inappropriate and invites political meddling.\n- Legislated timelines are intended to ensure that actions needed to recover species occur without\nundue delay. There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce GRS within nine months\nof the release of Recovery Strategies or Management Plans. Failure to meet the legislated deadlines\nis a chronic problem, which should be addressed through improved implementation, not weakening\nof the law.\n- There are already sufficient tools for authorizing harmful activities.

This is the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act.  The priority must be on protecting and recovering species at risk.  We cannot put development interests ahead of the health of our ecosystem.  Allowing violators to pay a fee is not a deterrent. Proponents of harmful activities should NOT be allowed to simply pay into a fund rather than providing on-the-ground reparation for damage done. This easy way out reduces accountability and facilitates harm to species at risk and their habitats. Retain the current requirements to provide an on-the-ground, overall benefit to species harmed.\nThe ESA (sec. 18) provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory\nframeworks, based on the standard of providing an overall benefit to species negatively impacted.\nUnless this standard is maintained, species will continue to decline.\n",

To remove our SAR protections will set a negative precedent for the rest of Canada and our neighbors to the South.\nFurthermore, we simply don't have the time to waste when it comes to any environmental policy. SAR protection= habitat protection. Protecting our natural environment and sustaining healthy ecosystems results in many additional benefits; carbon capture, increased crop productivity, healthier\/happier residents, increased property value, flood protection, jobs for those in environmental sectors, etc. The benefits are far reaching and go much beyond the government's wallet.\nThis is short sighted destruction.

        "comment":"1A. By extending the time when when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to when listing is to occur from three to twelve months you provide opportunity for the act to be exploited. Within those twelve months development could occur rapidly causing irreparable damage to the listed species. There is no benefit to the endangered species by extending this time, and three months is already reasonable.\n1D. COSSARO consists of expert scientists in conservation biology. By allowing the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species you are ignoring science and delaying the protection of endangered species. This also allows the Minister to delay controversial listings, further weakening the protections of the act.\n1E. \"If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition.\" COSSARO already considers the condition of the species in a broader biologically relevant geographic area during the assessment progress. I am concerned that this change will make it difficult to list species with a broad range until they are in decline everywhere. Recovery is more likely to be successful when protections are implemented sooner. This change also ignores the many reasons why conserving species on the edge of ranges is important.\nF. It is not clear who would be included by broadening COSSARO member qualifications to include members who have relevant expertise in ecology, wildlife management, as well as those with community knowledge. Scientists and those with traditional indigenous knowledge are already included, and it seems this change is a way to non-scientists in COSSARO. COSSARO should include scientists who do not have pressures from other sources impacting their priorities.\n2A. Keeping the science-based assessment process \"at arm's length\" from decision making regarding protection of species is outright irresponsible. Further, by allowing a three year hiatus on implementing protections, you are putting the species at further risk for the sake of development. The purpose of the act is to protect endangered species, and this change is basically a giant loophole to only protect species when it is convenient. By the time the three year hiatus has finished, the species may have experienced further declines from which it cannot recover.\n3A. Listing a species is already a time consuming process, and when population declines are steep action needs to be taken quickly. Extending the response statement timeline unnecessarily lengthens the process, and provides a way to slow down the listing of controversial species. There is no reason to extend this timeline, and this amendment should be removed.\n3C. Again, extending timeline causes unnecessary delays which can provide developers to finish projects in areas that should be protected and a way to slow down the listing of species.\n4. The so called \"Pay to Slay\" weakens the act by making assumptions that are known to be untrue for many taxa. Habitat that is destroyed cannot simply be replaced somewhere else for a net zero effect. Ecosystems take time to become established, and may not provide the same resources to endangered species as the original habitat.\n4B. By shifting the approach from individual species to species more generally, the act is ignoring cumulative impacts. In most cases a species is not threatened by one thing. Rather many small impacts add up to cause a decline. Many small scale impacts will add up to impact the species as a whole.\n4E. Landscape level agreements should be used with caution because they can ignore site or species specific issues and cumulative impacts. If a landscape agreement is implemented, effort should be made to include the requirements of specific taxa that are to be protected.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). I support the Canadian Herpetological Society position on this matter.\nThe main purpose of the ESA should be to protect species, not to expedite development. Any changes to the ESA should be made with great care, as without diligent legislation there is a risk of additional habitat loss and population declines. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extirpated from Ontario, and such losses to our natural heritage are unacceptable in the face of so many other unmitigated threats to biodiversity.\nThe public should be notified quickly of COSSARO\u2019s species\u2019 assessments, and the listing should be immediate. Waiting one year after the species is listed could result in harmful effects on the species. We must stress that a lot of these species, particularly amphibians and reptiles, are already facing rapid declines, so immediate protection is strongly recommended.\nI also strongly disagree with the possible suspension of listings for up to three years, as such long delays could allow large developments and lack of mitigation, potentially wiping out populations of species before protection is enacted. Furthermore, Threatened and Endangered species should have expedited, not delayed, Habitat Regulations, as these species are especially vulnerable.\nThe current proposal calls for including those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d \u2013 a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have unbiased expertise in species assessment or that have a different agenda altogether. I still strongly oppose that the minister should be able to overrule decisions made by COSSARO, as such veto power explicitly undermines the arms-length scientific approach that is supposed to be used to assess species. COSSARO assessments are based on IUCN criteria that have been refined over many decades, and the majority of COSSARO's assessments have already been fully vetted through the federal listing process (COSEWIC), which includes significant peer review from provincial and federal governments, stakeholders, ATK, biologists and taxa specialists.\nI also strongly oppose COSSARO being required to base its assessments on the status of a species throughout its range, as opposed to in Ontario only. For species that have a small portion of their range in Ontario, these populations often present unique adaptations and reservoirs of genetic variation, facilitating resilience to climate change. Loss of our Ontario populations means loss of global diversity in the species.\nAllowing species to be wiped out in Ontario simply because they occur elsewhere is short-sighted and not indicative of the values placed on Ontario\u2019s natural heritage by residents of the province. Furthermore, SAR play an important role in our local ecosystems, and as species diversity declines, so does the overall health of our natural areas. Ontario will likely become an important region to safeguard populations as the impacts of climate change worsen; this potential cannot be overstated.\nFinally, Ontario must never rely on neighbouring provinces and countries to protect SAR. This passes the responsibility and control on to others, and shows Ontario\u2019s lack of interest in protecting its biodiversity. Ontario residents have widely embraced the protection of SAR, and have provided countless volunteer hours to ensure their protection and recovery. The proposed changes will quickly negate those efforts, as species will lose the protection and the heightened awareness provided by listing, and lost funding opportunities that often provide the minimum requirement to get volunteer efforts started.\nThe Species at Risk conservation trust could be a powerful tool under some circumstances, but there is great room for such a program to be abused. This trust could allow for areas facing development to be developed by simply paying into the trust as opposed to protecting the resident species at risk.\nThe proposed changes include amending the act to strike out \u201cthe environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d and substituting \u201ca website maintained by the Government of Ontario\u201d. Such a change would mean that the opportunity for public input is lost. Removing opportunities for public input eliminates government accountability to the public and prevents the public to participate in the protection and recovery of SAR.\nLastly, I agree with the Canadian Herpetological Society that better enforcement is necessary to protect SAR. There is a strong need for enforcement of the ESA through fines and if necessary, incarceration.\nThe purposes of the ESA are:\n1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.\n3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.\nIn support of the Canadian Herpetological Society and many other organization, I believe that the proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. Given that, the Canadian Herpetological Society strongly advise you to reconsider the proposed changes and further consult with the public and professionals, to use a collaborative and transparent approach to responsible development while also protecting SAR.\n",

        "comment":"I have been involved in this process right from the discussion papers to submitting at the standing committee.  There are many flaws within this law that need to be addressed.\nFirst is the Minister must have a say in the process.  The COSSARO committee needs to be answerable to someone.  Also on that committee should be more than just Scientists that can read data.\nThe process the committee used must also be amended as the way it works now, species that are not at risk whatsoever get on the list, such as grey fox, spotted wintergreen etc.  There are several species that get listed simply because we are on the extreme fringe of their normal living range.  And because of the way the law is written, they are put on, and must have a recovery program.  Well you can not recover what was never here.  Thus you waste money on a species that will never be populus in this area.\nAlso there must be a mechanism that allows to make distinctions in areas within the province.  IE. there may be a problem with something in Thunder Bay, that is unique to that area, but no problem in Cornwall, yet when something is listed, the policy blankets the province, which may or may not be necessary.\nActivities allowed under the act must also be re-accessed.  For example and eagle's nest or something of that nature.  We put all kinds of restrictions around a species that has chosen to build their nest where that practice has been going on for ages.  I know of three nests that are right next to a highway, yet we are told they we need to modify our activities around such.\nThe \"Drop Box\" system that is now used by CUSSARO is in it methodology flawed as it forces more species to be declared at risk than what is necessary.  Just because something \"fits\" into the box, does not mean it should be a species at risk.  I refer back to the examples of Grey Fox, and Spotted Wintergreen.\nAlso the MNRF  should be forced to follow their own policy.  I think of red sided dace, where the MNRF will stock trout in those creeks that have them, yet forbid harvesting of minnows.\nIn short, this whole policy\/law needs to be revisited and revised.\n",

However, we are puzzled about how these proposals will strengthen protections for wildlife. What are we missing? We see how applications under the Act may be \"streamlined\", but could you please explain what is being proposed to STRENGTHEN our province's PROTECTION FOR WILDLIFE?  From what we have been able to read\/find, we are left with the distinct impression that these proposed changes will weaken the Endangered Species Act and make it easier to destroy critical wildlife habitat. We already have been personally observing such disturbing and destructive practices in our area and in other regions across Ontario.\nSpecific major comments\/concerns follow. (Words in CAPITALS are for emphasis.)\n\u2022\tNumerous proposals will lengthening timeframes or introduce delays to the start of protections for Species at Risk and their essential habitats. How can this possibly \u201cstrengthen\u201d our province\u2019s protection for wildlife? Please make revisions to the following -- in order to REDUCE delays and actually IMPROVE PROTECTIONS: Proposal 1. Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List, proposed changes A & D; Proposal 2. Defining and implementing species and habitat protections, proposed changes A [option to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years; require that all criteria in iii be met \u2013 not just one] & C; Proposal 3. Developing species at risk recovery policies, proposed changes A & C re extending timelines; and Proposal 4. Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions, proposed change C.\n\u2022\tThe approach of REQUIRING the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) to \u201cadjust a species\u2019 classification\u201d based on its overall \u201ccondition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and OUTSIDE Ontario\u201d seems very short sighted [proposal 1-E].  It is known that often wildlife corridors have been disrupted by human activities and have left species cut off. However, the genetic diversity offered by even a small population may be vital to long-term survival of the species.\n\u2022\tCreation of Species at Risk Conservation Trust has considerable appeal and would meet a need. However, we suggest this be used when individuals or organizations have not been compliant with the regulations. We live on the Bruce Peninsula and we see this happening all around us as precious habitat is destroyed for \"development\" (forestry, quarries, housing).  There seems to be little penalty for such disregard! The current proposal to use this proactively will need wisdom and information about impacts that may be beyond reach. We risk the loss or irreparable damage to ecosystems that cannot be \"forgiven\" or replaced.\n\u2022\tGreatly expanded powers for the Minister in some situations seem to risk overreach and potential interference, rather than effective and appropriate oversight and action.  Relates to proposals 1D, 2A&D, 3A&C, 4 A&F. Suggest these be removed or greatly revised.\nBiodiversity in Ontario and Canada is under extreme pressure -- largely from habitat loss and degradation (and invasive species often associated with development and roads). Indeed, the recent report of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) provides a chilling summary of a global problem! We in Ontario need to do our part and follow a precautionary principle regarding species and habitat protection.  The current proposed changes to the ESA fall far short on that count.\nWe urge you to do what you can to give vulnerable species a chance at survival -- not make it easier for them to be eradicated by destroying vital habitat. The previous government already relaxed regulations and this resulted in a surge of \"approved\" developments. How will this be better controlled by your proposals?\nIn our opinion, the Endangered Species Act needs to be strengthened by doing the following:\n1. Institute an approach that truly protects species and their habitats by removing many of the potentially harmful exemptions that degrade and fragment critical habitat.\n2. Work with local governments and conservation groups to develop meaningful local approaches to habitat and species protections \u2013 and provide financial assistance when needed.\n3. Maintain a strong voice for science and evidence, including aboriginal traditional knowledge, in the implementation of the revised Endangered Species Act.\n4. Reconsider the proposal of allowing habitat degradation in exchange for contribution to a fund. Research and better understanding is needed, we agree, but not at the expense of destroying critical habitat that can never be replaced or \"moved\"!\n5. Do not remove threatened species from our Ontario list just because they are \"plentiful\" somewhere else. It is known that often wildlife corridors have been disrupted and have left species cut off. However, the genetic diversity of even a small population may be vital to long-term survival of the species.\nWe urge you to take actions to help ensure the survival of endangered and threatened species throughout our province. The disappearance of any of these species may have profound negative impacts that we simply do not appreciate at this point. The time to take a precautionary approach is NOW!\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the endangered species act are broad in scope and significantly damage the protections that this act provides to vulnerable species in our province. As outlined in the proposed changes my response to each section is as follows:\n1. While I agree that providing earlier notice on a species assessment would be preferable, extending the time to listing said species from 3 to 12 months only considers the impact that a new listing has to developers. Allowing developers to complete work that could significantly damage the habitat of a newly listed species is short-sighted, and potentially damaging to the species. During a time when we are losing species daily at an alarming rate, this is the worst time to reduce protections and allow developers to potentially destroy habitat. B. Backdating this to 2019 is also not acceptable.\nThe minister, who has zero experience in ecology, biology, or the environment, should not have any say in the classification of a species or the re-assessment of any species. This is outside their purview and the reason COSSARO exists is to ensure an unbiased and science-based approach to listing species, allowing the minister to reconsider classification makes this decision entirely political in nature and is a step backward in the process.\nThis is a non-starter, species at the edge of their range are often adapted to the extremes of a species\u2019 tolerance, by assuming that a species is secure in the center of its range and therefore secure in Ontario, we are removing protection for individuals that are specially adapted and may provide genetic advantages to the species as a whole. Further, the species may not be protected in the other country, which means the population in Ontario is providing a modicum of protection to the entirety of a species.\nCOSSARO should continue to only include professionals with relevant expertise, community knowledge is important, however, it is not always based in scientific fact, this could potentially harm a species as a whole, through the inclusion of knowledge that is incorrect or improper identification skills that grossly exaggerate a species range and population.\n2. The listing process should continue to be automatic, each species that is provided with a status of concern is based on hard science and population trends, if the status is provided, and this species requires protection, they should be automatically protected, end of story. Without automatic protection and instead of an announcement of coming protection, this could cause rampant removal of habitat in order to avoid permits or hold-ups to development in the future, potentially causing even more damage to a species. Habitat regulation must continue to be required, each species is tied to its habitat and a habitat requirement, without this, the species is not truly protected.\n3. Timeline extensions are required to ensure a species is adequately protected within reasonable timelines, while in some circumstances, extensions should be granted (where further research is required) in general, removing timelines is akin to removing protection. B. Recovery strategies should constitute policy, not advice to government. These strategies need to be implemented if we have any hope of maintaining a species into the future. C. allowances should only be provided in extreme circumstances and should continue to have a timeline\/limit.\n4. Paying a charge in lieu of protection is completely unacceptable, this model is not working in the United States, and the recreation of habitat in other areas is a complicated process that may not even produce positive results. We have barely scraped the surface on the specific habitat requirements of many species, and destroying habitat that clearly meets their needs and trying to recreate it elsewhere is not the solution. We should be expanding and protecting the habitat in situ, where the species occurs.\nWhile I agree that there needs to be further oversight on the governments\u2019 part during the permit process, as well as ensuring mitigation measures that are proposed are completed and followed. This is not the way and will lead to extensive damage to the habitats of vulnerable species. All developers can provide reasonable alternatives and reasonable excuses for why those alternatives could not be pursued from an economic standpoint. Economics should be much lower on the list of reasons not to protect habitat. A. an independent expert must be consulted, otherwise political and economic considerations will always be at the forefront of decision making. All individuals of a species, make up the species as a whole, each individual contributes to the species, especially in the scenario of species at risk, many species that are at risk are long-lived, and slow to mature, every individual matter.\nALL activity in the habitat of a species at risk newly listed or not deserves immediate protection, this change would once again only benefit the developer, and immediate protection is integral to keeping the species from continuing to decline.\n",

        "comment":"Enforcing the Endangered Species Act is a good idea, but every other proposed change is horrible and misguided.  Taking advice from non-scientists and minister discretion will not lead to a better outcome.  It can already be difficult to make sound decisions in a quiet room, it will become virtually impossible if you let industry and developers in to distract and pester the scientists and minister with incessant demands.  The way the world works is already geared for turning wilderness into urban sprawl, the proposed changes will only accelerate this trend and make it virtually impossible to protect what remains.  To rely on other jurisdictions for protecting various species that are threatened in Ontario is a bum mentality worse than expecting others to pay for us, or to paint an image that our Premier can relate with, to constantly share their beer with us.  Ontario species need full protection in Ontario, protection that cannot be waived or watered down with cash.  Ontario should keep all of its species, there is no excuse.\nBiodiversity and wildlife is our wealth, the problem is not everyone understands this or appreciates how valuable it is.  That importance can't be conveyed in just a moment with words, so I won't even try and it's simpler if those who are not totally convinced of the necessity for biodiversity, species, and healthy ecosystems would just resign.  Protecting what species we still have is the very minimum to do to get a passing grade.  In fact, we should be restoring nature to its former glory and beyond, for example bringing back wolves throughout the province if we still had ecosystems to support them, because predators are essential but often missing.\nI wish the current Ontario government could be a champion of sustainability, for both fiscal and wildlife management.  Unfortunately, it seems that the word progressive is thought to mean progress, development, and paving land over, while conservation of both species and energy is clearly not a priority based on prior actions.  Therefore, to call themselves Progressive Conservatives is false advertising and the name should be changed to something more fitting, such as the Beer & Anger party.  Otherwise, please prove that you can manage this province, including our rich wild heritage, with the maturity and wisdom it deserves.\n",

        "comment":"Protecting species-at-risk in Ontario was initiated in 1971 under the guidance of Premier Bill Davis, a Progressive Conservative, who ensured this province became one of the first jurisdictions in the world to pass an Endangered Species Act (ESA).  Though this was ground-breaking protective legislation, it was so new that it was based upon current knowledge of its time. Only several species were identified for protection, but their numbers have reached into the hundreds (though a complete inventory of Ontario\u2019s species has never been done) because habitat protection was not a major consideration in 1971.\nThe Act was reframed in 2007, recognizing the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) as an independent body, whose members must have relevant scienti\ufb01c expertise or aboriginal traditional knowledge, deemed to be the apolitical group of specialists who would make final decisions re: the listing and designation of Species at Risk. In other words, the identification of Species at Risk became an impartial and science-based process. Recovery Strategies and Management Plans for At-Risk species also became part of the law. The Minister of Nature Resources was responsible to select which species needed to be assessed by COSSARO.\nUnfortunately, the Act was weakened in 2009 by a Liberal government. In response to the weakened bill, then Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, Gord Miller (appointed earlier by the Mike Harris government), produced a report, requiring that MNR ensure Recovery and Management teams be composed of members who had the necessary expertise AND the authority to act independently.\nMore importantly, Mr. Miller\u2019s report advised: \u201cMNR should ensure that habitats are prescribed on an ecological basis, rather than being driven by economic or social constraints.\u201d\nYou can read this detailed report at http:\/\/docs.assets.eco.on.ca\/reports\/special-reports\/2009\/2009-Last-Lin\u2026  but I believe ECO\u2019s observation regarding economic and social constraints is relevant to the results of the current 10 Year Review of the ESA, EBR 013-4143, which closed on March 4, 2019.\nThe purpose of the ESA SHOULD ONLY BE the protection and recovery of species facing extinction in Ontario; it is already weak and allows harm to be caused to species at risk.  Now protection for at-risk species has been further undermined when it comes to the results of the recent 10-year review. Anyone who perused the results of the responses to EBR 013-4143 could see the vast majority of respondents wanted to see the ESA strengthened.\nThe EBR exists to protect the environmental rights of Ontarians and enable us to participate in environmental decision-making. By taking our right to be notified and participate in decisions to remove, reduce or pause protection for endangered and threatened species, the government is undermining the value we, THE PEOPLE OF ONTARIO, place on our environment. This is unacceptable.\nSpecifically, I OPPOSE THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS presented in this posting, as listed below:\n1. A) Extending the timeline between the Ministry receiving a COSSARO report and legal listing of  assessed species from 3 months to 12 months;\nD) Allowing the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species where the Minister forms the opinion based on scientific information that the classification is no longer appropriate;\nE) Requiring COSSARO to adjust a species' classification to reflect its overall condition across all jurisdictions if it exists beyond Ontario;\n2. A) Decoupling the listing process from automatic protection, allowing the Minister to suspend the protection that should be afforded to threatened and endangered species;\nB) Limiting species protection via \"scoping\" with the Minister's discretion;\nC) Removing the mandatory legislative requirement and timeline to develop a habitat regulation proposal for each newly-listed threatened or endangered species;\nD) Enabling the Minister, rather than LGIC, to make species-specific habitat regulations;\n3. A) Giving the Minister discretion to extend the 9-month Government Response Statement development timeline for some species;\nC) Allowing the Minister to extend timelines for conducting the review of progress towards protection and recovery based on individual species\u2019 needs;\nD) Removing specific reference to posting under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993 and instead requiring that certain products under the Act be made available publicly on a government website;\n4. Creating the Species At Risk Conservation Trust, and the regulatory charge that applicants seeking to destroy species at risk habitat will pay;\nA) Removing the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert in the \u2018D\u2019 permit process and replacing the requirement for LGIC approval with Minister approval;\nB) Broadening the approach to minimize adverse effects for permits and agreements to ignore risk to individuals rather than whole species at risk;\nC) Providing a new transition provision for existing Endangered Species Act permit-and agreement-holders to continue to operate for twelve months following the application of new species or habitat protections;\nE) Creating a new landscape agreement for clients to use to destroy species at risk habitat;\nF) Weakening the test for a s. 18 provision;\nG) Removing the requirement for the Minister to consult with an expert if the Minister forms the opinion that a proposed regulation is likely to jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario or to have any other significant adverse effect on the species.\nThe examples provided in the above numbered four sections show the Conservative government is not interested in protecting at-risk species and their needed habitat'\nFinally, let me repeat that I am unalterably opposed to any amendments to the EBR that reduce our rights to be notified or consulted re: any environmental decision-making. Surely the government has learned from the public outcry AGAINST SCHEDULE 10 of BILL 66 that ONTARIANS OPPOSE BEING EXCLUDED FROM PUBLIC NOTIFICATION AND CONSULTATION.  This represents the antithesis of democracy. If Premier Ford believes that he is \u201cFOR THE PEOPLE\u201d, then his government needs to realize that it must ALWAYS consult with, and LISTEN TO, the PUBLIC WHOM IT PURPORTS TO SERVE.\nClearly these amendments serve to open up at-risk species and their essential habitat to development and destruction, and remove protections of the imperiled species themselves so that special interests will not be punished for harming, extirpating, killing, or even driving them toward extinction. The ESA is already deficient for NOT listing species that have already been driven to extinction to remind us of what has been lost as a result of inadequate action, or plain ignorance, in the past. The suggested amendments also present serious and transparent attempts to undermine science as part of the listing and protections process in these amendments; yet, SCIENCE should be the 'driver' in this process.\nSpecifically, the amendment states: \u201cThe proposed changes would authorize the creation of a regulatory charge that could be paid by persons who are permitted to carry out otherwise prohibited activities under certain permits, agreements, and regulations. The charge would be paid in lieu of fulfilling certain potential conditions that could otherwise have been imposed under the permit, agreement, or regulation. The proposed charges would only be available in respect of species prescribed by regulation. The price for the payment-in-lieu (i.e. regulatory charge) will be within the range of costs that a client would have otherwise incurred through meeting the species-based conditions of an authorization.\u201d This shows that the government is deliberately GUTTING protection for species at risk.\nThis government desperately needs to read the ENTIRE recent report from the United Nations, available at https:\/\/www.un.org\/sustainabledevelopment\/blog\/2019\/05\/nature-decline-u\u2026  which states:\n\u201cThe health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.\u201d\nand\n\u201cWe find sources of food, medicine, livelihoods and innovation in nature. Our well-being fundamentally depends on nature. Our efforts to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems must be underpinned by the BEST SCIENCE that humanity can produce.\u201d\nI urge you to abandon the above amendments and strengthen the implementation of the ESA in the following ways:\nA) Repeal the exemptions created in 2013 to permit forestry, hydro and mining industries to conduct activities that negatively impact species at risk;\nB) Repeal the exemption created in 2016 to allow hunting and trapping of the threatened Algonquin wolf;\nC) Amend section 57 (1)1 of the ESA so that exemptions will only be allowed if they do not jeopardize the survival and\/or recovery of endangered and threatened species;\nD) Amend the ESA so that all permits that allow habitat or species destruction pass the overall benefit test, and are monitored and enforced to ensure the benefits support species at risk recoveries.\nProtecting Ontario's endangered species is vital to the future of our province's biodiversity, the health of our environment, and the ecosystem services on which all Ontarians rely for sustenance and survival. I will be monitoring this important issue closely, as will many other members of the Ontario Public.\n",

I strongly oppose the changes that are being considered. They will not improve outcomes for species at risk. On the contrary, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.\nMore specifically, I do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Nor do I support the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme that would grease the wheels of destruction by allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats.\nImproving outcomes for species at risk requires enforcement, not weakening, of the law.

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are the wrong direction for the government to take. They have the capacity to further harm species at risk for the following reasons:\n- reduced emphasis on input from scientific experts means that evidence-based decision making is reduced\n- increased Minister's discretion around suspending species protections and timelines means increased potential for political interference and politics based decision making\n- no clarity on many aspects of the changes - habitat banking, pay-to-slay, and other proposals - simply paying in order to destroy a species does not guarantee its long term survival\n- increased timelines for listing a species means delays in conservation action and potential for habitat degradation or destruction\nThe current ESA is the gold standard in Canada and worked well. If there were issues, these could have been fixed through appropriate dialogue. Putting out these proposed changes and almost immediately including them in a bill does not constitute adequate stakeholder engagement.\nPlease leave the Act as is and take more time to consult broadly across a range of stakeholders if improvements are desired.\n",

        "comment":"The Hamilton Naturalists' Club, representing 600 members and dedicated volunteers, welcomes this opportunity to comment on the proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act.\nWe are celebrating our 100th anniversary this year as a human voice for the protection of wildlife and natural areas.  We have always attached considerable importance to the preservation of endangered species in Ontario.\n As such, we are deeply concerned about the major changes to the ESA unveiled in the government's omnibus housing bill, the \"More Homes, More Choice Act,\" Bill 108. We believe changes to the ESA should have been completely separate from an omnibus bill, especially when the proposals threaten to weaken the ESA in many ways.\nThe fact that many leading conservation and environmental organizations believe the changes will be detrimental to endangered species should prompt the government to reconsider the changes and preferably remove Schedule 5 completely from Bill 108.\nThe HNC strongly agrees with the detailed criticisms of the proposed changes that have been outlined by Ontario Nature, in particular, as well as the Toronto Field Naturalists in their 7 May letter to Environment Minister, and many others.\nFor example, we believe the Environment Minister should not have broad discretion to interfere with the science-based listing of species, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting.  Proposals for more ministerial discretion could result in harmful delays in recovery planning and ESA protections.\nThe HNC is also opposed to the proposed creation of a Species at Risk Conservation Trust, where developers and industries could pay into a fund  in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation of the damage they inflict on species and their habitats.   We agree with many critics who view a fee-in-lieu fund as an easy way out for proponents of harmful activities that reduces transparency and accountability.  It is inconsistent with the purpose of the ESA, which is to protect and recover species at risk.\nWe also take exception to a proposal to assess species on the full extent of their range, rather than the status of a species in Ontario.  The proposed approach could well mean that species near the edge of their range in the province would lose their protection in law. We find that unacceptable, especially in the face of climate change because healthy species populations are needed at their northern limits to help species adapt to changing climatic conditions.\nThe HNC believes the proposed changes are inappropriate, ill-considered and untimely. It is essential that Ontario show leadership in protecting endangered and vulnerable species such as the Algonquin Wolf, Boreal Caribou, Barn Owl, most of our turtles, and more.  The urgency of strong action was underlined by the recent United Nations report warning that more than one million species are facing extinction over the next decade.\nIt is imperative for the government to recognize that endangered and vulnerable species must be  protected with an effective legal framework.   Ontarians should have confidence that the ESA will not be subject to \"death by a thousand cuts,\" which is the direction that unfortunately the proposed changes would lead to.\nWe fully share Ontario Nature's conclusion that the proposals amount to sacrificing the recovery of species at risk to the advantage of those with vested short-term economic interests in unbridled development.\nThe HNC stands united with conservation organizations across Ontario in urging the government to remove Schedule 5 completely from Bill 108.\nThank you.\n",

We look forward to continuing to work with your government to modernize and improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act. We are optimistic that this opportunity can result in improved outcomes for species at risk while ensuring Ontario provides the condition to grow our renewable forest sector.  However, the vagueness of the proposed changes does not provide necessary business certainty and, if implemented as proposed, would result in increased red tape, delays in operations and create the environment for legal challenges to both government and industry.\nThe 10th year review of the provincial Endangered Species Act provides government with a rare opportunity to pave the way for Ontario\u2019s future and will have far-reaching social, economic, and environmental impacts for generations to come. The most crucial action the government must take remains a permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act through a Section 55.  The Crown Forest Sustainability Act - recognized worldwide as a leading piece of legislation for sustainable forest management - already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk.  Having two Provincial acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to the forest sector.\nThe proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act indicate that a Section 18 Regulation will be the authorization process for forestry, instead of a Section 55 Regulation. This has the potential to restrict access to wood supply for our company and could have unintended negative consequences to economic development and create significant additional administrative burden to both government and industry.  Government must carefully consider how this solution is achieved and what authorization is used.\nThe former government recognized that the Crown Forest Sustainability Act and the Endangered Species Act cannot be harmonized and provided a temporary solution that was defended and won in court following legal challenges from environmental organizations.  We are asking that the Ford Government take the necessary steps to fix this situation by going beyond what the former government attempted and implement a permanent Section 55 Regulation for forestry.\nEven with a permanent Section 55 regulation, the forest sector will continue to operate under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act which, by law, requires, forestry operations to follow an approved forest management plan. Guides developed under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act include operational prescriptions and conditions (e.g. reserves, modified operations, and specific conditions on road use and construction) in the area near a species at risk and their habitat.  In other words, species at risk and their habitat would be efficiently protected and managed under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act.\nIn order to avoid socio-economic impacts, we require permanent legislative recognition that the Crown Forest Sustainability Act is an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act, while developing workable species at risk policy.  It is our expectation that these required changes will be made and adopted into the new Endangered Species Act legislation.\nWe would be happy to meet with you or your staff at your earliest convenience to discuss the best path forward to ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk while keeping this province open for business.\nSincerely,\nMarc Pinette\nArea Manager\nWood and Fiber\nGP North Woods LP\n",

We are optimistic that this will result in improved outcomes for species at risk while ensuring Ontario is a place to grow our renewable forest sector, unleash its full potential and provide good-paying jobs for our people. However, the vagueness of the proposed changes does not provide necessary business certainty.\nThe 10th year review of the provincial Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides government with a rare opportunity to chart a course for the next decade and beyond. Political decisions on this will have far-reaching social, economic, and environmental impacts for generations to come. Therefore, the most important action the government must take remains permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through  Section 55. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.\nIn March, we asked that this essential first step be accomplished in your Government\u2019s legislative changes to the ESA. However, the proposed changes indicate that a Section 18 Regulation will be the authorization process for forestry, instead of a Section 55 Regulation. For the past 10 years, we have consistently asked for a permanent Section 55 Regulation as the authorization process for the forest sector. The former government recognized that the CFSA and the ESA cannot be harmonized and provided a workable, temporary solution that was defended in court.  We are asking the Ford Government to take this workable, temporary solution and make it permanent.\nWe are asking that you revise the proposed legislative ESA changes to acknowledge that Section 55 will be the authorization mechanism for forest operations on Crown lands. Instead, MECP appears to be pursuing a revised section 18 \u201charmonization\u201d instrument which is at odds with our request. This bold move, like your support for other industries and activities with the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, would send a positive message to the forest sector and [name of organization].\nIn addition to this critical revision, it also remains necessary to ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:\n1.\tConsideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy\n2.\tCumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy\n3.\tSocio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented\nThe sector will continue to operate under the CFSA which, by law, requires, forestry operations to follow an approved forest management plan. Guides delivered under the CFSA include operational prescriptions and conditions, which may include reserves, modified operations, or specific conditions on road use and construction in the area near a species at risk and their habitat.\nSince the establishment of the ESA, we have been clearly and consistently outlining what is required for permanent, long-term certainty within Ontario\u2019s forest sector and for our northern and rural communities. In order to avoid catastrophic socio-economic impacts, we need permanent, legislative recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy.

I have never even seen most of those animals!\u201d\nMy response would be- WE CANNOT, WE SHOULD NOT   ignore this lamentable news.\nWHY?\n We are all part of a delicate and balanced ecosystem containing plants, animals and non-living organisms. We are all connected and we all depend on one another for all our needs-our very survival.\nAll the actions and reactions occurring in the web of life form a tangled maze- like the strands in a spider\u2019s web. If one strand is severed, such as the elimination of a specific species, the whole web starts to unravel and that affects the well being and future existence of all of us.\nFor example, a furry bumble bee is relatively small, appears insignificant, and unimportant.\nBut, it is extremely important as it is a master pollinator due its large and furry body.\nOne third of every mouthful of all the fruits and vegetables you eat depends on small pollinators, like a bumble bee.\nYou might respond, it doesn\u2019t really affect me as I eat mostly meat.\nIf pollinators like bumble bees, disappear the cost of buying meat might soar out of your price range.\nRemember, we are all connected!\nLet me explain, livestock eat alfalfa and other grains.\nGuess what, bees pollinate the alfalfa and other grains.\nLess plant food for our livestock means, higher prices across the board.\nHave we humans protected 15-20% of green spaces for our precious pollinators around the world?\nNo!\n Just recently, The UN provided us with some sobering news \u2013the population of bumble bees have declined by 90 per cent.\nIf we do not protect 50 % of our green spaces insects will disappear in 100 years!!\nFiguring out what kind of impact this will have on humans is straightforward.\n Humans are on the apex of the food chain and insects are at the bottom.\nOnce the insects are eliminated most plants will disappear and anyone left living in this barren waste land will die of hunger and starvation.\nAnd if you are hunter, and you figure you will shoot big mammals for your sustenance-think again.\n Well, as those pesky, little bugs died off so did all the animals that formed the intricate food chain above, them including small mammals and later the larger ones.\nEvidence has clearly demonstrated that protecting habitats for the future survival of all species and especially the endangered ones, due to our vital interconnectedness, benefits the well-being of all of us.\n So we need the Endangered Species Act to be strengthened, not decimated.\nWe urge you to world diligently towards protecting 50 % of our green spaces.\nThe actions you take today will determine if your children and your children\u2019s children will embrace a future filled with hope and optimism or face a future filled with dread and fear.\nFor the sake of your own children and the world\u2019s children protect all species, especially the endangered ones that form their own niche with their own specialized functions in the precarious web of life.\nCan you not you hear the cry of the Endangered Species\n",

        "comment":"Many species are declining across the world and in Canada. The province of Ontario is not immune to these declines; there are currently more than 200 species at risk (SAR) in the province. The main purpose of the ESA should be to protect species, not to expedite development. Any changes to the ESA should be made with great care, as without diligent legislation there is a risk of additional habitat loss and population declines. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extirpated from Ontario, and such losses to our natural heritage are unacceptable in the face of so many other unmitigated threats to biodiversity. Ontario has an opportunity to be a leader in biodiversity conservation, with an ESA that is the gold standard to which other jurisdictions aspire.\nI agree that the public should be notified quickly of COSSARO\u2019s species\u2019 assessments, but listing should be immediate. Waiting one year after the species is listed could result in harmful effects on the species. I must stress that a lot of these species, particularly amphibians and reptiles, are already facing rapid declines, so immediate protection is strongly recommended. I also strongly disagree with the possible suspension of listings for up to three years, as such long delays could allow large developments and lack of mitigation, potentially wiping out populations of species that should be listed but whose listings have been unnecessarily delayed. Furthermore, threatened and endangered species should have habitat regulations, as these species are especially vulnerable.\nCOSSARO is an independent committee with expertise in scientific disciplines and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (TEK), and these individuals take great care and consideration when making decisions about which species should be listed as at risk. I do agree with broadening member qualifications, but this should not take away from the legitimacy of the organization. The current proposal calls for including those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d \u2013 a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have unbiased expertise in species assessment or that have a different agenda altogether. I still strongly oppose that the minister should be able to overrule decisions made by COSSARO, as such veto power explicitly undermines the arms-length scientific approach that is supposed to be used to assess species.\nI also strongly oppose COSSARO being required to base its assessments on the status of a species throughout its range, as opposed to in Ontario only. For species that have a small portion of their range in Ontario, these populations often present unique adaptations and reservoirs of genetic variation, facilitating resilience to climate change. Loss of our Ontario populations means loss of global diversity in the species. As Aldo Leopold said, \u201cTo keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.\u201d Allowing species to be wiped out in Ontario simply because they occur elsewhere is short-sighted.\nThe Species at Risk conservation trust could be a powerful tool under some circumstances, but there is great room for such a program to be abused. This trust could allow for areas facing development to be developed by simply paying into the trust as opposed to protecting the resident species at risk. Such a proposal runs the risk of jeopardizing the social license that many large companies currently have. If companies are seen to be \u201cbuying\u201d the right to destroy the habitat of endangered species, they will be viewed as poor corporate citizens and likely lose business in the long term. Under certain circumstances, SAR habitat may be lost, and such a program could result in compensatory habitat creation elsewhere. In those cases there should result a net gain in quality SAR habitat for the same species. Net gains or losses should not be measured as simplistic aerial extent of habitat lost versus created, as the quality of habitat and whether it is actually occupied by viable subpopulations is more meaningful. Although complex to measure, indicators that are relevant to the SAR classification system should be used, such as numbers of mature individuals, survival rates, reproductive rates, area of occupancy, and long-term viability of the mitigation project.\nThe proposed changes include amending the act to strike out \u201cthe environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d and substituting \u201ca website maintained by the Government of Ontario\u201d. Such a change would mean that the opportunity for public input is lost.  Removing opportunities for public input eliminates government accountability to the public and prevents the public to participate in the protection and recovery of species at risk.\n\tLastly, I agree that better enforcement is necessary to protect SAR. There is a strong need for enforcement of the ESA through fines and if necessary, incarceration.\nThe purposes of the ESA are:\n1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.\n3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.\nI believe that the proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. Given that, I strongly advise you to reconsider the proposed changes and further consult with the public and professionals, to use a collaborative and transparent approach to responsible development while also protecting SAR.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the ESA.\nI've been reading about the global extinction of species and losses to biodiversity in the May 6th report by the UN International Program on Biodiversity and Ecological Services (IPBES). The report confirms what we read about almost every day, both in the popular media and in scientific studies.\nAs far as I can see and tell, biodiversity is key to human survival and a world with a future in which our children can enjoy what we enjoy in our world. We know that climate has changed in the past, and species have been extinguished, but most often this has resulted from factors beyond the control of humans.\nI find it hard to believe that, given what we know about the importance of biodiversity, and the damage to biodiversity we know that we are already rendering through human activities, the Ontario government can pose changes to weaken our present laws governing the protection of species at risk in our province.\nThe proposed changes look to me as though they will put species at risk in much greater risk. They sure look to me as though they will make it easier for industry, governments, and developers to destroy habitats of our most vulnerable flora and fauna, sometimes with the payment of a small fee, that would become the cost of doing business.\nI don't support the proposed changes that would allow wide ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting.\nWhat the IPBES report and other mountains of evidence call upon us to do is improve outcomes for species at risk. I am surprised that the proposed legislation cannot distinguish between the significance to our future of underwriting and supporting biodiversity as compared to \"reducing red tape\". I truly hope that our government is able to move beyond slogan driven policy and propose bolder legislation  to promote actions that will preserve biodiversity in our province.\n",

        "comment":"Last week Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Steve Clark, introduced omnibus Bill 108, the More Homes, More Choice Act. This Bill affects 13 pieces of legislation including the Conservation Authorities Act, the Planning Act and the Endangered Species Act. This Bill contains just about everything developers, the aggregate industry and other industries have been seeking. Schedule 5 of Bill 108 contains the changes to the Endangered Species Act. These changes are sweeping and tantamount to having no Endangered Species Act at all. If passed the changes spell a dire future for species at risk in our province.\nOne of the proposed changes is that assessments of species be based not on the status of a species in Ontario, but instead on its status across its \"biologically relevant geographic range.\" Most species now listed as threatened or endangered in Ontario, which are considered to be more stable in the US, could be delisted (e.g. during regular reassessment processes) and receive no protection as a result.\nThis action will do irreparable harm to wildlife and therefore human life if it is enacted and must not be passed.\nOntario Nature has compiled the list of Threatened and Endangered Species currently listed along with their global status. G4 rank means apparently secure and G5 means secure. Based on the government's proposal, it is conceivable that 74% of currently listed threatened and endangered species could be delisted and lose protection.  This too will result in a seriously imbalanced ecosystem and so needs to be removed from Bill 108.\nThere are many more areas of concern, with both process and what is included in the proposed legislation.  I urge you to consider our planet's life over dollars and act ethically instead of irresponsibly.\n",

        "comment":"The planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

We wish to register our strong opposition to the changes to the Endangered Species Act that are being considered. They will not improve outcomes for species at risk. On the contrary, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.\nSome of the proposed changes appear to be designed to take the protection of species at risk away from science-based decision-making, into the political realm. We do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Nor do we support the scheme that would allow developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats. Payments into fund will increase government coffers but will not save the species they destroy.\nMisery Bay Provincial Park is on Manitoulin Island, which is the home of many species at risk, including The Manitoulin Gold (aka Lakeside Daisy), the Dwarf Lake Iris, Barn Owl, Evening Grosbeak, Sharp Tailed Grouse, Hills Thistle, Pitcher\u2019s Thistle and Blanding's Turtle, to name just a few. Removing any species from the list will jeopardize their survival.\nImproving outcomes for species at risk requires enforcement, not weakening, of the law. It also requires investment in stewardship, not writing off species at risk and their habitats as red tape.\nSincerely\nTed Kilpatrick - chair of Friends of Misery Bay\n",

How are you going to ensure that the Minister stays genuine and is not corrupted by big business?\nSection 1. Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nComment #3\nIn the following section:\nA. Provide the public earlier notice of COSSARO's species\u2019 assessment and classification results by making its report available to the public no later than three months after it is received by the Minister. Also, extend the time from when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to when listing is to occur from three to twelve months (i.e., when a species must be added to the SARO List).\nComment: What is stopping developers from going and destroying all the at risk species on their sites while the species don\u2019t have protection yet because you delayed the implementation?\nComment #4\nIn the following section of the proposed change:\nD. Allow the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species where the Minister forms the opinion based on scientific information that the classification may not no longer be appropriate. For species that are not yet on the list or are listed as special concern, the proposed changes provide that the species would not be added to the SARO List or listed to a more endangered status during COSSARO's re-assessment.\"\nComment: How is the Minister forming this potential decision, and what scientific information are they using to make this decision? What sources will be allowed or not allowed to be used for this \"scientific information\"? How will the scientific information be vetted? Does the Minister have complete power to decide to not take certain available scientific truths into consideration if someone whose vested interest is not in the protection of species at risk tells them to? The public deserves to know how such an absolute power will be handled in very specific detail.\nComment #5\nIn the following section of the proposed change:\nE. Require COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened. If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition.\nComment: How broad is broad? Are you actually suggesting that the Minister can force COSSARO to de-list or decide not to list species because they are common 800km away in the southern United States? Broad needs to be defined and measurable, and potentially different for each species. Details are required here.\nSection 2. Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nComment #6\nIn the following section of the proposed changes:\nA. De-couple the listing process from automatic protections and provide greater Minister\u2019s discretion on protections, while keeping the assessment as a science-based process at arm\u2019s length. While the role of classifying species would remain with COSSARO and listing of classified species would continue to be required, the proposed changes would provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species when the following specified criteria are met:\ni. applying the prohibitions to the species would likely have significant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario so additional time is required to determine the best approach to protect the species and its habitat;\nii. the temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario; and\niii. one of the following further criteria is met:\n1.\tthe species has a broad distribution in the wild in Ontario;\n2.\thabitat availability is not a limiting factor for the species;\n3.\tadditional time is needed to address the primary threats to the species, or co-operation with other jurisdictions is necessary to reduce the primary threats to the species,\n4.\tother criteria that may be specified by regulation.\nComment: What training or higher education does the Minister have to make discretion decisions on highly scientific and complex environmental systems? The current Minister has degrees in political science and English. How will the Minister\u2019s education be supplemented in order to make informed decisions? Who is advising the Minister, and are those individuals competent in these complex environmental systems? Will the Minister be receiving training from the scientific community in order to make these decisions? Or will the Minister who is not educated in such things have the power to make decisions without understanding the full impact that those decisions have? Perhaps it would be in the best interest of everything that calls Ontario home to have a Minster who is actually educated in environmentally related topics.\nFurther, how is \u201csignificant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario\u201d defined? Does the Minister have the ability to just make arbitrary decisions that something that isn\u2019t truthfully a significant economic impact now is because a business pressures them to?\nHow is \u201cbroad distribution\u201d defined under (iii.1.)? Who is defining this?\nUnder Item 4, what other criteria is this in reference to? What regulations are being targeted here? More details are required here.\nComment #7\nIn the following section:\nB. Enable scoping of species protections, where appropriate, via new Minister\u2019s regulations. This proposed new authority would enable species protections to apply to specific geographies or in specific circumstances (e.g., to species that are not affected by disease).\nComment: How is this notion of lifting protection for certain areas being regulated or managed? Who decides this? How is the Minster developing these regulations? And this section notes a new authority- what is this?\nComment #8\nIn the following section:\nC. Remove the mandatory legislative requirement and timeline to develop a habitat regulation proposal for each newly-listed threatened or endangered species and retain the option to develop a habitat regulation when needed.\nComment: Why are you removing the development of habitat regulations for species? What criteria is being used to decide when you will do it?\nComment #9\nIn the following section:\nD. Enable the Minister, rather than LGIC, to make species-specific habitat regulations.\nComment: Again, what qualifications does the Minster have to be making such decisions? Who will be advising the Minister on these decisions? How are you ensuring that the Minister stays true and is not being coerced into making poor environmental decisions to help benefit the pockets of corporations and business? How is that situation beneficial for tax payers?\nSection 3. Developing species at risk recovery policies\nComment #10\nIn the following section:\nA. Give the Minister discretion to extend the nine-month Government Response Statement development timeline, for some species.\nComment: How is the Minister deciding when this happens? Who is advising the Minister on this? The Ministry or businesses? How will it be determined what species this can be done for?\nComment #11\nIn the following section:\nC. Allow the Minister to extend timelines for conducting the review of progress towards protection and recovery based on individual species\u2019 needs.\nComment: What qualifications does the Minster possess to be able to determine the specific needs of species? Who is advising the Minister on this? What metrics will be used to determine these needs? When are you saying it would be appropriate to delay research into the progress of species?\nComment #12\nIn the following section:\nD. Remove duplicative requirements by removing specific reference to posting under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993 and instead requiring that certain products under the Act be made available publicly on a government website.\nComment: Why? Why are you making this change?\nSection 4. Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nComment #13\nIn the following section:\nCreation of Regulatory Charge and Agency \u2013 \u201cThe funds would support strategic, coordinated and large-scale actions that assist in the protection and recovery of species at risk\u2026. The proposed amendment would restrict the funds to fund only those activities that are reasonably likely to support the protection and recovery of prescribed species.\u201d\nComment: How is this going to be managed? Will there be timeframes and locational restrictions on where the money can be spent, and by whom? For example, if you let a developer destroy a wetland to build a commercial plaza, and that wetland contained species at risk that can be destroyed in this \u201cpay to play\u201d regime, will the money collected be used to benefit this wetland species? If not, then how is this pay to play regime beneficial to that species? Will there be timeline restrictions on how long the government can wait between allowing for the destruction of species at risk and their habitat, and when the money has to be used to provide benefit? How will you ensure that all the species destined to be destroyed in this \u201cpay to play\u201d regime are receiving equal benefit from the pool of money? Will each species have their own pool of money?\nFurther to this, who will own the land where the money is being spent? What is stopping a situation where restoration has occurred with money from this fund, and then a developer comes along and wants to build infrastructure on these funded restoration lands, and then that is destroyed because the developer paid into the fund, and now you have a net zero gain from all the previous destructions because their restoration has now been destroyed?\nComment #14\nIn the following section:\nCreation of Regulatory Charge and Agency \u2013 \u201c\u2026The proposed charges would only be available in respect of species prescribed by regulation\u2026 The proposed changes would provide for the ability to make a regulation to prescribe a subset of the species prescribed under the listing regulations as eligible for the payment-in-lieu charge.\u201d\nComment: Who is deciding which species are going to be destined for destruction? How is that being managed or updated? If a species on this destruction list becomes even more endangered over time because they continually get killed by developments, is there a mechanism to remove them from this destruction list?\nComment #15\nIn the following section:\nCreation of Regulatory Charge and Agency \u2013 \u201c\u2026Clients would still need to fulfill some on-the-ground requirements, including considering reasonable alternatives for their activity and taking steps to minimize the adverse effects of the activity on the species at risk.\u201d\nComment: What would these on the ground requirements look like? Who determines what they will be? How will these activities be overseen to ensure they are actually completed?\nComment #16\nIn the following section:\nCreation of Regulatory Charge and Agency \u2013 \u201c\u2026The agency would receive the funds and ensure informed, unbiased and expert decisions are made to disburse the funds to third parties that will undertake the activities in accordance with the purposes proposed to be set out in the statute. \u2026 The Minister would have the ability to establish guidelines (e.g. objectives and priorities) for funding and set standards for activities that receive funding\u2026 The proposed changes would include regulation making authority in respect of the composition, operation, governance and management of the agency (for example, composition of the board of directors for the agency).\u201d\nComment: How is the agency going to be unbiased if the Minster determines the guidelines, regulations, and can influence who is on the board of directors? Shouldn\u2019t the money be spent based on scientific truth and the opinion of qualified persons?\nComment #17\nIn the following section:\nAdditional Changes relating to Issuing Permits, and to Agreements and Regulatory Exemptions- A. Remove the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert in the \u2018D\u2019 permit process and replace the requirement for LGIC approval with Minister approval.\nComment: How is the Minister qualified to make decisions that were previously made by an independent expert? What training is the Minister receiving to now take on this role?\nComment #18\nIn the following section:\nAdditional Changes relating to Issuing Permits, and to Agreements and Regulatory Exemptions- B. Broaden the approach to minimizing adverse effects for permits and agreements (e.g., \u2018C\u2019 permit, \u2018D\u2019 permit, landscape agreements, section 18 harmonization) by shifting the focus from \u2018individual members\u2019 of the species to the \u2018species\u2019 more generally.\nComment: How are you ensuring that this change will not result in the extirpation of species from geographic areas where there are limited numbers of individuals found? Or is the government intending on extirpating species that they believe are in the way?\nComment #19\nIn the following section:\nAdditional Changes relating to Issuing Permits, and to Agreements and Regulatory Exemptions- D. Enable the Minister to establish codes of practice, standards or guidelines with respect to species at risk or their habitat, and enable regulations made under the Act to incorporate documents to supplement requirements or conditions related to species at risk.\nComment: How is the Minister qualified to establish these standards and guidelines? Who will actually be developing these guidelines?\nComment #20\nIn the following section:\nAdditional Changes relating to Issuing Permits, and to Agreements and Regulatory Exemptions- F. Replace s.18 with a new provision that would include a more flexible test and would allow the Minister to prescribe activities by regulation, to allow them to be carried out without requiring any additional authorizations under the ESA. An activity could be prescribed for this purpose, where it\u2026\nComment: How are these regulations being decided? What checks and balances are in place to ensure these are not developed each time a business wants to develop in an area with species at risk and they just don\u2019t want to have to deal with the \u201cproblem\u201d?\nComment #21\nAdditional Changes relating to Issuing Permits, and to Agreements and Regulatory Exemptions- G. Remove the requirement for the Minister to consult with an expert if the Minister forms the opinion that a proposed regulation is likely to jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario or to have any other significant adverse effect on the species\nComment: How is the Minister forming this opinion? Who is advising the Minister of this opinion? If a regulation is in fact jeopardizing the survival of a species, how is the Minister being informed, and what obligation does the Minister have to make a change to ensure the species does not become extirpated or extinct?\nWith regard to the details provided in Bill 108:\nComment #22\nIn the following section:\n3. Same(5)If consideration of the condition of the species both inside and outside of Ontario under clause(4) (b) would result in a species classification indicating a lower level of risk to the survival of the species than would result if COSSARO considered the condition of the species inside Ontario only, COSSARO\u2019s classification of a species shall reflect the lower level of risk to the survival of the species.\nComment: What regard is being given to distinct population groups? For example, if an endangered species in Ontario has a more populous group of relatives further into the states, but the genetic makeup of the two populations is different, are you still suggesting of downgrading the Ontario population even though it is genetically different from the population across the border? Is genetic testing studies being completed to check this? Having increased genetic diversity within species is important to ensuring resiliency as the climate starts changing and plants and animals are forced to adapt.\nComment #23\nIn the following section:\nDelay of prohibitions upon initial listing 8.2\nLimitations(3)Subsections (1) and (2) authorize a person to carry out an act that would otherwise be prohibited under clause 9 (1) (a) and subsection 10 (1) or to possess or transport something contrary to clause 9 (1) (b), subject to the following limitations:1.The person shall take reasonable steps to minimize the adverse effects of the activity that was authorized by the permit or agreement referred to in subsection (1) on the species that is listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List as an endangered or threatened species for the first time.\nComment: What are \u201creasonable steps\u201d? How are reasonable steps defined? Who decides if the steps are reasonable? Reasonable steps to a developer are going to be a lot different than the reasonable steps an ecological expert would be taking.\nComment #24\nIn this section:\nException,species regulations(1.2)Subject to section 57, the  Minister  may, by regulation, limit the  application of the prohibitions in subsection (1)  with respect to a species that is listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List as an endangered or threatened species.Same(1.3)Without limiting the generality of subsection (1.2), a regulation under that subsection may,(a)provide that  some of the prohibitions in subsection (1) do not apply with respect to a species or provide that they do not apply in specified circumstances;(b)limit the geographic areas to which all or some of the prohibitions in subsection (1) apply, or the times at which they apply, with respect to a species;(c)limit  the  application  of  all  or  some  of  the  prohibitions  in  subsection  (1)  to  a  specified  stage  in  the  development  of  a species; or(d)provide that a limitation set out in the regulation is subject to specified conditions.\nComment: Under what specified circumstances would protecting endangered species be deemed not applicable? How is the Minister deciding when this can occur, and what flexibility do they have in making such a decision?\nComment #25\nIn this section:\nBenefiting species(2)The  benefiting  species  under  a  landscape  agreement  are  not  required  to  be  an  impacted  species  under  that  agreement, subject to clause (3) (a)\nComment: If a developer comes in and wants to develop the last remaining habitat in a geographic area of the say Blanding\u2019s Turtle, and you allow it under a landscape agreement, because there were other species at risk also impacted, and the developer decides to benefit the Barn Swallow because it was also in the area, how is that in any way a benefit to the Blading\u2019s Turtle, that has been much more significantly impacted? The benefits in a landscape agreement should go to the species most severely impacted by the activity.\n",

They will not improve outcomes for species at risk. On the contrary, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.\nMore specifically, I do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Nor do I support the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme that would grease the wheels of destruction by allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats.\nImproving outcomes for species at risk requires enforcement, not weakening, of the law. It also requires investment in stewardship, not writing off species at risk and their habitats as red tape.\n",

The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"The Friends of Ojibway are forwarding this letter to you to express our concerns about Bill 108 as it relates to The Endangered Species Act in Ontario.\n The proposed Bill will have a devastating effect on species presently listed as Endangered, Threatened or Rare and will most certainly affect future species designated as such. Bill 108 will basically gut the Endangered Species Act as we know it and could become a tool to enable the destruction of habitat required for the survival of species in Ontario.\n If the proposed amendments are implemented it could have a devastating effect on our region. Windsor\/Essex County has the lowest percentage of natural areas in the province but has the highest concentration of rare species in Canada. These small remaining remnants of natural spaces would be devastated should further destruction be allowed to occur.\n Advances made in species protection and preservation over the past decade could swiftly disappear if Bill 108 as proposed is approved.  The Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks suggests these proposed amendments will \u201cimprove outcomes for species at risk\u201d. In fact the opposite is true. If adopted they will provide loopholes so that lands now afforded some protection can be destroyed.\n Our organization strongly opposes some of the proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act that will allow for the destruction of habitat in our province. This destruction will add to the growing list of extinct and extirpated species within Ontario.\nRegards\nBill Roesel\nPresident\nThe Friends of Ojibway Prairie\n",

        "comment":"I am not in favour of this proposal. I think that if this proposal is passed that the Endangered Species Act will fail to protect the species it is designed to protect and it will have no positive environmental outcomes. The following is why I think so:\ni. There is no benefit to prolonging the time that the Minister has from receiving the COSSARO report to adding the species to the SARO List. If COSSARO believes that the species population is declining, it is better to act fast rather than slow so that habitat and individuals are not lost. It is of more environmental benefit to protect rather than attempt to rebuild habitat that's lost while the Minister acts slowly.\nii. If COSSARO believes the species should be listed, the Minister should not have the power to suspend the species and habitat protection for up to 3 years. If additional time is required to determine the best approach to protect the species and its habitat, it can be done while it's protected. There's no benefit to the species to allow it's habitat to be developed or for the species to be disturbed should the criteria be met for the Minister to pause the protection. Once the species habitat is developed or the species is disturbed, there is no undo button. For example, if we find out after development of the species habitat that COSSARO was right asking for the species to be protected, then this Act failed the species.\niii. Developers should not be given the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act. No amount of money will recreate habitat to a species liking or un-disturb a species. Biota is finicky and unreasonable. Just because the habitat looks the same as before, doesn't mean the species agrees. Biota also doesn't have a concept of money. You can't pay a Blue Heron to be okay with machinery operating close to its nest- it will abandon the nest.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the ESA. I strongly oppose the changes that are being considered. They will not improve outcomes for species at risk. On the contrary, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.\nMore specifically, I do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Nor do I support the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme that would grease the wheels of destruction by allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats.\nImproving outcomes for species at risk requires enforcement, not weakening, of the law. It also requires investment in stewardship, not writing off species at risk and their habitats as red tape.\nAdditionally, i have the following comments and concerns regarding the proposed changes as outlined under the five categories:\n1. Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\n-Science-based listing of species at risk by COSSARO and automatic protection of listed species and\ntheir habitats are cornerstones of the ESA. They provide certainty, whereas ministerial discretion\npoliticizes the process, inviting delay and controversy.\n-There should be no change to the ESA regarding the listing process and the role of COSSARO. The law\nsets out a transparent approach to listing based on a consideration of \u201cthe best available scientific\ninformation, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional\nknowledge.\u201d (sec. 5(3)).\n-Edge of range species should not be denied protection based on their status outside Ontario\n2. Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\n- There should be no alternative to automatically protecting threatened or endangered species and\ntheir habitats upon listing.\n- Allowing the Minister to remove or delay protections is inappropriate and invites political meddling.\n3. Developing species at risk recovery policies\n-Legislated timelines are intended to ensure that actions needed to recover species occur without\nundue delay. There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce GRS within nine months\nof the release of Recovery Strategies or Management Plans. Failure to meet the legislated deadlines\nis a chronic problem, which should be addressed through improved implementation, not weakening\nof the law.\n4. Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements, and developing regulatory exemptions\n-This is the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act. The priority must be on\nprotecting and recovering species at risk.\n-There are already sufficient tools for authorizing harmful activities. No new tools are needed.\nChallenges should be addressed through improved implementation.\n-Proponents of harmful activities should NOT be allowed to simply pay into a fund rather than\nproviding on-the-ground reparation for damage done. This easy way out reduces accountability and\nfacilitates harm to species at risk and their habitats. Retain the current requirements to provide an\non-the-ground, overall benefit to species harmed.\n-Do not remove the requirement to obtain Cabinet approval or to consult with an independent expert\nregarding sec. 17(2)d permits. These are intended to be available only for projects that \u201cresult in a\nsignificant social or economic benefit to Ontario\u201d and that will not \u201cjeopardize the survival or recovery\nof the species in Ontario.\u201d These are appropriate requirements and ensure that such permits are\nissued only an exceptional basis.\n-Do not remove the requirement for the Minister to seek an independent opinion on regulations that\nmight jeopardize the survival of a species in Ontario. That would only make it easier for harmful\nactivities to proceed, without proper scrutiny.\n-The ESA (sec. 18) provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory\nframeworks, based on the standard of providing an overall benefit to species negatively impacted.\nUnless this standard is maintained, species will continue to decline.\n5. Enforcing the Endangered Species Act\nThis is an improvement as this inspection power is currently lacking. However, if the government were\nserious about improving outcomes for species at risk, it would remove the regulatory exemptions put\nin place in 2013 that have enabled over 2,000 of these harmful activities to proceed in the first place,\nwithout inspection or enforcement.\n",

        "comment":"I do not support the proposed changes contained within the 10th Year Review of Ontario's Endangered Species Act, and I believe that the Ontario government has a duty to preserve the biodiversity and natural spaces we have left in Ontario for current and future generations. I have a Master's of Science specializing in wildlife biology and I currently work as a researcher who focuses on Molecular Ecology. I primarily work to create molecular tools that allow us to improve our ability to detect and monitor at-risk, endangered, and invasive alien species in our province. I believe this provides me with excellent qualifications to provide informed comments on the problematic changes proposed for this act.\nOverall, I believe the proposed changes serve only to weaken the protections provided to endangered and at-risk species currently available in the province. We are currently experiencing a 6th mass extinction event on the planet and recent reports such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) provide key drivers of global biodiversity loss, such as \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d. All of these drivers of biodiversity loss are directly caused by human activities, meaning that it is our responsibility to change our behaviours in ways which minimize our harm on the environment.\nOntario was the first province in Canada to establish an Endangered Species Act and I believe that it is still our responsibility to raise the bar for environmental protections in our country, and across the globe. I believe that many of the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act serve only to lower the bar we\u2019ve set for protecting the environment and preserving our biodiversity. We are currently at a period of time where the rapid loss of biodiversity demands we increase our efforts to protect what remains, and I believe the proposed changes to the act inhibit our ability to do this.\nBelow, I outline what I believe to be the most problematic changes proposed:\n1)\tAssessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report to the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. The proposed changes suggest extending this time period from three to twelve months. This undermines the purpose of the Ontario Endangered Species Act and directly contradicts its purpose of providing timely protections to at-risk and endangered species so we can make efforts to protect and restore their habitats and populations. Additionally, the proposed changes suggest providing the Minister the power to veto recommendations put forth by COSSARO and this undermines the purpose of a committee of experts coming together to make recommendations that are informed by science and benefit the people of Ontario the most. The current Minister, Rob Phillips, also does not have a scientific background or any training in conservation or environmental policy and allowing him (and future Ministers who lack a scientific background) to have executive control over which recommendations pass is not in the best interest of the people of Ontario. Placing so much power in the hands of one individual\u2019s position regardless of political affiliation also increases the risk of corruptive forces dismantling the Endangered Species Act which is explicitly not in the interest of this act.\n2)\tDefining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThese proposed changes additionally reduce the automatic protections that would be granted by SARO and go against the interests of the ESA. As outlined above, putting this decision making process in the hands of the Minister whom is not required to have any background in conservation, population ecology, or biodiversity sciences opens up the Endangered Species Act to being easily corrupted against the interests of the species being protected by this act.\n3)\tDeveloping species at risk recovery policies\nLike above, this subsection of suggested changes will result in increasing delays which both do not need to happen and will have detrimental consequences on the species we need to be protecting. The current state of the global environmental crisis warrants an increased rapidity in response and action, not increasingly slowed decision making.\n4)\tIssuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nIssuing a system which allows for those with vested interests in land misuse an opportunity to pay a fee to openly destroy protected habitats and risk the long term success of at-risk and endangered species fundamentally goes against the changes we need to be making to protect local biodiversity. As outlined in the recent IPBES report, land misuse and direct exploitation of plants and animals are some of the leading causes for the rapid biodiversity loss we are seeing across the globe. A system in which you can pay to misuse protected lands and directly exploit the plants and animals which exist there will only further exacerbate the biodiversity loss being seen in Ontario. This is in direct contradiction to the purpose and goals of the Endangered Species Act and to allow these to go through is unconscionable. Lastly, providing the Minister with the power to work without expert consultation and based largely on their opinion of whats best for the species of concern is a massive oversight which opens too many opportunities for decisions to be made against the best interest of the species at hand, for the current Minister and for future Ministers.\nIn summary, I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act. The changes propose \u201c\u2026 to improve the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning.\u201d However, as I\u2019ve outlined, the recommended changes work directly against meeting these goals.\nThe proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts and creating justification to do so further. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections and increases the risk of extreme ecosystem harm should the current or future Minister become corrupted and begin making decisions which benefit those who want to misuse Ontario land and exploit native species. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed Species at Risk Conservation Trust is a detour for developers and friends of the Government around the present requirement that specific protections be implemented on any lands where a species has been found to be endangered.   It has no more moral or practical value in protecting species at risk in a particular local habitat than the \u201ccash in lieu of parking\u201d provisions of certain municipalities have in restraining inappropriate urban development and providing adequate parking in a downtown neighbourhood.   The Conservation Trust does nothing for endangered species in particular habitats;  It merely allows developers to rape them in exchange for hush money.\nThe proposed legislation should be amended on this point to require a sizeable, automatic payment (at least $10,000 per acre for each exemption requested) into the Conservation Trust by developers when filing a request for an exemption from local endangered species protection requirements.   In such cases the developer should also be required to submit to a local panel of scientists, ecologists and community leaders for approval a binding, viable mitigation plan, showing measures to be taken by the developer to reduce local species\u2019 endangerment.  An example of such arrangements might be the maintenance of protected open stream flow and marshland within parks if a large housing development is to be created in the area, and the provision of separate storm and sanitary sewers draining outside of the protected area.  Even after local approval, such developer exemptions should be subject to heavy punitive fines if the required mitigation plan is not properly implemented, or an endangered species is subsequently found to have been locally exterminated.\n",

        "comment":"Hi\nI'm concerned that portions of proposed policy changes for the endangered species act seem like step backwards from all the great work already done protecting the all wonderful  species and habitats that make Ontario such a great place to live. As an active outdoorsman, I want to continue to see biodiversity promoted for the health of Ontario's wildlife. Protecting areas for the endangered species gives us amazing opportunities to enjoy seeing and learning about all the interesting life in Ontario, and gives these endangered species a fighting chance to survive ongoing climate changes which is bringing new challenges from invasive species and diseases.\nThank you for the opportunity to voice our opinions!\nIn response to the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d\nThe planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA.

        "comment":"Dear Public Input Coordinator,\nI am very concerned about the difficult circumstances faced by species-at-risk in Ontario. Our province is home to 243 species that are at risk of extinction. Endangered and threatened species in Ontario have already been deprived of protections due to widespread exemptions for industry which were enacted in 2013. These exemptions have made it far too easy for critical habitat to be developed and\/or fragmented, and for species-at-risk to not be adequately protected.\nInstead of attempting to mitigate the effects of the more than one million species across the globe that are at risk of extinction, the Government of Ontario is doing the opposite. In Bill 108, it has included the \"More Homes, More Choice Act\" - 20 pages of amendments to the Endangered Species Act that would simply abandon or ignore species-at-risk. Preservation of our natural heritage is essential and should involve both protecting and recovering at-risk species (e.g., the Blanding\u2019s Turtle, Lake Sturgeon, Boreal Caribou, Polar Bear, Wolverine, Hog-Nosed Snake, Wood Turtle, Olive-Sided Flycatcher).\nSome of the more problematic amendments which are being proposed for the Endangered Species Act include:\n\u2022 allowing significant delays and interference regarding the listing of species-at-risk;\n\u2022 permitting exceptions and mechanisms for proponents to avoid prohibitions regarding these species and\/or their habitats;\n\u2022 placing severe limitations on the government\u2019s actions to protect and recover species-at-risk;\n\u2022 developing landscape agreements that would allow proponents to harm some species-at-risk in exchange for benefitting others; and,\n\u2022 proposing a \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d option - a new regulatory charge that proponents can pay in lieu of protecting and restoring species-at-risk or their habitats.\nDecisions on which species should be classified as \u201cextirpated\u201d, \u201cendangered\u201d, \u201cthreatened\u201d, or those of \u201cspecial concern\u201d (and the subsequent conservation mechanisms that are required for them) should be science-based and made only by scientists who work in the field. Politicians should have no involvement in this process.\nI strongly urge you to ensure that the Endangered Species Act is implemented as it was originally intended \u2013 with a focus on protecting and recovering species-at-risk. This legislation must lead to recovery for vulnerable species in Ontario rather than changes that will drive more of them toward extinction. To this end, please remove Schedule 5 (which contains deleterious proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act) from Bill 108.\nThank you for your consideration.\n",

        "comment":"I enjoy the managed forest environment for recreation and peace of mind, and as a way of life for economic support.  I work in northwestern Ontario in the forestry sector.  This is my back yard, the place that I value and love, my home.\nMy first comment is a general comment with regards to species habitat protections.  Often in recovery documents or information describing threats to species at risk (SAR) I read that harvesting or forest operations are a threat to habitat.  Harvesting and forest operation in Ontario are implemented per provincial policy to emulate natural disturbance and to protect SAR through the requirements of ESA Reg 242\/08 Sec. 22.1.  Harvesting and the strong renewal programs that are implemented per the legal requirements are actually habitat management tools and do not \u2018destroy\u2019 or \u2018damage\u2019 habitat.  Harvesting and renewal, or natural disturbance such as fire, ensures habitat sustainability over the long-term.  The natural environment is not static \u2013 ever.  The CFSA for our Crown Forests manages the forest landscape through the policy for boreal landscapes over the long term providing for sustainability.  I would encourage writers of recovery policies and descriptions on threats to start correctly stating that forestry operations implementing provincial policy, which includes the requirements for SAR protection per Reg 242\/08, on Crown Land are a tool to deliver long term forest health.\nMy comments related to Additional Changes Relating to issuing permits, and to Agreement and Regulatory Exemptions are as follows:\nSec. 55 of the Act provides for the creation of exemptions.  Regulation 242\/08 Sec 22.1 outlines the regulation \u2018exemption\u2019 for forestry on Crown Land.  This \u2018exemption\u2019 binds forestry practices to implement protections for species at risk as outlined in the Reg- those practices have their basis per the Crown Forest Sustainability Act.  My experience working in forestry I have put into practice the requirements of this regulation and found it effective protection for SAR and their habitat and efficient in terms of a well-established process under the FMP planning process. This regulation should be made permanent to allow forestry to continue to protect SAR under the CFSA.  I do not support \u2018harmonization\u2019 options under Sec. 18 of the Act.  The CFSA provides the forest management planning process consider all environmental, social and economic values on Crown Land.  All species, not just SAR are provided protections - a key benefit over the ESA. The CFSA is in its 25th year of effective implementation.\nI believe it is impossible to effectively balance all environmental values as well as social and economical values through any harmonization option.  The ESA has a single species focus, with no good ability to manage multiple species, not just SAR, with opposing needs at a landscape scale.  The CFSA is implemented through a wide body of policy and guidelines MNRF has written to implement forest operations to provide for the sustainability of the forest environment, of which only a part is SAR.  Sustainability is though managing a landbase for all values- environmental, economic and social -  not just SAR.\nI believe SAR are NOT more important than non-at-risk species, or people\u2019s livelihood and our communities or other forest environmental values.  The ESA is robbing the people of Ontario, and in my opinion, robbing other wildlife species that are not at-risk, from sustainability by putting only SAR first. This is due to the ESA single species focus which cannot be the framework to manage a landscape.\nIn northwestern Ontario, my home, forestry is a significant contributor to good paying jobs that support our communities.  Supporting permanent \u2018exemption\u2019 to forestry to continue to work under the CFSA with no harmonization under Sec. 18, means the MOECP does not have to re-invent the wheel so to speak by creating a different process and more red tape; it means that Ontario, particularly NW Ontario, will stay OPEN FOR BUSINESS supporting this government\u2019s priority.  The CFSA is a much more robust process to sustainability, to implement SAR protections, than the ESA is for the Crown Managed Forest.\nA further comment on changes to permits and agreements.  The idea of a landscape agreement- as I said above the Crown Forest landscape should continue to solely be managed per the CFSA.  Other \u2018landscapes\u2019 then this proposed change could apply to are private land.  Likely at scales not really \u2018landscape\u2019 level.  The purpose in the proposal is \u2018to benefit one or more species\u2019 is not going to work.  Often one species benefits to the detriment of another, and the ESA only permits \u2018benefit\u2019 and equally rates all species at risk with no priority order.  Landscape include all species, not just SAR, with no assessment of detriment to species not currently at risk.\nAs for further Sec. 18 of the Act proposed changes \u2013 to repeat myself \u2013 forestry should be permanently exempt through regulation as the activities are approved under another act, the CFSA.\nPoint G under changes to permits ect. \u2013 to remove the Minister to consult an expert, I agree with this proposed change that no expert need be consulted; however, I do not agree that the Minister alone should have sole power \u2013 I believe the Minister of MNRF and the Minister responsible for Mining should be required to be consulted. \u201cSingle silo\u2019s\u201d in government are not good especially when those ministers are responsible for other acts that could be operated under by regulation for the protection of SAR.\nMy comments for the proposed changes to COSSARO are as follows:\nThe proposed changes to COSSARO I support as proposed with two considerations: 1) Proposed change D \u2013 to allow Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider classification \u2013 my concern is that the Minister set a time frame of reconsideration within 12 months for example.  2) F \u2013 the proposal to broaden COSSARO member qualifications \u2013 yes I support this, but COSSARO should also have representatives from social sectors like First Nations, as well as the economic sector like Forestry, and northern Ontario municipal representative.  A wide set of voices is required as the Government values \u2018traditional\u2019 knowledge, as well as science.  A last note about COSSARO proposed changes \u2013 E \u2013 proposal to require COSSARO to consider other factors etc before classifying- I fully support this and it a long overdue positive change. Species found data deficient should not be listed, policy should not be based on a guess or worse on fear.\nMy comments for the proposed changed under \u201cDefining and implementing species and habitat protections\u201d are as follows:\nI support in principle the proposed changes under \u201cDefining and implementing species and habitat protections\u201d with the following exception.  Point D in this section, I do not agree the Minister should be given power solely to make species-specific habitat regulation. I believe it should be 3 Ministers at least (and ministries- eg MNRF and the one responsible for mining) required to provide input and joint decision making power.  It is not good to operate in a single \u2018silo\u2019.  This is because supporting the ability to regulate to work under different acts, these acts are likely in other ministry jurisdictions.\nI support the proposed changes to extend the timeline for development of recovery strategies, and to extend other timelines as noted in the proposal \u2013 I think this will ensure they are done right. By done right I mean completed specific to Ontario.  I do not support simply adopting federal documents as Ontario\u2019s own as has sadly been the practice.   I support that the proposed change to clarify the recovery strategy is advice to government and that policy defined in the Government Response Statement; but the Government Response Statement should specifically include social and economic analysis of the impact of implementation and the final policy decision balance the three pillars of sustainability (social, economic and environmental).\nMy comments related to proposed regulatory charge and agency are as follows:\nOn the topic of \u201cCreation of Regulatory Charge and Agency\u201d \u2013 I do not agree that this should extend to those operating under the Regulations.  This type of system works well for private land, small infrastructure developments on private land and area south of the forest area of the undertaking.  Forestry already provides stumpage payments and other payments and should not be burdened with additional charges when operations are conducted under the CFSA.  Keeping this proposed charge and agency out of the scope of Crown Forest will ensure Ontario remains OPEN FOR BUISNESS.\nAlso, I find it interesting that in the description of the section \u201cCreation of Regulatory Charge and Agency\u201d proposed changes, it justifies the proposed charges and agency by saying \u201cThis new approach will give greater certainty to business and better enable positive outcomes for species at risk compared to the current piece-meal industry led-approach\u201d  Wow, this description of a \u2018piece-meal\u2019 approach admits the current ESA and implementing overall benefit permits does not work, if what is being implemented is judged as \u2018piece-meal\u2019. Charges applicable to a sub-set of species will not fix \u2018piece-meal\u2019.  The entire concept of overall benefit permits needs to be revised, as simply adding a \u2018tax\u2019 won\u2019t fix it.  Under the Regulations \u2013 where forestry operates under the CFSA, forestry implements a ridge policy framework to provide a comprehensive program for environmental, social and economic protections for our forest environment \u2013 there is nothing \u2018piece-meal\u2019 about it.  It is a process that does not require charges or adjustment.\nIn an effort to reduce red-tape, creating another over-paid board-governed provincial agency is not useful and is cost prohibitive to the people of Ontario. I think these charge and agency proposed changes need further thought and review.\nMy comments on proposed changes related to Enforcement are as follows:\nOn the topic of enforcement:  Enforcement powers and offense provisions existing in the ESA should NOT be applied to activities conducted under the regulations where the regulations permit work under another act.  For example the CFSA already has enforcement and offense provision; do not duplicate enforcement and offense provisions that is not efficient and would hinder the goal of being OPEN FOR BUSINESS.\nThe protection order powers at the Minister\u2019s discretion should not be solely at the MOECP\u2019s discretion.  The MNRF and the one responsible for mining should be jointly hold \u2018discretion\u2019.  I do not believe that power should be held in \u2018one silo\u2019.\nThank you for consideration of my comments.\n",

        "comment":"As a resident of Ontario and a strong proponent of environmental protection, I am extremely opposed to the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act. Ontario once had the strongest protections for Endangered Species in Canada, but the changes outlined in Bill 108, Schedule 5, would drastically weaken the protections for our most vulnerable species and prevent the ESA from efficiently protecting these species and their habitat.\nI am specifically opposed to:\n1.\tChanges that allow the Ministry to delay or withhold protections on whim without the input of external, qualified scientists;\n2.\tPushing back when protections kick in after soon-to-be-listed species are announced, which allows developers more time to knowingly degrade, damage, and remove the habitat used by listed species before protections legally begin;\n3.\tChanges that no longer automatically protect newly listed species from existing developments and industry, and no longer automatically protect vital habitat;\n4.\t\u201cScoping\u201d of protections \u2013 with the vague wording used (\u201cspecific circumstances\u201d), the Minister essentially has free rein to withhold protections on a whim; and\n5.\t\u201cPay to slay\u201d \u2013 instating a \u201cSpecies at Risk Conservation Trust\u201d to accept cash instead of actual conservation and restoration work currently required by the ESA. Replacement or restoration of original habitat is NOT as good as preserving original habitat, and should be a last resort. There is also no substitute for strong and enforced regulation, and accepting monetary compensation sends the wrong message on how little value the Government of Ontario and the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Park place on Ontario\u2019s unique, irreplaceable, and priceless Species at Risk. It is absolutely unbelievable that the Bill reassures the reader that payment-in-lieu would be \u201cwithin the range of costs that a client would have otherwise incurred through meeting the species-based conditions of an authorization\u201d \u2013 if we are willing to sacrifice Species at Risk for money, the regulatory charge should at least exceed the typical costs for carrying out conservation and restoration activities as a deterrent!\nAdditionally, many of the proposed changes are written using exceptionally vague language without concrete details or examples, making it difficult to understand how these changes would affect the process of listing and protected species under the amended Endangered Species Act. The vague language also seems to imply that many decisions will be up to the Ministry\u2019s discretion, as the proposed changes would do little to curtail delayed or scoped protections based on specific interests.\n",

        "comment":"A general overview of the changes you propose to make is that species will only receive protection if doing so does not prevent development or the ability for people to make money. Given that the forestry and mining sectors already have an exemption from the ESA, you are simply including all other industries in that exemption. As a consequence, the only time a species, or its habitat, receives protection, is when it is not under threat, which, of course, obviates the need for legislation to protect species. Automatic protection must not be removed.\nThere are a number of times that the rigourousness, independence and unbiased nature of the process is referenced but ultimately decisions about protection lie in the hands of the Minister, which means that the process is not unbiased and independent. In fact, the number of aspects in the proposed changes that are at the discretion of the Minster is remarkable. Administering the legislation on a case-by-case basis is extremely flawed and is not in the spirit of legislation that defines a clear set of rules. The process of receiving protection must be independent of the Minister and the Minister's interpretation must not outweigh that of the independent committee.\nBy virtue of being listed as at risk, we have deemed it necessary to value the individuals of the species, in accordance with its rank. Species are listed because either habitat or individuals are few\/lacking. If you only wield protection when it is absolutely critical, your legislation will only come into effect once the species has been reduced to the point of nearly being extirpated (because otherwise there are other locations in Ontario where the species can be found, despite being Endangered). Species only receive protection once they are critically endangered in Ontario, because this is the only instance when the survival of the species will be jeopardized. This undermines the SAR ranking system. Protection must continue to be granted for all Threatened and Endangered species to ensure that they do not become more imperiled.\n3D: Reword: \u201cRemove duplicative requirements by removing specific reference to posting on the government website and instead requiring that certain products under the Act be made available under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993.\u201d Either that or explain what \u201ccertain products\u201d are.\nSpecies at Risk Conservation Trust: Ironically this is the same principle as a Carbon Tax. My main concern with this is that you are proposing to spend money to support protection but i) work could be done in support of species, say in the form have habitat remediation, that is then undone by an ensuing project because the habitat of a species is no longer protected, and ii) because species do not receive automatic protection, and it is at the discretion of the Minister as to whether a species receives protection, it is believable that no developer will ever actually pay any money into this trust.\n4G: This statement should not be left so vague as to imply that if a Minister does not form the opinion, that the Minister does not have to consult an expert. It should be clearly stated that the Minister must consult an expert in order to form the opinion that it will not jeopardize the species.\n",

        "comment":"The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) is Ontario\u2019s largest non-profit, conservation-based organization, representing 100,000 members, supporters and subscribers, and 740 member clubs. We have reviewed ERO Proposal 013-5033, as well as Schedule 5 (Endangered Species Act) of Bill 108 \u201cAn Act to amend various statutes with respect to housing, other development and various other matters\u201d and respectfully submit the following comments for consideration.\nGeneral\nIn our previous submission dated March 4 2019, we identified several long-standing concerns with Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act (ESA) and strongly encouraged the Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) to undertake a thorough review of the Act. We commend the government for undertaking this thorough review, and are pleased to see that several of our concerns have been addressed in Schedule 5 of Bill 108.\nThe proposed changes will shift some of the responsibility that is currently delegated to unelected officials and return it to the Minister, while also infusing the process with additional flexibility. Given the increase in Ministerial discretion and responsibility, the OFAH expects to see an attendant increase in the transparency of the entire process including government decisions.\nThe changes proposed in Bill 108 present a tremendous opportunity to improve efficiency and potentially better outcomes for species at risk; however, successfully leveraging these opportunities will hinge entirely on balanced implementation. While we support changes that will enable a more efficient and effective implementation of the Endangered Species Act to protect and restore Ontario\u2019s biodiversity, we will not support measures that simply remove barriers to development.\nAssessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nIn our previous submission, we voiced concerns about an unelected body (the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario; COSSARO) making unchallengeable decisions of provincial significance, especially given the lack of relevant expertise for certain species. We support the proposed expansion of relevant expertise to include community knowledge and wildlife management expertise as we previously recommended; however, without an increase in the size of COSSARO, there will still be many species for which the relevant expertise is not present on the committee. Logically, community knowledge will vary by species \u2013 how will these diverse backgrounds be incorporated? There is nothing in Bill 108 that forces a change to the committee\u2019s composition to include these additional perspectives. We recommend reviewing the COSSARO Terms of Reference to ensure they are reflective of these changes.\nThe bill proposes to increase the predictability of COSSARO\u2019s reporting requirements by requiring submission of an Annual Report in January of each year. The OFAH is supportive of this change. We recommend that the COSSARO Annual Report outline: (1) how each species scored against the evaluation criteria (Indicators A to E); and (2) anonymous voting results. In the interest of transparency, we further recommend that the Minister release those reports publicly and in an unedited form. These changes would improve certainty, transparency, and predictability of listing decisions and the associated impacts of protections.\nThe bill proposes to increase the maximum length of time before adding species to the Species at Risk in Ontario (SARO) list from 3 months to 12 months. We interpret this to mean the Minister maintains the authority to add a species to the SARO list earlier if necessary. If this interpretation is correct, then we agree with this change as long as 12 months is not the default timeline.\nWe support the proposed changes to Subsections 8 (3) and (4) of the Act to lower threshold for species reassessment under strict criteria, as recommended in our previous submission.\nIn our previous submission, we expressed concern about edge of range species and how recovery actions were prioritized relative to other listed species. Bill 108 proposes to require COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 status across its broader range and mandates a lower threat designation in some circumstances.  In our view, species that were historically precarious in Ontario, but healthy elsewhere, could be given lower priority for recovery actions under certain circumstances. Given that the species assessment processes differ between Canada, Ontario, and the United States, how will COSSARO effectively assess a historically precarious species such as gray fox or spotted gar in other jurisdictions? Does the \u201clowest level of risk\u201d mentioned in Section 5 (5) include the Special Concern and Not at Risk designations, or is it limited to Endangered or Threatened?\nDefining and implementing species and habitat protections\nSome species have significant connections to humans, whether through their distribution (e.g. barn swallows), specific relationships to a particular industry and its impacts (e.g. bobolink and agriculture), or socio-economic value through sustainable use (e.g. Lake Sturgeon). These species warrant special consideration and increased flexibility in order to develop effective, targeted protections, while also recognizing their interactions with humans. We support the Minister\u2019s authority to pause protections for particularly difficult species under the strict criteria listed in Section 8.1 (3); however, we expect the use of this authority to be used only in exceptional circumstances, as there are some species for which a delay of three years would be very detrimental. The listing of the bobolink, and the associated impacts on agriculture, demonstrate that a heavy-handed regulatory approach can destroy goodwill and peoples\u2019 sense of stewardship while doing nothing to protect species. How will the government determine what constitutes \u201csignificant social or economic implications\u201d as described in Section 8.1 (3)(b)(i)?\nAs stated previously, general habitat protections and the development of specific habitat regulations are not warranted for many species, particularly those that are not limited by habitat. Eliminating the mandatory requirement to protect the habitat of Threatened or Endangered species that are at risk due to factors other than habitat loss\/degradation should result in more efficient use of limited resources and time for both the proponents and the government. We support this change.\nWe support the addition of Section 27.1 Species Protection Order to expand the Minister\u2019s authority to implement Species Protection Orders in addition to existing habitat protection orders.\nDeveloping species at risk recovery policies\nWe support all changes proposed in this category on the condition that \u201cremoving specific reference to posting under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d does not limit public consultation opportunities in any way.\nIssuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nWe support the establishment of the Species at Risk Conservation Fund which, if administered properly, could enable strategic and large-scale species conservation efforts that are not possible under the current system. This will be in addition to, rather than replacing, the existing permitting route which proponents can still choose to access. Enabling tools that incentivize species conservation is a positive step as long as developers are still required to avoid and mitigate impacts where possible.\nMECP staff has informed us that only a small subset of species would be eligible under this regulation, mainly due to the disproportionate permitting burdens. Which species are being considered for inclusion in this regulation? How will the government accurately estimate the amount of the species conservation charge? If there is uncertainty about an appropriate species conservation charge, we recommend erring on the side of caution by increasing the charge to ensure an overall benefit to the program.\nOur understanding is that this will require development of additional regulations, providing another opportunity for public comment. Section 20.7 of the Act outlines the activities that are eligible for funding from the Fund, but there is no information about the monitoring and reporting requirements for projects that receive funding. Is the onus on the proponent to monitor and report on progress? Section 20.8 outlines the creation of Guidelines for Funding \u2013 will these be informed by public input?\nWe agree with the proposed changes to Section 16 of the Act to ensure that landscape agreements conform to previously published government response statements, thus ensuring compliance with formal policy direction.\nEnforcing the Endangered Species Act\nNo comment.\nConclusion\nThe reality is that the government has never had the capacity to implement the ESA as it was intended, and the Species at Risk in Ontario list has become a species purgatory. The changes proposed in this bill recognize the reality of species protection and recovery in Ontario and will enable additional tools that can be harnessed to benefit listed species and incentivize conservation.

        "comment":"The planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"In Ontario, The ESA and the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) do not align in a way which works for the people of Ontario nor is having both of these pieces of Legislation acting together on the same land base as it pertains to Forest Management in Ontario. The CFSA mandates Forest Management at two scales, the landscape level, and at a stand level. The well founded and strong science that drives this approach theoretically provides habitat across time for species at risk using both the coarse and fine scales. The ESA only manages at the fine scale for individual species, often time at the detriment to other species. The CFSA and the legislated guides that form Ontario's forest management policy framework are an effective tool that provides for the long term sustainability of a healthy landscape\/ecosystem. The ESA's stipulation that one cannot \"harm, harass etc...\" creates area's that are effectively forever off limits to management, even though the forest cover is not static over time, this flies contrary to the paradigm of Landscape level course and fine filter management, which is not necessarily for an overall benefit to the species for which the restriction is being created for. The ESA as written would effectively halt Ontario's forest Sector if the CFSA would be replaced by the ESA, which I am vehemently against as the CFSA has proven to be world class piece of legislation. Alternatively, the idea of harmonization between the acts is also counter productive because the two paradigm's cannot coexist on the same landscape without both harm to landscape level integrity, and Ontario's economy. Thus; the forest sector in Ontario requires a permanent solution to the ESA, which can be accomplished through a permanent section 55 Regulatory Exemption. I do not support the Harmonization option as it does not effectively deal with the socio-economic and landscape level management risks associated with the ESA. The only path forward for a strong and resilient landscape in an era of fire suppression, and a strong and resilient Northern\/rural Ontario economy and communities is to enact the CFSA as an equivalent process to the ESA.\n",

I strongly support the long term Section 55 regulatory Exemption on the basis that the Crown Forest Sustainability Act serves as an equivalent process to the Endangered species Act. In fact the CFSA is a more sustainable approach that respects the necessary balanced consideration of environmental; social; cultural and economic aspects imperative to forest management. I do not support attempts to harmonize the CFSA with the ESA through amendments to section 18 proposed in this posting.\nA practical northern solution to the ESA is critical to sustaining the northern economy and way of life. No doubt endangered species are important but they must be managed in a manner that respects jobs and communities as part of a landscape approach to balanced forest management. Endangered species should not be blindly protected at all cost; balance is paramount.\n",

        "comment":"With a recent UN report estimating that 1 million species worldwide risk extinction, some of the changes made in this review are irresponsible. Rather than bolster protection for our rapidly declining biodiversity, these changes clearly place the needs of developers and corporate interests above those of the species the act claims to protect.\nThe inclusion of the \"Species at Risk Conservation Trust\" is perhaps the most flagrant example of this. In addition to the disingenuous title, it makes no sense from an environmental perspective. Damaging our ecosystems today in favour of some ill-defined, hypothetical benefit in the future is a losing proposition. Once our ecosystems are gone, there's really no way to get them back.\nAdditionally, the changes laid out in section 2 introduce a number of opportunities for conflicts of interest to arise. Changes here should ensure that the committee of experts has the final say in which species are protected, with minimal opportunity for intervention by the minister or other parties whose interests are counter to the protection of our species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"I am concerned that the proposed changes to The Endangered Species Act would make it much easier for developers to build at the cost of endangered species.\n1A. By extending the time when when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to when listing is to occur from three to twelve months you provide opportunity for the act to be exploited. Within those twelve months development could occur rapidly causing irreparable damage to the listed species. There is no benefit to the endangered species by extending this time, and three months is already reasonable.\n1D. COSSARO consists of expert scientists in conservation biology. By allowing the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species you are ignoring science and delaying the protection of endangered species. This also allows the Minister to delay controversial listings, further weakening the protections of the act.\n1E. \"If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition.\" COSSARO already considers the condition of the species in a broader biologically relevant geographic area during the assessment progress. I am concerned that this change will make it difficult to list species with a broad range until they are in decline everywhere. Recovery is more likely to be successful when protections are implemented sooner. This change also ignores the many reasons why conserving species on the edge of ranges is important.\n1F. It is not clear who would be included by broadening COSSARO member qualifications to include members who have relevant expertise in ecology, wildlife management, as well as those with community knowledge. Scientists and those with traditional indigenous knowledge are already included, and it seems this change is a way to non-scientists in COSSARO. COSSARO should include scientists who do not have pressures from other sources impacting their priorities.\n2A. Keeping the science-based assessment process \"at arm's length\" from decision making regarding protection of species is outright irresponsible. Further, by allowing a three year hiatus on implementing protections, you are putting the species at further risk for the sake of development. The purpose of the act is to protect endangered species, and this change is basically a giant loophole to only protect species when it is convenient. By the time the three year hiatus has finished, the species may have experienced further declines from which it cannot recover.\n3A. Listing a species is already a time consuming process, and when population declines are steep action needs to be taken quickly. Extending the response statement timeline unnecessarily lengthens the process, and provides a way to slow down the listing of controversial species. There is no reason to extend this timeline, and this amendment should be removed.\n3C. Again, extending timeline causes unnecessary delays which can provide developers to finish projects in areas that should be protected and a way to slow down the listing of species.\n4. The so called \"Pay to Slay\" weakens the act by making assumptions that are known to be untrue for many taxa. Habitat that is destroyed cannot simply be replaced somewhere else for a net zero effect. Ecosystems take time to become established, and may not provide the same resources to endangered species as the original habitat.\n4B. By shifting the approach from individual species to species more generally, the act is ignoring cumulative impacts. In most cases a species is not threatened by one thing. Rather many small impacts add up to cause a decline. Many small scale impacts will add up to impact the species as a whole.\n4E. Landscape level agreements should be used with caution because they can ignore site or species specific issues and cumulative impacts. If a landscape agreement is implemented, effort should be made to include the requirements of specific taxa that are to be protected.\n",

        "comment":"Many species are declining across the world and in Canada. The province of Ontario is not immune to these declines; there are currently more than 200 species at risk (SAR) in the province. The main purpose of the ESA should be to protect species, not to expedite development. Any changes to the ESA should be made with great care, as without diligent legislation there is a risk of additional habitat loss and population declines. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extirpated from Ontario, and such losses to our natural heritage are unacceptable in the face of so many other unmitigated threats to biodiversity. Ontario has an opportunity to be a leader in biodiversity conservation, with an ESA that is the gold standard to which other jurisdictions aspire.\nI agree that the public should be notified quickly of COSSARO\u2019s species\u2019 assessments, but listing should be immediate. Waiting one year after the species is listed could result in harmful effects on the species. I must stress that a lot of these species, particularly amphibians and reptiles, are already facing rapid declines, so immediate protection is strongly recommended. I also strongly disagree with the possible suspension of listings for up to three years, as such long delays could allow large developments and lack of mitigation, potentially wiping out populations of species that should be listed but whose listings have been unnecessarily delayed. Furthermore, threatened and endangered species should have habitat regulations, as these species are especially vulnerable.\nCOSSARO is an independent committee with expertise in scientific disciplines and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (TEK), and these individuals take great care and consideration when making decisions about which species should be listed as at risk. I do agree with broadening member qualifications, but this should not take away from the legitimacy of the organization. The current proposal calls for including those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d \u2013 a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have unbiased expertise in species assessment or that have a different agenda altogether. I still strongly oppose that the minister should be able to overrule decisions made by COSSARO, as such veto power explicitly undermines the arms-length scientific approach that is supposed to be used to assess species.\nI also strongly oppose COSSARO being required to base its assessments on the status of a species throughout its range, as opposed to in Ontario only. For species that have a small portion of their range in Ontario, these populations often present unique adaptations and reservoirs of genetic variation, facilitating resilience to climate change. Loss of our Ontario populations means loss of global diversity in the species. As Aldo Leopold said, \u201cTo keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.\u201d Allowing species to be wiped out in Ontario simply because they occur elsewhere is short-sighted.\nThe Species at Risk conservation trust could be a powerful tool under some circumstances, but there is great room for such a program to be abused. This trust could allow for areas facing development to be developed by simply paying into the trust as opposed to protecting the resident species at risk. Such a proposal runs the risk of jeopardizing the social license that many large companies currently have. If companies are seen to be \u201cbuying\u201d the right to destroy the habitat of endangered species, they will be viewed as poor corporate citizens and likely lose business in the long term. Under certain circumstances, SAR habitat may be lost, and such a program could result in compensatory habitat creation elsewhere. In those cases there should result a net gain in quality SAR habitat for the same species. Net gains or losses should not be measured as simplistic aerial extent of habitat lost versus created, as the quality of habitat and whether it is actually occupied by viable subpopulations is more meaningful. Although complex to measure, indicators that are relevant to the SAR classification system should be used, such as numbers of mature individuals, survival rates, reproductive rates, area of occupancy, and long-term viability of the mitigation project.\nThe proposed changes include amending the act to strike out \u201cthe environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d and substituting \u201ca website maintained by the Government of Ontario\u201d. Such a change would mean that the opportunity for public input is lost.  Removing opportunities for public input eliminates government accountability to the public and prevents the public to participate in the protection and recovery of species at risk.\n\tLastly, I agree that better enforcement is necessary to protect SAR. There is a strong need for enforcement of the ESA through fines and if necessary, incarceration.\nThe purposes of the ESA are:\n1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.\n3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c.\u00a06, s.\u00a01.\nI believe that the proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. Given that, I strongly advise you to reconsider the proposed changes and further consult with the public and professionals, to use a collaborative and transparent approach to responsible development while also protecting SAR.\n",

This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery.

Instead it obviously is written for the narrow benefit of special interests such as developers.  The Premier was caught promising these benefits to special interests before the election,  while he was misleading Ontarians about his intentions to do so.   The natural resources that the Endangered Species Act helps regulate are critical to many different industries,  private and public stakeholders,  both now and in the future.\nThe legislation is designed to eliminate barriers created by inconvenient scientific and objective facts and reality when they conflict with economic special interests to whom the legislation panders.  There are a number of unacceptable aspects to the proposal:\n1)  Requiring experts to consider the status of a given species outside of Ontario before classifying it as at risk.  This is utterly ridiculous - the government by definition has the public responsibility of setting policies that apply to Ontario,  not anywhere else.  The only thing that is relevant is the status of the species in Ontario, if it's native to Ontario.  By this flawed logic, is the government going to tell Ontarians who are now being affected by severe flooding issues,  that since the Sahara desert is dry,  the government doesn't have to do anything to deal with the problem?   It's a clear way of eliminating scientific facts from the process, since in many cases it will be possible to find somewhere that a given species has a different status.\n2) Allowing the Environment Minister to interfere in species protection and permit processes.  For example, removing the requirement for the Minister to consult with independent scientific experts.  This describes allowing political and special interests lobbying to dominate the decisions that affect all Ontarians,  which appears to be what the government and the Premier want.\n3)  Allowing a payment fee to give developers the opportunity to bypass critical protection activities.  \"allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act\".   This is outrageous,  it basically sells off natural resources that belong to everyone in Ontario to the government's lobbying friends.   Is the government going to also then offset whatever costs do accrue to developers with heavy tax cuts that will be paid for by everyone else through cuts in health care,  education,  and public services?\n4) Creating a deliberately crafted delay of years from when a species is classified to when it is protected by the act (by increasing the default time to 12 months and giving the Environment Minister the ability to arbitrarily extend that period through \"reconsiderations\" that don't have to be scientifically or factually based.\n",

We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"After reading the proposed legislation, I do not agree with some critics that the proposed amendments to Ontario's environmental laws will \u201cgut\u201d the province's protection regime for endangered species.\nHowever, in matters affecting endangered species of plants and animals, unfettered ministerial discretion and an alternative avenue for land developers to pay into an environmental trust instead of being subject to an independent environmental review and permission process are a clear invitation to corruption and abuse of Ontario's environmental protection process. As such they are bad public policy and will cost any government politically, especially when consequent resulting scandals are publicized. Further protections in these areas therefore need to be built into the amending legislation.\nOn the other hand, the proposal to improve public participation by including other persons than scientists on environmental assessment panels makes sense, provided that they are respected members of other professional groups serving society that require evidence-based judgments, are barred from political and economic affiliations which might prejudice their judgements, and do not form a majority of the panel which could decide to override competent and unanimous scientific advice.\n",

        "comment":"Many species are declining across the world and in Canada. The province of Ontario is not immune to these declines; there are currently more than 200 Species At Risk (SAR) in the province. The main purpose of the ESA should be to protect species, not to expedite development. Any changes to the ESA should be made with great care, as without diligent legislation there is a risk of additional habitat loss and population declines. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extirpated from Ontario, and such losses to our natural heritage are unacceptable in the face of so many other unmitigated threats to biodiversity. Ontario has an opportunity to be a leader in biodiversity conservation, with an ESA that is the gold standard to which other jurisdictions aspire.\nWe agree that the public should be notified quickly of COSSARO\u2019s species\u2019 assessments, but listing should be immediate. Waiting one year after the species is listed could result in harmful effects on the species. We must stress that a lot of these species, particularly amphibians and reptiles, are already facing rapid declines, so immediate protection is strongly recommended. We also strongly disagree with the possible suspension of listings for up to three years, as such long delays could allow large developments and lack of mitigation, potentially wiping out populations of species before protection is enacted. Furthermore, Threatened and Endangered species should have expedited, not delayed, Habitat Regulations, as these species are especially vulnerable.\nCOSSARO is an independent committee with expertise in scientific disciplines, and these individuals take great care and consideration when making decisions about which species should be listed as at risk. Broadening member qualifications must not take away from the legitimacy of the organization. There is a need for taxa experts and those well-versed in research and recovery of Ontario\u2019s plants and wildlife. Members must fully appreciate and understand natural and anthropogenic threats and their impacts on the biology of our native SAR and their habitats. The current proposal calls for including those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d \u2013 a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have unbiased expertise in species assessment or that have a different agenda altogether. We still strongly oppose that the minister should be able to overrule decisions made by COSSARO, as such veto power explicitly undermines the arms-length scientific approach that is supposed to be used to assess species. COSSARO assessments are based on IUCN criteria that have been refined over many decades, and the majority of COSSARO's assessments have already been fully vetted through the federal listing process (COSEWIC), which includes significant peer review from provincial and federal governments, stakeholders, ATK, biologists and taxa specialists.\nWe also strongly oppose COSSARO being required to base its assessments on the status of a species throughout its range, as opposed to in Ontario only. For species that have a small portion of their range in Ontario, these populations often present unique adaptations and reservoirs of genetic variation, facilitating resilience to climate change. Loss of our Ontario populations means loss of global diversity in the species. As Aldo Leopold said, \u201cTo keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.\u201d Allowing species to be wiped out in Ontario simply because they occur elsewhere is short-sighted and not indicative of the values placed on Ontario\u2019s natural heritage by residents of the province. Furthermore, SAR play an important role in our local ecosystems, and as species diversity declines, so does the overall health of our natural areas. Ontario will likely become an important region to safeguard populations as the impacts of climate change worsen; this potential cannot be overstated. Finally, Ontario must never rely on neighbouring provinces and countries to protect SAR. This passes the responsibility and control on to others, and shows Ontario\u2019s lack of interest in protecting its biodiversity. Ontario residents have widely embraced the protection of SAR, and have provided countless volunteer hours to ensure their protection and recovery. The proposed changes will quickly negate those efforts, as species will lose the protection and the heightened awareness provided by listing, and lost funding opportunities that often provide the minimum requirement to get volunteer efforts started.\nThe Species at Risk conservation trust could be a powerful tool under some circumstances, but there is great room for such a program to be abused. This trust could allow for areas facing development to be developed by simply paying into the trust as opposed to protecting the resident species at risk. Such a proposal runs the risk of jeopardizing the social license that many large companies currently have. If companies are seen to be \u201cbuying\u201d the right to destroy the habitat of endangered species, they will be viewed as poor corporate citizens and likely lose business in the long term. Under certain circumstances, SAR habitat may be lost, and such a program could result in compensatory habitat creation elsewhere. In those cases there should result a net gain in quality SAR habitat for the same species. Net gains or losses should not be measured as simplistic aerial extent of habitat lost versus created, as the quality of habitat and whether it is actually occupied by viable subpopulations is more meaningful. Although complex to measure, indicators that are relevant to the SAR classification system should be used, such as numbers of mature individuals, survival rates, reproductive rates, area of occupancy, and long-term viability of the mitigation project.\nThe proposed changes include amending the act to strike out \u201cthe environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d and substituting \u201ca website maintained by the Government of Ontario\u201d. Such a change would mean that the opportunity for public input is lost. Removing opportunities for public input eliminates government accountability to the public and prevents the public to participate in the protection and recovery of SAR.\nLastly, we agree that better enforcement is necessary to protect SAR. There is a strong need for enforcement of the ESA through fines and if necessary, incarceration.\nThe purposes of the ESA are:\n1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.\n3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.\nWe believe that the proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. Given that, we strongly advise you to reconsider the proposed changes and further consult with the public and professionals, to use a collaborative and transparent approach to responsible development while also protecting SAR.\n",

Any species loss lessens us as a people.\nI voted for the Ford government because I I wanted some fiscal sanity, not to throw open the gates to unbridled development that will endanger the natural world that supports us all.\nGiven the rapid pace of urbanization in southern Ontario we don't need fewer regulations-we need more before we all disappear beneath concrete and asphalt.\nScrap these proposals to weaken the Endangered Species Act.

        "comment":"I am strongly opposed to the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act. These changes are extremely regressive and will add significant pressure on species that are at risk of becoming extinct in Ontario.\nIt is clear that the proposed changes will not benefit any species at risk, they have been made to benefit developers. The possible extinction of Ontario\u2019s species is not worth short-term economic gain. We need to start making long-term conservation plans We are at a tipping point, and if we don\u2019t immediately implement strict regulations to protect these species it will be too late for many. 90% of wetlands in southern Ontario have already disappeared. 90% of many species of songbirds have declined. 60% of wildlife populations have disappeared worldwide. This has all happened within the last 5 decades. Extinction is forever - it will be much more costly when the government of Ontario is scrambling to save species from the brink of extinction than it is to maintain the current laws that were made to protect them.\nIt is clear that the new provincial government has no interest in wildlife conservation, but Ontarians have the right to see these species protected. These species have the right to a habitat which they depend on for survival. We continue to exploit our resources for profit, and we continue to fail to give something back to the system that sustains us. Everything we have comes from the environment and we take it for granted. This new proposal is based on greed and there is no denying that. With these proposed changes we are talking about the risk of losing 200+ species to extinction. I can\u2019t sleep at night knowing the threat that these changes may bring to our wildlife, our environment, and to our people.\nTo summarize, none of the proposed changes should be implemented - keep the Endangered Species Act as-is. I am an ecologist with a wealth of knowledge and experience in this subject and my comments should be considered.\nFirst and foremost, do NOT allow developers and municipalities to pay money to opt out of the Endangered Species Act. Since when do we allow people to pay money to get out of the law? This is absolutely preposterous. Every single developer and municipality is going to take advantage of this, and this is going to be detrimental to species at risk all over Ontario. What is the sense in having legislation if you can simply back out of it? The money to be made by this is nowhere near the replacement value of the species that we will lose from development. Species that are threatened and endangered are in imminent danger of going extinct. If hundreds of development projects are to proceed without protecting these species, we will lose entire populations, and possibly entire species. Again this is an excuse to let developers do what they want so they can profit while the rest of the people and wildlife of Ontario suffer the consequences.\nMaintain the current 3 month deadline for a new at-risk species to be added to the SARO list. It can take years to properly assess the status of an at-risk species. Some wildlife populations can decline rapidly, and by the time studies and assessments are complete, newly classified species can be at even greater risk. It is critical we act quickly to implement their protection.\nDo NOT make changes to their geographic boundaries. This is a provincial piece of legislation \u2013 populations outside Ontario should not be considered during assessment. This is only an excuse to limit protection and to prioritize development.\nLeave COSSARO qualifications as-is. Non-scientists should not be making scientific decisions. These decisions should only be made by experts who have proper knowledge and training in ecology and biology. I would never diagnose a person\u2019s medical condition, because I am not a medical doctor. Why would someone who is not an ecologist be deciding when a species is threatened?\nMaintain automatic protection for threatened and endangered species. Do not implement a three-year waiting period for protection. Currently, the ESA classifies a species as \u201cendangered\u201d when:\n\u201cA species shall be classified as an endangered species if it lives in the wild in Ontario but is facing imminent extinction or extirpation.\u201d\nFacing \u201cimminent extinction\u201d means protection must be implemented immediately. Irreversible damage can be done in three years, and endangered species can go extinct during this time if proper protection is not applied.\nMaintain the timeline and requirement to develop a habitat regulation proposal for each new listed species. Species have evolved separately and each species has unique habitat requirements. Some species\u2019 habitats may overlap, but no two habitat requirements are exactly the same.\nThe Minister should not be able to use discretion to extend deadlines. These deadlines are put in place so important issues are dealt with promptly and are not swept under the rug or forgotten about. Again, this is just an excuse to delay the protection process so developers can carry on with work and the protection of species can be ignored.\nDo not allow permit holders to operate for 12 months when a new species is listed. If a development project threatens a newly listed species, activities should stop until permits are amended. Again, threatened and endangered species are at imminent risk and all precautions should be taken to avoid habitat destruction or mortality. The death of a few individuals can be detrimental to the population.\nDo not shift focus from \u201cindividual members\u201d to \u201cspecies\u201d. A species\u2019 population is made up of individuals, and if we don\u2019t protect the individuals, we are not protecting the population or the species. For some species, such as Blanding\u2019s turtles, the mortality of a few individuals can wipe out entire populations.\nThese proposed changes will be detrimental to populations of species at risk if they are to be approved. As Ontarians, we are lucky to live in a province with such unique and diverse habitats. We should take every step possible to protect them so they can be enjoyed by future generations. The impacts of the decisions we make today will last a lifetime. Why wait for things to be too late when we can take the right steps now? How will you feel when your grandchildren ask you about wild animals that they will never get to see in the wild? Will you feel proud to tell them that it was that so some rich people can make extra money? Because this is exactly what this proposal is. Make the right choice \u2013 do not proceed with the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act.\nThank you for your time\n",

        "comment":"Response to the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d\nThe planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201dhas proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this time frame from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"Hello:\nI wish to provide the following comments on the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act:\n1. Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\n- I find the proposed change to the timeframe between when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to when the listing is to occur from 3 months to 12 months problematic.  I find it problematic because it treats all species classification (i.e., special concern, threatened, endangered, etc.) as equal when they are not.  A species classified as threatened or endangered is more deserving of attention in terms of quicker actions that must be taken to protect its survival as opposed to say a species classified as special concern. I would recommend that the 3 month timeframe be retained for species classified as extirpated, threatened and endangered and perhaps a longer timeframe for species classified as special concern.  In short, retain the shorter timeframe for listing a species in the SARO list for those classified as extirpated, threatened, and\/or endangered.\n- The proposed change to allow the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species where the Minister forms the opinion based on scientific information that the classification may not no longer be appropriate is troubling to say the least.  While I understand that the Minister will be informed by scientific information, the Minister may not necessarily be a qualified scientist to assess the information and \/or fully appreciate its implications.  As such, I would recommend that the Minister NOT be permitted to require COSSARO to reconsider species classifications. Instead, let this work be done by the qualified scientists who sit on the COSSARO as I am sure they would if and when a species needs to be re-classified.  There should be no political interference in the species classification process.\n- I firmly disagree with the approach to require COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened. If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition. I would remind the government that the ESA is about protecting\/ensuring  the survival of species within Ontario's borders regardless of how the species may be faring in its broader geographical range.  Species that are threatened and\/or endangered within Ontario should not have their classification lowered since they should be protected throughout their range to ensure their long-term survival and well-being.  Furthermore, species know no borders as they move throughout their range in search of shelter, food, mates and\/or to nest.  It is problematic to think that species could potentially be treated\/valued differently depending on what part of their range they are in.  For the long-term viability of a species, COSSARO should only assess the status of species within their range in Ontario to ensure their survival in Ontario as they are part of our natural heritage.\n2. Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\n- The proposal to remove the mandatory legislative requirement and timeline to develop a habitat regulation proposal for each newly-listed threatened or endangered species defeats the purpose and spirit of the ESA.  For threatened or endangered species, it would seem vital to move towards developing a habitat regulation to ensure the survival of the species.  Please retain the mandatory legislative requirement and timeline for the habitat regulation; it should not be optional.\n4. Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\n- It seems contradictory for the government to propose the creation of the Species at Risk Conservation Trust to allow municipalities or other infrastructure proponents the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act but then still require them to fulfill some on the ground requirements to minimize the adverse effects on species.  Would it not make more sense and be more cost effective to have the proponents undertake the on the ground actions rather than pay into a trust that has to be publicly administered?  Furthermore, if the regulatory charge is to be within the range of costs that a client would otherwise incur through meeting the species-based conditions of an authorization, then why not have them just undertake the actions in the authorization instead complicating the process through the creation of a separate bureaucracy to administer the funds collected?  This proposed change needs to be thought through further with its merits carefully weighed.  The protection of species should not be something one can pay to ignore or dismiss.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\nMany species are declining across the world and in Canada. The province of Ontario is not immune to these declines; there are currently more than 200 Species At Risk (SAR) in the province. The main purpose of the ESA should be to protect species, not to expedite development. Any changes to the ESA should be made with great care, as without diligent legislation there is a risk of additional habitat loss and population declines. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extirpated from Ontario, and such losses to our natural heritage are unacceptable in the face of so many other unmitigated threats to biodiversity. Ontario has an opportunity to be a leader in biodiversity conservation, with an ESA that is the gold standard to which other jurisdictions aspire.\nWe agree that the public should be notified quickly of COSSARO\u2019s species\u2019 assessments, but listing should be immediate. Waiting one year after the species is listed could result in harmful effects on the species. We must stress that a lot of these species, particularly amphibians and reptiles, are already facing rapid declines, so immediate protection is strongly recommended. We also strongly disagree with the possible suspension of listings for up to three years, as such long delays could allow large developments and lack of mitigation, potentially wiping out populations of species before protection is enacted. Furthermore, Threatened and Endangered species should have expedited, not delayed, Habitat Regulations, as these species are especially vulnerable.\nCOSSARO is an independent committee with expertise in scientific disciplines, and these individuals take great care and consideration when making decisions about which species should be listed as at risk. Broadening member qualifications must not take away from the legitimacy of the organization. There is a need for taxa experts and those well-versed in research and recovery of Ontario\u2019s plants and wildlife.  Members must fully appreciate and understand natural and anthropogenic threats and their impacts on the biology of our native SAR and their habitats.  The current proposal calls for including those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d \u2013 a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have unbiased expertise in species assessment or that have a different agenda altogether. We still strongly oppose that the minister should be able to overrule decisions made by COSSARO, as such veto power explicitly undermines the arms-length scientific approach that is supposed to be used to assess species.  COSSARO assessments are based on IUCN criteria that have been refined over many decades, and the majority of COSSARO's assessments have already been fully vetted through the federal listing process (COSEWIC), which includes significant peer review from provincial and federal governments, stakeholders, ATK, biologists and taxa specialists.\nWe also strongly oppose COSSARO being required to base its assessments on the status of a species throughout its range, as opposed to in Ontario only. For species that have a small portion of their range in Ontario, these populations often present unique adaptations and reservoirs of genetic variation, facilitating resilience to climate change. Loss of our Ontario populations means loss of global diversity in the species. As Aldo Leopold said, \u201cTo keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.\u201d Allowing species to be wiped out in Ontario simply because they occur elsewhere is short-sighted and not indicative of the values placed on Ontario\u2019s natural heritage by residents of the province. Furthermore, SAR play an important role in our local ecosystems, and as species diversity declines, so does the overall health of our natural areas.  Ontario will likely become an important region to safeguard populations as the impacts of climate change worsen; this potential cannot be overstated.  Finally, Ontario must never rely on neighbouring provinces and countries to protect SAR.  This passes the responsibility and control on to others, and shows Ontario\u2019s lack of interest in protecting its biodiversity.  Ontario residents have widely embraced the protection of SAR, and have provided countless volunteer hours to ensure their protection and recovery.  The proposed changes will quickly negate those efforts, as species will lose the protection and the heightened awareness provided by listing, and lost funding opportunities that often provide the minimum requirement to get volunteer efforts started.\nThe Species at Risk conservation trust could be a powerful tool under some circumstances, but there is great room for such a program to be abused. This trust could allow for areas facing development to be developed by simply paying into the trust as opposed to protecting the resident species at risk. Such a proposal runs the risk of jeopardizing the social license that many large companies currently have. If companies are seen to be \u201cbuying\u201d the right to destroy the habitat of endangered species, they will be viewed as poor corporate citizens and likely lose business in the long term. Under certain circumstances, SAR habitat may be lost, and such a program could result in compensatory habitat creation elsewhere. In those cases there should result a net gain in quality SAR habitat for the same species. Net gains or losses should not be measured as simplistic aerial extent of habitat lost versus created, as the quality of habitat and whether it is actually occupied by viable subpopulations is more meaningful. Although complex to measure, indicators that are relevant to the SAR classification system should be used, such as numbers of mature individuals, survival rates, reproductive rates, area of occupancy, and long-term viability of the mitigation project.\nThe proposed changes include amending the act to strike out \u201cthe environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d and substituting \u201ca website maintained by the Government of Ontario\u201d. Such a change would mean that the opportunity for public input is lost.  Removing opportunities for public input eliminates government accountability to the public and prevents the public to participate in the protection and recovery of SAR.\n\tLastly, we agree that better enforcement is necessary to protect SAR. There is a strong need for enforcement of the ESA through fines and if necessary, incarceration.\nThe purposes of the ESA are:\n1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.\n3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.\nWe believe that the proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. Given that, we strongly advise you to reconsider the proposed changes and further consult with the public and professionals, to use a collaborative and transparent approach to responsible development while also protecting SAR.\n",

        "comment":"To Whom it May Concern,\nI am very concerned about the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act. As a resident of South Bruce Peninsula, I have witnessed how individuals and politicians, can unduly affect the process and outcomes for species at risk in regards to the piping plover. I am very concerned about the amount of discretion the proposed changes give to the minister as I am witnessing how individuals who are not informed or educated about scientific processes and wildlife, can influence politicians at a higher level of government.\nWe need to take a stand on this. This act was heralded as progressive and needed when it came in. To walk it back, years later, is ridiculous.\nIf South Bruce Peninsula had embraced the economic opportunities provided by the opportunity to be a community that would be perceived as bringing a species back from the brink, then it all would have been a different story.\nMost importantly, the conflict in our community .... is not about the plover. It is about people not understanding coastal processes, and not knowing what a real beach is. Sauble Beach will not survive the kind of beach grooming that has taken place here. We won't have a beach in 50 years. The kind of grooming that has gone on here is, Incredibly short sited. The endangered species habitat, is our habitat.\n",

        "comment":"Bill 108, Schedule 5 (ERO 013-5033) Proposed Amendments to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the ESA. I strongly oppose the changes that are being considered. They will not improve outcomes for species at risk. On the contrary, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.\nMore specifically, I do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Nor do I support the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme that would grease the wheels of destruction by allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats.\nImproving outcomes for species at risk requires enforcement, not weakening, of the law. It also requires investment in stewardship, not writing off species at risk and their habitats as red tape.\nFurther to the above:\nThe provincial government is proposing a new approach to getting species off the Species at Risk in Ontario (SARO) list. And it\u2019s not by addressing threats, preventing further declines or implementing recovery measures. Nothing that involves real, on-the-ground improvements. Rather, it would simply require basing species assessments on how our most vulnerable plants and animals are doing outside Ontario, not here at home.\nThis new approach to listing is just one of the many disturbing changes the government intends to make to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA). Like the other proposed amendments, it\u2019s bound to please developers and industry players looking for ways to circumvent the law\u2019s protective measures. Strangely though, I have recently learned that it holds some appeal even for people in the conservation field who would prefer that recovery efforts be focused only on globally imperiled species.\nI strongly disagree this perspective, and here\u2019s why\u2026\n1. Over 100 species on the SARO list could be removed and no longer considered \u2018at risk.\u2019 Many others could be down-listed from threatened or endangered to special concern. In either case, most of the species currently recognized as threatened and endangered in Ontario \u2013 and their habitats \u2013 might no longer be protected under the ESA.\nTake for example our turtle species, all of which are on the SARO list. Based on their global rankings (Natureserve), the wood turtle could well be down-listed to special concern (and consequently no longer protected from harm or habitat destruction) while the spiny softshell, spotted, Blanding\u2019s, snapping, musk, eastern box and northern map turtles could all be removed from the list entirely. The government could be sentencing an entire order of animals to continued decline.\n2. Most of our at-risk species are concentrated in southern Ontario, the most heavily developed and populated part of the province. The proposed change could open the floodgates to further loss and degradation of the region\u2019s remaining woodlands, wetlands, streams and shorelines. Many threatened and endangered species serve as umbrella species for others insofar as protecting their habitats helps other species using the same habitats. We could lose one of our most effective legal tools for protecting entire natural communities.\nAn example is the least bittern. Currently listed as threatened, this bird often stands in the way of development approvals in wetlands, benefiting many other wetland inhabitants at the same time, from frogs, fish and dragonflies to muskrats, rare orchids and black terns. Removing the least bittern from the SARO list would mean one fewer lines of defence for these other species.\n3. Most of the plants and animals affected are \u2018edge of range\u2019 species at their northern limit in Canada. Edge of range species generally are considered important in conservation efforts, particularly in an era of climate change. They may be better adapted to extreme climates than core populations or may have other characteristics that will facilitate adaptation. Excluding them from protection could result in a significant loss of genetic diversity and reduce the ability of species to persist, for example through geographic range shifts.\n4. Many of these species are also important culturally, socially or economically. Their continued decline or disappearance from Ontario could be deeply felt by communities and individuals across the province. Take for example American ginseng, a treasured medicinal plant that inhabits the rich, mature deciduous woodlands of southern Ontario. Though legally cultivated, very few viable wild populations remain in Ontario. Under the new rules  it could potentially be down-listed to special concern, as its global status is vulnerable.  Wild populations would then be subject to harvesting, a primary driver of its decline.\n5. The proposed approach would prevent new listings of and thus legal protections for species that are in trouble in Ontario.\nFor example, a recent study indicates that the American bumble bee is in drastic decline in Canada. Not yet listed in Ontario, its global status is vulnerable, which means it could be listed only as special concern when it is assessed by Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO). In that case, it would have no legal protection under the amended ESA.\nI, for one, don\u2019t believe it\u2019s acceptable to sacrifice species in Ontario just because they\u2019re doing better elsewhere. We must not allow the government to wipe its hands of responsibility for our fellow creatures in need and precipitate their disappearance from our province.\n",

All government officials who are in any way connected to environmental policy, in particular the proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act, must read every word of this report. Ontario should be setting an example to the world that ecosystems can be protected while benefitting our society and economy.\nI teach grade 9 students about sustainability and the balance that must be maintained. Your government's plans are ignoring basic grade 9 geography concepts.\nOne thing I encourage is the reading of publications from reputable organizations so that my students will be informed by experts. Your government officials would benefit from reading and learning from scientific studies written by experts. Ecosystems provide essential services that must be considered as economic assets. Weakening the Endangered Species Act essentially ensures the reduction of Ontario's natural capital. These spaces also mitigate the impacts of the flooding that is expected to only worsen and cost further damage of property and significant economic impact to individuals and municipalities.\nOntario Nature's list of concerns (attached link) clearly expresses my concerns. I wanted to focus on two or three particularly offensive parts of the proposal, but it is impossible to be so restrictive with so many destructive ideas being proposed.\nMoney cannot replace life; a fee instead of remediation action or avoidance of harm is completely unacceptable. Too much time spent postponing action and ignoring science will undermine all other efforts to help species at risk. Species on the fringes of their territory, such as many Carolinian species, often have the strongest and most diverse genetics; critical characteristics with climate changes posing immediate and significant threats to Ontario. Assuming that other jurisdictions will take responsibility for safeguarding species is an abdication of Ontario's moral responsibility for all species within its boundaries.\nI again urge you to read, in its entirety, the intergovernmental report on biodiversity that is attached. It was released May 6, 2019. Governments have a responsibility to ensure that human populations can thrive, but not at the expense of all other populations.\n",

        "comment":"Nature Barrie submission on proposed Ontario ESA amendments \u2013 May 2019\nI am submitting these comments on behalf of Nature Barrie, formerly known as the Brereton Field Naturalists' Club. Nature Barrie has worked since 1951 to acquire and disseminate knowledge of natural history, to protect and preserve wildlife and to stimulate public interest in nature and its value.\nNature Barrie strongly supports submissions made by Ontario Nature, Environmental Defence, The David Suzuki Foundation and the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition opposing the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\nSchedule 5 of Bill 108 contains changes to the Endangered Species Act. These changes are sweeping and tantamount to having no Endangered Species Act at all. If passed, the changes spell a dire future for species at risk in our province.\nGiven the just released United Nations report (May 6, 2019) on the status of endangered species worldwide, it is unbelievable that our government could consider weakening Ontario's present legislation for Endangered Species. On the contrary, the government should be amending the regulations under the ESA to undo the harmful weakening of protections for Endangered Species passed by the previous Liberal government several years ago.\nThe following is from the May 6, 2019 CBC News report on this United Nations study:\n\"The findings are not just about saving plants and animals, but about preserving a world that's becoming harder for humans to live in, said Robert Watson, a former top NASA and British scientist who headed the report.\n\"We are indeed threatening the potential food security, water security, human health and social fabric\" of humanity, Watson told The Associated Press. He said the poor in less developed countries bear the greatest burden.\n'Business as usual is a disaster'\nThe report's 39-page summary highlighted five ways people are reducing biodiversity:\nTurning forests, grasslands and other areas into farms, cities and other developments. The habitat loss leaves plants and animals homeless. About three-quarters of Earth's land, two-thirds of its oceans and 85 per cent of crucial wetlands have been severely altered or lost, making it harder for species to survive, the report said.\nOverfishing the world's oceans. A third of the world's fish stocks are overfished.\nPermitting climate change from the burning of fossil fuels to make it too hot, wet or dry for some species to survive. Almost half of the world's land mammals \u2014 not including bats \u2014 and nearly a quarter of the birds have already had their habitats hit hard by global warming.\nPolluting land and water. Every year, 300 to 400 million tons of heavy metals, solvents and toxic sludge are dumped into the world's waters.\nAllowing invasive species to crowd out native plants and animals. The number of invasive alien species per country has risen 70 per cent since 1970, with one species of bacteria threatening nearly 400 amphibian species.\nFighting climate change and saving species are equally important, the report said, and working on both environmental problems should go hand in hand. Both problems exacerbate each other because a warmer world means fewer species, and a less biodiverse world means fewer trees and plants to remove heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the air, Lovejoy said.\n\"Humanity unwittingly is attempting to throttle the living planet and humanity's own future,\" said George Mason University biologist Thomas Lovejoy, who has been called the godfather of biodiversity for his research. He was not part of the report.\nThe world's coral reefs are a perfect example of where climate change and species loss intersect. If the world warms another 0.5 degrees Celsius, which other reports say is likely, coral reefs will probably dwindle by 70 to 90 per cent, the report said. At 1 degree Celsius, the report said, 99 per cent of the world's coral will be in trouble.\n\"Business as usual is a disaster,\" Watson said.\"\nIn our own Simcoe County, Nature Barrie has worked with the City of Barrie, MNRF, Bird Studies Canada and the developer of the former Barrie Central Collegiate site in Downtown Barrie's Urban Growth Centre to preserve roosting and nesting habitat for threatened Chimney Swifts in the chimney of the former high school when the school was demolished in the spring of 2018.\nThis habitat will either be maintained intact or replaced with a suitable habitat structure across the street as part of the redevelopment. The developer publicly expressed his support for wildlife habitat protection when recently presenting his redevelopment plans for the site. The City made and posted large signs on both street frontages of this site to share this good news story with the public at large. Nature Barrie has presented plaques to both the city and the developer to recognize their efforts to preserve habitat for threatened and endangered species.\nClearly there was no need for reducing or avoiding the requirements of the present ESA in this major residential\/institutional downtown redevelopment project. The existing ESA did the job it was supposed to do!\nWHY DOES THIS MATTER? WHO CARES ABOUT ENDANGERED SPECIES ANYWAY? Well, THE PEOPLE CARE!  HOW DO WE KNOW THE PEOPLE CARE? All of Ontario's eight species of turtles are now on the ESA. One evening several years ago, I stopped to assist four teenage girls, in their prom dresses, who were helping a turtle get across four-lane Ferndale Drive in Barrie and safely back into the adjacent provincially significant wetland known as the Bear Creek Ecopark. These young women felt it was important enough to stop and take time, on one of the biggest social nights of their lives, to protect this endangered species!\nWe owe our future generations much better than what Bill 108 proposes to do!\n",

The changes would remove essential legal protections for species at risk and for the habitats that sustain them.\nThe proposed changes would lead to delays in protecting species at risk \u2013 delays of up to three years for newly listed species \u2013 at the discretion of the Minister.

The proposal weakens virtually all aspects of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act and could put development and industrial interests ahead of species at risk. These changes are inconsistent with the purpose of the Act, which is to protect and recover species at risk in Ontario.\nI hope the government of Ontario is mindful of the fact that once a species is extinct, no amount of money can bring it back. Humans are at the top of the food chain, but still rely on the existence of the chain, and extinction of species threatens all aspects of human life, both physical and psychological.\nPlease, @fordnation, stop the short sighted, destructive, non-science and non-economic theory based cuts that threaten the health, wealth and prosperity of Ontario residents both human, plant and animal.\n\"Schedule 5 would be better named the Extinction Schedule,\" says Caroline Schultz, Executive Director of Ontario Nature. \"It's all about pushing aside our most vulnerable plants and animals to make room for sprawling development and unchecked industrial activity.

Generally, I am optimistic that this will result in improved outcomes for species at risk while ensuring Ontario is a place to grow the forest sector by unleashing its full potential and providing good-paying jobs for forestry workers.  However, the vagueness of the proposed changes does not provide the necessary business certainty for the forest sector. The unprecedented economic downturn of 2008 decimated the forest industry in Northern Ontario; re-establishing its presence and strength is vitally important. Business does not tolerate uncertainty and as such will invest elsewhere.\nTo be confident that Ontario is the right place for investment, the forest sector requires a permanent section 55 regulation that recognizes the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act. I do not support the proposed section 18 \u201charmonization\u201d option for the forest sector. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk.

        "comment":"The planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

Biodiversity is required for a healthy environment and must be preserved.  Small populations of a species in one area may provide a valuable genetic resource for the species everywhere and so should be protected even if larger populations exist elsewhere.  Some species require many years to reach sexual maturity and so may be severely and adversely\naffected by short term planning.\nTransparency of decisions made by the government is extremely important.  As is the ability to educate and inform the government by citizens.  Unbiased, scientific knowledge should be placed before individual preferences when making decisions.\n",

        "comment":"On behalf of  Lecours Lumber Co. Limited thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes, ERO number 013-5033. We look forward to continuing to work with your government to modernize and improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We are optimistic that this will result in improved outcomes for species at risk while ensuring Ontario is a place to grow our renewable forest sector, unleash its full potential and provide good-paying jobs for our people. However, the vagueness of the proposed changes does not provide necessary business certainty.\nThe 10th year review of the provincial Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides government with a rare opportunity to chart a course for the next decade and beyond. Political decisions on this will have far-reaching social, economic, and environmental impacts for generations to come. Therefore, the most important action the government must take remains permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through  Section 55. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.\nIn March, we asked that this essential first step be accomplished in your Government\u2019s legislative changes to the ESA. However, the proposed changes indicate that a Section 18 Regulation will be the authorization process for forestry, instead of a Section 55 Regulation. For the past 10 years, we have consistently asked for a permanent Section 55 Regulation as the authorization process for the forest sector. The former government recognized that the CFSA and the ESA cannot be harmonized and provided a workable, temporary solution that was defended in court.  We are asking the Ford Government to take this workable, temporary solution and make it permanent.\nWe are asking that you revise the proposed legislative ESA changes to acknowledge that Section 55 will be the authorization mechanism for forest operations on Crown lands. Instead, MECP appears to be pursuing a revised section 18 \u201charmonization\u201d instrument which is at odds with our request. This bold move, like your support for other industries and activities with the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, would send a positive message to the forest sector and Lecours Lumber Co. Limited.\nIn addition to this critical revision, it also remains necessary to ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:\n1.\tConsideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy\n2.\tCumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy\n3.\tSocio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented\nThe sector will continue to operate under the CFSA which, by law, requires, forestry operations to follow an approved forest management plan. Guides delivered under the CFSA include operational prescriptions and conditions, which may include reserves, modified operations, or specific conditions on road use and construction in the area near a species at risk and their habitat.\nSince the establishment of the ESA, we have been clearly and consistently outlining what is required for permanent, long-term certainty within Ontario\u2019s forest sector and for our northern and rural communities. In order to avoid catastrophic socio-economic impacts, we need permanent, legislative recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy.\nSincerely,\nEric Buteau, CPA, CA\nGeneral Manager\/Controller\n",

        "comment":"A2A Endangered Species Act submission, May 2019\nRe: ERO # 013-5033\nThe Algonquin to Adirondack Collaborative is an environmental charity which works to protect wildlife and to maintain habitat connectivity for wildlife through the broad region from Algonquin Park in Ontario to the Adirondack Park in New York State.   We have over 50 partner organizations and 200 members which we collaborate with throughout the A2A corridor.  We envision an Algonquin to Adirondacks region that is a resilient, with an ecologically connected landscape which sustains a full range of native wildlife. A critical component of this vision is protecting our most endangered species at risk based on objective scientific evidence and respect for wildlife.\nAs an organization which focusses on protecting habitats and species in this critical biological corridor, we have serious concerns with the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, 2007.  In particular:\n\u2022\tThe Act and its protective provisions under the proposed changes would become much more discretionary rather than science based.  The ability of the Minister to second guess recommendations of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO), and delay listings based on social or economic considerations compromises the science-based approach.\n\u2022\tNumerous changes are aimed at delaying possible listing and implementation, time which can make the difference between effective protection of species and significant species and habitat loss.  The 3 year delay for economic and social considerations, the one year extension for review of COSSARO recommendations, the one year delay for application of protective provisions for existing permit holders, provisions allowing for indefinite delay of Government Response Statements to Recover Strategies, and the Ministerial discretion proposed for carrying out a review of progress (rather than the current 5 year requirement) all point to loss of protection and a movement away for an objective, science-based approach to endangered species.\n\u2022\tProvisions that limit the geographic extent of assessments \u2013 in particular the requirement that COSSARO assessments be based not on the status of species in Ontario, but on status across a \u201cbiologically relevant range\u201d \u2013 ignores the importance of transitional areas at the edge of ranges.  A2A represent a significant and rich biological area in part because it is a transitional zone between northern and southern species.  If an extended range is applied to the assessment of species, significant protection could be lost in the A2A area and a key factor in adjusting to climate change (the protection of species as they adjust to changes climate zones) will threatened.\n\u2022\tRecommended changes that make it easier to obtain permits for harmful activities also threaten the integrity and purpose of the Act.  Such measures as providing a fee-in-lieu of protection option, removal of the requirement for the Minister to consult independent experts prior to issuing permits that are deemed to provide social or economic benefits, creation of landscape agreements for multiple harmful activities throughout an area, and removal of protections for individual members of a species, all limit the ability to ensure that permits do not result in the incremental loss species by providing a much broader scope, both geographic and political, for the issuing of harmful activity permits.\nIn conclusion, A2A has serious concerns with many of the proposed changes and can see significant negative impacts in the A2A which has many species at risk.  As a significant biological corridor in a transitional area, with a relatively intact landscape, an effective, science-based approach to protecting endangered and threatened species as a key component to protecting the A2A corridor today and for future generations.  We strongly urge the Ontario Government to reconsider these changes and undertake further work to ensure an effective and science-based approach to protection of our endangered and threatened species.\nDavid Miller\nExecutive Director, A2A, on behalf of the A2A Board of Directors\n613-220-7482\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the above noted Environmental Registry of Ontario posting. The following comments are provided by Region of Peel staff as input to the Ministry to consider regarding the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act.\nIt is anticipated that a Report including these comments will be brought before Regional Council as part of a report on Bill 108 for endorsement in June. A copy of the Report and Council resolution will be forwarded to Ministry staff for further consideration at that time. Our comments here should be viewed as subject to Regional Council\u2019s endorsement.\nRegional staff continues to support the Ministry\u2019s efforts to review and update the Endangered Species Act to improve clarity, implementation, cost effectiveness and ultimate protection and recovery of species at risk.\nWhile generally supporting the overall objectives of the proposed changes,\nit is important that the Ministry ensure that any revisions to the Act, including changes providing new tools and compliance options for proponents, be implemented in a way that complements the existing framework while meeting the purpose of the Act to protect species at risk and promote their recovery.  Specific comments on the provisions in Bill 108 are provided below.\nTimelines and Transition Projects\nStaff are generally supportive of the increased timelines and phase-in when species are added to the Species at Risk in Ontario List and transition provisions that allow approved projects to proceed while new species are being reviewed.  However, staff wish to reiterate the importance of ensuring that the species at risk protections in the Act be applied in a timely manner that does not compromise their survival.\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Services\nA new report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) released on May 6, 2019, found that around 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction due to changes in land and sea use, direct exploitation of organisms, climate change, pollution and invasive alien species. The report states that the current global response is insufficient and \u2018Transformative changes\u2019 are needed to restore and protect nature.\nThe proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act call for the consideration of the condition of the species both inside and outside of Ontario and that the classification of a species reflect the lower level of risk to the survival of the species. If a species is not considered endangered outside Ontario, then the species may not get status in Ontario even if the species is threatened or endangered within Ontario. Many of the species currently classified in Ontario as threatened or endangered may not meet these criteria, which would remove their protection requirements.\nAs habitat further south becomes less suitable for species due to climate change, protecting habitat and species in the northern range becomes even more important as species ranges expands north. It is important that the Ministry ensure that the implementation of these criteria considers climate change impacts on species and their ability to adapt and the importance of protecting species that are at risk within Ontario.\nNew Tools and Options for Compliance\nIn accordance with Regional staff comments provided to the Province earlier this year on the Discussion Paper, staff generally support changes proposed to the Act that would provide new tools and options to achieve compliance, including the payment of conservation charges, the formalization of landscape agreements and regulations enabling compliance to be met through approvals under other legislation.\nIn developing new tools and options for compliance, a focus on a simple, efficient and user-friendly implementation process would be beneficial to achieve the objectives of streamlining and simplifying compliance under the Act and allow for delivery of public infrastructure in a timely manner.\nThe Region is supportive of the idea of exploring options such as paying into a conservation fund or allowing conservation banking in lieu of ESA activity-based requirements. It is stressed however, that should these tools be implemented, that they be subject to criteria and considered within the established conservation hierarchy of Avoid, Minimize, Mitigate, and Compensate to ensure the purpose of the Act is achieved with emphasis on avoiding, minimizing and mitigating impacts before compensation is considered. Management of a conservation fund and conservation land banks should be undertaken with the overall intention of supporting activities that would enhance species at risk survival objectives and provide an overall benefit.\nThe regulations, guidelines and standards related to landscape agreements, conservation land banking and payment of conservation charges to the Species at Risk Conservation Trust should include requirements to prioritize investment in restoration and enhancement of habitat in proximity to where reduced habitat protection is authorized under the Act. The use of conservation charges to compensate for reduced habitat protection should ensure that funding and land banking is implemented equitably in areas where habitat is affected.  The investment of funds should be directed to habitat restoration and enhancement activities that are proven or reasonably likely to support the protection and recovery of species and provide an overall benefit.\n",

        "comment":"The planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario's best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

Our values guide us to work relentlessly with our employees and those who work for us to achieve world-class environmental performance. We will strive for continual improvement of our health, safety and environment management system and will deliver electricity to our customers and manage our operations in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner.\nHydro One is supportive of the proposed changes to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act.  The addition of more tools will help facilitate compliance with the Act. Incorporating landscape level agreements will reduce administrative burden on both Hydro One and the Ministry, while allowing for a coordinated approach to mitigating impacts.  We also hope that this will open up options for species conservation actions that would have been challenging to implement under the existing safe harbours and stewardship agreement legislation.\nProviding earlier notice of COSSARO listing decisions and extending the timeline for protections going into force will give greater certainty to long term projects and allow for proper upfront planning to avoid impacts to Species at Risk. Further, we welcome the consideration of the broader geographical range when determining listing decisions for individual species.\nThe creation and implementation of the Species at Risk Conservation Trust and payment-in-lieu will improve the efficacy of species recovery actions by focusing efforts where they can have the greatest impact. Implementation of these actions by a government body with a Species at Risk recovery mandate should result in more successful projects.\nWe look forward to continuing to work with the Government of Ontario to find a balance between industry needs and species habitat protections that facilitates positive outcomes for Species at Risk in Ontario.\n",

        "comment":"I am completely opposed to the amendments being proposed to the ESA, as buried in Schedule 5 of the new housing Bill 108.\nFirst, the review of the ESA was neither transparent nor done with any intention to improve or strengthen the current Act.  The only goal was to determine how much the government could weaken the current ESA to make it easier for developers and other sectors to destroy critical habitat.   As such, the ESA review is a total sham, which completely contravenes the mandate of the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks.   If every Ministry's purpose is now primarily economic, then this government could save taxpayers billions every year by rolling all existing Ministries up into the one, big monolith \u2013 the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade.  Obviously, the public expects each Ministry to serve a purpose and act in accordance to their mandate, while serving the public good - not a select few business sectors - otherwise there is no point in their existence.\nSecond, according to the UN, 2019 report, the planet is at a crisis point with the greatest mass extinction in history underway, all at the hands of human activity.   According to the Ontario government's own website and data,  Ontario is currently at risk of losing at least 200 species already.    Knowing this, it makes absolutely no sense for any government to loosen restrictions, eliminate protections of species at risk or, in any way, make it easier for developers to freely bulldoze or contaminate critical habitats.\nAccording to the various comments submitted to the ERE when this review was undertaken, the public has already expressed their concerns and their expectations for a stronger ESA, not a a weaker one.    And, as per the backlash at election time over the secretive promises made by Ford to open up the Greenbelt to developers,  it was clear the public has no interest is seeing developers accommodated by sacrificing the environment.    If this government truly believes Schedule 5 of Bill 108 was in the public interest, then why are these amendments to the ESA couched amongst a hundred other amendments in a housing Bill?    And why was the public only provided a minimal 30 days to learn about it and make comment?\nWe all know, \"paying a fee to kill\" vulnerable species will be absolutely no problem for developers or any other sector (a small write-off) but it will cost our environment, and the rest of us, dearly.   I'm quite confident, the general public \u2013 if they had been properly informed of these amendments - has no interest in seeing the criteria for species status determined by either non-scientists or unilaterally by a Minister with  absolutely no scientific credentials.   Nor would the public agree that species populations outside of Ontario's borders  is enough to open our own up to decimate  \u2013 how ludicrous is that.     Do we not need pollinators in Ontario?    Do we not need reptiles, amphibians, bats and birds to control insect populations?   Do we not need native species of fish to control algal blooms and ensure a healthy lakes?    Do we not need native trees, plants and shrubs as a foundation for essentially every viable ecosystem?\nClearly the changes being proposed in Bill 108 were designed in the best interest of the developers and other business sectors that are not interested in evolving their business practices in a progressive, sustainable manner.     Easing restrictions on species at risk to accommodate archaic business practices is the last thing we need.    It's bad policy for the environment AND the economy.\n",

This is very distressing to me and I ask that this not happen. I live in an area where there are a number of endangered species including the piping plover, lakeside daisy, and massasauga rattlesnake. These and other species need to remain protected on the Saugeen\/Bruce Peninsula  and other areas of the province. To remove those legislated requirements will be a huge step backwards in environmental protection. Please reconsider your plans and retain the protection that currently exists.\n",

The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection.

I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list.

He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable.

        "comment":"10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes | Environmental Registry of Ontario\nProposed suggestions relating to the points in the proposed changes of the Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act\nhttps:\/\/ero.ontario.ca\/notice\/013-5033\nAssessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nWe do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting.\nWe are concerned about 1A -  the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act R.S.O.2007 would allow for a species to not be added to the SARO list or listed to a more endangered status during COSSARO's reassessment. We fear the damage that could happen to the species in question during the twelve months of research that it would take the scientists to determine the status of the species. We, and many other people believe that there should be a strict policy to prevent any damage to their habitat to reducing the amount of species destruction during the extended period of time that it would take for a species to be added to the SARO list. Without imminent change to protect habitats and species, a developer, or any other person, could destroy or disturb the habitat of the potential species at risk within the new alloted twelve month policy extension, which was previously three months. During this year long period, a developer has newfounded rights to the land that were approved prior to these policy changes. Our concerns our found within the following proposition, \u201cProvide the public earlier notice of COSSARO's species\u2019 assessment and classification results by making its report available to the public no later than three months after it is received by the Minister. Also, extend the time from when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to when listing is to occur from three to twelve months (i.e., when a species must be added to the SARO List).\u201d\nWe have concerns about 1D - \u201cAllow the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species where the Minister forms the opinion based on scientific information that the classification may not no longer be appropriate.\u201d With this statement, we believe that the judgement of the Minister may be questionable. For an example; what kind of scientific research will they base their reports of endangered species? Will this be based on one scientific report or multiple reports and findings? Will the sources be unbiased and credible? Will the species and environment be what they base their conclusion on, or will it be money and industry?\nWe are concerned about point 1E - \u201cRequire COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened. If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition.\u201d This would allow habitat and species to be destroyed (even if it was also located in another area) and this is unacceptable. We have to look at genetic diversity and the importance that each pocket area brings to diversity and survival of the species.\nWe are concerned about 1F - \u201cBroadening COSSARO member qualifications to include members who have relevant expertise in ecology, wildlife management, as well as those with community knowledge.\u201d We are concerned that an expert scientific committee of experts that have studied these issues through their research and with their scientific expertise will be diluted out and that non- scientific people such as land developers  who care about land development will override the experts opinions. There seems to be a lack of consideration and appreciation for scientific knowledge\u2026 it seems to be disrespected by the new government.\n2. Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThey would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.\nImproving outcomes for species at risk requires enforcement, not weakening, of the law. It also requires investment in stewardship, not writing off species at risk and their habitats as red tape.\nWe are concerned about the proposed limiting protections where the ESA protections only apply in specific geographies or under specific circumstances. This could cause exclusion of important habitats and species from protection, further endangering the species.\nConcern about decoupling the listing process of endangered species from automatic protections and also giving the Minister' full discretion on this decision. The minister may not base the decision of scientific facts and may include opinions in the overall decision of protection a species at risk. The minister may completely ignore scientific research and findings.\nThe minister may deem that a land with current habitat protection can have social and economical benefits, the current protection on the habitat can be dismantled to allow the use of the land for up to 3 years. This is a concern as habitat protection is a huge part of protecting endangered species, and with the loss of this protection, some species can potentially become extinct. This veto of automatic protections allows the Minister to have \u201cdiscretion on protections,\u201d including suspending protections for up to 3 years without public consultation. Removing expert input as a requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert prior to creating regulations that would jeopardize the survival of a species in Ontario.\nThe act allows the dodging of requirements allowing activities to be approved under other laws to be carried out without any additional authorizations under the ESA, even if they harm threatened or endangered species or their habitat. This allows the sweeping of authorizations for harmful activities to create \u201clandscape agreements\u201d for proponents undertaking harmful activities in multiple locations.\nThis act also interferes with the listing of species at risk to allow the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider its science-based listing decisions.\nWe are concerned with 2A. We are concerned with providing the Minister greater discretion on protections. Why is science-based being kept at an arm\u2019s length. It should be the basis of the decision?  \u201c2A De-couple the listing process from automatic protections and provide greater Minister\u2019s discretion on protections, while keeping the assessment as a science-based process at arm\u2019s length. While the role of classifying species would remain with COSSARO and listing of classified species would continue to be required, the proposed changes would provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species\u201d  when specified criteria are met.\nWe are concerned with 2B - the new act will not be protecting all geographies in Ontario for species at risk - that they can say for example select an area they want to develop and cut that one out so the area can be developed. \u201c2B. Enable scoping of species protections, where appropriate, via new Minister\u2019s regulations. This proposed new authority would enable species protections to apply to specific geographies or in specific circumstances (e.g., to species that are not affected by disease).\u201d\nWe are concerned about 2C - \u201c2C Remove the mandatory legislative requirement and timeline to develop a habitat regulation proposal for each newly-listed threatened or endangered species and retain the option to develop a habitat regulation when needed.\u201d\nWe are concerned with 2D\u2026..that the Minister without expertise in the area can make species-specific habitat regulations - the Minister would not necessarily care about the species at risk with these new changes but care more about land development   \u201c2D. Enable the Minister, rather than LGIC, to make species-specific habitat regulations.\u201d\n3. Developing species at risk recovery policies\nThey will not improve outcomes for species at risk.\nThe idea of deserting \u201cEdge of Range\u201d species will have a harmful impact on the future of the species. The proposition is to require COSSARO to base its assessments not on the status of a species in Ontario, but instead on its range. For example, southern Ontario endangered species at the northern limit of their range may receive less or no protection depending on their status outside of the province of Ontario.\nConcern about the multiple delays that are proposed for the listing, planning and reporting on species at risk, undermining species recovery.\nThe proposed changes would:\nGive the Minister discretion to extend the nine-month Government Response Statement development timeline, for some species.\nClarify that recovery strategies are advice to government, and that Government Response Statements are the government\u2019s policy direction for species at risk.\nAllow the Minister to extend timelines for conducting the review of progress towards protection and recovery based on individual species\u2019 needs.\n4. Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nWe do not support the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme that would grease the wheels of destruction by allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats.\n5. Enforcing the Endangered Species Act\nConcern about linking the endangered Species Act to the  Bill 108, More Homes, More Choice Act, 2019.\nConcern that the view of the government is that economics, building  and big business is more important than the environment, habitat and species. According to the proposed changes they state  \u201cThis is being proposed in to preserve the ability of the Minister to act swiftly and minimize associated social or economic impacts.\u201d Once we destroy this habitat and species and the genetic diversity of species within the pockets of habitat they are lost. The social impact of loss of natural land and spaces is ultimately very negative for humans including those in Ontario . The UN has just come out with their report on the destruction of species and the impact. Wee need to move forward with protection of species and habitat not backwards as these new proposed changes would do.

I would prefer not to have to explain  to my children and grandchildren how our generation allowed integral species to go extinct because we wanted a short term payoff.\nOn the subject of bypassing permitting requirements for development projects: if we continue to push into spaces where wildlife previously lived we will see increased threats from coyotes and other predators in our neighbourhoods.\n",

        "comment":"Dear Premier, Ministers and MPPS of Ontario:\nAt the same time as the United Nations is reporting nature is in more trouble than at any other time in human history, the Ontario government is considering weakening protections for species at risk.\nSchedule 5 of Bill 108: The More Homes, More Choices Act, needs to be removed!\nSchedule 5 of the Act is concerning for many reasons:\n\u2022 It allows a newly listed species to be covered under a pre-existing permit which could wipe out areas that are key to its survival and recovery.\n\u2022 It allows harm to a species through landscape agreements or conservation fund payments that don't have to benefit the species or habitat being harmed. Establishing a conservation fund can be beneficial and support important recovery and restoration projects for more common species where populations are sustainable with proper conservation efforts. However, it is not the best practice for species at risk who are facing possible extinction.\n\u2022 It gives the Environment Minister the ability to suspend protection for up to three years and allows the Minister to limit protection once those three years are up. Such delays make it more difficult to recover a species and increase the costs associated with recovery.\n\u2022 It slows the operations of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO), creating administrative burdens for the listing process and calls into question its ability to act as an independent body.\nThese are just a few of the many issues with Schedule 5 of Bill 108.\nWe need you to do more for wildlife.\nThe Ontario Government needs to show leadership by creating incentives to protect and recover species at risk.\nWe urge you to work with conservation organizations and business development to ensure a balanced approach\n",

        "comment":"The planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"This proposal to gut the Endangered Species Act is infuriating, irresponsibly and callous - coming as it does at the same time that the UN has declared that we are facing an existential crisis related to the a mass extinction event on Earth, it is stunning to me that this government continually finds new and appalling ways to be out of touch with reality.  And that is quite an achievement seeing as what this government has done in the past 10 months, such as cancelling tree planting programs in the middle of an extreme but \"new normal\" spring flood season; cutting the forest fire fighting budget just before the \"new normal\" forest fire season begins; cancelling and then fighting climate change action just when the world has 11 years to reduce our carbon emissions or face catastrophic consequences.  This government is doing exactly the wrong things at a pivotal time in human history, shirking its duties to its citizens while claiming to be making everything better.  History will judge this government harshly - offering buck-a-beer and casinos when the planet is facing a crisis.  This is not leadership and this is NOT for the people.\nThis proposal further illustrates the extraordinary extent to which this government's policies are entirely divorced from science and logic.  As I read the proposed changes to Ontario's \"best in class legislation\", I tried really hard to see how these changes would actually strengthen the purpose of the statute - the protection of nonhuman species in Ontario from extinction - and I could find nothing.  Rather, this proposal is another example of this government's \"race-to-the-bottom\" approach to legislating and regulating, well, everything.  Why lead if you can just gut existing programs and ensure our extraordinary province becomes as mediocre as our neighbours?  Especially when you can take credit for past governments' achievements (like the coal phase-out!) when it suits you to justify not leading anymore?\nMoreover, this proposal is another excellent example of this government's deft use of \"double-speak\".  George Orwell would be flattered, if he weren't appalled.  How exactly would \"de-coupling\" automatic protections for listed species and increasing Ministerial discretion for listing such species actually result in greater protection?  Where does science actually fit into these decisions when Ministerial discretion is strengthened and development is prioritized?  How does increasing Ministerial discretion result in an arms'-length decision-making process?  Ministerial discretion in the existing Act is the primary reason why, in the 10 years since the statute has been in place, we now have MORE endangered species and species-at-risk in Ontario, not fewer.  It defies all sense and logic that giving the Minister even more power to over-ride the protections in the Act and facilitate development of precious habitat would be of any benefit to at-risk and endangered species in this province.  The purported objectives of this proposal are in no-way supported by the actual proposed changes. The attempts by this government to disguise its intentions to bolster development by dismantling protection for at-risk species is disgusting - be honest and transparent about who and what these proposed changes are really for and then see how the public reacts.\nThis proposal also demonstrates how little this government understands science.  Plants and animals cannot be moved around this province like human populations.  Natural systems are not just large zoos that can be re-located on a whim when they get in the way.  The landscape in southern Ontario is so highly fragmented and degraded that it will not make a jot of difference to an at-risk species, particularly not for less mobile species like mammals, reptiles and amphibians, if you destroy their habitat in one place and \"build a new one\" somewhere else (are you serious???  Do you really think that humans can just replace natural processes and areas so easily?).  Destroying natural habitat for development is not equivalent to expropriating a house for a highway - you cannot just build a new marsh or forest somewhere and expect animal and plant populations to be ok.  Humans are not nearly as sophisticated as natural processes and we actually don't understand natural systems nearly as well as we think we do.  We are forever causing unintended effects due to our arrogance and hubris and we consistently underestimate the extraordinary ways that even the most humble creatures are connected to the larger systems that sustain us (see the attached video about what happened to Yellowstone National Park when wolves were re-introduced).\nSimilarly, it makes absolutely no sense to say that because a species is found outside the province we can ignore its status inside our borders.  Ontario's border is a human creation - it only makes sense politically (sort of) but it makes no sense at all in terms of hydrology, watersheds, ecology, ecosystems, plant and animal distributions or climate.  Plants and animals need space, they need genetically diverse populations, they often need to move.  Nature is not and cannot survive like a zoo. If Ontario decides not protect endangered species because they are seemingly alright somewhere else, that does not mean that the species is somehow safe from extinction. (How does this government even propose to monitor out-of-province populations and efforts for species protection?  And will there be any assessment of legislation and political changes in other jurisdictions so that we can be assured that these species will be taken care of elsewhere?  Any plans to re-adjust our approach if other jurisdictions take a similar leave-it-to-others approach of looking after the nonhuman world??  This is how extinction happens - everyone thinks someone else will take care of the problem, everyone believes that what they do doesn't cause the problem.)  This government has acknowledged that the ESA was one of the best pieces of legislation of its kind - our race-to-mediocrity will simply ensure that species will be extirpated from Ontario and elsewhere.  Extirpation is simply extinction at the local level.  If you extirpate populations across entire areas, that leads to the extinction of the species.  Extinction is permanent - once a species is wiped off the planet, it cannot come back - millions of years of evolution, interdependence and interaction eliminated in the blink of a geological eye.  The cavalier attitude of this government's proposal to something so serious and permanent is shocking.\nFinally, this proposal confirms how completely out-of-step this government is with reality.  Just last week the United Nations released a report that laid out in painful detail how humans are driving over 1,000,000 species towards extinction.  Reports are also documenting the global collapse of insect populations and of life within the oceans.  96% of the mass of living things on this planet is made up of humans and our livestock, only 4% is EVERYTHING else; 70% of bird populations on Earth are poultry, mostly chickens.  Think about that - we are displacing all other life on the planet; we are wiping out insects, once the most abundant animals on Earth; and we are destroying the oceans, areas so large that we know the moon better than we know what is under the world's seas.  If anyone in this government actually believes that we can live on a planet or in a province that is devoid of almost all life except for humans, our livestock and our food plants, they need to go back to school...oh wait, you're cutting high school classes as well.  Cunning plan.\nThe UN report was compiled by 450 scientists over 3 years - this government does not know better.  And it cannot possibly claim that Ontario somehow doesn't count in this tally of mass global extinction when 90% of ecosystems in southern Ontario have already been either degraded or destroyed (and this government also wants to \"bulldoze\" and harvest its way through some of the largest and most pristine ecosystems left in the world by repealing the Far North Act!!).  Extinction and ecosystem degradation is our problem, too - we are also to blame and we cannot escape the impacts.\nThe ESA needs to be strengthened by limiting or eliminating Ministerial discretion in at least two ways: 1) the listing of at-risk species should be a science-based decision that is completely removed from politics, not at the discretion of a Minister; and 2) the discretion of the Minister to depart from the provisions of the statute and approve projects and development that will harm at-risk species must be curtailed.  If the government is not prepared to make these changes, then the current ESA should be left alone, not weakened like the government is proposing.  I wholeheartedly oppose any proposed changes to the legislation that would make it even easier to undermine the ecological systems and services in this province for the sake of short-term (and short-sighted) development and extraction.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act include a few notable positive changes, such as requiring annual status updates. However these are marred by the numerous glaring negative aspects that will put endangered species in Ontario at greater risk of extinction:\nPoint 1E:\n\u201cRequire COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened. If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition.\u201d\n-\tThis regulation disregards the very real impacts of local population extinctions. Species require adequate habitat and connectivity of smaller populations in order to sustain the overall population. Ontario is a link in this chain, connecting the United States and Eastern and Western Canada. By accepting this regulation, Ontario would be shirking it\u2019s responsibility for environmental stewardship on the pretense that others will pick up the slack.\nPoint 1D, 2A-D, 3C, 4A, 4D\n-\tAltogether too much power is given to the individual minister. Decisions made by a committee of scientists should not have the power to be overthrown by an individual public servant. A committee is less likely to be biased, as ministers face pressure to adhere to the interests of their party and are likely to be replaced if they disagree.\nPoint 2A\n-\tThese regulations are entirely contrary to the actual goal of protecting species at risk\no\tDecoupling automatic protections essentially allows bureaucracy to tie up the process of protecting species. This is already an issue, with many species on the list still lacking any sort of plan for their protection\no\tSuspending protection for species to allow for \u201cadditional time to address the primary threats\u201d is inherently logically inconsistent. Addressing primary threats should be a priority, but while plans and research are in development, a species should still be protected.\no\tSocial and economic implications should not outweigh environmental considerations. To say that temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species is extremely short-sighted at best and impossible to prove. Furthermore, this is irrelevant if this species is already being considered under Cossaro \u2013 the implication for consideration is that the species has been impacted. Further inaction will not allow the species to recover.\no\tExtending timelines will again continue to put species that require protection at additional risk of experiencing further decline. This is already an issue in current reviews of endangered species\nPoint 2C\n-\tSimilar to point 2A, this legislation flies in the face of species conservation. Historically, suggested best practices are ineffective. Protection of Habitat MUST be a priority. Species cannot exist without appropriate habitat\nPoint 4\n-\tThe pay-to-slay legislation is outrageous. On the ground actions are vital and necessary to the protection of species. In recent ads, Ontario has talked about keeping the worst offenders accountable with regards to climate change \u2013 this change in species at risk legislation expressly exempts the worst offenders from any responsibility towards mitigating their environmental impacts\n",

        "comment":"To Whom it May Concern:\nThe Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation (\u201cMCFN\u201d) submits the following comments in respect of the amendments to the Endangered Species Act, R.S.O. 2007 that are being proposed in Bill 108, More Homes, More Choice Act, 2019.\nMCFN has grave concerns regarding these amendments, and what they could mean in respect of the protection of critical and culturally important species. In our view, the proposed amendments eat away at the protections for threatened and at-risk species in Ontario that exist under the current version of the Endangered Species Act. The potential implications of these amendments is the extinction or the increased likelihood of extinction of species that are of importance to MCFN.\nMCFN Rights and Territory\nMCFN\u2019s traditional territory spans from Long Point on Lake Erie to the Niagara River, then down the River to Lake Ontario, northward along the shore of the Lake to the River Rouge east of Toronto, then up that river to the dividing ridges to the head waters of the River Thames, then southward to Long Point, the place of the beginning (the \u201cTerritory\u201d).\nMCFN asserts Aboriginal rights not only to continued use of the lands, waters, and watershed ecosystems within its Territory for a variety of livelihood, harvesting, ceremonial and spiritual purposes, but also to maintain the health and conservation of vital medicinal plants and animals within its Territory. This latter right is also recognized as being protected under Article 24 of UNDRIP. We have a duty and stewardship responsibility to protect the integrity of this Territory.\nThe Proposed Amendments\nThe amendments to the Endangered Species Act proposed in Bill 108 that MCFN has particular concerns with include the following:\n1.\tSuspending protections for listed species. The new section 8.1 would allow the Minister to suspend some or all protections for species newly listed as either threatened or endangered for up to three years, if certain conditions are met.\n2.\tAllowing industry activities to continue despite impacts on listed species. The proposed amendments also provide developers, industry, and others who impact the habitat of a species listed as either threatened or endangered with a range of options to continue their activities. For example:\na.\tfor a period of 1 year after a species is listed as endangered\/threatened for the first time, some of the prohibitions on listed species (e.g. prohibitions on killing, transporting, selling a species) will not apply to people who were issued permits to engage in activities before the species was listed (the new section 8.2); and\nb.\tthe Minster can make regulations limiting the application of the prohibitions on certain activities affecting a species listed species (e.g. by indicating that some of the prohibitions do not apply to certain activities, or by limiting the geographic areas in which they do apply; etc. (the new section 9 (1.2) to (1.4));\n3.\tLandscape agreements. The new section 16.1 enables the Minister to enter into \u2018landscape agreements\u2019 with others, where such agreements can authorize a person to engage in activities in a certain geographic area that would otherwise be prohibited under the Act because they affect a listed species. While the agreements would require the person or proponent conducting the activity to undertake some \u201cbeneficial actions that will assist in the protection or recovery of one or more species\u201d, the species that benefit from do not necessarily have to be the ones impacted by the activity. There is also no mention or requirement that First Nations must be consulted or even notified, if and where these agreements are negotiated.\nImpact of the Proposed Amendments\nAltogether, the proposed amendments eat away at the protections for threatened and at-risk species in Ontario that exist under the current version of the Act. These changes noted above can contribute to the extinction or the increased likelihood of extinction of species that are of importance to MCFN, thereby compromising MCFN\u2019s right and stewardship responsibility to protect the health of those species and their habitat.\nIn addition, these landscape agreements will effectively allow certain activities to continue, despite the potential impacts of those activities on threatened or endangered species and their habitat. What is more, the amendments suggest that the landscape agreements can be negotiated without the knowledge or involvement of, and consultation with, First Nations.\nMCFN Recommendations\nMCFN\u2019s view is that these amendments should not be made.\nHowever, should the Government go ahead with the amendments, then MCFN is of the view that language should be incorporated into the amendments that requires consultations with First Nations where landscape agreements are negotiated, and where there is the potential for that agreement or the activities that will be permitted under that agreement to affect the rights and interests of a First Nation. This is particularly important where the landscape agreement is to cover a geographic area that falls within the traditional territory of a First Nation.\nIn addition, if and when the Minster proceeds to make regulations limiting the application of prohibitions on certain activities affecting a species listed species, MCFN should be meaningfully consulted on the development of those regulations. The Crown\u2019s regulatory schemes must provide a meaningful opportunity for consultation and accommodation of MCFN, where MCFN\u2019s asserted or proven Aboriginal and Treaty rights are implicated. As the Crown develops these regulations, it must provide for meaningful consultation and accommodation.\nMNCFN is particularly concerned with the amendments above. However, MCFN would like to take this opportunity to provide some additional comments and queries in respect of the Endangered Species Act, and in response to what Ontario has claimed the new approach to species protection that is adopted in the Act to achieve. These are outlined in the table that can be viewed in the attached document.\n",

Jones Forest Products Continues to Ask for Permanent Recognition of the CFSA as an Equivalent Process to ESA by Adopting a Section 55 Regulation into the ESA; Response to ERO Number 013-5033\nPremier Ford, Minister Phillips, and Minister Yakabuski,\nOn behalf of Bruce G. Jones Forest Products, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes, ERO number 013-5033. We look forward to continuing to work with your government to modernize and improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We are optimistic that this will result in improved outcomes for species at risk while ensuring Ontario is a place to grow our renewable forest sector, unleash its full potential and provide good-paying jobs for our people. However, the vagueness of the proposed changes does not provide necessary business certainty.\nThe 10th year review of the provincial Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides government with a rare opportunity to chart a course for the next decade and beyond. Political decisions on this will have far-reaching social, economic, and environmental impacts for generations to come. Therefore, the most important action the government must take remains permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through Section 55. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.\nIn March, we asked that this essential first step be accomplished in your Government\u2019s legislative changes to the ESA. However, the proposed changes indicate that a Section 18 Regulation will be the authorization process for forestry, instead of a Section 55 Regulation. For the past 10 years, we have consistently asked for a permanent Section 55 Regulation as the authorization process for the forest sector. The former government recognized that the CFSA and the ESA cannot be harmonized and provided a workable, temporary solution that was defended in court.  We are asking the Ford Government to take this workable, temporary solution and make it permanent.\nWe are asking that you revise the proposed legislative ESA changes to acknowledge that Section 55 will be the authorization mechanism for forest operations on Crown lands. Instead, MECP appears to be pursuing a revised section 18 \u201charmonization\u201d instrument which is at odds with our request. This bold move, like your support for other industries and activities with the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, would send a positive message to the forest sector and Bruce G. Jones Forest Products.\nIn addition to this critical revision, it also remains necessary to ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:\n1.\tConsideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy\n2.\tCumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy\n3.\tSocio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented\nThe sector will continue to operate under the CFSA which, by law, requires, forestry operations to follow an approved forest management plan. Guides delivered under the CFSA include operational prescriptions and conditions, which may include reserves, modified operations, or specific conditions on road use and construction in the area near a species at risk and their habitat.\nSince the establishment of the ESA, we have been clearly and consistently outlining what is required for permanent, long-term certainty within Ontario\u2019s forest sector and for our northern and rural communities. In order to avoid catastrophic socio-economic impacts, we need permanent, legislative recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy. It is our expectation that these required changes will be made and adopted into the new ESA legislation that you are passing.\nWe would be happy to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the best path forward to ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk while keeping people in this province working.\nSincerely,\nBruce Jones\nCC \tMinister Vic Fedeli, Ministry of Finance\nMinister Greg Rickford, Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, Ministry of Indigenous Affairs\nMinister Todd Smith, Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade\n             Minister Laurie Scott, Ministry of Labour\n             MPP Norm Miller, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs\nJamie Lim, President and CEO, OFIA\n",

        "comment":"Response to the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d\nThe planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species.

The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better.

        "comment":"Regarding changes to the assessment process, I support \u201cAmendment E\u201d- the proposal to consider a species condition around its broader biologically relevant area. However, this recommendation would better reflect societal values if it included the recognition that species can have regional significance.  For example the trillium flower is Ontario\u2019s official plant.  It would be a loss to our Province if this species were to go locally extinct, despite remaining abundant in the USA or Quebec. Such cases could be accommodated with some kind of provision that balances broader biological considerations with the possibility of regional significance.\nI see no reasonable justification for  the extension from three to twelve months of delay before listings are reported and the time when they are enacted.  At the same time this could result in irreversible harm to severely endangered species.\nConcerning the proposed changes to implementation, Amendment A which allows Ministerial discretion to override COSSARO designations for up to three years could easily lend itself abuse. For instance a Minister with political motives could forestall a conservation decision in order to please a minority interest in his or her riding. Moreover, the proposal to make such discretionary decisions contingent on the Minister\u2019s judgment that there are \u201csignificant social or economic implications\u201d is overly vague and subjective. I am thus strongly opposed to this amendment.\nRegarding the proposed amendments to permitting, I am opposed to all of the proposed changes that remove the requirement of the Minister to consult with experts. We expect our elected officials to make informed decisions that are in the best interest of society as a whole.  Drawing on the relevant expertise is the most reliable way to ensure such outcomes. I can\u2019t think of any societal benefit that would result from a loosening of the current consultation requirements.\n",

While I support growth, a holistic approach must be taken, ensuring that development supports\/encourages the rich biodiversity of the city. In the case of Chimney Swifts, developers must adhere to the permit requirements for removal of the habitat - not pay fines to skirt responsibilities - and incorporate habitat reconstruction into the development plans, as the species has been in decline for many years due to habitat (brick chimney) loss.\nSpecific to the proposed changes, I strongly oppose the proposed changes to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act (ESA), as brought forward in Schedule 5 of Bill 108.

I strongly disagree with this proposed change. While most people do not comment, I find the requirement to publicly post and accept comments under the EBR to be very much in the spirit of democratic representation and should be retained.\nSection 4: The proposed change, if properly managed, has the potential to be a useful tool for conservation and allow for better provincial coordination of conservation targets. I do worry that the current government's intention is simply create easier ways for businesses to ignore species protection. I also worry that this will become the only tool, rather than one of several tools; this may be appropriate for some species in some parts of the province, but be completely inadequate or even counter-productive for others. Decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis. Costs should be proportional to the size of the business involved. Multi-billion dollar corporations should be required to pay a proportionally larger charge than a small local business of individual. It is also essential that the Species at Risk Conservation Trust is not merely an arm of the current government in power, and that is is truly independent agency.\nBut if the government truly wishes to employ this in good faith, it could have many benefits for wildlife and businesses alike.\nA red flag is that this leaves a lot of the decisions in the hands of the Minister's office, and removes much of the requirements for independent consultation. I think it is undesirable to allow for too many of these decisions to be make for political aims. That will be an unavoidable tendency for the Minister, who is, after all, a political appointment whose primary loyalty all too often seems to be to the party\/government instead of the province as a whole. This is a concern for all parties, and was certainly an issue in the Liberal days as well.\nBefore allowing the Minister's office such sweeping control over this process, remember that the next Liberal\/NDP\/Green government will inherit these same changes and powers. We would all rather have a system that keeps enough checks and balances on the various parties (government and advocacy groups alike) so that we all feel reasonably assured that important decisions are make with input from across the province's various constituencies. Proposed changes to Ministerial control should be scaled back and more input\/oversight retained.\nSection 5-B: It is unclear what is being proposed. Enforcement is obviously a key component of protection, and Conservation Officers are relied upon for on the ground enforcement, particularly of hunting and fishing infractions. Proper enforcement \u2014 and the credible threat of punishment if rules are knowingly broken \u2014 must be maintained or strengthened.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Province\u2019s proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). It is understood that the Province is seeking to improve the administration of the ESA through new types of permit and agreements while ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk. While implementation challenges have been expressed in the implementation of the ESA, the Province\u2019s Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan also recognizes that species at risk in Ontario are facing increasing strain and pressure due to the effects of climate change, invasive species and habitat alteration. City of Markham staff supports the intent of this Act to reverse negative trends to species at risk populations and have concerns that some of the proposed changes may weaken the level of protection afforded to Ontario\u2019s species at risk. We provide the following comments for your consideration.\n1.\tIntegration of ESA permitting with land use planning\nCity of Markham staff support the concept of a \u2018landscape agreement\u2019. The City is currently planning for the \u2018Future Urban Area\u2019 encompassing approximately 1300 hectares to accommodate growth to 2031 and it is anticipated that numerous ESA permits will be required in support of urban development. To manage the impacts of urban development, the City is requiring that a natural heritage restoration plan be prepared for each of the four community blocks. The option to implement a \u2018landscape agreement\u2019 can assist in a coordinated and strategic approach to the implementation of multiple restoration projects to enhance the natural environment including the habitat for species at risk.\nCareful attention must be paid to the implementation of the landscape agreement to ensure that unforeseen impacts to species at risk are not incurred. Staff have concerns that landscape agreements are not required to fully offset impacts to each impacted species at risk as proposed under section 16.1(2) of the ESA. This could result in a difficult scenario where Provincial staff have to choose \u201cwinners and losers\u201d amongst species at risk.\n2.\tSpecies at Risk Conservation Trust\nCity of Markham staff support the option to offset impacts to species at risk through a dedicated fund, however safeguards need to be put in place to ensure proper management and administration of this agency.\nFirstly, it should be ensured that \u2018species conservation charges\u2019 are directed towards beneficial activities for species at risk rather than administration and staffing costs. If the Province intends to recover administration and staff expenses through the \u2018species conservation charge\u2019, then these additional costs should be factored into account.\nSecondly, projects funded by the agency should prioritize the recovery of species that have been impacted and for which a \u2018species conservation charge\u2019 has been collected. As proposed, it appears that funds collected under the Species at Risk Conservation Trust may be directed towards any species at risk.\n3.\tAdopting a Precautionary Approach to Ontario\u2019s Biodiversity and Species at Risk\nWhile City staff support a number of the proposed changes, other proposed changes could have an undesirable result on the recovery of species at risk in Ontario. These include:\n\u2022\tConsideration of the condition of the species outside of Ontario (s. 5(4)(b))\n\u2022\tAbility to suspend protection of newly listed species at risk for up to three years (s. 8.1)\n\u2022\tAbility to, by regulation, limit the protection of newly listed species (s. 9(1.1))\nSpecies at risk populations are facing increasing risks due to climate change, invasive species and habitat alteration. Staff suggest that these changes be carefully reviewed in consultation with industry experts to ensure that the overall purpose and intent of the ESA is not compromised.\n",

I am concerned about the short-sightedness of some of the changes being made to this Act.\n1)\tI am concerned about the development of a land trust instead of the requirement to do protection activities. Recovery and conservation need to be priorities, and this should be focus on the habitat that was disturbed. Many of these species having a fidelity to their habitat, and so offsetting habitat elsewhere will not produce an equivalent benefit. I am also concerned about the loose language that funds are \u201creasonably likely to support the protection and recovery of these species\u201d.

KFN\u2019s membership includes over 500 residents and families actively involved in protecting the environment and quality of life in the Kingston area.  For over 70 years our members have monitored plants, wildlife and the natural environment in the Kingston area.\nAs the owner of a number of private nature reserves and an organization dedicated to environmental stewardship in the Kingston area, KFN wishes to express its disappointment over the changes proposed by your government to the ESA. Ontario\u2019s biological diversity is unmatched in Canada, but this means that our province also has special responsibilities. In our respectful view, the Ontario Government can and should be leading the way on the protection of vulnerable species in Canada. Unfortunately, at almost the same time that the United Nations is reporting an unprecedented threat of extinction for a million species,  the Ontario government is proposing to roll back protection for our species at risk. The proposed changes to the ESA are not in the best interests of future generations of Ontario residents.\nThe KFN has reviewed Bill 108. We have a number of comments to offer on the changes proposed in Schedule 5 of the Bill:\n\u2022\tChanges to the criteria for classification of species at risk, especially those at northern or southern ends of their ranges likely means that species in trouble in special areas such as Ontario\u2019s Carolinian habitats may no longer be protected. These are special and important areas.\n\u2022\tOverall the changes to the ESA proposed in Bill 108 offer multiple avenues for delaying government decision-making. This increases uncertainty for both the environment and developers. It also means that the status of species at risk can continue to deteriorate while government delays unfold. This uncertainty makes the \u201cred tape\u201d problem worse not better.\n\u2022\tBill 108 expands the scope of Ministerial discretion to a point where science-based decision making is undermined. KFN understands and accepts the need for political decisions to be made in the public interest. We nonetheless suggest that Ministers of the Government should let scientific experts give them the best advice possible and only then make clear accountable decisions. Including multiple avenues for reviews and inserting political considerations too early in the process has the potential to confuse the results of species assessments.\n\u2022\tThe Bill eliminates automatic protection for the most vulnerable of species for a year for existing permit and agreement holders and allows the Minister to suspend protection of habitat and species for up to three years based on socio-economic factors. It further allows protections, once they become available, to be limited by geography or specific circumstances. The result is that protection for threatened and endangered species and their habitats will largely be discretionary. In addition, the product of this system is going to be complex, hard to track and hard for Ontario residents and industry to understand.\n\u2022\tThe Ministerial discretion for indefinite delay of recovery statements and removal of requirements for EBR notices of recovery strategies and management plans will make it harder for Ontario residents to contribute to government decision-making on species recovery and will delay government action to ensure that recovery efforts are initiated.\n\u2022\tIn many ways the Bill will facilitate harmful activity which further impacts vulnerable species. Paying into a fund may encourage general consideration of the challenges to and the needs of species at risk but it will not protect species and habitats confronted by immediate threats. Various new provisions for permits and agreements provided for in the Bill will contribute to actual habitat and wildlife losses.\nIn conclusion, the KFN\u2019s assessment of Schedule 5 to Bill 108 is that it will reduce protections for and actually contribute to losses of species at risk and their habitats. We urge the Government of Ontario to reconsider the contents of Schedule 5. These proposed legislative changes will not contribute to sustainable development in Ontario and in our respectful view, they are not in the public interest.\nPresident, Kingston Field Naturalists\n",

It is also an important driver in the northern communities of Ontario. Determining a permanent solution to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is critical, and the best solution to manage the above said objectives is to make the balanced CFSA an equivalent process to the ESA. I strongly support a long-term Section 55 Regulatory Exemption for the forest sector which recognizes the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  I do not support the attempts at harmonization of the CFSA with the ESA through amendments to Section 18 as proposed in this posting.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the ESA is a gift to developers, at the cost of all Ontarians and endangering food security.\nI'm not leaving this comment to tell you that Ontarians value biodiversity and wildlife, and that the proposed changes eviscerating the ESA will harm both of those. You already know that.\nI'm writing this comment to protest the long term economic damage that you will be doing to the province, and, in consequence, all Ontarians, regardless of whether they care for the environment or not.\nUsing economic language, natural areas and ecosystems provide a variety of what are called positive externalities, or benefits to third parties without imposing a cost on those third parties. Forests, for example, regulation of climate, carbon storage and erosion control. Pollinators such as bees (certain species are on the endangered list in Ontario) are important for food supply. In contrast, destroying these cause negative externalities, as do other things that impact the environment (such as polluting the air, water, etc.), meaning that the long-term social cost is not fully captured by the person or organization conducting these activities, but is rather passed on to everyone else. In effect, it is socialism - it is providing \"welfare payments\" for such persons or organizations.\nI understand that the proposed legislation would allow developers to pay a certain fee for their actions in certain cases, and more housing is needed in the GTA. While I agree that these might mitigate the economic damage that the developers would causing, there's no provision in the legislation to ensure the fee or payment will be sufficient to capture the entire scope of the excessive negative externalities that they cause. This means that the difference between these negative externalities and the payment will be borne by Ontarians. In addition, there is no indication that this payment will go towards offsetting the negative externalities and thus the cost to Ontarians would be even greater.\nI respectfully ask that you reconsider the proposed amendments to the ESA in light of the above.\n",

The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the\u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"\u2022 Considering a species condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario increases the risk that the species will be extirpated from the province which can have significant ecological and economical impacts, while also reducing the protections for the species and preventing proper conversational efforts from being implemented leading to a more reactive rather than proactive approach to protecting our species. Species reintroduction programs are very costly and few are truly successful.\n\u2022 Providing the Minister with the authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for newly-listed species can be detrimental on the survival of a species depending on the sensitivity of the species to ecological changes; especially if they have particular mating habits or require a very particular set of conditions to not only survive, but to be able to reproduce.\n\u2022 I'm concerned about the new proposed section 8.2 under the ESA mentioned in the Bill 108 proposal:\nNew section 8.2 provides that, for a period of one year after a species is listed\n on the Species at Risk in Ontario List as an endangered or threatened species\n for the first time, some of the prohibitions under subsection 9 (1) or 10 (1)\n will not apply to persons who were issued permits or otherwise authorized under\n the Act to engage in activities before the species was so listed. This one-year\n delay applies in addition to any order made under section 8.1 that temporarily\n suspends the relevant prohibitions for a period of up to three years.\nAs mentioned above, any type of delay in establishing protections for a species can be detrimental to its population numbers. This section can also get tangled with new section 27.1:\nNew section 27.1 gives the Minister the power to order a person not to engage in an\n activity or to stop engaging in an activity that may have a significant adverse\n effect on a species listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List as an\n extirpated, endangered or threatened species. The order may also require the\n person to take steps to address the adverse effect of the activity.\nIf I'm not mistaken, if you combine these two new sections in a real life scenario, the Minister now has authority to allow allow activities to occur if a species was newly listed, while also giving the Minister the authority to come back after the one-year delay and order said person to no longer engage in the activity that may have a significant adverse affect on a species and also force said person to remediate the situation. This is a very reactive approach. This approach not only has the potential to increase harm on the species population, but may lead to an increase in costs for protection and remediation efforts. I fear negativity will follow no matter which decision the Minister will make in this position, whether proactive or reactive as a result of the authority given by these two new sections of the ESA.\n\u2022 I don't agree with the proposed change to create a regulatory charge that would authorize individuals to pay to carry out prohibited activities. I understand that the Government wishes to reduce timelines to get projects up-and-running while reducing regulatory burden, however, I don't believe that allowing individuals to pay a fee to by-pass the process of obtaining permits and obeying regulations is the way to go. This proposal is especially worrisome considering the proposed changes for the Environmental Assessment Act. Under the ESA proposal, there is a line in the summary which states \"Clients will still need to fulfill some on-the-ground requirements, including considering reasonable alternatives for their activity and taking steps to minimize the adverse effects of the activity on the species at risk\". However, under the new EAA proposal, the Government wishes to exempt low risk projects from having to undergo a EA and change the classification of some medium-risk projects and moving them to low-risk classification. I'm confused as to how the Government will monitor these on-the-ground requirements and what would be considered reasonable alternatives depending on the new risk classification of projects. For example: would someone wishing to establish a septic bed in a region near a wetland with an endangered turtles be able to by-pass the Environmental Assessment step as well as pay the regulatory charge under the ESA and carry forward with the project? - More clarification on this regulatory charge and the types of projects that may be eligible to by-pass permits, agreements, etc. would be good to see.\n\u2022 The new transition provision for existing Endangered Species Act permits would allow holders to continue operations for 1 year following the listing of new species or habitat protections while the permit or agreement is amended.  How will this work for those who paid the regulatory charge? Will they also be limited to 1 year while the Ministry explores alternatives to ensure the protections are accounted for and make the operators adjust their activity accordingly or will the be exempt from this process?\n",

Credit Valley Conservation (CVC) provides these comments on the areas of focus as identified in the Notice on the Environmental Registry of Ontario.\n1.\tAssessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk List in Ontario List\nCOSSARO is a science based organized that uses the best available information to develop the species at risk list.  As a result, CVC supports the automatic protection of listed species.  If there is delay in the listing then the species and its habitat then there is a greater risk for population declines and habitat loss.  Furthermore, if there is no automatic listing the species, the species  would not be eligible for funding or programs that facilitate recovery efforts.\nCVC does not support the COSSARO assessment being based on \u201cbiologically relevant geographic area\u201d.  The Endangered Species Act is based on protecting the biodiversity of Ontario.  By not protecting the Species at Risk in Ontario, we are putting the biodiversity of Ontario at risk.  In addition, not protecting species at the edge of their range may put the species at further risk due to climate change.\n2.\tDefining and implementing species and habitat protections\nCVC recommends that there be no de-coupling of listing species at risk from automatic protection provided under the ESA for threatened and endangered species and their habitats.\nCVC would recommend that he Province should work with any affected business to find an appropriate solution when a species is added to the list that would affect that business  For example, if a specific project has already been approved or is near approval, it would seem reasonable to use measures to mitigate impacts to the species rather than undertake a complete redesign. But these should be addressed as one-off exceptions rather than delaying the automatic protection.\n3. \tDeveloping species at risk recovery policies\nCVC recommends that there should be no change to the legal requirements to produce GRS within 9 months.  The Legislated timelines are intended to ensure that the actions to recover species occurs in a timely manner.   The completion of GRS needs to be appropriately resourced to ensure that the timelines are achieved.\nIf the Province deems an extension to the timelines would be benefical for a specific species due to complex life cycle or other issue.  Then the extension should be provided for that species with a specific backstop date within which the GRS would be completed.\n4.  \tIssuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAlthough CVC is in support of Landscape Actions that can be undertaken by a Trust, this approach needs to be undertaken with a high degree caution.  Some of the concerns include:\n\u2022\tShifting the focus of the protection to the general species from the individual members of the species has the potential that the specific requirements of the species will not be achieved;\n\u2022\tLoss of local or reginal habitat and biodiversity in areas of development if the offsets are provided elsewhere;\n\u2022\tEstablishing equivalency, additionality and monetary value of lost habitat plus overall benefit;\n\u2022\tPressure to move toward a strictly cash-in-lieu approach solely for the purposes of expediency;\n\u2022\tWith the establishment of the Trust, who is taking the responsibility for providing the offsets and overall benefit; and\n\u2022\tEnsuring that complete cost recovery (including monitoring and adaptive management) is achieved.\nConservation Authorities are major landholders across Ontario and are environmental agencies that actively acquire and restore lands across for ecological improvements. Under the proposed new Species at risk Conservation Trust, special consideration should be given to Conservation Authorities (and projects undertaken through or under a Conservation Authority)  to be recipients of funds for dedicated species at risk recovery projects, given their mandate, regulatory framework  and considerable expertise restoring lands for this very purpose.\nClarification should be provided as to whether projects undertaken by a Conservation Authority will have the ability to go through the Species Conservation Charge\/ Conservation Trust process. The current wording appears to imply that only municipalities and large infrastructure developers can choose to go through this route.\n5.\tEnforcing the Endangered Species Act\nAlthough CVC recognizes the need to act swiftly, CVC is concerned that exempting the regulations containing Minister\u2019s orders made for the purpose of pausing protection from the EBR posting and consultation requirement eliminates the opportunity for public comment.  CVC recommends removing this exemption.\nPlease do not hesitate to contact the undersigned if you have any additional questions.\nYours truly,\nGary Murphy\nDirector\nPlanning and Development Services\nCredit Valley Conservation\n",

        "comment":"Reviewing Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act in light of new and developing issues relating to Ontario\u2019s environment is wise for any government.  However the currently proposed amendments seem, on the whole, not to be concerned with providing better care for species, but rather to consolidate power in the person of the Minister of Natural Resources and reduce the accountability of said person to individuals and the scientific work of conservation experts in the field, including those working under their own authority.  These amendments would allow for collusion between businesspeople, scientists and the Minister of Natural Resources for monetary or individual gain to occur undocumented at the expense of endangered species where current legislation would clearly reveal such corruption.\nPlease stand firm to keep our species at risk in Ontario safe and do not forward the amendments as proposed.\nWhat follows are comments based on specific components of the proposed amendments.\nAmendment 1.A. Why expand the required period from 3 to 12 months? \u2013 Given that 1E is also introduced why not expand to 4 or 6 months?  A fourfold increase in time is not necessary and could be extremely harmful for a species in need needing decisive action.\n1.D. Specificity is completely lacking in the statement of this amendment.  What is \u201cScientific information?\u201d Government reports, externally published works, and multiple expert opinions should all be taken account in the situations described here, and legislation should require as much; not leaving a loophole for a single biased opinion of one individual with a science background to sway government decisions.\n1.E. Putting the position of species within Ontario into the broader context of the species global distribution and status is a good idea \u2013 but requiring a species to be  downlisting based solely upon external populations is short-sighted. The importance of a species in Ontario ecosystems is as important for our legislation to consider as its external abundance.\nAmendment 2.C. If species are newly-listed as at risk, the best way to downgrade them is immediate action and the currently proposed amendment eliminates any timeframe within which a protection plan must be made.  Removing the necessity of a plan inevitably means some species will be eventually missed by protocol and suffer because of it.  If new habitat regulation plans need to be made later, then allow for the plans to be updates and altered after an original strategy has been put into place \u2013 but please do not remove the mandate to develop a habitat regulation proposal within a clear and short timeline \u2013 it will only leave species increasingly vulnerable to human error.\nAmendment 3.A. Sometimes timeframes for scientifically sound plans may need to be extended, but this amendment again, leaves the timeframe open-ended.  Do not remove accountability from the Minister by leaving this law open-ended!  It is only setting the law up for abuse!  To make the option of extending the deadline to a year or 18 months is justifiable, not removing the cap completely at the Minister\u2019s discretion.\n3.C. Why would a progress review need such extension unless the government was failing to do its work?  The frequency of reviews and subsequent policy alterations should be scheduled according to the existing species-specific Government Response Statements.  To allow the Minister to alter this seems illogical unless this amendment simply seeks to empower the Minister to justify altering the established conservation science regime based on their discretion.  Instead of \u201cbased on individual species\u2019 needs\u201d this could read \u201cbased on a repeated advice and data provided by experts performing species-specific surveys in the field.\u201d\nAmendment 4. The 4th amendment from A through F actually gives the Minister and businesses obvious loopholes and opportunities for abuse within the ESA that promote business expansion while minimizing accountability by removal of external scientific and expert accountability, and allowing the opportunity to harm a species at risk in favour of any other \u201cspecies\u201d, not necessarily even another at risk species, with soft language and arbitrary judgement calls giving all of the decision-making power to the Minister and high-ranking officials.  Within this new fundraising entity there is described no accountability for a dollar-to-dollar transmission of funds paid to allow the harming of one species and \/or their habitat to be put to use elsewhere in the province for the specific benefit of that species; this would inevitably lead to species that are more difficult to protect being disproportionately harmed by business action.\nAmendment 5.B. While increasing enforcement is wise, relying on people who are not trained and educated in conservation issues to perform meaningful inspections allows for a great degree of error and bias to occur from ideologues on either side of the issue who lack a strong conservation background and education occupy these positions to abuse their role in this process.  Both those who are intent on stopping all development, and those intent on promoting it regardless, would be given undue authority to misunderstand and misapply to law to their own preferences.\nFinally, the Minister should not be allowed to order any pause in the protection of a species on his or her own authority.  Again, as above, using expert data in significant amounts may be justify such an action, but to allow the Minister this authority without scientific accountability enables corruption within the system.\nAlso concerning is in the proposed changes to the Environmental Assessment Act \u2013 new section 15.3, making \u201cCertain undertakings\u201d exempt from environmental assessments. Why should this occur and why are these undertakings devoid of specificity in the law?  Such soft language leaves enormous gaps in legislation, opening many avenues for abuse.\nPlease do not forward these amendments to the ESA as is.  Please keep clear guidelines, timeframes and accountability to experts and scientific data a consistent part of our ESA in Ontario.\n",

In Ontario we have a responsibility to protect flora and fauna in that wild - and it has never been so important.  Having a strong Endangered Species Act is essential.  There must be no caveats, permits or permissions for developers and industry to exchange money for wildlife habitat.  Industry must not have a seat at the decisions table for listing or assessing wildlife.\nAny changes to the Act should strengthen protections for flora and fauna and their habitat. There must be no changes that further put nature at risk and provide a hand up to developers and industry.  We need more money in conservation...but not in exchange for wildlife and wildlife habitat.  That is a loosing and downward spiraling cycle.\n",

        "comment":"The planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"The Rescue Lake Simcoe Coalition supports the following submission of the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition:\nRe: 10 year review of the Endangered Species Act, ERO  013-5033\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nPlease accept our submission to the aforementioned review. We stand by the submissions of              Ontario Nature and their local clubs. Naturalist clubs are at the front line of what these changes                 will mean for species at risk.  We should heed their caution and concerns.\nAbout Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition With our 35 member groups from both urban, rural and semi-urban communities, we aim to promote community development that is financially, environmentally and socially sustainable,          such that provides a net benefit to residents. A major part of this is to recognize the value that                   natural heritage, agriculture and water gives to our communities, including the numerous            benefits and co-benefits of ecosystem services. Ensuring the people of Simcoe County, and             Ontario broadly, continue to receive these benefits requires an approach to economic            development that is evidence based, transparent and accountable to the public, and with full              consideration of the long-term impacts that communities will either have to deal with or benefit               from.\nSimcoe County\u2019s Context as a Home to Species-At-Risk At 4,841 square kilometres, Simcoe County is one of the largest regions in the Greater Golden                Horseshoe. Its vast interconnected water system includes provincially and internationally          important water resources: Wasaga Beach, Minesing Wetlands, Matchedash Bay and Wye           Marsh. Geologically diverse, Simcoe is home to over 1500 species of vascular plants, 150              species of nesting birds, 50 mammals and 33 types of reptiles and amphibians . It offers               1 specialized vegetation communities adapted to unique habitats such as coastal plains, prairies            and savannas, alvars, bogs and fens, the Great Lakes shoreline and the Niagara Escarpment.              In addition, the county contains provincially significant wetlands, provincially significant Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest and more than 60 species of plants and animals deemed              vulnerable, threatened or endangered in Ontario and\/or Canada. Extensive tracts of           2 undisturbed forest in the north and east are habitats for forest-dwelling birds and mammals. All               these features combine to provide a healthy habitat for Simcoe County residents, flora and              fauna. Our concern is how these sensitive habitats will be treated in future under the potential changes.\nIn broad strokes, we are opposed to the following changes to:\n\u25cf How species will be assessed and listed\n\u25cf How species and habitats will be protected\n\u25cf Species at risk recovery policies\n\u25cf Permitting and exemptions under the new Species at Risk Conservation Fund\nNew Changes Put in Context of Species at Risk in Simcoe County\/Lake Simcoe Watershed\nAs noted in Figure 1, there are several species at risk in one of our watersheds and they are                   most at risk within Simcoe County communities. The new changes proposed could pose             significant threats to Simcoe County\u2019s most vulnerable species and sensitive habitats.\nIn 2012, MNRF looked at the Lake Simcoe Watershed to assess the vulnerability of species at                risk within the Lake Simcoe watershed in light of climate change. Out of the 62 species at risk                  known in the watershed, 17 were identified as most at risk and therefore high priority for study.                 As easily seen in Figure 1, these species were most imperilled (red\/orange\/yellow) in Barrie,              Oro-Medonte, Orillia, Innisfil and Bradford West Gwillimbury.\nFurther, the vulnerability assessment found that two species at risk were going to face              devastating futures factoring in climate change - the Redside Dace and the Jefferson             salamander. Assessments concluded that in both cases, the current habitat, which is currently             under threat, is the only one left that is suitable for them in the entire watershed.\nAlthough from two different ecosystems, what these species tell us is all we need to know about                 how effective current ESA regulations are at protecting species and their habitat. Urban             development is the most significant threat to both of these species as clearly outlined in their                recovery strategies. The Redside Dace requires clean water with forest cover while the             Jefferson Salamander requires connected habitat which includes well-functioning wetlands and          clean water systems. However, their habitats continue to be affected by urbanization despite             coherent recovery strategies. That we are not only threatening their \u201cofficially recognized            habitat\u201d, but also degrading adjacent habitats so they have no other habitat options is a scathing                assessment of what we are doing to our landscapes and watersheds.\nYet, the province\u2019s proposals for changes to the ESA only further jeopardize these two species.\nJefferson Salamander\nThe Jefferson Salamander is listed globally as \u201capparently secure\u201d meaning that it is not              uncommon but also not rare. Despite that the salamander is listed as \u201cthreatened\u201d under the               ESA as well as in the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA), current proposals to the ESA could                  see the Jefferson salamander delisted or have its status reduced due to its somewhat stable               presence in the US. New powers could mean that Ontario could absolve itself of protecting the                salamander\u2019s habitat even though Ontario is its only home in Canada. Once a species has been                delisted based on its stable populations elsewhere, will the province commit to continuously             re-evaluating its position based on how other populations are increasing or decreasing? Will             there be coordination efforts by Ontario to ensure if other populations are at risk, the Ontario                population is added? If other jurisdictions were to implement similar policies based on common              populations elsewhere, how would that impact the continental population of a species?            Absolving our responsibility to our natural world is not acceptable.\nRedside Dace The Redside Dace is primarily limited to headwaters in river systems that it used to commonly                populate throughout. It is relatively common in the eastern part of its range although its               population is declining quickly. In the western part of its range it is less common and hence was                  listed as endangered under SARO. Similar to the Jefferson Salamander, the province could             determine that there are healthy populations outside of Ontario and it could either be delisted or                have its status downgraded. Again, associated habitats would also suffer by this potential             change.\nThe Redside Dace could also be impacted by landscape agreements. Under the current             proposal, proponents could enter into landscape agreements that would allow activities normally            prohibited under the ESA to take place or continue as long as the proponent executes               \u201cbeneficial activities\u201d in the specified geographic area for species in the area. Amazingly, the              beneficial activities don\u2019t have to apply to the species being affected by the damaging activities,               nor do they have to apply to other species listed on SARO. Further, there is little detail about                  what constitutes a \u201cbeneficial\u201d activity as this is at the Minister\u2019s discretion - a subjective position                that potentially politicizes a process and negates the science-based recommendations of the            recovery strategies. As outlined in its species recovery strategy, urbanization has a predominant             impact on the Redside Dace\u2019s survival. Under current ESA policy proposals, urbanization could             occur under a landscape agreement. The proponent would then have to agree to other              \u201cbeneficial activities\u201d that may not even apply to the Redside Dace. This could be tree planting,                riverbank rehabilitation or numerous other activities that could not possibly mitigate the damage             done to the Redside Dace\u2019s habitat via urbanization.\nThis cannot be viewed as adequate protection for a species at risk. If landscape agreements               just mean that some things have to be done rather than the right things for the species and its                   survival, then what is the point of the entire act?\nHine\u2019s Emerald Dragonfly\nIn the Nottawasaga River Valley Watershed, we already have a similar story of \u201ceconomic              development\u201d trumping the needs of endangered species. The Hine\u2019s Emerald Dragonfly has            only one known home in Canada - the Minesing Wetlands. It requires clean, cool, springfed               water to breed and in which to spend the first two years of its life underwater. And yet, the                   demand  for urbanization has threatened its water supply and habitat.\nIn its 2014\/2015 annual report, \u201cSmall Things Matter\u201d the Environmental Commissioner of            Ontario\u2019s office used the Hine\u2019s Emerald as an example of how science outlines what is needed,                but the government does differently at the expense of our shared environment and species at               risk. In its recovery strategy, it is clear that certain landscapes should be protected from               urbanization to maintain habitat and water flow. However, the government did not fully protect              this region from further urbanization or disturbance.  As said in the report:\n\u201cIn the case of Hine\u2019s Emerald, the failure to protect the Snow Valley Uplands areas is troubling.                 The importance of such protection was explained and expressly recommended in the species\u2019             recovery strategy. The MNRF\u2019s decision is particularly disconcerting because the Snow Valley            Uplands are under pressure from development, as noted in the recovery strategy. This makes              protecting the area all the more important, although possibly more controversial.\n\u200b Given the             specificity of this recommendation in the recovery strategy, and with no explanation of             the ministry\u2019s decision provided, the ECO concludes that the MNRF opted to favour             development, rather than to prioritize the protection of this species at risk habitat\u201d             (Emphasis added) p. 154\nWhat will happen to the habitat of the Hine\u2019s Emerald under these new policies? Will they                consider that recovery strategies in the US that have been quite successful for other              populations therefore negate the need for protection in Ontario? Will future and current             urbanization plans conflict with habitat regulations enough for the Minister to warrant that those              projects will get an exemption? After all, subsections 9.1 - 9.4 of the new proposal allow the                 Minister to limit the prohibitions protecting a species by removing some of them, limiting the               geographic area where they apply or only applying to the species at a certain stage of its                 development.\nFor the Hine\u2019s Emerald, it could very well mean that prohibitions that affect its adult range could                 stay (since that is mostly in a provincially significant wetland anyway), but prohibitions that              impact its larvae stage (which is the first two years of its life) could be lifted. Again, this is                   something that is made at the Minister\u2019s discretion. The listing and protection of a species               should not be left to a Minister\u2019s discretion; rather, it should be science-based.\nChimney Swift\nNature Barrie has been successful in protecting critical habitat for \u200bthreatened Chimney Swifts as              part of the redevelopment of the former Barrie Central Collegiate site in Downtown Barrie\u2019s              Urban Growth Centre. Co-operation between Nature Barrie, the developer, the City of Barrie             and MNRF led to the preservation of Chimney Swift roosting and nesting habitat in the chimney                of the former high school when the school was demolished in the spring of 2018. This habitat                 will either be maintained intact or replaced with a suitable habitat structure across the street as\npart of the redevelopment. The developer publicly expressed his support for wildlife habitat             protection when recently presenting his redevelopment plans for the site.\nClearly there was no need for reducing or avoiding the requirements of the present ESA in this                 major residential\/institutional downtown redevelopment project. The existing ESA did the job it            was supposed to do.\nSummary Simcoe County is a significant home for many species at risk. It is also home to vast wetland                  and water complexes as well as forest habitat. The species and spaces included in the ESA\u2019s                recovery strategies are our most vulnerable and sacred. They function as indicators to let us               know when our activities have gone too far and when our thirst for all things new and concrete is                   threatening our water, air and soils. They are already telling us we have gone too far. Now is                  not the time to abandon them or the spaces in which they reside. We have a moral duty to                   protect the places in which we live.\nFor that reason, we strongly urge MECP to implement the following recommendations:\n\u25cf Reinstate automatic protections of listed species and their habitats;\n \u25cf Landscape agreements, as written, do little benefit to species affected and again provide             another way to avoid ESA prohibitions. Landscape agreements should either be  abandoned or make it clear that beneficial activities comply with the recovery strategy for  the species affected and provide maximum net benefit.\n\u25cf Do not change the listing process and the role of COSSARO;\n\u25cf Regardless of populations outside of Ontario, species at risk should be afforded            protection in Ontario.  Edge of range species should not be denied protection;\n\u25cf Do not allow the ESA to become politicized by delegating authority to the Minister to               remove or delay protections;\n\u25cf Maintain the legal requirement to produce a GRS within nine months of the release of               Recovery Strategies or Management Plans;\n\u25cf There are already exemptions to the ESA. Creating more tools to allow harmful activities              is the final gutting of the act;\n\u25cf The rules that apply should be applied consistently and fairly. Allowing proponents to             avoid policies by paying into the Species at Risk Conservation Fund reduces            accountability and only exacerbates harm. The legislation should focus on requirements           to provide on-the-ground, overall benefit.\n\u25cf Section 17(2)d permits should still be required to obtain Cabinet approval or to consult              with an independent expert;\nConsidering that the existing ESA was already woefully inadequate to protect species at risk,              the current policy proposals make it abundantly clear that the objective of these changes is               expediting business rather than taking accountability to protect species at risk.\nThe impetus for protecting species at risk is directly related to our own survival. We are in the                  midst of a loss-of-biodiversity crisis. There seems to be little value in these proposed policies to\n6\naddress this existential crisis proactively. With each protected habitat we allow to be destroyed,              each species we allow to be extirpated or become extinct, we threaten our own survival. These                species at risk are not simply \u201cnice to have\u201d, they form the basis of the ecosystems on which our                   survival relies.\nAs Carl Sagan once said, \u201cAnything else you're interested in is not going to happen if you can't                  breathe the air and drink the water.\u201d It is a false illusion that economic development can                override natural laws. We trust that MECP agrees and will push for stronger implementation of               the ESA without putting our species and spaces at further risk.\nSincerely,\nMargaret Prophet Executive Director, Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition\n",

        "comment":"Below are my comments on specific sections of the proposed changes to the ESA.\n1. Proposed Change: A.\tProvide the public earlier notice of COSSARO's species\u2019 assessment and classification results by making its report available to the public no later than three months after it is received by the Minister. Also, extend the time from when a COSSARO report is received by the Minister to when listing is to occur from three to twelve months (i.e., when a species must be added to the SARO List).\nComment: Extending the length of time from when a species is listed to when protection is applied delays protection which should be afforded to these species immediately.  It also allows for opportunities for abuse of the system via pre-emptive destruction of habitat prior to implementation of protection.  As such, it is strongly recommended that listing of species remain at no more than 3 months.\n2. Proposed Change: D.\tAllow the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species where the Minister forms the opinion based on scientific information that the classification may not no longer be appropriate. For species that are not yet on the list or are listed as special concern, the proposed changes provide that the species would not be added to the SAROList or listed to a more endangered status during COSSARO's re-assessment.\nComment: COSSARO are the experts on the status of Species at Risk in Ontario.  The evaluation of a species status is always based on the best available scientific information gathered from THE recognized experts in the field.  The idea that the Minister, who is a lay person when it comes to SAR, can counter the findings of COSSARO is absurd. I strongly consider that this recommended change be reconsidered.  If the Minister suspects a species status is out of date, they should request that a Status Report Update be completed.\n3. Proposed Change:     E.\tRequire COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened. If the overall condition of risk to the species in the broader biologically relevant geographic area is lower, COSSARO would be required to adjust the species\u2019 classification to reflect its overall condition.\nComment: This issue has been much discussed in conservation related fields and the argument essentially amounts to passing responsibility to other parties.  We in Ontario have a jurisdictional responsibility to protect our own SAR and make decisions on species status based on available information for that species in Ontario.  We cannot rely on the U.S to preserve SAR since we do not know how policies will change in the future.  We must maintain our biodiversity without relying on others.\n4. Proposed Change: F.\tBroaden COSSARO member qualifications to include members who have relevant expertise in ecology, wildlife management, as well as those with community knowledge.\nComment: COSSARO represents the recognized experts on species status in the province.  Only experts with direct knowledge of species under review should be involved in the assessment of species status.  As part of the process of preparing a status report, a comprehensive compilation of information including correspondence with a variety of stakeholders and experts is carried out.\n5. Proposed Change: A.\tDe-couple the listing process from automatic protections and provide greater Minister\u2019s discretion on protections, while keeping the assessment as a science-based process at arm\u2019s length. While the role of classifying species would remain with COSSARO and listing of classified species would continue to be required, the proposed changes would provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species when the following specified criteria are met:\nComment: SAR are designated as such for a reason.  Removing automatic protection for newly listed species is not in keeping with Ontario\u2019s goal of preserving biodiversity.\n6. Proposed Change:  i.\tapplying the prohibitions to the species would likely have significant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario so additional time is required to determine the best approach to protect the species and its habitat;\nComment: What amounts to a \u2018significant\u2019 social or economic implication?  Who determines this?\n7. Proposed Change: ii.\tthe temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario; and\nComment: Who will determine this?  A species status is assessed by COSSARO based on an immediate need for protection for a given species.\n8. Proposed Changes related to 'Creation of Regulatory Charge and Agency'\nComment: Allowing developers to pay to destroy SAR or their habitats should only be used for specific species under specific conditions.  For some species, replication of habitats that could presumably be created through the conservation fund is exceedingly difficult.  The amount required to be paid by developers or individuals must be substantial and the funds must go to stewardship activities that directly benefit SAR in a meaningful way.  I would like to see these funds dedicated to land acquisition, habitat restoration and follow-up monitoring.\n",

The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to the forestry sector.

        "comment":"To Whom it May Concern,\nI am deeply troubled by the recently proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act of Ontario. These changes seem to prioritize development over protecting species at risk, mainly by making it easier and more efficient for large companies to abide by the legislation, and therefore ultimately removing accountability for their actions. Below are a few of the main concerns I have:\n1A: increasing time until species must be listed under the act from 3 to 12 months. If a species has been listed by COSSARO, that means it is in immediate need of conservation action. Extending the listing time effectively makes it easier for companies to fit in projects and continue to harm  species for a full year, by which point significant damage could be done. I urge the government to put more emphasis on the listing process (i.e. to ensure species are properly being listed), rather than weaken the very fabric of the legislation.\n1E: Require COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area: the Endangered Species Act of Ontario is provincial legislation, with the mandate to protect species within the province. Therefore, it seems strange that a species' protections should be dependent on populations outside of Ontario. Furthermore, COSSARO already considers the status of feeder populations in its assessments, and therefore no changes are needed to this part of the legislation. Ontario is home to a variety of rare species at the northern edge of their ranges (e.g. Carolinian species), and the act currently has the power to protect these species. I think this proposed change demonstrates a lack of undrstanding for natural ecology as well as the purpose of conservation legislation.\n4: the Species at Risk Conservation Trust: while no doubt well-intioned, this has disastrous potential. Arguably the largest challenge to natural conservation is not funding, it is a lack of resources. Large development and infrastructure companies must be held accountable for their actions, and they can do this by complying with the current mandate of the act to make efforts to avoid harm and create additional habitat for species at risk. This trust will make it very easy for companies to do what they please without actually having to help protect species at risk; it is simply impossible for one trust to cover all types of conservation problems at a provincial scale. I strongly advise the government to reconsider creating this trust - it will remove accountability from companies that are largely responsible for harming species at risk and seriously undermine the purpose of the legislation.\nI believe that any reasonable inspection of these proposed changes would lead to the conclusion that the government is signifigantly weakening this legislation. Many of these changes are directed to undermine species' protections while making it easier for polluters and habitat-destroyers to further harm species at risk. I truly hope the government will see the potential harm that could be caused through by changes and reconsider their position.\n",

        "comment":"I have  a background in biology and ecology and have taught at an Ontario university for 25 years.  I am very familiar with population ecology, the function of organisms within their communities, and the nature of rarity and strategies for conservation.  I have also been a central participant in a number of important scheduled reviews, such as a Regional government 20-year Official Plan review, 10-year academic department reviews (3 occasions), and  the 25 year review of the largest cooperative education program of any Canadian university (this took one year and about 200 hours of my time).  I have also sat on a Regional government arms-length ecological and environmental advisory committee that was heavily involved in assessing and advising habitat and species protections when development proposals affected legally designated high-quality natural areas.Thus I am very familiar with how effective review processes should be conducted, as well as the specific content of endangered species investigations.\nThis review process is a great disappointment.  It looks like political and developer interests are well entrenched and take precedence over the central concern of conservation of species.  I notice how often the pat phrases of such interests are used: \"modernize\", \"streamline processes\", \"reduce duplication\".  The \"review\" is happening far too quickly and there does not appear to be any opportunity to engage in official hearings or interactive consultations.  It is stated that consultations have occurred, but not with whom.  That should be transparent.  It does not appear to include scientists, conservation organizations, environmental groups, and experts.\n1D  This much Ministerial discretion is dangerous.  (\"Allow the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species where the Minister FORMS THE OPINION based on scientific information that the classification may no longer be appropriate\".)  As far as I know the present Cabinet has no biologist on it.  Also, such important changes require more than just an \"opinion\".\n1E  The requirement to consider a species' condition around its broader geographic area outside Ontario  is concerning.  We are entering a period of profound climate uncertainty and environmental warming. The genetic makeup of organisms at the outer limits of their distribution may represent a suite of adaptive abilities that will be crucial to contend with such changes.\n1F  The makeup of the CASSRO committee, as well as the selection process, are important. What are the present criteria for membership on the committee? What constitutes \"community knowledge\"? I feel it is paramount that the committee include a climate scientist.\n2A  \"Decouple the listing process from automatic protections and provide greater Minister's discretion on protections, while keeping the assessment as a science-based process at arm's length\".  There are several contradictions here.  The minister would be allowed to ignore whatever they want.\n2A  \"provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years\",  if \"the species would likely have significant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario'.  Certainly good studies should be made, but a 3 year suspension could also be a death sentence for an endangered species.\n2C  Remove requirements to develop a habitat regulation proposal for newly-listed species.  Please consider that such habitat regulations will be used to guide decisions not just at the provincial agency level, but - and probably even more often - at the municipal level.\n3D  Remove specific reference to posting under the Environmental Bill of Rights..  NO! That is a very bad move.  Simply putting documents on a government website is too dodgy and subject to political abuse. In Canada we have had the unfortunate experience of the Federal government removing scientific reports from websites, muzzling civil servants and scientists, and obliterating references to climate change, which it found particularly distasteful to its political beliefs.\n4 The regulatory charge.  This is a shocking and shameful proposal.  I've seen the phrase \"pay to slay\" used to describe it.  Unfortunately, it's a vey accurate descriptor.  In my 10 years work with a Regional Ecological and Environmental advisory committee I noticed a consistent positive change in the quality of environmental assessments produced by developers and particularly their ability to design more sophisticated and effective rehabilitation plans.  We should be interested in encouraging such leading-edge corporate capabilities.  Allowing them to simply pay their way out of a conservation problem rather than developing enhanced expertise in problem solving (and by implication developing a competitive corporate advantage) is disturbing and regressive.\n",

Currently, Ontario has seen the extinction\/extirpation of 24 species, with another 243 species listed as Species at Risk.\nThe City of Brampton has identified the following key concerns with the proposed ESA change include:\n\u2022\tNo longer automatically listing species as threatened or endangered that have been determined to be at risk by a committee of scientists;\n\u2022\tChanges to \u201cedge of range\u201d species means considering populations outside of Ontario when listing a species at risk, which will allow Ontario to simply opt out of protecting species at home..  This will result in reduce biodiversity and reduce ecological health of Ontario\u2019s green spaces;\n\u2022\tOpening the scientific committee, Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO), to non-scientist members;\n\u2022\tGiving the Minister the discretion to interfere with the listing of at risk species; and\n\u2022\tPotential downloading of the administration of the ESA to municipalities\nThe City supports the following proposed ESA changes:\n\u2022\tProposed greater notice and transparency regarding the listing of at risk species;\n\u2022\tIntroducing social and economic concerns into COSSARO\u2019s decision making process\n\u2022\tIntroducing pay-to-proceed system on harmful activities.\n\u2022\tTaking a Landscape approach to compensation\nDetailed Comments\nThe proposed changes and City comments are outlined below under five categories:\n1.\tAssessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\n\u2022\tThe City of Brampton agrees with the proposed requirement for an earlier notice of COSSARO species assessment but the City has concern with extending the time before a species is listed to the Species At Risk Ontario (SARO) from 3 to 12 months because this may cause harm to listed species.\n\u2022\tProposed changes to the Act must clarify the scientific framework that would permit the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider a SARO listing.\n\u2022\tThe City is concerned with the proposal to broaden the scope of COSSARO assessment of at risk species to populations outside of Ontario.  This change will allow Ontario to simply opt out of protecting species at home and reduce Ontario\u2019s biodiversity and ecological health of its green spaces.\n\u2022\tThe proposal to broaden COSSARO\u2019s member qualifications to members with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d has the potential for negative and positive outcomes.  The City urges the Province to ensure that COSSARO remains a scientific focused and governed committee by limiting the number members with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d\n2.\tDefining and implementing species and habitat protections\n\u2022\tIn City\u2019s view, de-coupling automatic at risk species protections and greater Ministerial discretion has the potential to harm the protection of endangered species.\n\u2022\tThe City of Brampton is concerned with delaying species and habitat protection for 3 years.  The criteria for delay needs to clearly laid out in the proposed legislation including defining the following terms:\no\t\u201csignificant economic and social impacts:; and\no\t\u201cother criteria that may be specified by regulation\u201d.\n\u2022\tThe Province is proposing to remove the mandatory requirement within strict timelines to develop habitat regulation.  In addition, the proposed revision would allow the Minister to decide not to develop habitat regulations. This proposed changes will have impacts on protecting at risk species .\n\u2022\tThe City of Brampton supports the proposal to enable the Minister, rather than Lieutenant Governor in Council (LGIC) to make species-specific habitat regulations.as it is expected to result in more timely permit approvals.\n3.\tDeveloping species at risk recovery policies\n\u2022\tIt is the City\u2019s view, that should the Minister be given more discretion to extend the timeline for a Government Response Statement, a clear decision making framework needs to be develop to ensure the decision is based on a sound scientific rationale.\n4.\tIssuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\n\u2022\tThe City of Brampton supports the creation of a Species at Risk Conservation Trust as it has the potential to result in greater efficiencies and greater overall benefits to the species.  However, the City would like greater clarity on how these funds will be disperse, ideally, these funds should be required to be spent within the same subwatershed where the impact has occurred.\nThis proposed change closely resembles the City\u2019s West Humber Strategy which takes a sub watershed perspective on impacts and compensation.\n\u2022\tThe City is concerned with the proposed changes to section 18 that may allow ESA authorizations under other legislation (i.e. Planning Act, Environmental Assessment Act).  While the City supports the elimination of duplication, this change has the potential to download some ESA approval responsibilities onto municipalities.\n",

        "comment":"Toronto Zoo Response to the ESA Proposal\nAs an organization that is dedicated to saving species for future generations, we offer the following comments on the proposed changes to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act (ESA). We believe the proposed revisions will have little positive impact on our species at risk and will primarily streamline the process for development without allowing for endangered species to stand in the way.\nIn a province like Ontario, with a large and diverse workforce and ample avenues for business development, environmental protection and economic prosperity should not be mutually exclusive outcomes. We possess the ingenuity to seek business and development opportunities that don\u2019t infringe on the limited wild spaces occupied by Ontario\u2019s threatened species.\nWe took the opportunity to submit comments on the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Discussion Paper\u201d but and would like to reiterate two key points:\n1. Payment options in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities\nWe continue to believe that there is an inherent danger in allowing payments to a conservation fund in lieu of activity-based requirements. This action decouples mitigation for the negative impacts of development from the area the impact occurs. Basic and exploratory research on species is necessary, and we applaud the province for seeking new means to fund it; however, we believe that funds raised to mitigate the impact of development projects should remain tied to the direct impacts of those activities. The proposed changes state that: \u201cThe price for the payment-in-lieu (i.e. regulatory charge) will be within the range of costs that a client would have otherwise incurred through meeting the species-based conditions of an authorization.\u201d If this statement is true, then the end cost to clients would remain the same, and thus this change would be of no impact to development\n2. Delaying the listing of Species at Risk\nDelays throughout the proposed ESA raise many concerns for the future of species and habitat protections in the province. Delaying SARO listing to twelve months following a COSSARO report is unjustified and no reason is mentioned for this delay throughout the proposed bill. Listing species and habitats as critically endangered requires immediate action, and this delay will hinder protection across the province. Furthermore, decoupling of the listing process from automatic protection will directly affect the survivability of critically endangered species that need protection immediately following addition to the SARO List.\nProviding the Minister with the authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years is extremely concerning. It is not only the delay that raises concern, but the criteria that must be met in order for a suspension to occur. For example, a newly listed SAR may be eligible for suspension if prohibitions and protection practices have significant social or economic implications for the province. This is a vague statement that is not clarified within the proposed bill and could lead to a subjective decision to delay the protection of critically endangered habitats and species.\nFinally, extending regulation timelines and Government Response Statement (GRS) timelines will directly affect the implementation of the ESA by environmental organizations to actively protect newly-listed species. Regulations and GRS\u2019s are crucial in planning how to appropriately protect a species in this province, and provides accountability for the government to respond to and act upon protecting a species at risk. Releasing GRS\u2019s in a timely manner also helps conservation organizations to plan mitigation strategies and projects to protect these species. These proposed changes indicate a lack in the sense of urgency in the face of climate change and accelerated worldwide losses in biodiversity.\nIn addition to our previously identified objections, we wanted to draw attention to three additional areas of concern:\n1. Permitting the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider classifications\nWe have issue with allowing the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species where the Minister forms the opinion based on scientific information that the classification may no longer be appropriate. COSSARO is the committee that determines whether a species should be classified as extirpated, endangered, threatened or special concern. This committee is made up of ecologists and wildlife managers, experts in their field, and therefore these classifications are based on scientific evidence. This issue causes concern as the opinion of the Minister (based on unspecified scientific evidence) seems to supersede the reasons for classification determined by COSSARO in the first place.\n2. Considering species conditions outside of Ontario\nThe change proposed in category 1.E to \u201cRequire COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened.\u201d We consider this a particularly concerning amendment that could significantly weaken species protection. Many species have wide geographic ranges and few, if any, species reside exclusively in Ontario. However, even when lower risk populations exist elsewhere, we believe there are compelling reasons to offer strong and appropriate protection to Ontario populations. Ontario should seek to protect its own natural biodiversity irrespective of the actions of other jurisdictions. Regardless of whether a species exists elsewhere, if it declines in Ontario the province\u2019s biodiversity is harmed. For many species, Ontario represents the northern range extent, and in some cases could be called a fringe population to more robust populations further south. However, fringe populations are often an important part of a species\u2019 overall ecology, and can act as \u2018the canary in the coal mine\u2019 with declines in fringe populations illustrating threats with the potential to affect the species as a whole.\n3. The prerequisites for \u201cbroader\u201d COSSARO member qualifications\nThe COSSARO membership is already open to those with expertise in either scientific disciplines or Traditional Knowledge, and the current members represent experts in both ecology and wildlife management. Thus, we are unsure what the statement in category 1.F is intended to include by also adding \u201cthose with community knowledge\u201d to participate in the assessment process. We respect the effort to make this process more inclusive but are equally concerned about the possible dilution of qualified opinions.\nConclusion:\nWe don\u2019t believe that the proposed changes to the ESA reflect the broad interests of the people of Ontario. We strongly hope that the proposed changes to the ESA will be reconsidered and approached with greater consideration of positive outcomes for species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"I wish to thank the Government for allowing me to comment on the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). I am aware there is a need to allow for development across the province, whether it be for housing or business. Such development must be well thought out and complete and full analysis MUST be completed to determine what, if any, impact there would be on the environment and and life forms, including humans, that could or would be negatively impacted by such development. Further, our natural world sustains all life and as such we have an obligation to ensure the on going well being of all living things, whether human, plant, insect, etc. We cannot allow unrestricted use of our lands and properties. As such, many of the proposed changes to the ESA would be a detriment to the natural world and in many instances provide carte blanche to developers to eradicate natural lands and species for the sake of making a dollar...or more.\nThe idea that developers and others to pay into a fund in lieu of completing on the ground repatriation is harmful and will only increase government coffers and not rehabilitate damage habitat.\nTo allow members to be appointed to the COSSARO who do not have adequate expertise in species assessment will do nothing to enhance the work of the COSSARO. To allow the Minister to require the COSSARO to reconsider its science based listing decisions removes the expertise of the COSSARO. Why have such a body of the Minister can wreak havoc over it? Further, the proposal to allow the Minister to have greater discretion on protections, which would include suspending protections for up to three years all without public consultation could lead to the eradication of some species.\nThe ESA cannot be limited to specific geographies or under specific circumstances as this could exclude important habitats from protection. And the allowance of multiple delays for the listing, planning and reporting of species at risk will undermine species recovery.\nDevelopment is necessary to better the lives and conditions for all. But any development must be well thought out and all risks must be, as much as possible and with as much consideration as possible, be sought out and addressed.\nBeing pro business and development is a worthy objective, but not at any cost.\nRespectfully submitted,\n",

        "comment":"Re: City of Kenora Request for Permanent Recognition of the CFSA as an Equivalent Process to ESA by Adopting a Section 55 Regulation into the ESA; Response to ERO Number 013-5033\nPremier Ford, Minister Phillips, and Minister Yakabuski,\nOn behalf of the City of Kenora, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes, ERO number 013-5033. We are eager proponents of efforts to modernize and improve the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We are optimistic that this will result in improved outcomes for species at risk while ensuring Ontario is a place to grow our renewable forest sector, unleash its full potential and provide good-paying jobs for our people. However, the vagueness of the proposed changes does not provide necessary business certainty.\nThe 10th year review of the provincial Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides government with a rare opportunity to chart a course for the next decade and beyond. Political decisions on this will have far-reaching social, economic, and environmental impacts for generations to come. Therefore, the most important action the government must take remains permanent recognition of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) as an equivalent process to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) through Section 55. The CFSA already provides landscape, stand, and site-level direction for managing, conserving, and protecting species at risk. Having two acts attempting to accomplish the same outcome represents the single greatest piece of red tape and duplication to this sector.\nThis is an essential first step to be accomplished in your Government\u2019s legislative changes to the ESA. However, the proposed changes indicate that a Section 18 Regulation will be the authorization process for forestry, instead of a Section 55 Regulation. For the past 10 years, we have consistently asked for a permanent Section 55 Regulation as the authorization process for the forest sector. The former government recognized that the CFSA and the ESA cannot be harmonized and provided a workable, temporary solution that was defended in court.  We are asking the Ford Government to take this workable, temporary solution and make it permanent.\nWe are asking that you revise the proposed legislative ESA changes to acknowledge that Section 55 will be the authorization mechanism for forest operations on Crown lands. Instead, the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) appears to be pursuing a revised section 18 \u201charmonization\u201d instrument which is at odds with our request. This bold move, like your support for other industries and activities with the Species at Risk Conservation Trust, would send a positive message to the forest sector and the City of Kenora for which the forestry industry is a major economic driver.\nIn addition to this critical revision, it also remains necessary to ensure the following requirements be embedded in a new, modernized ESA:\n1.\tConsideration of climate change on habitat in all species at risk policy\n2.\tCumulative impact of all species at risk policy on a healthy economy\n3.\tSocio-economic impact analysis must be completed and shared with impacted stakeholders and First Nations prior to any species at risk policy being implemented\nThe sector will continue to operate under the CFSA which, by law, requires, forestry operations to follow an approved forest management plan. Guides delivered under the CFSA include operational prescriptions and conditions, which may include reserves, modified operations, or specific conditions on road use and construction in the area near a species at risk and their habitat.\nSince the establishment of the ESA, the City of Kenora has supported efforts to drive long-term certainty within Ontario\u2019s forest sector so as to create sustainable northern and rural communities. In order to avoid catastrophic socio-economic impacts, we need permanent, legislative recognition that the CFSA is an equivalent process to the ESA, while developing workable species at risk policy. It is our expectation that these required changes will be made and adopted into the new ESA legislation that you are passing.\nWe would be happy to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the best path forward to ensuring positive outcomes for species at risk while keeping people in this province working.\n",

        "comment":"The following comments have also been submitted as a PDF letter signed by:\nRod Regier - Commissioner, Planning, Development & Legislative Services\nRE: \t10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes (ERO Registry Number 013-5033)\nDear Public Input Coordinator:\nOn April 18, 2019, the Province posted the document titled \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d to the Environmental Registry of Ontario for a 30-day comment period. The following are comments from Regional staff on the proposed changes to the Act. These comments will be included as part of a Council Report that will be submitted to the Province as comments on Bill 108, More Homes, More Choice Act, 2019.\nOntario\u2019s Endangered Species Act\nStaff has reviewed the Province\u2019s proposed changes to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act (ESA) with respect to:\n- Enhancing the Province\u2019s oversight and enforcement powers to ensure compliance with the Act;\nImproving transparent notification of new species\u2019 listings;\n- Ensuring appropriate consultation with academics, communities, organizations and Indigenous peoples across Ontario on species at risk recovery planning; and,\n- Creating new tools to streamline approval processes, reduce duplication and ensure costs incurred by clients are directed towards actions that will improve outcomes for the species or its habitat.\nWhile the proposed changes to the Endangered Special Act are meant to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Act, there are publically stated concerns that:\n- Species listed as threatened or endangered may no longer be automatically protected;\n- There will be increased opportunity for political interference in the listing process;\n- Developers and other activity proponents will be able to pay into a fund to compensate for harming species at risk and their habitats, rather than providing an on-the-ground overall benefit to species; and\n- Southern Ontario species at the northern limit of their range may receive less or no protection, depending on their status outside Ontario.\nThe Region relies on the Province to effectively require the identification and protection of significant species and their habitat.  Over the past 10 years a great deal of knowledge has be gained on the health and vulnerability of Ontario\u2019s species at risk, and the challenges and opportunities experienced while planning for their ongoing protection and conservation.\nThe system-wide changes being proposed by the Province reflect frustrations that are a result of a relatively young policy framework and practise, coupled with increasingly high development pressures.  A balanced long-term approach will be necessary to ensure that the planning and development decisions made in the present do not prohibit conservation opportunities in the future. Ontario must remain committed to protecting its biodiversity, including Ontario\u2019s most vulnerable plants and animals, and their important habitats.\nOption to pay\nProposed changes to the Endangered Special Act would allow developers and other proponents to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground compensation.\nThe conservation of habitats and species in-situ is fundamental to the long-term effectiveness of conservation efforts.  Having the option to pay, instead of actively conserve, will result in the incremental loss of critical habitat and individual lifeforms, and will limit the overall research and conservation potential for the species at risk. The Region acknowledges that there are circumstances where a broader research-based approach to addressing a particular threat to a species is needed.  Funding, from a development related source such as the proposed \u201cConservation Trust\u201d, could be construed as being able to \u201cpay to slay\u201d.  An alternative source of funds must be found to enable that important work to be undertaken.\nRecommendation\nThe Province should prioritize in-situ conservation, with very strict criteria for opting out.  In addition, the Province should continue to support proactive species at risk research with funding that is not directly related to development.\nNon-science-based influence\nThe Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) is a committee comprised of qualified scientists who perform science-based assessments of whether a species is at risk. The Province is proposing to broaden COSSARO membership so that it includes those with \u201ccommunity knowledge or aboriginal traditional knowledge\u201d. The proposed changes would also enable the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider its science-based listing decisions, and removes the current requirement that the Minister consult with an independent expert prior to creating certain regulations or issuing permits.\nAboriginal traditional knowledge is an important addition to COSSARO. Community knowledge is a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have adequate expertise in species assessment or have a differing agenda.\nRecommendation\nThe Province should include Aboriginal traditional knowledge, and better define \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d so that is as apparent what value the additional member(s) would be binging to the Committee. In addition, the Province should continue to rely on scientific expertise as a sound foundation for decision making.\n\u201cEdge of range\u201d species and protection limitations\nThe Province is proposing a change that would require COSSARO to base its assessments not on the status of a species in Ontario, but instead on its status throughout its range. For example, southern Ontario endangered species at the northern limit of their range may receive less or no protection, depending on their status outside Ontario. The Minister would also be able to limit Endangered Species Act protections so that they apply only in specific geographies or under specific circumstances.\nProtecting species that inhabit geographies that do not conform to political boundaries will always be a challenge. In light of climate change, it will be increasingly important to protect healthy species populations at their northern limits to help species adapt to changing climatic conditions. As result, we believe the Provincial assessment process of a species\u2019 status must be a science-based and taken from a long-term, risk-averse and apolitical perspective.\nThe provincial assessment process must also ensure that geographic or circumstantial protections would not arbitrarily allow for the exclusion of important habitats and species from protection. It should also ensure that decisions regarding endangered species prioritize environmental benefits, over other potential social and economic benefits.\nRecommendations\nThe Provincial assessment process for endangered species should continue to be science-based, and taken from a long-term, risk-averse and apolitical perspective. This process should ensure that geographic or circumstantial protections do not arbitrarily allow for the exclusion of important habitats and species from protection. Any decisions regarding endangered species should prioritize environmental benefits over other potential social and economic benefits.\nListing and protection delay\nThe proposed process is to list species nine months after COSSARO makes its assessments public.  Listing of species at risk would no longer result in automatic protections for threatened and endangered species and their habitats.  The Minister would have greater \u201cdiscretion on protections\u201d including the ability to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years based on social or economic considerations. Such delays would be exempted from Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) posting and consultation requirements.\nStaff do not support this proposed change. Introducing a nine month delay in protection after a species at risk is listed is counter intuitive. It also increases the risk of vulnerable plants, animals and their habitats being eliminated before protections are in place.  Once it has been determined that a species is vulnerable, the consideration and timely implementation of protective measures is a logical next step.\nProperty-owners are investing in a Province where protecting the natural environment has been identified as a priority. Protecting threatened and endangered species is a responsibility shared by all and must become an ingrained and expected part of the planning and development process.  Elimination of EBR consultation requirements, coupled with delays in protections, may result in development that does not adequately fulfil Provincial priorities.\nRecommendation\nThe Province should not proceed with its proposed nine month gap between the COSSARO assessments and listing, nor the decoupling of listing with automatic protection, as these proposed changes would increase the risk of vulnerable plants, animals and their habitats being eliminated before protections are in place. EBR consultation requirements should be maintained.\nMulti-site authorizations and other approvals\nThe Province is proposing to create \u201clandscape agreements\u201d for proponents undertaking activities in multiple locations, and wants to allow activities approved under other laws to be carried out without any additional authorizations under the Endangered Species Act.\nWe acknowledge and agree that landscape agreements may provide opportunities for additional positive outcomes for endangered species.  However, to ensure they are effective, such agreements must prioritize conservation over economic and social factors, and be implemented to address the full scope of site-specific and species-specific concerns.\nWith respect to the use of instruments under other Acts to protect species at risk, the Province should carefully consider how best to manage long-term impacts to species and habitats, and any potential risks that may be associated with allowing permanent Endangered Species Act exemptions under other laws (e.g., the forestry industry).\nRecommendations\na)\tThe Province should revise its proposed approach to landscape agreements to prioritize conservation over economic and social factors, and ensure that such agreements address the full scope of site-specific and species-specific concerns; and\nb)\tIn considering the use of instruments under other Acts to protect species at risk, the Province should adopt an approach that best manages long-term impacts to species and habitats, and any potential risks that may be associated with allowing permanent Endangered Special Act exemptions under other laws (i.e., forestry industry).\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act.\n",

        "comment":"I am concerned about the changes to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act. We are the most densely populated province with the highest concentration of endangered species. If there is any province that needs evidence-based decision making it would be Ontario. Development and conservation are not mutually exclusive. We just need to be smarter about how and where we develop and how we plan to restore or mitigate this impact. I am concerned about the short sightedness of some of the changes being made to the Act.\n1) I am concerned about the development of a land trust instead of the requirement to do protection activities. Recovery and conservation need to be priorities, and this should focus on the habitat that was disturbed. Many of these species having a fidelity to their habitat, and so offsetting habitat elsewhere will not produce an equivalent benefit. I am also concerned about the loose language that funds are \u201creasonably likely to support the protection and recovery of these species\u201d. This allows for too vague of an interpretation of what actions need to be taken.\n2) I am concerned about abandoning the \u201cedge of range\u201d species. With climate change the genetic diversity of these northern populations will become more important with the northern migration of species.\n3) I am concerned about changes that limit protections, veto protections, bypass ESA requirements and bypass consultations. Critical habitat ought to be critical habitat regardless of who or what is being proposed.\n4) I am concerned about the delays in the listing and changing of status of SAR that is proposed to occur. We ought to be adapting to the problem on a time scale that is representative of the problem and not delay listings by up to 5 years. Assessing species that may be at risk takes time while often that species status continues to decline. By the time COSSARO presents a status report to the minister recommending listing that species is AT RISK and action needs to be taken immediately (or should've been taken much sooner). Suspending and postponing protections to that species will allow that species to continue to decline while it awaits the protections it deserves and desperately needs. Therefore, any temporary suspension to species and habitat protections  for some newly-listed species when specified criteria are met, would automatically not be able to meet criteria ii \"the temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario\". This criteria essentially prevents the suspensions from being possible but including it creates ambiguity and room for uninformed and reckless decisions by people who are insufficiently educated in the subject matter.\n",

        "comment":"Overall, I am against these amendments to the Endangered Species Act. In total, they reduce the protections for endangered species.\nSpecifically, I oppose the new section 16.1 which allows the Minister to enter into landscape agreements with persons to (i.e corporations) to mitigate their destructive activity upon a habitat of a particular species by supporting somehow another species. That is counter to protecting the species that would be harmed by the development. It makes no sense to claim that by assisting species X while ruining species y is a positive outcome.\nThe change to consider number of particular species outside Ontario in determining whether a species merits protection is an affront to the people of Ontario. The objective of the Endangered Species Act is to provide protection to wildlife in Ontario. This is so that the people of Ontario can continue to enjoy the animals, birds, fish, insects and plants that are native to our province. Why should I have to go to another province or to the States to see a Canada warbler, bobolink, least bittern or a peregrine falcon among many other birds, not to mention the numerous other creatures and plant life that ought to have sanctuary in Ontario?\nThe new ability for the Minister to defer listing a species for 12 months instead of 3 is wrong.\nThis set of changes appears to reduce protections of our wildlife in order to facilitate the building of new housing and other building activities. There is more than enough land in our huge province for housing and other infrastructure without reducing habitats for our valuable wildlife.\nStart over and this time treat wildlife and the people of Ontario both with the respect they deserve.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act 2007 have been broadly outlined into five categories in the ERO propopsal. I have specific issues with some of the proposed changes, and have itemized them according to the five categories.\n1.Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\n-The proposed changes to the listing of species on the SARO List (namely, earlier notification to the public with increased lag between notification and addition to the list) will not strengthen the protection of species at risk and should not be enacted. The functional application of this proposal warns people who might need to remove potentially protected habitat\/species earlier and gives more time to enact that need.\n-The proposed changes around considering a species' broader geographical condition is more likely to weaken a species' protection in Ontario, and should not be enacted. The reason Ontario has an Endangered Species Act is to protect Ontario's species at risk, and this is not achieved by considering a species conservation concern in other regions, such as other provinces, nationally or internationally.\n2.Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\n-The proposed changes regarding de-coupling the listing process from automatic protection for up to three years does not strengthen the protection of species at risk in Ontario. If a species is listed, but its habitat\/species protection is not in force for a three year review period, there is no meaning to the species being listed. COSSARO has already justified why it needs protection by having it listed, and delaying the force of the protection under any circumstance to determine a species-appropriate habitat\/species protections is redundant.\n3.Developing species at risk recovery policies\n-The proposal that recovery strategies are advice and the Government Response Statements will be policy is not likely to strengthen protection of species at risk. This proposal allows the government to ignore the scientifically based recommendations for any reason.\n-The proposed changes to allow for extended timlines for review of progress towards protection and recovery will not increase the protection of species at risk in Ontario. The greater lag between submission of and response to recovery strategies, in tandem with the other proposed changes to the ESA 2007 regarding timing of protections, allows more time for the destruction of species at risk and their habitats.\n4.Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements, and developing regulatory exemptions\n-The proposed creation of a Regulatory Charge and Agency will not strengthen the protection of species at risk in Ontario. This entire approach simplifies a very complex issue that affects all residents of Ontario. There is nothing redeemable about this proposal. Paying fines is not acceptable - no one bred or built the species at risk or their habitats, and so paying to destroy them is not equal restitution. Further, these natural features cannot be recreated and are invaluable because of that.\nIn summary, as an Ontarian - a resident, father, taxpayer, and business owner -I am generally not in favour of the intent of any of the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act 2007. None of the proposed changes stregthens protection of species at risk in Ontario. These changes instead weaken the Act such that most species at risk and their habitats could be destroyed before my children have time to enjoy and benefit from them. Our human existence is more dependent on the diversity around us than this government knows, and the proposed changes reflect that ignorance. These changes are not for the people, they are not even for the birds! These changes to the ESA must not be enacted.\n",

        "comment":"I do not support the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act. Firstly, habitat is *the* most important factor in protecting Ontario's biodiversity. Allowing development to continue by paying into a conservation fund is absurd (Yes, even for species like the butternut tree). No amount of conservation funds can bring back vital habitat. Not all habitat is equal. If an area is already supporting species at risk, developing it and saving another random section of habitat is not an equal exchange. Furthermore, I strongly believe in protecting local biodiversity. \"Considering\" the status of species at a global scale is unhelpful for 1) protecting the biodiversity of Ontario 2) protecting the species as a whole. Many local populations of animals have adaptations tot local environments that help them persist. If these populations are lost, those adaptations are lost forever. Local adaptation will be incredibly important as the climate continues to change, and many species are pushed out of their fundamental niche. Lastly, ANY delay to the protection of listed species is inexcusable. For many animals, 3 years of delay, and any habitat degradation or mortality that occurs in those 3 years, could spell disaster for the species. It already takes many years to collect the required data to have a species listed. I implore the ministry to consider the statements of conservation organizations and wildlife biologists. I have seen first hand how difficult it is to enforce the ESA as it is; any weakened version would be disastrous.\n",

No doubt the developers will spend heavily to get the minister's attention and then to persuade him to allow the habitat destruction and this will open the door to corruption and disgrace, not to mention harmful to the prospects for species in Ontario.\nThis is a retrograde proposal that will reduce our natural heritage as well as the reputation of the Conservative Government.

Species at risk need our ADDITIONAL protection and a reduction of protection is opening the door for permanent loss of diversity. A loss that can never be recovered.\nThe proposed changes to the ESA would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals -  which is completely contrary to Ontario's responsibility to our future and our future security.\nDiversity matters! Time after time we have witnessed the destruction of habitat from which we cannot recover.\nChanges which would allow ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based endangered species listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. As a resident of Ontario I do not support allowing a political process supersede the needs of the environment and our responsibilities to protect endangered species.\nShort sighted \"gain\" will result in long time, Irreversible loss for our Province.\nIntroducing a \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme is disgusting and irresponsible. Money does NOT trump our environment! This type of thinking is in fact jepordizing our future prosperity.

        "comment":"I'm writing to share my extreme concern for the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act in Ontario.  At a time when we are losing countless species (some estimates at the million species mark, or up to 60% of our plants and animals), we must take greater action to save them rather than fewer.  I appreciate the need for businesses to succeed and grow and create the infrastructure or other items that Ontario relies on, but it must not be at the extent of our natural infrastructure, our natural environment, and all that lives within it.  The proposed changes may sound good in sound bites, or in bullet point, but when you get into the details, you realize that all is not well.\nI work in species conservation, and have done research that has shown a severe decrease in bumble bee populations, including the American bumble bee (which is only found in Ontario and a small part of Quebec for it's Canadian range) that my data shows is critically endangered in large part due to human efforts.  I have also done research that shows how little we do know about our endangered plants and pollinators; even when we do have species listed as at-risk, we often don't know how to recover them, and what their interactions on the landscape involve.\nDestroying a plot of land that is home to an endangered species in one area is not ok, even if another piece of land is created or designated elsewhere - this may be well outside the range of the animal, doesn't have the same connectedness on the landscape as the original spot, may result in 'death by a thousand cuts', and so on.  Even 'transplanting' the species doesn't work - does it have it's pollinators\/special fungal associations\/specific host plants\/specific food sources\/mates, etc in the new area?  So frequently we don't consider the true impact of our actions - lives and species are not simple abstracts.\nSimilarly, paying into a 'fund' for 'research' is not an acceptable alternative for killing or otherwise harming species.  Yes, we need more research, but there's not point doing research on something that is dead and gone, or that is even more fragmented.  The more individuals of a species that exist, the wider gene pool that exists, and the more areas that a species occurs in, the more chance of survival it has.  Species are under so many threats these days - and with climate change in particular, it's just going to get worse.  They need to have as much diversity and resilience as possible to survive.\nWe also need to focus on species in Ontario specifically and not brush off declines here as unimportant if the species exists elsewhere.  Using the example of climate change again, species at the northern edges of their ranges often have genetic differences and\/or adaptations that may allow them to survive coming changes.  Perhaps a species is common in one area now, but that could change, especially if we don't value them; losing whole chunks of their range will not be a benefit.  We need to protect and enhance these species, and not \"write them off\".  As well, if everyone \"passed the buck\" to someone else, nothing would happen.\nThe committee that evaluates species to see what their conservation status is in Ontario (COSSARO) needs to remain independent of all external influences, and remain science based.  After the science is evaluated, then the views of others, like businesses, can be accounted for.  Allowing other views, such as those by foresters intent on cutting down a forest for profit, or engineers with aggregate companies, or developers looking to make a subdivision, on the committee will detract from this non-political goal.\nThe timelines can not be changed for listing.  We have seen in the federal level that species assessed as at-risk of extinction languish for years before they get protection in many cases.  Even at the provincial level this can be delayed.  And while it sounds good to get more input, our species are disappearing.  Inaction of even a few years could result in their loss.  I have seen this first hand with bumble bees - in the time to do the research, publish the results, get the committee to assess the species, get the government to enact legislation, they have disappeared from Ontario.  Status reports and their associated recovery strategies are key tools for conservation groups to take action with, and are often necessary for funding to be accessed as well for conservation activities.  Without a formal assessment, there is also no legal protection.  Again, we should be speeding this up, not slowing the process down.\nYes, we need to reduce red tape,  but not in the way that is planned.  Let's get rid of the loop holes in the current legislation and make it stronger and clearer: thou shalt not kill endangered species, thou shalt not delay the process of listing species, thou shalt not let short-term business interests overrule our precious ecosystems; let's have a clear and easy process to follow and not lots of hoops to jump through.\nExtinction is forever.  It's not just a phrase or a meme to be passed off as a motherhood statement.  It is a cold hard fact.  We have a social and moral obligation to try to prevent the extinction of species, as well as any other decrease in populations, especially when we as a species have been causing it.  This era is not considered the \"Anthropocene\" and the sixth mass species extinction event for all the great work humans have been doing for the environment!   We need to take action now and increase the strength of the ESA for our future planet's inhabitants.\n",

I strongly oppose the changes that are being considered. They will not improve outcomes for species at risk. On the contrary, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. This will not benefit the citizens of Ontario.\nMore specifically, I do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Nor do I support the proposed changes that would allow developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats. Conservation banking would require extensive study and review to be successful, and the time lag associated with implementing projects of value would not keep pace with the destruction of species and their habitats.  Basing the protection of species on a global population, not a provincial population, not only ignores the impacts that climate change will have on species movements, with southern species needing to move north to survive, it also relies  on assuming other countries are providing an appropriate level of protection to species, which the United States is not.\nMany of the concerns expressed about the Endangered Species Act are not with the legislation, but with implementation. Continuing cuts to the ministries that enact these laws only increases wait times. Improving outcomes for species at risk requires enforcement, not weakening, of the law. It also requires investment in stewardship, not writing off species at risk and their habitats as red tape. The habitat that these species rely on provide countless benefits to the citizens of Ontario, including clean air, clean water, flood mitigation, and other ecosystem services. Development at any cost is not what the people of Ontario have asked for.\nGiven that the changes to the Endangered Species Act have been included in Bill 108: More Homes More Choices Act, the following quote seems appropriate to consider.\n\"We consider species to be like a brick in the foundation of a building. You can probably lose one or two or a dozen bricks and still have a standing house. But by the time you've lost 20 per cent of species, you're going to destabilize the entire structure. That's the way ecosystems work.\"\n",

The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts.

        "comment":"Bill 108 Schedule 5 and the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act are set to leave our most vulnerable species and ecosystems without adequate protection. While the proposed changes are framed as ways to improve efficiencies and provide \u201cbest-in-class\u201d protection for species at risk, this is highly misleading: these changes would instead be massive steps backward and pose real threats to already threatened species.\nWe need to take action to strengthen, not weaken, our current protection. Many of the supposed challenges this proposal aims to address could be remedied through improved implementation of the Act, not through undermining it. Instead of adding more exemptions, the time is now to repeal the 2013 exemptions and strengthen the Act back to its original gold-standard. The United Nations recently released a deeply troubling report warning that over one million species are facing extinction over the next decade. This accelerated and \u201cunprecedented\u201d rate of extinction is driven by inaction over climate change, habitat destruction for development, overfishing, pollution, and invasive species. These are all human-caused problems with human solutions. Beyond recognising that biodiversity has its own intrinsic value, we rely on it for our clean drinking water, for the food we eat, and the air we breathe. Green infrastructure provides billions of dollars of ecosystem services that often go unrecognized until they are lost. A massive conservation effort is needed now and we do not have time for this government's inaction and destructive policy change.\n1. Do not instate the Species at Risk Conservation Trust. This will only make it easier for industry and development to move forward and this is inconsistent with the Endangered Species Act.  Protection and recovery must be the priority. The description that these funds would go towards activities that are \"reasonably likely\" to support protection is concerning. We need strong protection and confident language in this Act. The Minister should also not have discretion as to how and where these funds are spent: these should always be science-based decisions. The fact that these changes are proposed to give \"greater certainty to business\" speaks volumes.\n2. Do not open up COSSARO to \"community knowledge\". This is inviting corruption . We do not want to see those with inadequate expertise making decisions that will affect the protection or extinction of species at risk. Science-based assessments are critical. Do not allow the Minister to interfere with the listing of species at risk.\n3. Do not base the assessments on the status of a species throughout its range. This is Ontario's Endangered Species Act. This change would affect the majority of species at risk in Ontario. The genetic diversity of the plants and animals living here will be critical as species migrate with climate change, as these individuals are best adapted to the northern conditions. If we are completely careless with the habitat now, the populations moving north will suffer in the future too.\n4. Do not allow the Minister to have so much discretion and ability to meddle. Do not decouple automatic listing and species protection. The proposed changes invite weak oversight, less transparency, and self-regulation subject to political whims and the influence of powerful lobbyists. The ESA already allows the Minister to request a review of a COSSARO decision if credible scientific information indicates the listing is not appropriate. Maintain mandatory habitat protection without Ministerial discretion.\n5. Do not create landscape agreements. This does not address site-specific or species-specific concerns and presents unwarranted additional risk of species already in peril.\n6. Do not allow activities to avoid the ESA thanks to any other authorizations. We do not want to see permanent exemptions for industries like the forestry or mining sectors. Repeal the exemptions from O. Reg. 242\/08 and strengthen the ESA. As habitat loss and degradation are the primary factors threatening species, this is a dangerous precedent with the added hazard of reduced accountability.\n7.  Continue to require that the Minister consults with an independent expert prior to creating regulations that would jeopardize the survival of a species, or issuing permits for harmful activities that would provide a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario.\n8. Do not allow for the multiple proposed delays to the listing and reporting timeline. With the accelerated extinction rate brought to light in the new UN report, we do not have the time for this.\nEndangered species and climate change should be taken seriously. The time is now to take action, not undermine existing legislation.\n",

        "comment":"This proposal is extremely concerning. Ontario is lucky enough to be home to a wide range of fauna and flora species. Unfortunately, many of these species are at risk, and until now the Endangered Species Act has done a good job protecting these species and their habitats. That being said, these proposed changes will result in irreversible damage. These animals are important to their ecosystems, and therefore to us. When you lose a keystone species because you allow developers to pay into a fund rather than actually protect the animals, a ripple effect occurs, and humans will lose services we rely on. Ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water filtration, and pollination are dependent on key plant and animal species. For that reason, among others, this proposal is incredibly short sighted and will end up costing the public more money in the long run.\nAllowing developers to pay into a fund rather than investing in habitat restoration or mitigation techniques is absurd. The Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario is made up of qualified, expert scientists for a reason. Opening this to \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d is not appropriate. Scientists spend years learning about the precise requirements of species at risk. These intricacies are not easily understood and cannot be accounted for with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d. Healthy populations at the northern limit of a species range are critical and will become more important as climate change forces species to move North. Automatic protections are necessary to avoid economic and social bias. We have to prioritize protection of our natural resources in many cases. We cannot get a species or ecosystem back once we destroy it, I cannot stress this enough. Ministerial interference is extremely problematic.\nEssentially, the proposal you have made is disappointing, ineffective, and infuriating. This government has continuously put things that Ontarians care about at risk, whether that is vulnerable animals or vulnerable humans. I urge you to either leave the Endangered Species Act as it is, or truly make it better, rather than destroying it.\n",

In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"Many of the proposed changes will have detrimental effects on Ontario's species at risk. It is critical to ensure that in making decisions, the safeguarding of these sensitive species is top priority - overall biodiversity, and in fact many individual species at risk specifically, have huge impacts - both direct and indirect - on humans in a social, health, and economic sense. Therefore, while it may seem intuitive to prioritize humans having to change as little as possible within this legislation, the resulting damage to society will be far worse.\nThe purpose of listing and enacting protections for species at risk within the current time frame is to ensure rushed, \"last minute\" actions with adverse effects are not taken. Extending this window does not help - in fact, it encourages a mindset of \"how much time you have left to act a certain way\" rather than simply learning to act better because you have to. Similarly, increasing length of notice for these protections is the same - this is specifically significant for species that may be listed as at risk because of hunting and poaching. Larger \"reminders\" or \"notices\" essentially provides a timeline to say \"get as much as you can now\".\nAs someone who studies ecology, I know firsthand that the natural world can be unpredictable and it runs on its own timeline, not ours. Therefore, it is essential that ecological issues, especially those as significant as species at risk, are protected and acted upon as quickly as possible - ideally, as soon as you realize something is wrong. By making all new listings occur within a set time frame, this significantly reduces the response time. Ecology requires a fine balance; as more time goes by problems get exponentially more difficult to solve, sometimes becoming completely irreparable. As such, immediate protection of all listed species is essential. Moreover, the Minister, who may or may not know ANYTHING about ecology or a given species, should not be able to simply suspend a species' protection. This, along with giving the Minister authority to extend deadlines for SAR listing or publications is only opening the window for the continuation of harmful actions that threaten the specific species. Again, time is a significant factor, and it does not make sense to \"suspend\" the protection provided by the listing unless the species has recovered substantially enough to be considered a healthy, self-sustaining population to the point where it no longer ecologically makes sense to have them listed. It is not reasonable to go off of the criteria that suspension of protection will not have adverse effects on it's survival within Ontario, as obviously there are threats to its survival in Ontario which have led to its listing in the first place.\nAdditionally, the entire purpose of the SAR listing is to provide protection to these species through the ESA and scientific research. To remove these protections, whether literally by allowing some species to be exceptions, or indirectly by making it easier for companies and individuals to be able to dismiss or forgo them completely negates this purpose. Species at risk require our protection - often because of the actions that we seek to continue; only once a species is recovered should these limitations be lifted. While of course it is essential to protect individuals of a species themselves, it is also extremely important to protect their habitat. It is very ineffective to displace or relocate species and alter or remove their former habitat - although it \"protects\" the species, more often than not it just kills them more slowly, as they will instead die of lack of resources, disorientation, or in trying to return to their former habitat. Many species have excellent homing ability (the ability to get themselves back to their home\/habitat) and high site fidelity (meaning they consistently return to the same location for things like hunting, overwintering, breeding, etc). Again, this means that in protecting a species, it is critical that their habitat is included and should not be subject to additional lenience when enforcing the act.\nWhen it comes to exceptions for following the ESA, the proposed amendments are essentially short-cuts for companies to ignore protected species. There should be MANDATORY consultation with approved expert consultants in regards to a complete list of all relevant species and how each of them will be affected - importantly, this should NOT, under any circumstances, be able to be overruled by the Minister. There is no reason to forgo this step. Additionally, money is not an acceptable replacement for adverse affects on sensitive species; all permit holders that are determined to need to continue acting despite possible or known harm to a species at risk should be required to provide suitable alternative compensation for that species as approved by relevant consultants. This could include alternative habitat, alternative site restoration, or other actions as appropriate.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\nThe planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations and these proposed changes will actively work against this goal.\nThe main purpose of the ESA should be to protect species, not to expedite development. Any changes to the ESA should be made with great care, as without diligent legislation there is a risk of additional habitat loss and population declines. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extirpated from Ontario, and such losses to our natural heritage are unacceptable in the face of so many other unmitigated threats to biodiversity.\nThe public should be notified quickly of COSSARO\u2019s species\u2019 assessments, and the listing should be immediate. Waiting one year after the species is listed could result in harmful effects on the species. We must stress that a lot of these species, particularly amphibians and reptiles, are already facing rapid declines, so immediate protection is strongly recommended.\nI also strongly disagree with the possible suspension of listings for up to three years, as such long delays could allow large developments and lack of mitigation, potentially wiping out populations of species before protection is enacted. Furthermore, Threatened and Endangered species should have expedited, not delayed, Habitat Regulations, as these species are especially vulnerable.\nThe current proposal calls for including those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d \u2013 a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have unbiased expertise in species assessment or that have a different agenda altogether. I still strongly oppose that the minister should be able to overrule decisions made by COSSARO, as such veto power explicitly undermines the arms-length scientific approach that is supposed to be used to assess species. COSSARO assessments are based on IUCN criteria that have been refined over many decades, and the majority of COSSARO's assessments have already been fully vetted through the federal listing process (COSEWIC), which includes significant peer review from provincial and federal governments, stakeholders, ATK, biologists and taxa specialists.\nI also strongly oppose COSSARO being required to base its assessments on the status of a species throughout its range, as opposed to in Ontario only. For species that have a small portion of their range in Ontario, these populations often present unique adaptations and reservoirs of genetic variation, facilitating resilience to climate change. Loss of our Ontario populations means loss of global diversity in the species.\nAllowing species to be wiped out in Ontario simply because they occur elsewhere is short-sighted and not indicative of the values placed on Ontario\u2019s natural heritage by residents of the province. Furthermore, SAR play an important role in our local ecosystems, and as species diversity declines, so does the overall health of our natural areas. Ontario will likely become an important region to safeguard populations as the impacts of climate change worsen; this potential cannot be overstated.\nFinally, Ontario must never rely on neighbouring provinces and countries to protect SAR. This passes the responsibility and control on to others, and shows Ontario\u2019s lack of interest in protecting its biodiversity. Ontario residents have widely embraced the protection of SAR, and have provided countless volunteer hours to ensure their protection and recovery. The proposed changes will quickly negate those efforts, as species will lose the protection and the heightened awareness provided by listing, and lost funding opportunities that often provide the minimum requirement to get volunteer efforts started.\nThe Species at Risk conservation trust could be a powerful tool under some circumstances, but there is great room for such a program to be abused. This trust could allow for areas facing development to be developed by simply paying into the trust as opposed to protecting the resident species at risk.\nThe proposed changes include amending the act to strike out \u201cthe environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d and substituting \u201ca website maintained by the Government of Ontario\u201d. Such a change would mean that the opportunity for public input is lost. Removing opportunities for public input eliminates government accountability to the public and prevents the public to participate in the protection and recovery of SAR.\nLastly, I agree that better enforcement is necessary to protect SAR. There is a strong need for enforcement of the ESA through fines and if necessary, incarceration. Increasing SAR protections and enforcement would also create needed jobs in the environmental sector.\nThe purposes of the ESA are:\n1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.\n3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.\nI believe that the proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA and actively works against them. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. I strongly believe we need to reconsider the proposed changes and further consult with the public and qualified professionals, to use a collaborative and transparent approach to responsible development, while also protecting SAR.\n",

I will summarize my main concerns below.\n1. Burying the proposed changes within a housing omnibus bill is disingenuous and disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of Ontario citizens who support good conservation and environmental practices.  It seems that the government's agenda (open for business) is driven in this case by land speculators, developers and the construction industry who have successfully lobbied the Progressive  Conservative party in order to let them do an end run around scientific best practices for species conservation.  Is Schedule 5 of Bill 108 the payback price the PC party is happy to pay to Ontario Proud and the businesses that were financial contributors to the party's election victory in 2017?\n2. Ministerial discretion is being introduced or expanded in the proposed ESA. This strips away any pretext of scientific objectivity from the listing or protection of species which is currently based on best practices.  Ministers are subject to interference and compromises in their duties, particular when officials in the Premier's office are calling the shots and micro-managing many aspects of the Ministry operations.\n3. The fee-in-lieu fund in section 20 (\"Pay to Pave\") is a blatant get-out-of-jail card for industry to proceed with wholesale destruction of habitat in exchange for token financial penalty. I live in the eastern GTA (Durham Region), and have seen multiple housing developments in the area that cut and bulldoze first - they treat modest fines as a cost of doing business that they just pass on to the home buyers. The proposed fee-in-lieu fund is unnecessary, and instead real financial penalties should be enforced for violation of the ESA as it exists today (I understand they are rarely enforced currently, and when fines are levied they are inconsequential).\n4. I do not believe the government's claims that the changes to the ESA buried in Bill 108 will have any significant impact on improving affordability or availability of housing stock in the province. This is simply a sneaky attempt to weaken protection of Ontario's current and future endangered species in order to reduce cost and inconvenience to the land speculation, development and building industries.\n",

I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

Decisions should be left with the scientific experts not put in the hands of politicians who do not have expertise in the subject.\nOnce a species at risk is listed it and the threatened or endangered species and its habitat. The Minister should not have the power to pick and choose what species and what habitats should be protecting and when. Giving the Minister this discretion would provide too much opportunity for interference from developers and lobbyists, protection of the environment, and wildlife should not be subject to political whim and economic pressure.\nESA protections should not be limited to apply only in specific geographies or under specific circumstances. If a species of habitat is to be protected it should be protected everywhere and under all circumstances. If you must limit protections than it should be on a case by case basis, that needs to be approved by COSSARO.\nCOSSARO should base its assessments on the status of a species in Ontario, not on its status throughout its range. As an Ontarian I am concerned with seeing the extirpation of species from our province. If CASSARO has to base its assessment of the entire range a species we may see the disappearance of the unique species (or their habitats) from Ontario because they are not threatened in other areas of the continent. This is especially concerning in the face of climate change because healthy species populations are needed at their northern limits to help species adapt to changing climatic conditions.\nThe idea of allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground compensation is revolting and not something that should be considered in progressive third world country. You are providing with developers with a way out of their responsibilities as good corporate citizens. Any company that wants to do business in Ontario should understand that we are not a province that is willing destroy the wildlife, plants and habitat for the sake of business.  This move would make it far too easy for proponents to move forward with harmful activities.\nThe proposed landscape agreements for proponents undertaking activities in multiple locations does not lend itself to addressing site-specific or species-specific concerns. Not all sites are the same and different species require different actions, the landscape agreements would present additional risk for species already at risk.\nThe removal of the requirement to consult with an independent expert prior to creating regulations that would jeopardize the survival of a species, or issuing permits for harmful activities is unacceptable. This proposal is putting development before the protection of our natural heritage, and ignores science. No industry should be exempt from the ESA no matter how much they contribute to Ontario\u2019s economy.\nDelaying the listing, planning and reporting on species at risk, is of deep concern and undermines species recovery. By delaying the listing of a species by 9 months puts species further at risk as within this timeframe vulnerable plant and wildlife habitats could be destroyed or irreparably damaged.\nNeed to post to EBR for public comment and not just to the website, the EBR is the tool for public, and other stakeholders to be notified about potential changes and make comments. Not posting decisions to the EBR is a cowardly tactic to avoid drawing  public attention to political decisions that are detrimental to the survival of species that  that are at risk in Ontario, and allows those with political connections the opportunity to  undermine species protections without full public scrutiny.\nThe creation of any Species At Risk Conservation Trust should be run by a board that is elected or appointed based on skill set and expertise, not political appointments. It should be a board of scientists, not developers, lobbyists and politicians.\nI do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Nor do I support the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme that would grease the wheels of destruction by allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats.\n",

        "comment":"Re: ERO #013-5033 Proposed Changes to Endangered Species Act\nI am strongly opposed to the changes to the Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA) that are being proposed in this ERO posting and in Schedule 5 of Bill 108. These changes threaten the survival and recovery of Ontario\u2019s many species at risk. They do not reflect the knowledge of scientists with expertise on species at risk or the traditional knowledge of First Nations. I ask that Schedule 5 be removed from Bill 108, and that changes to the ESA that truly protect species at risk and their habitats be developed in consultation with the scientific community and First Nations.\nI oppose all of the following proposed changes:\nAssessment and listing of species at risk\n(a) To change the composition of COSSARO to include members without scientific qualifications or First Nations\u2019 traditional knowledge. This will destroy the credibility of the assessment process.\n(b) To assess species based on their status across their overall range, rather than their status in Ontario. This will remove protection from many species at risk which reach the northern limit of their range in Ontario.\n(c) To delay listing of species for a year following COSSARO assessment and to allow greater Ministerial discretion to challenge COSSARO assessments. This will leave species at risk without protection for an extended period of time and, hence, greatly threaten their survival and recovery.\nProtection for species at risk and their habitats\n(a) To remove the current automatic protections when species are listed, and to permit the Minister to suspend protections for newly-listed species at risk and their habitats for up to three years in some circumstances (such as having significant social or economic implications). If species are determined to be at risk, it is critical that protections be put in place as soon as possible. The Minister should not be permitted to suspend those protections.\n(b) To allow the Minister to limit protection of species and their habitats to specific geographies or specific circumstances. This will greatly limit the ability of a species to recover.\nRecovery policies for species at risk\n(a) To allow Ministerial discretion in extending timelines for Government Response Statements and review of progress towards protection and recovery of a species. These documents are important for ensuring that species protections are put in place and are effective. Currently, they are often delayed, and even further delay will negatively affect species recovery.\n(b) To remove the requirement that postings be made under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993. If the posting are no longer available on the ERO website, public input on species at risk issues may be limited.\nPermits, agreements and regulatory exemptions\n(a) To allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge instead of carrying out activities required by the ESA. This change is meant to permit developers to ignore the needs of species at risk. It will clearly result in the destruction of species at risk and their habitats, not in their protection.\n(b) To remove the requirement that the Minister consult with an independent expert before issuing permits for activities harmful to species at risk, or when preparing exemption regulations that jeopardize the survival of a species. The Minister does not have the scientific knowledge to make these decisions that may harm or jeopardize the survival of species at risk. It is critical that he\/she seek expert advice in these matters.\nSchedule 5 must be removed from Bill 108.\n",

        "comment":"**NB - There is nothing in this submission that would prevent it from being published as a comment in the final decision notice.\nMay 17, 2019\nPublic Input Coordinator\nSpecies Conservation Policy Branch\nDear Madam\/Sir,\nPlease accept this submission as Environment Hamilton\u2019s formal comments on the government\u2019s proposed changes as part of the \u201810th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act\u2019.\nWe have a number of concerns about the changes the government is proposing to make to this important piece of legislation.   Our concerns are that much greater in light of the very recently released Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, prepared by the United Nations Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).  The IPBES warns that \u2018(N)ature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history \u2014 and the rate of species extinctions is accelerating, with grave impacts on people around the world now likely\u2026\u2019.  According to IPBES chair, Sir Robert Watson, \u2018(T)he health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.\u2019  Given this reality, we believe that the province needs to rethink proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act and consider taking steps to further strengthen, not weaken, this important legislation.\nWe share the concerns that many other community stakeholders have that the Ministry of Environment, Conservation & Parks (MECP) wants to allow developers & other proponents of harmful activities to contribute money into a fund rather than being required to fulfill obligations for on-the-ground compensation. This proposed approach reduces accountability to the broader public and to the planet, making it far easier to proceed with activities that harm species at risk & their habitats at a time when vulnerable species are more vulnerable than ever before.\nOur understanding is that the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) \u2013 which plays a critically important role in assessing whether a species is at risk \u2013 is currently comprised of highly qualified scientific experts.  We DO NOT support MECP\u2019s proposal to  broaden the members of COSSARO to include those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d.  The only exception we believe should be made is to include indigenous knowledge\/ traditional ecological knowledge to guide decision-making.   This approach would require the careful establishment of a clear definition of what constitutes valuable \u2018community knowledge\u2019 within the COSSARO process.  Currently, we fear that the proposal to include those with community knowledge is too vague and could open up the committee to those who do not have adequate expertise in species assessment or to individuals who have other interests besides the stringent protection of species at risk.  We cannot afford to jeopardize the important work of COSSARO at this point in our planet\u2019s history.\nWe are also concerned that a change is being proposed that would require COSSARO to base its assessments not on the status of a species in Ontario as is currently the case, but instead on its status throughout its range.  We worry this will lead to less or no protection for southern Ontario endangered species that are located at the northern limit of their range, depending on their status outside Ontario. This is especially concerning in the face of climate change because healthy species populations are needed at their northern limits to help species adapt to changing climatic conditions.  Our concern regarding this issue is especially pronounced here in the Hamilton area, where we have some of the most biodiverse natural areas in the country.\nWe are also deeply concerned about the proposal to confer a number of new powers on the Minister of Environment, Conservation & Parks.   We are concerned about the proposal to empower the Minister to limit Endangered Species Act protections in order to make them applicable in specific areas of the province or under specific circumstances.   We do not support this approach as it could lead to the exclusion of important habitat areas in the province and it could prevent the protection of certain endangered species.  We also do not support the proposal to confer powers on the Minister to reject automatic protections of threatened and endangered species and the habitats they depend on.  We do not believe it is appropriate to empower the Minister to suspend species and habitat protections for as long as three years for social or economic reasons.  And we definitely do not support the proposal to exempt the requirement for such delays to be subject to the public posting and commenting requirements under the Environmental Bill of Rights.   This approach works against openness and transparency and opens the door to political manipulation that could undermine species protections.  Again, now more than ever before, we cannot allow this to happen.  We do not support the proposal to empower the Minister to require the COSSARO expert group to reconsider its science-based listing decisions.  This proposed change would open the door ot political manipulation of the process \u2013 something that could put endangered species at even greater risk.   Private sector players could lobby the government and potentially disrupt the scientific-based process for listing species if these players believe the species threatens their development or business endeavours.  Finally, we are strongly opposed to the change that would remove the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert before creating any regulation that could jeopardize the survival of a species, or before the Minister issues any permits for undertakings that, while they might provide significant social and\/or economic benefit, put a species at increased risk.\nThe MECP proposal to create \u201clandscape agreements\u201d for proponents undertaking harmful activities in multiple locations is also a change we do not support.   This approach does not facilitate consideration of site-specific or species-specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.   We hold similar concerns about the  MECP proposal to allow activities approved under other laws without any additional authorizations under the Endangered Species Act even if these activities harm threatened or endangered species or their habitats.  This approach could result in the permanent exemption of industries like the forestry sector which, for obvious reasons, must remain subject to the requirements of the Endangered Species Act if we have any hope of ensuring adequate protections for species at risk.\nWe are also strongly opposed to the proposed delays in the timelines set out for the listing, planning and reporting on species at risk.  For instance, the proposal to list species nine months after COSSARO makes its assessments public leaves species at risk during this interim period; their habitats could be destroyed before appropriate protections kick in.  Again, we cannot afford, at this point in the planet\u2019s history, to allow species protections to be weakened.\nFinally, we worry about the proposal to update classifications of enforcements by removing certain designations \u2013 like conservation officer.   This proposed change makes us fearful that the MECP plans to enlist MECP staff that may not possess the appropriate skills sets to take on the role of enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.\nAll in all, we believe these proposed changes are short-sighted and ill-informed and are being proposed at a point in time when our planet is in greater peril than it ever has been before.   Changing these important rules now will set the MECP and this current provincial government up to leave a sad legacy for future generations to contend with.   We are deeply concerned and opposed to these changes.\nThank you\nLynda Lukasik, PhD\nExecutive Director\nEnvironment Hamilton\nTEL: (905) 549-0900\nEMAIL: llukasik@environmenthamilton.org\n",

        "comment":"I would like to start with the statement that I am deeply opposed to this bill. The proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act provide far too much power to the Minister, meaning decisions that are normally made by experts in the fields related to endangered species conservation have now become politically motivated. It would be absolutely ridiculous to presume that a government Minister could make an unbiased decision with regard to a proposed development that affects endangered species. The fact that the first point in allowing exceptions in response to hypothetical economic and social impacts justifies the Minister in blatently disregarding the specific needs of the species in question. This bill, and the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act would have direct consequences on my job and the jobs of my coworkers who include ecologists, biologists, arborists and landscape architects. This does nothing but make it easier for developers and would be developers to bypass the needs of species at risk at the cost of jobs of those in the service industry working with endangered species and environmental protection. At the same time, with the housing market in a state of decline across the province, this encourages and allows developers to proceed with developments in areas which may otherwise have remained protected due to the presence of species at risk. I urge this government to think of the long term future of this province, because once these habitats are lost, they are lost forever. And the species, while possibly present in other parts of the country or within neighbouring states, will be lost to this province. That would be a sad day when the province has to read a statement that, \"the butternut has been extirpated from Ontario, but hey, you can drive to northern Michigan if you want to see one\". Please consider all the industries and jobs that are affected by this bill, as well as the health, character and identity of this great province and do not pass this into law.\n",

There is lots of land that can be used for housing that does not intrude on our wonderful wildlife.

        "comment":"The planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protection. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and request Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\n",

        "comment":"Many species are declining across the world and in Canada. The province of Ontario is not immune to these declines; there are currently more than 200 species at risk (SAR) in the province. The main purpose of the ESA should be to protect species, *not to expedite development*! Any changes to the ESA should be made with great care, as without diligent legislation there is not just a risk of additional habitat loss and population declines, but a virtual guarantee. Further declines in some species may cause them to become completely extirpated from Ontario. Further losses to our natural heritage are completely unacceptable in the face of so many other unmitigated threats to biodiversity. Ontario should take the opportunity to be a leader in biodiversity conservation, with an ESA that is the gold standard to which other jurisdictions aspire.\nI agree that the public should be notified quickly of COSSARO\u2019s species\u2019 assessments, but listing should be immediate. Waiting one year after the species is listed WILL result in harmful effects on the species, at minimum on various localized scales, and at maximum across its range in our province. I must stress that a lot of these species, particularly amphibians and reptiles, are already rapidly declining both locally and worldwide (the barn swallow has declined more than 90% in the last 40 years, for example), so immediate protection is strongly recommended. I also strongly disagree with the possible suspension of listings for up to three years, as such long delays could allow large developments and lack of mitigation, potentially wiping out entire populations of species that should be listed but whose listings have been unnecessarily delayed for the sake of lining developer's pockets. The path to extinction is not immediate - it's an ongoing march, step after step, of repeated localized extirpations. Carried out across a landscape over time, you will reach a tipping point from which species cannot recover (i.e. Passenger Pigeon, Eskimo Curlew, Golden Toad, Heath Hen, etc., etc.) Furthermore, threatened and endangered species should have habitat regulations, as these species are especially vulnerable.\nCOSSARO is an independent committee with expertise in scientific disciplines and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (TEK), and these individuals take great care and consideration when making decisions about which species should be listed as at risk. I do agree with broadening member qualifications, but this should not take away from the legitimacy of the organization. The current proposal calls for including those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d \u2013 a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have unbiased expertise in species assessment or that have a different agenda altogether. I still *strongly oppose* that the minister should be able to overrule decisions made by COSSARO, as such veto power explicitly undermines the arms-length scientific approach that is supposed to be used to assess species. If this proposed change goes through, I would be ashamed to call myself Canadian, and the minister should be ashamed as well; no one person should be given that much power in this day and age, especially in our society.\nI also strongly oppose COSSARO being required to base its assessments on the status of a species throughout its range, as opposed to in Ontario only. Such a proposed change For species that have a small portion of their range in Ontario, these populations often present unique adaptations and reservoirs of genetic variation, facilitating resilience to climate change. Loss of our Ontario populations means loss of global diversity in the species. As Aldo Leopold said, \u201cTo keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.\u201d Allowing species to be wiped out in Ontario simply because they occur elsewhere is at best short-sighted, and at worst arrogant, irresponsible and wildly reckless; anyone who thinks that is a GOOD idea will find themselves on the wrong side of history.\nThe Species at Risk conservation trust could be a powerful tool under *some* circumstances, but there is too much room for such a program to be abused. This trust could allow for areas facing development to be developed by simply paying into the trust as opposed to protecting the resident species at risk. It places a dollar sign on the worth of a species' population at any given site. Such a proposal runs the risk of jeopardizing the social license that many large companies currently have. If companies are seen to be \u201cbuying\u201d the right to destroy the habitat of endangered species, they will be viewed as poor corporate citizens and definitely lose business in the long term, not to mention be openly brazenly flaunting their embrace of an oligarchy. Under some certain circumstances, SAR habitat may be lost, and such a program could result in compensatory habitat creation elsewhere. In those cases there should result a net gain in quality SAR habitat for the same species. Net gains or losses should not be measured as simplistic aerial extent of habitat lost versus created, as the quality of habitat and whether it is actually occupied by viable subpopulations is more meaningful. Although complex to measure, indicators that are relevant to the SAR classification system should be used, such as numbers of mature individuals, survival rates, reproductive rates, area of occupancy, and long-term viability of the mitigation project.\nThe proposed changes include amending the act to strike out \u201cthe environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d and substituting \u201ca website maintained by the Government of Ontario\u201d. Such a change would mean that the opportunity for public input is lost. Removing opportunities for public input eliminates government accountability to the public and prevents the public to participate in the protection and recovery of species at risk. Sort of the opposite of a democratic society where a responsible government can be held accountable by the people it serves.\nLastly, I agree that better enforcement is necessary to protect SAR. There is a strong need for enforcement of the ESA through fines and if necessary, incarceration. At minimum, court-imposed fines, especially those levied against corporations and businesses, should at least cover the costs of the crown's enforcement and legal proceedings - currently there is little reason to spend money enforcing a law when it costs more money to do so than what is won back in punitive or other damages. Increase the economic incentive to punish those who ignore the law!\nLooking to more advanced societies than our own in other countries, it is evident that societies as a whole do better with quality of life and happiness when their environment is not looked upon as something whose care is a chore better ignored, but rather a valuable asset whose overall health is necessary for our own well-being.\nThe purposes of the ESA are:\n1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.\n3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.\nI believe that the proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. Given that, I strongly advise you to reconsider the proposed changes and further consult with the public and professionals, to use a collaborative and transparent approach to responsible development while also protecting SAR.\n",

        "comment":"Re: Bill 108, Schedule 5 (ERO 013-5033) Proposed Amendments to Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act\nOntario should be a leader among the provinces in Canada in saving endangered species. Extinction is forever. We now know that many of Earth's species will be extinct in the next decades if nothing is done to protect them.  This is our watch. Please let\u2019s not look back in 10 years and say, \u201cOn our watch, many of Ontario\u2019s Species at Risk became extinct.\u201d Ontarians don't want this. We want our children and grandchildren to have the same opportunities to see and enjoy Nature that we have had.\nOne of the main reasons that we are facing such a bleak future for wildlife is that we aren't adequately protecting the habitats of endangered plants and animals. The Ontario  government can make a difference by strengthening, rather than weakening  protections for wildlife and its habitats. Where wildlife flourishes, so do people. If we are to have a sustainable economy and society, we must maintain a healthy environment.\nEndangered animals and plants can't speak for themselves. It's up to us to care for them.\nHere's why I strongly oppose the changes that are being considered: They will not improve outcomes for species at risk. On the contrary, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. As you cut protections for wetlands, lakes and rivers, you destroy the homes of animals and plants. About 90% of all wildlife relies on the shoreline of water bodies for some or all of their life cycles.\nI worry about basing protections on COSSARO assessments that would be based not on the status of a species in Ontario, but instead on its status throughout its range. For example, southern Ontario endangered species at the northern limit of their range may receive less or no protection, depending on their status outside Ontario. This is especially concerning in the face of climate change because healthy species populations are needed at their northern limits to help species adapt to changing climatic conditions.\nThe Environmental Bill of Rights posting and consultation requirements must continue to be applied to all habitats of species at risk if we are to have any hope of saving them.\nI strongly oppose proposed changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Pressure can be applied to politicians by those with a vested interest in developing habitats of species at risk, or harming SARs. The process of protecting them must remain with scientists, and remain outside of the political arena,\nI am further concerned that multiple delays are proposed for the listing, planning and reporting on species at risk, undermining species recovery. Of deep concern to me is the proposal to list species nine months after COSSARO makes its assessments public, because during this time vulnerable plants, animals and their habitats could be eliminated before protections kick in.\nI am completely opposed to the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme that would enable habitat and species destruction by allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats.\nImproving outcomes for Species at Risk requires enforcement, not weakening, of the law. It also requires investment in stewardship.  I hope the Ontario government will step up to the plate to provide it, by better funding the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests.  I urge the Ontario Government to reconsider all the issues I have raised about Bill 108.\n",

        "comment":"I'm really concerned that changes to the Endangered Species Act will move us backwards rather than forwards. Scientists have been sounding the alarm over the loss of species in Ontario and around the world for quite some time now. Allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground compensation is an easy way out for them, which reduces accountability and makes it far easier to proceed with activities that harm species at risk and their habitats.\nAnother concern is the removal of the independent expert consultant who vets whether new regulations or permits would jeopardize the survival of a species. This is horrifying - how will we know if we are making a good decision if we don't consult with those that know the most about the environment we are impacting?\nMultiple delays are proposed for the listing, planning and reporting on species at risk, undermining species recovery. Of deep concern is the proposal to list species nine months after COSSARO makes its assessments public \u2013 during this time vulnerable plants, animals and their habitats could be eliminated before protections kick in.\nIf you really care about our natural environment and its impacts on human health, you would reconsider these and other changes to the ESA. You can't put a price on nature...once it's gone, it's gone. Remember, you aren't just governing people, but also the land in this province. Be responsible and visionary, with proper stewardship of our natural environment. Leave the ESA alone!\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my strong concerns with the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act.\nQuality habitat is unquestionably important for all species.  The diverse species of the planet and of our province are interconnected in complex food chains and life cycles.  For the long term health of the planet we cannot risk losing links in this web of life.\nThese proposed changes with allowances for delays and discretionary powers by the Minister weaken the act extraordinarily.  Allowing protections to be suspended for 3 years is not acceptable.  Limiting protection in certain areas and circumstances is not acceptable.  Delaying protections of new species for existing permit holders is not acceptable.  Delaying response statements is not acceptable.  Delaying the review process is not acceptable.\nKnowledgeable experts must be engaged, science and data need to be respected, informed and responsible decisions must be made to ensure connected corridors and intact blocks of natural terrain.\nBiodiversity is essential to the healthy functioning of ecosystems on which human survival is dependent.  Unwavering protection of quality habitats and restoration of degraded landscapes is critical for biodiversity.  This is critical.  Ontario must lead, not lag.\n",

        "comment":"May 18, 2019\nPublic Input Coordinator\nMinistry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks\nSpecies Conservation Policy Branch\n300 Water Street\nFloor 5N\nPeterborough, Ontario\nK9J 3C7\nDear Sir\/Madam,\nRE: ERO #013-5033 Review of the Endangered Species Act, 2007\nWe, the undersigned organizations, strongly oppose proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA) put forward in Schedule 5 of Bill 108. The changes contained in Schedule 5 will strip Ontario\u2019s most vulnerable plants and animals of crucial legal protections. They are inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the ESA, which is to protect and recover species at risk in this province. They would undermine the very cornerstones of the law: science-based listing (including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge), mandatory habitat protection, and legislated timelines for planning and reporting. They would create many new loopholes for industry and development proponents, making it easier to proceed with activities that harm species at risk and their habitats.\nWe urge the government to remove Schedule 5 in its entirety from Bill 108 and thus not to proceed with the proposed changes to the ESA.\nBelow we outline our specific concerns about Schedule 5.\n1. Assessing and listing species at risk\nThe changes proposed would undermine the ESA\u2019s transparent, science-based approach to assessing and listing species at risk and could delay or prevent species from being added to the Species at Risk in Ontario (SARO) list, further threatening their survival and recovery.\ni.\tDelay in listing of species assessed by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO). Currently species must be listed within three months of COSSARO\u2019s submission of an assessment report to the Minister. This timeline would be extended to 12 months (proposed subsection 7(4)), during which time species at risk and their habitats would be unprotected and vulnerable to harmful actions taken by those wishing to avoid pending ESA restrictions.\nii.\tMore discretion for the Minister to second-guess assessments by COSSARO, resulting in delays in recovery planning and protections. The ESA already allows the Minister to request a review of a COSSARO decision if \u201ccredible scientific information\u201d indicates the listing \u201cis not appropriate\u201d (sec. 8(2)). The new language proposed in the Bill changes this to \u201cmay not be appropriate\u201d (proposed subsection 8(2)), opening the door more broadly to challenge COSSARO decisions. Requests for reassessment would delay both planning (Recovery Strategies, Management Plans) and protections, which are triggered by listing. Currently, a species is listed regardless of a request for reassessment. Under the proposed system, however, the species would not be listed until the reassessment is completed (proposed subsections 8 (3) and (4)). Since there is no specified timeline for the reassessment process, this change introduces the possibility of indefinite delays, politicizing the process and making it possible for developers to derail the listing process if they don\u2019t like a COSSARO decision.\niii.\tRequirement that COSSARO assessments be based not on the condition of a species in Ontario, but instead on its condition across its \u201cbiologically relevant geographic range\u201d (proposed subsections 5(4) and (5)). Most species now listed as threatened or endangered in Ontario, which are considered to be more stable in the United States, could be delisted (e.g., during regular reassessment processes) and receive no protection as a result. Most of the plants and animals that could be affected are \u2018edge of range\u2019 species at their northern limit in Canada. Edge of range species generally are considered important in conservation efforts, particularly in an era of climate change. They may be better adapted to extreme climates than core populations or may have other characteristics that will facilitate adaptation. Excluding them from protection could result in a significant loss of genetic diversity and reduce the ability of species to persist, for example through geographic range shifts. Many of these species are also important culturally, socially or economically. Their continued decline or disappearance from Ontario could be deeply felt by communities and individuals across the province. Further, the proposed approach could prevent new listings of and thus legal protections for species that are in trouble in Ontario but not yet listed.\niv.\tBroadening of COSSARO membership so that it includes other than scientific experts (proposed subsections 3(4) (a) and (b)). Currently COSSARO members must have expertise in (a) a scientific discipline such as conservation biology, population dynamics, taxonomy, systematics or genetics; or (b) aboriginal traditional knowledge. Such qualifications ensure the credibility and transparency of the assessment and listing process.\n2. Species and Habitat Protections\nThe proposed changes, including delaying or limiting protections for species and their habitats at the discretion of the Minister, would allow short-sighted economic or political interests to override the protection and recovery of species at risk. The ESA already provides ample flexibility to consider socio-economic issues and to accommodate proponents of harmful activities through permits and exemptions (sec. 17, 18, etc.). Credibility, transparency and certainty require protections that are science-based and not politically motivated.\ni.\tDe-coupling the process of listing species at risk from the automatic protections provided under the ESA for threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The Minister would be allowed to suspend species and habitat protections for newly listed species for up to three years based on social or economic considerations (proposed subsections 8.1(3)(b) and (5)(b)).\nii.\tOne-year delay in the application of automatic protections for newly listed species for existing permit\/agreement holders (proposed subsections 8.2(1) and (2)).\niii.\tMinisterial discretion to limit protections for species and their habitats so that they apply only in specific geographies or in specific circumstances. This could exclude important habitats and species from protection (proposed subsections 8(1)(1.2) and (1.3).\n3. Species at Risk Recovery Policies\nThe proposed changes below would delay required policies and reports and reduce public scrutiny.\ni.\tMinisterial discretion to delay indefinitely the development of Government Response Statements (GRS). These species-specific government policies stipulate the government\u2019s plans and commitments for actions that it will undertake or support to advance species recovery. Currently a GRS must be produced within nine months of the publication of a Recovery Strategy (for threatened or endangered species) or a Management Plan (for special concern species).The proposed change would allow the Minister to delay the development of a GRS indefinitely, as long as a notice is published on a government website (proposed subsection 12.1(4)).\nii.\tRemoval of requirements to post notices on the Environmental Bill of Rights Registry when the Minister publishes Recovery Strategies or Management Plans. As with the GRSs, notices would be published on an unspecified government website instead of the Environmental Bill of Rights Registry (proposed subsections 11(5) and 12(4)). It is unclear whether notices on the new website would be as transparent and accessible as they currently are on the Environmental Bill of Rights Registry, which \u201centrenches the rights of the public to receive notice of and provide input into environmentally significant acts, regulations and policies\u201d (Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, 2013, p. 34). This change could potentially shut out opportunities for public consultation regarding government policies and reduce government accountability to the public.\niii.\tMinisterial discretion to delay carrying out a review of progress towards the protection and recovery of species. Currently, the Minister is required to conduct a review of the progress made towards the protection and recovery of a species no later than five years after publication of a GRS. The proposed amendment allows the Minister to specify, in the GRS, any time period to carry out the review (proposed subsection 12.2(2)(a)). The requirement to report on progress within five years of the release of the GRS is reasonable and should not be changed. Reporting ensures transparency and accountability. It also provides an impetus for action, ensures that effectiveness is assessed, and contributes to institutional learning and adaptive management.\n4. Permits, agreements and exemptions to allow harmful activities\nThere are many mechanisms in the ESA, including permits, agreements and regulatory exemptions, that allow harmful activities to proceed as long as certain conditions are met. The ESA sets a high standard for permits, based on providing an overall, on-the-ground benefit to species negatively impacted by development. The standard for exemptions, however, is generally much lower and requires only mitigation of harm.\nThe proposed changes would make it easier for industry and development proponents to proceed with harmful activities. This direction is inconsistent with the purpose of the ESA which is to protect and recover species at risk. Wherever and whenever harmful activities are allowed to proceed, authorizations should be premised on providing an overall, on-the-ground benefit to the species affected. While authorization processes may result in delays, enabling economic development is not the purpose of the act. Even routine activities can have devastating cumulative impacts \u2013 aptly described as \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts.\u201d\ni.\tAllowing proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling on-the-ground requirements that would otherwise be imposed under the ESA (proposed section 20). A fee-in-lieu fund is an easy way out for proponents of harmful activities that reduces transparency and accountability. Proponents would be able to dodge the current requirement of permit-holders to provide an on-the-ground overall benefit to species negatively impacted. The easier it is to obtain an authorization for harmful activities, the more likely they are to occur. Habitat loss and degradation are by far the most significant drivers of species decline, underlining the importance of on-the-ground reparation for authorized damage or destruction.\nii.\tRemoval of the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert and to obtain Cabinet approval prior to issuing permits for harmful activities that would provide a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario (section 17(2)d permits). The proposed changes would undermine the rigour and credibility of the Minister\u2019s decision. Currently the ESA requires the expert consulted to submit a report on the potential impacts of the proposed harmful activities on the species at risk, including an opinion on \u201cwhether the activity will jeopardize the survival or recovery of the species in Ontario.\u201d It also requires Cabinet approval, premised on the authorized harmful activities being deemed to be of provincial significance. Removing these requirements would make it easier for such projects to proceed without adequate review or consideration.\niii.\tRemoval of the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert regarding the potential impact of a regulation (e.g., an exemption regulation) on species at risk if it is likely to jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario. This change would make it easier to pass regulations that could result in serious harm to species at risk and their habitats. It would undermine the rigour and credibility of the Minister\u2019s decision.\niv.\tRemoval of protections for individual members of a threatened or endangered species. Those authorized by a permit to proceed with harmful activities would no longer be required to take measures to avoid adverse impacts to individual members of a species (subsections 17(2)(c)(iii) and 17(2)(d)(v)). Instead, permit conditions would require only that measures be taken to avoid adverse impacts to affected species. The fine filter of protection for individual plants or animals would no longer apply, leaving the door wide open to incremental loss with untold cumulative impacts.\nv.\tCreation of \u201clandscape agreements\u201d for proponents undertaking multiple harmful activities throughout a geographic area (proposed section 16.1). This broad-brush approach is a new form of exemption for those carrying out harmful activities across the landscape. It doesn\u2019t lend itself to addressing site-specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril. Further, though the proponent is required to undertake beneficial activities, these do not need to benefit all of the threatened or endangered species that are negatively impacted. In fact, they need only benefit one species to qualify. The other species at risk would be subject to harm with no compensation throughout the area covered by the landscape agreement.\nvi.\tRemoval of the current requirement to provide an overall benefit to negatively impacted species when harmful activities approved under other pieces of legislation are authorized to proceed under section 18 of the ESA. Section 18 of the ESA already provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. But it is premised on providing an overall benefit to species negatively impacted. This high standard is intended to promote species recovery, whereas the proposed change aims only to ensure that steps are taken to minimize adverse effects.\nSummary remarks\nOn May 6th, only four days after the Government of Ontario tabled Bill 108 and Schedule 5, the United Nations released a report documenting extinction rates unprecedented in human history. According to the Chair of the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), \"The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide\" (IPBES media release, May 6, 2019, Paris). Species and ecosystems in Ontario are very much part of this global trend, and thus the report provides an appropriate frame for understanding the broad implications of the proposed changes to the ESA. These changes would weaken, delay, limit and remove protections for Ontario\u2019s most vulnerable plants and animals and in so doing contribute to further biodiversity decline across the province. They amount to nothing less than a proposal to sacrifice the recovery of species at risk to those with vested short-term economic interests in unbridled development.\nWe urge the government to remove Schedule 5 in its entirety from Bill 108.\nThank you for your attention.\nNational, Provincial, and Regional Organizations\nAnne Bell\nDirector of Conservation & Education\nOntario Nature\nRachel

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act.  I am deeply saddened and strongly opposed to the proposed changes to the Act. Contrary to improving the outcomes for species at risk, the proposed changes would facilitate the destruction of habitats that are essential to our most vulnerable plants and animals, by making it easier for industry and developers to avoid the obligations they face under the current legislation.\nAt a time when the United Nations has issued a report about the crisis facing our environment in terms of species extinction and climate change, I am gobsmacked by the proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act.  I am also deeply concerned that the 20 pages of amendments form a Schedule to a piece of legislation entitled \"More Homes, More Choice\" - certainly these proposals, if enacted, would provide less homes and less choice for vulnerable species.\nMore specifically, I do not support the proposed changes that would allow for broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting.\nI am also deeply concerned about the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d option that would facilitate habitat destruction and the risk to vulnerable species by  allowing developers and others to pay into a fund instead of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats.\nImproving outcomes for species at risk - which also affects us as people who rely on the natural environment for our well-being - requires enforcement, and investment in stewardship.  Weakening the existing law and writing off species at risk and their habitats as red tape, is simply unacceptable.\nI ask that Schedule 5, which contains the proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act, be removed from Bill 208 pending further consultation and public access to the science-based evidence on which this proposal should be based.\n",

The protections granted within this act are necessary and do not infringe on human's ability to seek economic progress. We as humans need to respect nature and it's species. They are after all one of our countries defining cultural features.\nIn light of this, I would like to ask the Ontario government to remove Schedule 5 from Bill 108.

It is very sad that he passed away, but I am glad that he didn't live to see these proposed changes which severely erode the substance of the Endangered Species Act. It would be crushing for him to witness the destruction of his life's work. It takes decades to build good legislation, but only minutes to destroy.  The proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act  now counteracts the intention for which it was created. Ensuring that habitats are enshrined is the intention of the Act and now there are too many ways to encroach on fragile ecosystems so that industry and developers can destroy these areas.\nAny destruction to the already fragile natural areas will contribute to a return to high rates of air pollution impacting humans as well as fragile species. Our natural forests, wetlands and agricultural lands contribute to ensuring  the safety of all living beings. In fact, wetlands store Carbon at a rate 40 times higher than tropical forests. Natural lands protect us from flooding, prevent erosion, and secure soil health as well as helping to protect our waterways. By protecting vulnerable species, we are actually protecting our own species as we protect the natural ecosystems of Ontario.\nFuture generations will reflect on this change to legislation, if it passes, as a horrible blight on the province's history. In fact, already across this country people are sharing this draconian proposal on social media as the worst sort of example of an attack on vulnerable species. I see posts daily from friends and acquaintances from BC and Alberta. It is an embarrassment to Ontario. Climate impact is now the number one issue facing Canadians. This proposal is an attack on Canadians  and our values of care for our natural world and our safety from the climate emergency which we now find ourselves in.  Drop the proposed changes now!\n",

        "comment":"The current proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act weaken the protection for Ontario species at risk (SAR), the opposite of the Act\u2019s intent.\nDelaying timelines for a species to be added to the SARO list is not protecting SAR. These species have been deemed at risk through a science and evidence-based process by COSSARO, meaning that Ontario is at risk of losing these species if action is not taken. By delaying timelines, the Ontario Government is delaying actions to protect these species.\nCOSSARO is the independent party that is made up of academics, expert ecologist and wildlife managers who conduct and review the science in order to form a qualified opinion for whether a species should be listed or not. This process requires qualified individuals who have a fundamental knowledge in biology, ecology or natural history and are up to date with scientific information and wildlife management to be able to make informed decisions on the future of species in Ontario. Adding \u201cothers with community knowledge\u201d should be better defined and the process of the Minister to review the scientific evidence is redundant. In addition, having the Minister intervene the independent process of listing SAR only politicizes it.\nThe Ontario Endangered Species Act should consider species in Ontario as its geographic scope because that is the geographic scope the Ontario Government is responsible for. Ontarians are at even greater risks of losing numerous species with these proposed changes. These species play important roles in our ecosystems in Ontario. Ecosystems that if protected and maintained provide services that benefit all Ontarians and future generations such as clean air, clean water, flood mitigation, healthy soils, etc. Minimizing protection for species otherwise at risk in Ontario because they have a wider geographic scope weakens the natural heritage and ecological value of Ontario that the people of Ontario rely upon.\nCreating a fund for developers or municipalities to pay into in lieu of mitigating impact of SAR on the ground will not benefit species at risk. Sacrificing species and their habitats will only benefit a few Ontarians in the short term, while safeguarding these species and the landscape the live on will benefit all Ontarians current and future. This act is intended to protect species and their habitat deemed at risk, not to sell them.\nThese proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act will not protect SAR or their habitat as the Ontario Government say they are committed to. I urge the Government of Ontario to seriously reconsider these propose changes to this Act. Before making changes to the current Act, consult science based and evidence-based information and experts who protect these species and their habitats, consider the long-term environmental impacts and the health and well-being of current and future generations in Ontario.\n",

The proposal to do so is an errosion of existing protections in order benefit developers and lobbyists whose interests lie in steamrolling the Green Belt and of natural habits rather than infilling and remediating already (under) developed land.\nI am appalled by this government's continued dismal and downplaying of the serious economic, social and environment consequences of the climate crisis we currently face and view these proposed changes as yet another way to undermine any meaningful action to minimize the associated effects.\n",

        "comment":"I am strongly in opposition of the proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act. The changes will reduce the effectiveness of the act and are not beneficial to Ontario's flora and fauna. Instead, they primarily benefit industry.\nRemoving or reducing protection for species at the northern limits of their range, species that hold ecological value and fill specific ecological niches, has potential to cause rippling impacts throughout the environment.\nFurther, allowing non-experts to participate in COSSARO decisions reduces the integrity of the council's decisions, which result from rigorous and scrutinous analysis of the best available scientific data.\nHabitat loss is the leading cause of decline in wildlife species. Allowing industry to pay fees to develop already-compromised habitats reduces corporate accountability and increases likelihood of lasting environmental damage. Overall Benefit is not equivalent to natural habitat, and the interim period to establish new habitats leaves at-risk species with inadequate conditions.\n",

        "comment":"RE: Bill 108, More Homes, More Choice Act, 2019\nProposed Changes to: Schedule 5 - Endangered Species Act, 2007\nI am writing as a private citizen who lives in Norfolk County, a biologically diverse area of Southern Ontario within the Carolinian Zone, the home of many of Ontario\u2019s at-risk species.  I have always been deeply concerned about protecting our environment, and wanted to express my concerns about the proposed changes to environmental protection as outlined in Bill 108.\nI am very concerned about proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act,  as outlined in the recent Bill 108, More Homes, More Choice Act, 2019.  The preamble to the proposed changes is very disturbing: \u201cProtecting Species at risk while clarifying roles and paths to compliance to not unnecessarily burden development.\u201d I did not think that development was a core mandate of this Ministry.\nI have reviewed the proposed changes and amendments, and it is my opinion that they will lead to widespread species extinction across Ontario, and a reduction in habitat (the \u201chomes) for many of our at-risk species. The general focus of these changes appears to assist industry and business to develop natural areas where they are currently restricted.  I am concerned that this will lead to degradation of habitat, and threaten our most vulnerable species in Ontario.\nSchedule 5, Endangered Species Act, 2007\nAny changes to this Act should strengthen, not weaken, protection for our most at-risk species, especially in light of recent studies which predict widespread extinction if our current land use practices are not changed.  The proposal to reduce the regulatory function of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) removes much of the impact of its scientific recommendations, and instead puts that power in the hands of the Minister.\nTime is a huge factor for the protection and continued existence of our endangered species in Ontario. I am very concerned by the proposals to extend the timing of a decision by the Minister to accept a species as \u201cendangered\u201d, and whether or not to protect the habitat.  Specifically:\nWhen COSSARO makes a recommendation, the proposal is to make that public within 3 months, then the Minister may list it 3-12 months after that.  This creates an opportunity for habitat destruction and\/or species extermination in the interim by the developer, to eliminate the requirement for industry\/business to comply with the ESA.\nThe proposal for the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the status of a species outside Ontario also creates a time delay in protection, along with a dangerous precedent of expecting that the United States will protect a species so that we can avoid our responsibility for protecting it or maintaining its habitat.\nIt is a mistake to reconsider Ontario\u2019s endangered species outside of Ontario, and to adjust their classification based on the assumption that they will be protected in their southern range, especially into the United States.  U.S. President Donald Trump has made every effort to gut any environmental regulations during his term; the future of any species or natural habitat in the United States is questionable while he remains in office.\nAlso, why would we consider the actions of another country when protecting or not protecting vulnerable species in our our Province and country?  Ontario is blessed with an abundance of unusual plant and animal species that other provinces, and countries, do not have.  We have a duty to protect these species.  Why would we risk losing this impressive biodiversity?  Aside from its important ecological value, this biodiversity brings many benefits to the Province, including extensive, low-impact, sustainable tourism.\nThe proposal to de-couple the listing process from automatic protections could give the Minister the ability to suspend protection for species and habitat protections for up to 3 years for newly listed species.  Again, this is a huge issue, because in 3 years, an endangered species could easily become extinct if it, and its home (habitat), are not protected.  The additional proposal to exempt the Minister from posting these \u201cprotection suspensions\u201d on the Environmental Bill of Rights, or consultation requirements, means that the Minister\u2019s actions will not be transparent or accountable.  It is distressing to read that this is to \u201cpreserve the ability of the Minister to act swiftly and minimize associated social or economic impacts.\u201d I thought that the mandate of this Minister was to protect the environment.\nPay to Develop: Proposed creation of Regulatory Charge and Agency\nA new layer of bureaucracy, proposed to be named \u201cSpecies at Risk Conservation Trust\u201d, would allow municipalities and developers to pay instead of protecting habitat or species.  This is diluting the responsibility of the Ministry to ensure protection of habitat and species, and allowing the opportunity for widespread habitat destruction. It also opens the door to decisions made not on the basis of their environmental protection, but on how favourable it might be for development.  We already have Ministries that promote development.  We need your Ministry to help protect the environment.\nThe proposal to allow industry and business to pay a fee to an agency in return for non-compliance to regulations is a poor way to protect species.  The wording in the proposal seems to indicate that the business in question could protect an endangered species that could be put at risk, but not necessarily the one in question. Putting funding in the hands of a Board that does not necessarily have a background or understanding of ecology or the requirements of endangered species for their continued survival, is risky.  This additional layer creates a time delay, and extra cost, and the threat of political interference in decisions that should be made with scientific data.  This is underlined in the statement made that this new agency will, in part \u201cGive greater certainty to business....\u201d\nInstead of creating \u201cmore homes\u201d, the proposed changes to the ESA will be setting the stage for widespread habitat and species destruction, effectively removing the \u201chomes\u201d of many of our most vulnerable fellow citizens of Ontario.  by reducing the requirement for reporting to the EBR, and consulting, you will be removing the ability for concerned members of the public to have a say in the future survival of these species.  By creating another layer of bureaucracy, and by giving your Ministry the ability to delay protecting habitats and species, you put these species at even greater risk, and dilute the effectiveness of the Act.  By allowing developers and industry to pay a fee instead of following the law, you set a dangerous precedent for these endangered species.\nNorfolk County, and many other rural counties in Ontario, derive a lot of business from ecological tourism and recreation, in the form of birding, nature tours, art, hiking, fishing, camping, and hunting.  Allowing habitat for our at-risk species to be threatened, will affect our economic stability.  We depend on the diversity of species in ways we don\u2019t understand yet - exterminating them will diminish our quality of life.  We also have a duty to protect the many species that we share this land and water with, and need to have strong enough laws to do that.\nI would urge the Minister to re-consider and reject these proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act.\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposal. I offer general and specific comments below, based on a 20+ year career in the private sector that includes many species at risk recovery activities but also operating construction companies, educational facilities, etc.\nGeneral comments:\nIncreasing flexibility and removing redundancy is useful, however the focus must always remain on species recovery not economic opportunity or cost.\nMinisters are politicians, often with little background in their area of responsibility. Requirements for them to consult with independent experts should not be watered down or eliminated.\nThe use of the best available science should supplemented, but not supplanted, by other forms of knowledge.\nSpecific comments:\nSection 1A: This may not provide for the needs of a species following assessment if the situation is dire. Extending the time may be a useful option but it should not be automatic and COSSARO (or another independent body) should decide this, not the Minister.\n1C: This should not apply in emergency circumstances.\n1D: COSSARO uses the best available scientific information. This should only apply if there is scientific information that was not considered or not available during COSSARO\u2019s review. Such information should be independently reviewed by qualified scientists to determine its veracity.\n1E: While considering a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, may be useful for some species, it should not automatically require adjusting classification. Populations on the edge of their range often contain adaptive value that is critical for future survival. Populations may be disjunct and suffer from different threats. Also, Ontarians frequently want to maintain populations of rare species in their province, regardless of any other jurisdiction. The body best able to consider this IS COSSARO. Please revise \u201cCOSSARO would be required to adjust\u201d to \u201cCOSSARO may adjust\u201d.\n1F: Broader membership may be useful, but primary qualifications for the majority of members must still include scientific background.\n2: As long as those criteria are not watered down, this may provide useful flexibility. However, similar criteria should apply to requirements or delays to developing habitat regulation.\n4. This conservation trust must be carefully developed with sound conservation science for species recovery as the highest priority as opposed to allowing development of sensitive habitat.\n4A: No. Politicians must always be required to consult with independent experts.\n4B: Only where this does not hinder the recovery of a species at risk (i.e. the current situation with bats).\n4C: This may be a useful option, but it should not apply if the activity poses a significant threat to the species or its habitat.\nI also offer an additional comment on a regulation under the Endangered Species Act. Under O. Reg. 242\/08, section 23.15(1), which defines \u201ceducational organization\u201d, this definition is too narrow. Various other organizations such as conservation NGOs and even consultants for short term activities such as stakeholder consultation meetings, provide useful education and should not be precluded from this activity. Please broaden the definition to reflect the modern reality that curatorial institutions are not always owned or operated by government, and that other organizations also have legitimate educational purposes.\n",

We have reviewed the ESA policy proposal (ERO# 013-5033) posted to the Environmental Registry on April 18, as well as Bill 108 More Homes, More Choice Act introduced on May 2. I am pleased to submit comments on behalf of the Company.\nSince 1994, the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA) has governed forest management to \u2018provide for the sustainability of the Crown forests,\u2019 consistent with \u2018large, healthy, diverse and productive Crown forests and their associated ecological processes and biological diversity\u2019. The CFSA establishes a robust management system with inventories, planning, monitoring, compliance and auditing built in. Ontario\u2019s Forest Management Plans (FMP) offer a solid and comprehensive statutory, regulatory and policy guidance framework for species at risk (SAR).\nAs a solution to the CFSA\/ESA harmonization challenge, EACOM has advocated for the CFSA to be recognized by the ESA as the right tool to manage for SAR found in Ontario\u2019s Crown managed forests. Previous efforts to achieve harmonization have been unsuccessful largely due to the ESA\u2019s Section 18 overall benefits test requirements.\nIn the recent policy proposal, MECP clarifies overall benefits test requirements to appropriately recognize sustainable forest management and enables recognition of FMPs under Section 18 of the ESA. The MECP also proposes to prescribe authorized forest management activities, conducted as per approved FMPs, through ESA regulations. EACOM believes that these measures will be necessary to ensure a durable Section 18 solution. It\u2019s important to achieve a solution that supports forestry and SAR objectives without requiring an additional authorization process.\nNevertheless, there remain potential conflicts between the CFSA and the ESA that could create legal risks. A permanent Section 55 regulation, which has also been proposed to harmonize the ESA and CFSA, has been successfully defended in Ontario courts, albeit in the form of a temporary measure. We would therefore encourage a robust legal review of the current proposal to ensure a Section 18 outcome also minimizes risk of additional legal challenges.\nShould such a legal review conclude otherwise, our recommendation would be to recognize sustainable forest management under the CFSA as functionally equivalent to the ESA, through a permanent Section 55(1)(b) regulation.\nWe applaud the government\u2019s efforts to improve SAR guidance in Ontario through this review. We will continue collaborating to enable a more balanced approach to managing all forest values, including SAR.\nThank you for the opportunity to participate in this consultation.\n",

It can be economically beneficial to be able to pay into this conservation trust in some circumstances where money would previously be spent on remediation where it is not feasible. However, there are considerations to be made for populations which are significant genetically, culturally, etc. These kind of decisions should be made with conservation of species as the highest priority, with economic considerations being an occasional exception, not the other way around.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n",

        "comment":"I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act. As a member of the international scientific community who lives and works in Ontario and has worked on species that have been classified as endangered in Ontario, I reflect the opinion of many who have international colleagues who have commented to me that these recommended changes are appalling and make all Ontario\u2019s science and scientists appear unworthy of respect. In the past, Ontario\u2019s Species at Risk science and scientist were highly respected around the world and were applauded for their contributions. Not so if this travesty is enacted. Scientists need to be consulted. Politics should not trump science, and unjustifiably changing the status of endangered species is simply ludicrous. Many examples could be cited here; for example, the endangered American eel. Ontario led the way in indicating the catastrophic North American decline of this species, and after 20 years, others are now following suit. To revert this species back to any lesser state would make Ontario and Ontario scientists the laughing stock of the world. Quebec  and the U.S. do not classify the American eel as endangered, but the IUCN does. To change the endangered status of this species in Ontario to anything less would be a gross injustice. Just look into this history of this decline. It\u2019s a bellwether species, signalling problems that we are perpetrating on the aquatic environment and its species. The status should not change. A very strong Recovery Strategy and plan was developed and the Response Statement was greatly delayed, which was in appropriate and apparently will become the norm under the proposed changes. A major injustice, but at least it was posted and I know that many were not pleased with the Response Statement. It was totally inadequate and years later still has not been finalized.\nProvided by a concerned aquatic scientist having studied a number of species currently classified as endangered in Ontario who does not support the government\u2019s meddling with the proposed Species at Risk Act changes.\n",

        "comment":"Response to the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d\nThe planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts. It is severely crippling enforcement and compliance. It is weakening species and habitat protections. It is delaying recovery planning. It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better. In the face of the current global biodiversity crisis, we must advocate for the preservation of species at risk.\nNOW IS THE TIME TO ACT!\n",

        "comment":"The Council of Tay Valley Township is writing to express concern that the proposed changes to the\nEndangered Species Act will result in significant reduction to biodiversity in Ontario:\ni) due to Ministerial direction regarding species protection rather than automatic listing and\nprotection of species based on scientific analysis; and\nii) due to the establishment of an unnecessary new Crown Agency whose purpose is to\nreceive fees from developers (that are, in some unspecified manner, intended to protect\nspecies) to permit developers to carry out otherwise prohibited activities. The fees are in\nlieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the Act.\nInstead, the Township proposes that scientific assessments of endangered species continue\nto result in automatic listing of the species within the current timeframes (without the\nemphasis on Ministerial involvement proposed and without the extended timeframes\nproposed).\nAdditionally, the Township proposes that the province explore the concept of conservation\nland banking, in the instances where habitat and endangered species will be destroyed.\nBiodiversity will be maintained or enhanced through permanent conservation of habitat lands\nvia payments to landowners (through conservation land banking as practiced in the United\nStates and other countries), rather than payment of a one-time fee into a fund.\nOntario\u2019s Endangered Species Act (ESA) was regarded as the strongest species protection\nlaw in Canada. However, in 2013 a number of exemptions were introduced by the Ministry of\nNatural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) that undermined the law. Subsequently, the 2017\nannual report by the Environment Commissioner of Ontario criticized the MNRF\u2019s failure to\nproperly implement the ESA. The Township is concerned the current proposed changes are\nbeing introduced with inadequate public consultation.\nThe Township is concerned that the proposed changes to the Act weaken already weak\nprotection for biodiversity in Ontario. According to a publication by the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology, greater biodiversity allows \u201cthe services species provide to contribute\nto the delicately-running natural cycles that help make earth habitable to humans\u2026, from\nproviding food and pharmaceuticals to helping reduce the impact of natural disasters such as\nfloods. Biodiversity is positively correlated with ecosystem productivity.\nThus, if humans want to continue benefiting from the abundance of these natural goods and\nservices, the biodiversity that establishes them must be preserved\u201d. The United Nations\nConvention on Biological Diversity, notes that, \u201cat least 40 per cent of the world's economy\nand 80 per cent of the needs of the poor are derived from biological resources\u201d. Protecting\nbiodiversity is in Tay Valley Township residents\u2019 self-interest for agriculture, tourism, and\nmental health.\nBiodiversity is under risk. The current species extinction rate is estimated by the International\nUnion for the Conservation of Nature to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the\nnatural or 'background' rate. According to the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s 2018 Living Planet\nReport, in Canada, mammal populations dropped by 43 per cent, amphibian and reptile\npopulations dropped by 34 percent, fish populations dropped by 20 percent, and some types\nof birds have lost between 43 and 69 percent of their populations.\nOnly one-quarter of land on Earth is free from impacts of human activities and that number is\nprojected to decline to just one-tenth by 2050 according to the World Wildlife Fund (based on\nthe International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Index, the Biodiversity Intactness\nIndex, and the Species Habitat Index).\nThe very recent release of the IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and\nEcosystem Services emphasizes the urgent need to protect Ontario\u2019s biodiversity. The report\nidentifies the next 18 months as crucial. The report calls for, among other recommendations,\n\u201cshifts in incentives, new environmental laws and stronger enforcement\u201d.\nIn Ontario the species at risk list has continued to grow, not shrink. Current legislation is not\ndoing enough to protect species. The Township is concerned that the options put forward by\nthe proposal would undermine science-based listing of species at risk (including Indigenous\ntraditional knowledge) and mandatory protection of listed species and their habitats.\nThere appear to be sufficient tools for protection but they are not being implemented on the\nground. No new Ministerial exemptions or delays in listing species are supported. Improved\nimplementation of the existing Act is required. The Ministry has never denied an ESA permit.\nThe Ministry has permitted 2,000 individual exemptions, as well as providing whole industries\nwith exemptions, e.g., forestry.\nThe Township believes that applicants who propose harmful activities should not pay a fee\ninto a fund that may, at some point in the future, provide some undefined \u2018benefit\u2019. The\nTownship also questions the need to set up a new Crown Agency in this era of cost-cutting\nby the government.\nInstead, the Township recommends that the province explore payments to landowners as a\nmeans of species protection through conservation banking. This would provide rural\nlandowners with payment for the benefits the natural capital of their land provides.\nConservation banking is a \u201cmarket program used throughout the United States that increases\nthe landowner's stewardship and incentive for permanently protecting their land by providing\nthem a set number of habitat or species credits that the respective owners are able to sell. In\norder to satisfy the requirements of species or habitat conservation measures, these\nconservation credits can be sold to projects or developments that result in unavoidable and\nadverse impacts to species.\u201d (US Fish and Wildlife)\nPricing of conservation credits are variable based on the type of species impacted.\n\u201cAdditionally, the market forces of supply and demand largely dictate the price of any given\ncredit, and the value may fluctuate based on many other economic factors such as land\nvalue, competition, and speculation about development in a certain habitat area.\u201d According\nto the US Department of the Interior, conservation credits can range in price from a low of\n\u201c$1500 per mitigation of a gopher tortoise to as much as $325,000 for vernal pool\npreservation\u201d.\nSuch payments could benefit rural land owners in Tay Valley Township (which is home to\nover 40 species at risk) and rural areas throughout the province.\n",

        "comment":"May 18, 2019\nRE: ERO 013-5033\n10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\nThe Ottawa Field Naturalists\u2019 Club opposes the changes to the Endangered Species Act proposed in Schedule 5 of Bill 108, and asks that they be rejected entirely.\nAt a time when the loss of biodiversity is accelerating, protections for declining species and their habitats need to be strengthened, not weakened. The modern crisis of biodiversity loss and rapid extinction was very recently highlighted in the Global Assessment from the United Nations. Anytime a species disappears, the ecosystem loses that species\u2019 function and contribution to biodiversity. That ecosystem may be less resilient, and the loss of some species may cause a trophic cascade of negative consequences.  Preserving biodiversity is key to ensuring ecosystem health, which in turn affects ecological services including the supply of clean water, pollination, and the ability to slow or even counteract the effects of climate change.\nThe proposal to reduce or remove the at-risk status of Ontario species that are either at the edge of their range, or that are not at risk elsewhere in their range, is particularly alarming. For species to be conserved appropriately, they need sustainable populations throughout their range. Failure to protect Ontario populations of any species falsely assumes that the causes of decline in Ontario will not occur elsewhere. Nearly all of Ontario\u2019s species at risk are threatened by some combination of habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and direct persecution. These phenomena are by no means restricted to our provincial boundaries. Ontario has a responsibility to conserve its share of the populations of its native species, be they large or small.\nFurthermore, the peripheries of the distributions of species are genetically important, for those populations are the ones most adapted to extreme conditions relative to the species\u2019 core range. Conserving these populations is critical to ensuring that individual species can adapt to and survive the effects of climate change; conversely, not protecting these peripheral populations would inhibit a species\u2019 ability to adapt or shift its natural distribution in response to changing conditions. When the population of a species in Ontario is at the limit of its natural distribution, our collective responsibility to protect it is greater, not lesser.\nAlso particularly concerning are proposed provisions that would allow a Minister or the government of the day to override the ranking of a species at risk or its protections, in spite of scientific evidence or advice.  In order to be both credible and responsible, the classification and ranking of species must remain evidence-based, and legal protection should flow from this. Short-term economic or political gain does not justify the permanent destruction and loss of our natural heritage.\nIn order to preserve Ontario\u2019s biodiversity, ecological health, and natural heritage, please remove the entirety of Schedule 5 from Bill 108.\nSincerely,\nDiane Lepage\nPresident, Ottawa Field-Naturalists\u2019 Club\nJakob Mueller\nVice-President, Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club\nOwen Clarkin\nChair, Conservation Committee, Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club\n",

        "comment":"I am opposed to the proposed changes to the ESA. The lack of regard and protection for SAR and their habitat is the reason we have species at risk in the first place.. If there was more regard and respect for common species and nature in general. we would not have SAR in the first place. If you want to make it easier for developers, protect common species habitat and allow regulations like the ESA and other environmental protection policies \/ regulations to work so we stop forcing common species to become rare.\nFurhermore, extending the period, in which a species is added to the SARO List, from 3 months to 12 months is unacceptable and undermines the objective of the ESA to protect rare species. A 12-month period will allow too much time for stakeholders (wishing to buy, sell or use property) to destroy SAR habitat (i.e. \u2018land sterilization\u2019) associated with the properties without facing consequences under the ESA. Making these proposed timeline changes would be huge oversight of the current government. The current time periods for assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List should remain unchanged.\nLastly, proposing to delist SAR that have healthy populations in other jurisdictions (e.g. USA), is a short-sighted and outrageous idea. The major oversight with this proposal is that it fails to understand the mass negative effect humans can have on a species. Biodiversity, the benchmark of a healthy and resilient natural environment, includes the diversity of a species across regonal boundaries. A species may be abundant outside of Ontario, but if that species' population outside of Ontario becomes decimated and extirpated, its Ontario population at the edge of its range, may be the only opportunity it has from going extinct. Also, regional climates and landscapes change over time as does a species range. We cannot predict this and so it is important to maintain diversity in its range so that species has every opportunity to adapt and survive future changes.\n",

How on earth can he make a decision without talking to those that have the knowledge?\nAllowing an activity to continue for 9 months once a species is listed is criminal. Our endangered species cannot be replaced and 9 months could make one hell of a difference to dwindling populations.\nPaying to continue a destructive activity rather than changing the project to protect the species is also disasterous. This cannot be a serious proposal, I am shocked.\nThese changes do not seem to be strengthening anything. This seems to be making it easier for business when we are talking about creatures that are already under extreme pressure. This is a bad look for a government already attacking science. In my area of Simcoe country are natural habitat draws in millions of tourist dollars.

The committee that defines which species is added to or removed from that list should only include experts in that field and should be free of any potential conflict of interests.  To permit lay people and others from the community will only introduce bias that will result in endangered species in Ontario to be placed at  further  risk or made extinct.\nIn addition, allowing businesses, city representatives or others to simply pay a fee to 'compensate' for activities that would otherwise not be permitted under the current legislation shows a complete disregard for the biodiversity that we must preserve in our province and in Canada. Please, do not procced with these changes.  It is a slippery slope that will only provide precedent for further such changes.  Please do not make Ontario the province that doesn't care about the biodiversity.  Leaving it to other provinces to handle the problem is irresponsible and unconscionable.

They all get a long so well and even with me sitting on my deck in the morning.\nWhen I go up north, I have the same. The wonderment and joy I get out of being able to live so close to so much beauty is astounding.\nIt pains me to think that these creatures are at threat. Without the bugs, the birds will lose their food source. Without plants and streams, more creatures will die, and one day it will be us humans. We are at a tipping point. We are on the top of a very delicate pyramid and once the foundation fails or crumbles, we will fall hard. We will have no drinkable water, we will have no food. If you want beer, without bees you won't get it.\nThey can't speak, the animals and our nature need good protection. There are ways to live in harmony.\nI plant native plants, the bees are plentiful. I plant veggies and fruits, the rabbits and I share. I try to use environmentally and sustainable products including food. I enjoy buying my meat from the local market where I can get to know the farmers and how much love they have for their land and for the animals they eventually sell. The food we eat relies on good and loving care.\nI don't want to live in a world where the only place to hear birds sing is on tv, or to see the last caribou living a sad life in a zoo. This is not my dream for the future, for the future of my unborn child. I don't want to live in an Ontario where there is no caring or love for what is around us. Nature will find a way to come back once we're gone, and I don't want that day to be in 10 years.\nI want to live to 100 in a world I love, and others can enjoy all the beauty of everything.\nI am a scientist,  a lover of animals and nature, and a member of Nature Guelph, Nature Ontario, CPWAS, and other organizations.\nI stand by the science, the organizations that fight. And so many of my family, friends and neighbors are fighting for this protection to maintain it's strength, in fact it should be made stronger.\nIn the past 40 years, the Earth has lost more than half of its wildlife. Without a strong Endangered Species Act (ESA), the more than 230 species at-risk in Ontario will be in dire straits. Environmental protection is not red tape.\nIn Ontario, there are over 230 plant and animal species that are at-risk of extinction or of disappearing from the province, a number which is growing every year. Their loss or decline affects the functioning and resilience of food webs and landscapes \u2013 jeopardizing the well-being of all living things, including humans.\nThe Government should realize that  you are reviewing the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act. The law\u2019s purpose is to protect and recover Ontario\u2019s most vulnerable plants and animals. To that end two changes MECP should be considering are:\n-   Repealing the long list of exemptions for forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development, approved by Cabinet in 2013; and\n -  Amending the law to set a higher bar for creating exemptions through regulation by ensuring they cannot jeopardize the recovery of threatened or endangered species.\nPlease:\n    Repeal the 2013 exemptions for the forestry, hydro, mining and commercial development industries;\n    Amend section 57(1)1 of the ESA so that any future exemptions cannot jeopardize the recovery of endangered and threatened species;\n    Maintain mandatory habitat protection for endangered and threatened species. (The law already provides enough flexibility through habitat regulations and permitting, so there\u2019s no need to politicize the process by adding ministerial discretion);\n    Maintain COSSARO\u2019s current species listing process, \u201cbased on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge\u201d (ESA, section 5 (3)); and\n    Require compensation that results in a direct overall benefit to affected species where harmful activities are permitted. (Do not allow proponents of harmful activities to bypass protections by simply paying into a fund.)\nI will be very disappointed and angry if none of these comments are even brought forth to be read. The last comment period had hundreds that were ignored. I thought we are in a democracy.\nBe better Ontario, this needs to be fixed and improved and keep non-science people and greedy business' out of the delicate ecosystem in Ontario.\nDoug Ford -Ontario is far more than just \"open for business\" . You need to fix this, or there are going to be far more angry people at your door than you can count.\nSupport nature, keep it secure. I can't imagine to live here if we lose any more.\nThank you.\n",

I am concerned that some the proposed changes do exactly the opposite. They will:\n- Allow developers to pay into a fund to proceed with development while harming species and their habitats rather than creating a net positive benefit for affected species.\n- Change the assessment criteria such that if a species is not considered endangered in another region outside Ontario, then the species would not get status in Ontario even if the species is threatened or endangered within Ontario. In fact, the large majority of the almost 200 species currently classified as threatened or endangered would not meet this criterion. Among other issues, this ignores the consideration that northern range expansion of species will likely be required as habitat further south becomes less suitable for species stressed by climate change.\n- Dilute the composition of the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO), the committee of scientific experts that makes decisions on the listing of endangered species, by the addition of those with a vaguely specified \u201clocal knowledge\u201d.\n- Allow the minister to remove protections for up to 3 years based on economic considerations rather than retain the current automatic exemptions. The minister would also be able to require COSSARO to re-evaluate a species for possible removal from endangered status.\n- Where other legislation addresses activities involving interaction with endangered species, allow provisions under the ESA to be disregarded even if these provisions are stricter. This would permanently exempt the forestry industry under the Crown Forestry Sustainability Act and open the door for other industries under future legislation.\n- Remove the requirement for the minister to consult with an independent expert on whether survival of a species would be jeopardized prior to creating a new regulation under the ESA or when issuing a permit to harm a species for economic benefit.\n",

        "comment":"Listing of species at risk by COSSARO and automatic protection of listed species and\ntheir habitats are cornerstones of the ESA and the Ontario government already has opportunity to provide scientific input through representatives (MNR etc employees that have relevant expertise) to COSSARO. A second round of political second-guessing by politicians, political staffers, and upper management will add uncertainty, delays, and inappropriate interference, and controversy.\nEdge of range species should not be denied protection based on their status outside Ontario. All conservation is ultimately local and Ontario should work hard to maintain all the species that naturally occur here regardless of how many naturally occur elsewhere.\nSpecies and their habitat should be protected at listing. Allowing the Minister to remove or delay protections is inappropriate and invites political meddling.\nI do not support weakening of legislated timelines for preparing recovery documents. There should be no change to the legal requirement to produce GRS within nine months\nof the release of Recovery Strategies or Management Plans. Failure to meet the legislated deadlines\nis a chronic problem, which should be addressed through improved implementation, not weakening\nof the law.\nThere are already sufficient tools for authorizing harmful activities. No new tools are needed.\nChallenges should be addressed through improved implementation.\nProponents of harmful activities should NOT be allowed to simply pay into a fund rather than\nproviding on-the-ground reparation for damage done. This easy way out reduces accountability and\nfacilitates harm to species at risk and their habitats. Retain the current requirements to provide an\non-the-ground, overall benefit to species harmed. Proponents already tend to claim that destroying a single population does not substantially increase the risk of extinction and this sort of thinking could be entrenched further under the guise of a bigger picture perspective. At the policy level, this attitude is absurd, akin to planning a diet of chocolate bars on the grounds that a single one won\u2019t cause obesity. Policy making is the opportunity to curb this type of short-term rationalization rather than entrench it.\nDo not remove the requirement to obtain Cabinet approval or to consult with an independent expert regarding sec. 17(2)d permits. These are intended to be available only for projects that \u201cresult in a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario\u201d and that will not \u201cjeopardize the survival or recovery of the species in Ontario.\u201d These are appropriate requirements and ensure that such permits are issued only an exceptional basis.\nDo not remove the requirement for the Minister to seek an independent opinion on regulations that\nmight jeopardize the survival of a species in Ontario. That would only make it easier for harmful\nactivities to proceed, without proper scrutiny.\nThe ESA (sec. 18) provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks, based on the standard of providing an overall benefit to species negatively impacted.\nUnless this standard is maintained, species will continue to decline.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act represent a targeted attempt to weaken the scientific listing process and protection of species at risk in Ontario.  Since 1971 the intent of the Act has been to identify and protect species at risk for their ecological significance and to affirm a common and ethical approach that these values are sufficiently important to current and future generations of Ontarians to be protected from impacts such as development and other economic interests.  As proposed, the alterations to the Act and supporting processes and instruments would significantly constrain the protections to species and habitats in favour of economic development opportunities, which should be otherwise directed to avoid areas that support important populations and habitats for the most rare and imperiled examples of our natural heritage.\nAssessing and listing species at risk\nThe proposed extended period of listing after COSSARO assessment would significantly lengthen the amount of time before important species and habitat protections apply, potentially impacting important populations that are critically imperilled and\/or that are facing imminent threats.  The requirement for COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition across a broader geographic area is dangerous to the protection of important Ontario species populations and not grounded in responsible assessment and management practice for natural heritage values.  Species at risk that are native to Ontario, even in small numbers, represent important and functional aspects of our natural history and require equal levels of protection.  Particularly with the coming pressures of climate change, these small populations are more likely to provide critically important sources of colonization and gene flow for Ontario biodiversity.\nDefining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe removal of automatic species and habitat protections and enabling scoping of protections through Minister regulations may significantly delay critically important protection needed quickly for some species and habitats.  It may also result in the creation of regulations that favour small to large-scale economic interests over that of species at risk protections.  Along with impacts to the listing of species at risk, the loss of automatic protections may also promote the loss of species and habitat by landowners or developers who fear the coming protections and choose to destroy species at risk values prior to protections coming into force.   The responsibility of making species-specific habitat regulations should remain with the LGIC, not the Minister, to ensure that such regulations go through a fair and open political process.\nDeveloping species at risk recovery policies\nThe proposed removal of posting requirements under the Environmental Bill of Rights would effectively remove much of the public review and comment opportunities on the government\u2019s approaches to recovery and related commitments.  This  is not a fair or appropriate move considering the importance of public input into development of these important protection policies and government transparency around these processes.\nIssuing ESA permits, agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nThe concept of creating a financial trust to allow developers to pay to avoid protection requirements of the Act is not an ethical or effective tool to protect species at risk and their habitats.  So much of the importance of legal protections, tools and operational requirements involves the assessment of proposed activities, minimizing adverse effects and ensuring benefits to species at both important local and provincial scales.  This is a critically important scientific process that improves the effectiveness of species protections and mitigation approaches for all projects. The proposed payment to avoid process approach would severely impact the important requirements of proposed developments to evaluate, understand and appropriately design avoidance and mitigation responses that are needed to protect important species at risk values.\nThe proposed removal of the requirement of the Minister to consult with experts on D permits and LGIC approval demonstrates that the government is not serious about getting scientific or political advice which is important to understanding the levels of impacts and appropriate mitigation involved in these larger, more complex projects.  Shifting the focus on impacts to individuals of the species to the broader species would also remove the important need to evaluate and understand how specific proposed development sites contribute to significant local populations and make it much more difficult to measure the levels of impact that are expected to occur as a result of an activity.\nEnforcing the ESA\nCurrent protection order powers should be extended to the discretion of individual officers under the legislation.  Having these critically important enforcement tools being used only under the Minister\u2019s discretion severely weakens the ability of stop work orders and other tools to be issued in a timely manner, which is often needed to effectively cease impacts from development or other activities that may be witnessed as occurring at a particular site.  The proposed removal of public consultation on Minister\u2019s regulations for pausing protections for the purpose of minimizing economic impacts is not a responsible approach to species at risk protection.  Public consultation needs to remain a functional component of policy, tools and instruments under the Act, and fast-tracking regulations that protect individual economic interests over broader public species at risk protection does not represent a functional or ethical approach to evaluation and management of Ontario\u2019s natural heritage values.\n",

Rather, the proposed  changes \u2013 embedded in an omnibus bill nakedly favorable to developers \u2013 are clearly an attempt to eviscerate the Act so that the natural treasures gifted to Ontario will not stand in the way of economic growth at any cost.\nForthwith, withdraw the proposals in their entirety and then revisit the reevaluation process with some level of caring in regard to the persistence and status improvement of species at risk of extinction in Ontario, and elsewhere.\nTo those who, in any way, further these proposals, rest assured, for your pay cheque and your precious pension, you will assume your position on the wrong side of history forevermore. It will be for people such as you that the ecology of the earth, already a shambles as the result of our choices, will yet again feel the joy of a boot in the face.\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing my job.\u201d\n\u201cI just work here.\u201d\n\u201cTwo more years, and I\u2019m retired!\u201d\n\u201cI was just following orders.\u201d\nNo, not good enough. You wear the outcomes as though they arose of your singular choice. Preventing the wrong thing from transpiring is the responsibility of all of us both individually and collectively. Now that you have been reminded of your responsibilities, what will you do to further them? Wake up and do something.\nThe Act, as it stands, was already profoundly weak. Each instance of where an exemption was granted under the Act represented an example of where the Act was ready to work, but where it was hobbled for political reasons. The ability of political actors to grant exemptions is a key weakness of the Act as it stands. Why not try to remove this weakness instead of introducing countless new ones? In Ontario, essentially all species at risk of extinction would be in a better place if the political choices which governed their fates focused on their well-being. Is that too much to ask?\nEndless sprawl. Miles of faceless, low-quality garbage houses giving rise to no meaningful sense of community for their occupants. Pavement and more pavement. Trees cut. Precious farm and grassland irretrievably destroyed. Wetlands drained or shrunken. Ever more detachment from nature and deeper states of depression and mental illness among our population, along with the concomitant scourges of addiction and crime. Species at risk of extinction violently elbowed into oblivion. This is the legacy you will leave if you enact the proposed changes to the Act. Nauseating. More Houses (not homes), More Choices, indeed.\nWithdraw the proposed changes entirely and start again. They represent a failure even before implementation. You must do what you can to ensure the proposals never see the light of day, for they will extinguish that light for species at risk of extinction in Ontario. We will all be staggeringly the poorer for this.\n",

        "comment":"I am deeply concerned about the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act. The UN\u2019s recent report on global biodiversity decline make it clear that we need to increase our efforts to protect threatened species and take this problem seriously. However, the proposed changes do just the opposite \u2013 delaying protections, allowing the Minister to ignore the science, and making it easier to conduct activities that harm threatened species. This is not the right direction and I am very disappointed with the government\u2019s continued attack on biodiversity, the environment, and ultimately Ontarians, whose lives depend on a healthy planet. I have listed my specific concerns below:\nI am opposed to extending the timeline for listing a species to 12 months. Considerable harm can be done to species in that intervening time between the COSSARO report and the listing.\nI am opposed to changes that would allow the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider species classification. If COSSARO is an independent committee of experts made up of members with expertise in scientific disciplines or Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (as stated on the Government of Ontario\u2019s website), then shouldn\u2019t they be able to come to a sound conclusion regarding the species listing without interference from the Minister? Why would the Minister come to a different conclusion than COSSARO regarding the appropriate classification? It\u2019s important that the listing is done by an independent team of experts so that politics don\u2019t get in the way of protecting species at risk.\nI am opposed to basing a species\u2019 classification on its condition outside of Ontario. Ontario, and Southern Ontario in particular, represents the northern range limit of many species, which may be particularly important habitat for a number of species that are expected to shift their ranges northward in response to climate change. Populations found at this northern limit may be best adapted to this area and will be vital for helping those range shifts to occur. For these reasons, not protecting the species or its habitat at its northern range limit because it may be more common elsewhere in its range is not sound, science-based decision-making. It also shifts the responsibility of species protection onto other jurisdictions, when all jurisdictions should be doing their part to protect endangered species.\nI support the notion that COSSARO member qualifications should include expertise in ecology, wildlife management and community knowledge. However, it appears that all members of COSSARO already have that expertise, so I\u2019m not really sure why this is part of the changes\u2026I am worried that \u2018community knowledge\u2019 is a veiled term will actually allow for COSSARO members that have different agendas and priorities other than protecting endangered species. In my opinion, COSSARO members should not have conflicts of interest that prevent them from making decisions based on the best interests of endangered species.\nI am opposed to the change that would de-couple the listing process from automatic protections and provide greater Minister\u2019s discretion on protections. If COSSARO has decided that a species needs to be listed, it is because COSSARO has determined that it IS THREATENED and DOES NEED PROTECTION. Allowing the minister to suspend protections for these species undermines the entire purpose of the act. A listing is not useful if it does not lead to any action. Allowing for \u2018additional time\u2019 is allowing for more opportunity for this species to decline. Furthermore, I\u2019m a bit confused regarding the criteria that \u2018the temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario.\u2019 If a species is listed, then that means its survival is jeopardized and that action is required to protect it, suggesting that no species should meet this criterion and therefore no suspensions on protection should occur. Furthermore, the language of these criteria is vague enough to be extremely subjective \u2013 e.g. what is a \u2018broad distribution\u2019? Plus, habitat availability is a limiting factor for most species, considering that habitat destruction and degradation is the number one cause of species decline globally (and this holds true particularly in Southern Ontario). Since habitat availability is a factor that limits the population of most endangered species, not addressing this by not requiring a habitat regulation is extremely irresponsible. I am therefore opposed to doing away with habitat regulations for all listed species.\nReducing species protections to specific geographies and \u2018specific circumstances\u2019 is just another way of saying that the protection of endangered species is going to be minimized, at a time when it is more important than ever to increase, not decrease, protection of biodiversity. I am opposed to any change that reduces species protections in this way.\nIn general, giving more power to the Minister and less power to an independent team of experts allows for political agendas to get in the way of endangered species protection. I do not support any changes of this kind.\nI am opposed to any changes that extend the amount of time it takes to enforce species protections, prepare a Government Response Statement and ultimately act to help endangered species recover. The current act has already been criticized on the grounds that it takes too long between listing a species and real action being taken to protect the species via recovery policies. Allowing the minister to further extend the timeline for the Government Response Statement doesn\u2019t make sense and doesn\u2019t act to protect endangered species. Furthermore, given that there are many uncertainties regarding how to best protect endangered species, adaptive management is extremely important for successful protection and recovery. Adaptive management requires continual review of progress, and therefore extending timelines for the review of progress is not in the best interest of endangered species.\nPosting under the Environmental Bill of Rights is important to ensure that the public is aware of what is going on and that they have a right to be involved and engaged. I do not support removing the reference to posting under the Environmental Bill of Rights.\nI do not support changes that allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing activities that would protect endangered species and their habitats. This reduces accountability and makes it easier for activities that harm endangered species to proceed.\nI am opposed to changes that remove the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert during the permit process. The Minister cannot possibly be an expert on all endangered species and their needs. Furthermore, the Minister may not be able to make objective decisions due to conflicts of interest. Therefore, consulting with an independent expert should be required so that the impacts on endangered species are understood, appropriate mitigation actions are undertaken, and decisions are reviewed by an objective perspective.\nOverall, I feel that these changes do not improve the Endangered Species Act, but undermine its true purpose and put already threatened species at greater risk. Ontarians deserve to be able to live in a healthy environment and experiences the wonders of biodiversity. We all depend on healthy ecosystems for our basic needs. Undermining the health of ecosystems by not protecting the species they are comprised of is a poor, short-sighted decision that will not serve the needs of Ontarians. In particular, future Ontarians are depending on us to make sound decisions and will not look kindly on short-sighted decisions such as the ones you are proposing. I urge you to reconsider these changes.\n",

        "comment":"As a young citizen working in environmental conservation, I see the benefits of protecting biodiversity on a daily basis. Healthy ecosystems maintain a balance that recycles nutrients, purifies water, regulate climate, maintain healthy soils, and provide us with food, raw materials and countless of recreational activities. When species are removed from the equation, the ecosystem becomes unbalanced, creating problems such as pests. For example, White Tail Deer populations are out of control in southern Ontario due to lack of predators that have been extirpated from the land due to human development and lack of sufficient habitat. As a result, we now see more auto collisions from coming in contact with deer and introduction of new diseases. Many grassland birds are at risk of extinction; these birds feed on insects that have harmful effects on crops. With these birds present in farmer's field, the pest can be controlled naturally reducing cost and labour to the farmer, while increasing yield.\nRemoving protection from species at risk, will mean that more wetlands will be developed. This will create bigger flooding issues as wetlands act as a water reservoir that allow water to slowly drain to rivers and lakes, while purifying it in the process. No wetlands will result in more flash floods; higher costs in infrastructure repairs for roads, homes and other buildings that will suffer; more soil erosion along river banks as a result of increased flow, among other things.\nOverall, ecosystems have highly complexed relationships that no human understand and messing with those relationships will always result in negative effects for people. The government needs to listen to industry professionals who know more on the topic than any politician. We need to start living with nature and not against it, because we will always lose that battle.\n",

At a time like this governments around the world need to be looking to measures that will strengthen the protections for endangered species and improve the resources available for enforcement and habitat restoration. The proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act would instead weaken protections by providing ministerial discretion to loosen regulations and extend the timelines for development and implementation of species protection measures.\nThe most significant proposed changes to the Act are meant to make it easier for developers to ignore species at risk. This may produce short-term economic gains for a few, but will do irreversible damage to the natural systems that are our common heritage. I am shocked by the shortsightedness of the proposed changes. There is no need to pit economic development against environmental integrity. Indeed, in the long term the health of our economy depends on the health of our natural systems. The resilience of society and ecology are fundamentally interlinked, and humanity's own ability to adapt to environmental change is bolstered by sharing the land with a diversity of non-human organisms.\nI urge legislators to reconsider the proposed changes and to instead move towards a strengthened set of protections for our species at risk.

        "comment":"The planet is currently facing its sixth mass extinction and this one is driven by human activity. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report listed five major driving factors in the global loss of biodiversity, including \u201cchanges in land and sea use; direct exploitation of animals and plants; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species\u201d.\nStrengthening and enforcing the Ontario Endangered Species Act should be of paramount importance to the Ontario government in the face of these global threats to biodiversity. Ontario was the first province in Canada to implement an Endangered Species Act in 1971, and was once heralded as setting the \u201cgold standard\u201d for species at risk protection. We as a province have a responsibility to continue to be a leader in species\u2019 conservation and recovery. To do so, we must reinforce protections for species at risk and their habitats and promote their recovery.\nIt is extremely disheartening that the \u201c10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\u201d has proposed such detrimental updates to the act. These updates will only weaken the protections put in place for species at risk. The changes are selfish and short-sighted, and are not written in the best interest of environmental protections. I do not support the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act (ESA) and list below the most problematic changes. I call for the Ontario government to do better. I believe that Ontario has a responsibility to preserve our biodiversity and natural spaces for future generations.\n1)  Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nCurrently, once COSSARO submits a report the Minister, the species must be added to the SARO list within three months. Once listed, the species and its habitat gain legal protection. The proposed changes suggest extending this timeframe from three to twelve months. There is no reason to extend this timeline and doing so is contradicting the goal of the ESA.\nThe proposal also states that the minister can veto COSSARO recommendations. The Minister should not have the authority to undermine a committee composed of independent experts and single-handedly decide which species will be added to the SARO list. I would also like to point out that the current Minister has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation or restoration science. He was the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and should not have the authority to veto COSSARO recommendations.\nThe proposed changes to SARO listing protocols will also result in less protections for edge-of-range species. Protecting edge of range species is important - Ontario makes up the northern-most extent of ranges for species currently listed under SARO. Within the onset of climate change, range sizes are shrinking and Northern ranges are particularly vulnerable. We must continue to enforce protections across a species\u2019 entire range.\nFinally, there is concerning and ambiguous language surrounding COSSARO membership being open to those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d and opens the door for membership to be exploited.\n2) Defining and implementing species and habitat protections\nThe proposed changes suggest that a SARO listing does not mean automatic protections to a species at risk and its habitat. The Minister would have the authority to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years. This is a glaring problem and once again contradicts the spirit of the ESA.\n3) Developing species at risk recovery policy\nThe proposed changes to the ESA include more pointless and detrimental delays. The Minister would have the authority to delay the development of Government Response Statements and reviews of the progress towards protection and recovery. There is no scientific or environmentally sound reason for these delays, nor do they act in the best interest of species at risk.\n4) Issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions\nAllowing municipalities or other infrastructure developers to pay a fee instead of abiding by the protections put in place by the ESA is an egregious flaw and incredibly problematic. I do not support this \u201cpay to slay\u201d policy. Ontario should not put a price on our biodiversity. Once again, this is in direct contradiction to the goals of the ESA. The proposed changes also state that the Minister no longer needs to meet with independent experts when considering issuing permits and exemptions, which is a gross oversight.\nSummary:\nI disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act that the Government of Ontario wants to push forward.\nThe goals of the proposal are to \u201cimprove the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\u201d.\nIn contrast to these goals, the proposal is ignoring the advice of an independent scientific committee of experts.

It is giving unnecessary and damaging authority to the Minister, who has no reason to veto, suspend or delay species at risk protections. In no way do the proposed changes meet the goal of the ESA.\nI am disappointed in this proposal and charge Ontario to do better.

The very densely populated Carolinian region of southern Ontario is home to the highest concentration of endangered species in Canada. It is not surprising that habitat loss and degradation is the main reason for the decline of many of these plants and animals. These fragile species would not survive in Ontario without the protections and, supports for their recovery and the recovery of their habitats, provided by the Ontario's Endangered Species Act.\nThe endangered species are an integral part of Ontario's natural assets. We need our natural assets for protections: from severe weather events; from the environmental threats to our physical and social health, and; from the economic uncertainty that environmental degradation brings.\nThe required review of Ontario's Endangered Species Act provides a good opportunity for the government to strengthen the act. Sadly the proposed changes will instead weaken the ESA. Science based consultation and decision making should be strengthened not weakened. Municipalities or other infrastructure developers should be required to redress the damage they cause the at-risk species habitats. There are many significant problems with the proposed changes e.g.:\n- The act should not 'provide greater Minister\u2019s discretion on protections, while keeping the assessment as a science-based process at arm\u2019s length'. Habitat protection decisions should be driven by scientific expertise not Ministerial discretion.\n- The act should not give the Minister 'authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species'. Once listed the species and their habitats should be immediately protected.\n- The act should not 'allow municipalities or other infrastructure developers the option to pay a charge in lieu of completing certain on-the-ground activities required by the act'. They should be required to bear the full cost of complying with the ESA.\nWith thoughtful and responsible leadership we do not have to compromise our protections of the at-risk and endangered species to have a healthy economy. Creative solutions driven by science based consultation are needed. The proposed changes clearly lack the needed science driven solutions. Please not make these severely flawed changes and leave the ESA as it is.\n",

        "comment":"I would like to comment on the changes to the Endangered Species Act that have recently been proposed.  Each of these four concerns has been carefully weighed and no significance should be placed upon their order.\nFirst, I am disappointed and gravely concerned that sufficient time has not been allowed to assess the consequences of the changes proposed.  I understand that the Bill that contains these changes is already in its second reading period and that the motion was carried in its first reading.  I conclude from the concurrent debate and consultation processes that the latter is considered insignificant to this Government.\nSecond, the intention is to improve an act that is currently \u201cineffective in its aim to protect and recover species at risk\" (from the Discussion Paper).  The changes proposed do not seem to help with species protection or recovery.  Instead, they appear to facilitate impacts to these species and their habitats by taking decision-making away from experts and giving it to politicians.  For example, I am particularly concerned about giving the minister power to suspend protected species' status.  If the aim is truly to make this legislation effective at protecting and recovering species, I would like to see those provisions spelled out and additional consultation take place.\nThird, the Government is aware of its duty to consult with First Nations relative to any developments that take place within their territory.  It was my hope that the one of the updates to this Act would articulate more fully how this duty would be fulfilled.  I am disappointed that this communication is missing from the proposed changes.\nLastly, it is simply impossible to protect and\/or recover a species without protecting its habitat.  Eliminating or suspending, no matter how temporarily, the legislation of protected habitat can only have negative impacts on the species.\nThank you for your consideration.\n",

        "comment":"May 18, 2019\nPublic Input Coordinator\nMinistry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks\nSpecies Conservation Policy Branch\n300 Water Street\nFloor 5N\nPeterborough, Ontario\nK9J 3C7\nDear Sir\/Madam,\nRE: ERO #013-5033 Review of the Endangered Species Act, 2007\nI strongly oppose proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, 2007 (ESA) put forward in Schedule 5 of Bill 108. The proposed changes to the ESA will negate the original purpose of the act which was to, protect Ontario\u2019s most venerable flora and fauna species. The act was put into place to provide legal protections to these species and their habitat, so that their populations can recover. The changes would undermine the very foundation of the ESA: science-based listing using expert and Indigenous Traditional Knowledge, mandatory habitat protection, and legislated timelines for planning and reporting. They would allow for organizations to take advantage of the new ambiguities in the act to destroy that which the act was put into place to protect, imperiled flora and fauna and their habitats.\nI urge the government to remove Schedule 5 in its entirety from Bill 108 and thus not to proceed with the proposed changes to the ESA.\nBelow we outline our specific concerns about Schedule 5.\n1. Assessing and listing species at risk\nThe proposed changes undermine the ESA science-based approach to listing new species, delay or prevent species being added to the Species at Risk in Ontario (SARO) list, deny them of the protections that go along with being listed and endanger species in need of listing before protections are granted.\nDenying the listing of species assessed by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO). Currently the species must be listed within three months of the minister receiving the assessment from COSSARO. The proposed changes would allow the listing to be delayed for up to 12 months (proposed subsection 7(4)), as well as require public notice no later than three months after the minister receives the assessment. This transparency to the public along with the delayed listing would allow for developmental interests to destroy the species and their habitat before the species is granted legal protection. This preventable threat to imperiled species is not acceptable.\nIncreasing the minister\u2019s ability to second guess a species listing based on his interpretation of the scientific information, would further delay the recovery planning and implementation of protections necessary for at risk species survival. The current ESA allows for the minister to request a review of the COSSARO decision if \u201ccredible scientific information\u201d indicates that the listing \u201cis not appropriate\u201d (sec. 8(2)). The proposal changes the language to \u201cmay not be appropriate\u201d (proposed subsection 8(2)), the ambiguity in the new language allows the ministers ability to more broadly challenge COSSARO decisions. Under the current ESA when a species listing is challenged the species receives protection until further reassessment says other wise. The proposal would not grant species protection until the reassessment has confirmed that it is in fact worthy of protection (proposed subsections 8 (3) and (4)). Since there is no specified timeline in which the re-assessment must take place this allows for indefinite delays in the listing process. The listing of species should be based solely on good science and not the interpretation of a single person.\nThe new changes to the ESA would require COSSARO assessments be based on the species boarder \u201cbiological relevant geographic range\u201d rather than only the populations found in Ontario (proposed subsections 5(4) and (5)). This would lead to delisting of species with more stable populations in the US. Further, leading to extirpations of species at risk in Ontario that would no longer have protections in place on them and their habitats. Most of the species that would be affected are species that are at the edge of their range. Removal of these species would be detrimental to the species as a whole for several reasons. Species that live at the edge of their range show the tendency to be more tolerant of extreme conditions, with the onset of climate change this would allow them to be more adaptable to changing conditions. This adaptability may not be observed in the individuals who live in the core of their species\u2019 range making them more venerable to the affects of climate change. Habitat degradation in Southern Ontario has destroyed almost all travel corridors between Ontario and the US. This has made most of Ontario\u2019s terrestrial species at risk geographically isolated populations and they should be treated as such; there is little or no chance for genetic exchange or interaction between Ontario populations and the more stable populations found in the US. It is our responsibility to protect these genetic pools lest something happens to other populations. These species have cultural, social and economic value to Ontarian\u2019s and contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to the economy each year through numerous outdoor recreational outlets, a fact that is greatly overlooked. These species decline will be felt by Ontarians in more ways than one and will be sorely missed.\nBroadening of COSSARO membership so that it includes other than scientific experts (proposed subsections 3(4) (a) and (b)). Currently COSSARO members must have expertise in (a) a scientific discipline such as conservation biology, population dynamics, taxonomy, systematics or genetics; or (b) aboriginal traditional knowledge. Such qualifications ensure the credibility and transparency of the assessment and listing process. Every management decision is made on solid scientific findings with the inclusion of Indigenous Traditional Knowledge as should be decisions to list species imperiled. Allowing for input of a non-scientific or Indigenous knowledge base allows for political and industrial influence that pays little mind to the well being of these species.\n2. Species and Habitat Protection\nThe proposed changes would allow for, under the discretion of the minister, delaying and limiting of protections for species. This would allow for political and economic interests to weigh in on the listing of a species, a decision that should only be left to unbiased science. The ESA as it stands allows through permits and exemptions, flexibility when it comes to socio-economic issues.\nUnder the proposed changes the minister would be allowed to suspend the listing of a species for up to three years (proposed subsections 8.1(3)(b) and (5)(b)). For species that are endangered of becoming extirpated or extinct this is an unacceptable amount of time. There are several conditions that need to be met for this delay to be imposed. Of these conditions the species should have \u201ca broad range within Ontario\u201d and \u201chabitat availability is not a limiting factor\u201d. If a species were to have a broad range within Ontario and ample habitat it is most likely not in need of protection. There is no room for this within the ESA.\nProposed is a \u201cscoping of species protections where appropriate\u201d. This would allow protections to apply only to specific geographic ranges or in specific circumstances, given is an example \u201cto species that are not affected by disease\u201d (proposed subsections 8(1)(1.2) and (1.3). This could allow critical habitat and populations of species to be overlooked and not gain protections because they are not with in the targeted geographic range. The ability to develop a geographic range would undoubtedly play a role in protected geographic ranges. Furthermore, not applying protections to species that are affected by disease is oxymoronic. Species whose populations are affected by disease deserve just as much protection than those who are not as they face an imminent threat. The individuals within that population who survive the disease will then carry immunity to that disease and will then be able to pass that on to their offspring and other populations thorough genetic exchange. If we were to not provide protections for these populations those who would have become immune could be destroyed and the disease could entirely wipeout populations. Ecologically we can not allow this to happen.\n3. Species at Risk Recovery Policies\nThese proposed changes would allow for delayal of required policies and reports necessary to take action to assist species in recovery as well as reduce transparency to the public.\nCurrent guidelines require a Government Response Statement (GRS) to be produced within nine months of the publication of a Recovery Strategy (for Endangered or Threatened species) or a Management Plan (for Special Concern species). The proposed changes would allow the GRS to be delayed without any timeline under ministerial digression (proposed subsection 12.1(4)). This would affect the recovery of the species as there would be no government accountability for that species until a GRS is produced.\nThe removal of requirements to post notices on the Environmental Bill of Rights Registry when the Minister publishes Recovery Strategies or Management Plans serves no purpose (proposed subsections 11(5) and 12(4)). Posting these notices serves to provide transparency to the public of the government\u2019s fiduciary duties and responsibilities to the recovery of these species. The Environmental Bill of Rights Registry, which \u201centrenches the rights of the public to receive notice of and provide input into environmentally significant acts, regulations and policies\u201d (Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, 2013, p. 34). To hide this from public eye by posting them on an unknown government site only serves to allow the government to escape from their responsibilities to endangered species.\nUnder the current ESA it is required that the minister reviews the progress toward protection and recovery of a species no later than five years after the publication of a GRS. The proposed changes would allow the minister to specify a timeline in which the progress will be reviewed. (proposed subsection 12.2(2)(a)). The ambiguity of this language allows for timelines that would be inappropriate for the recovery of species. The current five-year period is sufficient to assess what has been done and what still needs to be done for the protection and recovery of the species.\n4. Permits, agreements and exemptions to allow harmful activities\nThrough various channels in the current ESA allow harmful activities to take place including permits, agreements and exemptions. Permits must be mediated with on-the-ground work that provides a net benefit to the species being affected. However, the lower set standard for exemptions only requires mitigation of harm.\nThe proposed changes serve only those who think that species at risk habitat has no importance other than what can be built on or extracted from it. The ESA was put into place to aid those species who have been affected by human activities, now it is our duty to protect them as best we can.  Yes, authorization processes may result in delays; but this is the Endangered Species Act, not the Endangered Business Act. Enabling economic development is NOT the purpose of the act, and so-called routine activities can have devastating cumulative impacts \u2013 aptly described as \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts.\u201d\nAllowing proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling on-the-ground requirements that would otherwise be imposed under the ESA (proposed section 20). A-fee-in-lieu would allow for industry to destroy habitat with greater ease and without providing any benefit to the species that they are affecting. The proposed changes would charge companies what would be within the \u201crange of costs\u201d that a client doing the remediation work would have charged to fulfill the requirements of the current ESA. This charge would most certainly be the lowest possible cost to the company without any real work being done to aid the species affected. Furthermore, there is no mention of a required timeline in which the remediation work must take place. With habitat only being destroyed and little if any being created endangered species will surely pushed closer to extinction.\nRemoval of the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert and to obtain Cabinet approval prior to issuing permits for harmful activities that would provide a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario (section 17(2)d permits). Currently the ESA requires the expert consulted to submit a report on the potential impacts of the proposed harmful activities on the species at risk, including an opinion on \u201cwhether the activity will jeopardize the survival or recovery of the species in Ontario.\u201d Removing these requirements would allow for activities to take place with unknown consequences. The purpose of having independent expert consultation is to ensure that the best actions are being taken for the health of that species. The removal of this process would inhibit the ability to provide appropriate remedial responses in the wake of harmful activity.\nRemoval of the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert regarding the potential impact of a regulation (e.g., an exemption regulation) on species at risk if it is likely to jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario. This change would make it easier to pass regulations that could result in serious harm to species at risk and their habitats. It would undermine the rigour and credibility of the Minister\u2019s decision.\nThose authorized by a permit to proceed with harmful activities would no longer be required to take measures to avoid adverse impacts to individual members of a species (subsections 17(2)(c)(iii) and 17(2)(d)(v)).  This proposed action would no longer provide protections to individuals in the area where harmful activities are taking place. This could be disastrous to species with a tendency to spread out and live individually in times of non-breeding, an example of this is Ontario\u2019s turtles. Biologically turtles are slow to mature and have high nest predation due to raccoon\u2019s success with living in close proximity to humans. This makes EVERY individual in that population essential to their species\u2019 survival.\nCreation of \u201clandscape agreements\u201d for proponents undertaking multiple harmful activities throughout a geographic area (proposed section 16.1). This would allow development to sweep across the landscape with little regard for all the species present. In this proposal there is little or no room for site-specific or species-specific consideration. Although it would be required for the proponent to take action to mitigate harm done, this only applies to a single species. If multiple species are found within the geographic area all but one will suffer.\nRemoval of the current requirement to provide an overall benefit to negatively impacted species when harmful activities approved under other pieces of legislation are authorized to proceed under section 18 of the ESA. Section 18 of the ESA already provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. But it is premised on providing an overall benefit to species negatively impacted. This high standard is intended to promote species recovery, whereas the proposed change aims only to ensure that steps are taken to minimize adverse effects. Minimizing adverse effects indicates that there is going to be a net loss for the species. Section 18 should remain as is so that the ESA can continue to insure the recovery of species rather than be used for damage control.\nSummary remarks\nOn May 6th, only four days after the government of Ontario tabled Bill 108 and Schedule 5, the United Nations released a report documenting extinction rates unprecedented in human history. According to the Chair of the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), \"The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide\" (IPBES media release, May 6, 2019 Paris). Species and ecosystems in Ontario are very much part of this global trend, and thus the report provides an appropriate frame for understanding the broad implications of the proposed changes to the ESA. These changes would weaken, delay, limit and remove protections for Ontario\u2019s most vulnerable plants and animals and in doing so contribute to ongoing biodiversity decline across the province. They amount to nothing less than a proposal to sacrifice the recovery of species at risk to those with vested short-term economic interests in unbridled development. These species are neither Liberal nor Conservative, they pay no mind to the bipartisan debates of this country. Their fate should not be at risk while we debate amongst ourselves.\nI urge the government to remove Schedule 5 in its entirety from Bill 108.\n",

        "comment":"I am extremely disappointed in this Government's short-sighted and regressive approach demonstrated in these amendments.    Clearly, this so-called review was never intended to \"improve\" the Endangered Species Act.   The public never asked for the review, it was never tabled at the election, and it does not serve the best interests of the general public.\nAccording to the Ministry of Envrionment, Conservation and Parks' own data, there are over 200 species at risk of disappearing in Ontario currently.  So it makes absolutely no sense to weaken the current ESA - which these proposed amendments absolutely do.\nI vehemently object to the changes being proposed to the ESA.  They are not aligned to what the government already understands about the seriousness of species loss or what the entire world understands (per the recent UN statement on the mass extinction taking place right now).   We need stronger policies and enforcement, not watered-down Acts that benefit the profitability of select few businesses that are living in the past.\nEveryone knows developers and other sectors will have no problem paying a fee to continue archaic, destructive practices to do business.      And giving a Minister, without any science background whatsover, veto rights over the scientific community is nothing less than a dictatorship.\nThe fact that these amendments have been hidden inside a housing Bill is evidence that this review is not and environmental review at all, it is a back-door means of eliminating the Act entirely.      Therefore, Schedule 5 of Bill 108 should be removed completely.   If a review of the ESA is required, it should be done with complete transparency and with the objective of improving the situation for endangered species, not making it worse.\n",

        "comment":"I wish to express my blatant opposition to the proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act. In particular, the section entitled \"Creation of Regulatory Charge and Agency\" is especially dangerous as it suggests the implementation of a \"regulatory charge that could be paid by persons who are permitted to carry out otherwise prohibited activities\". Mike Schreiner of the Green Party summed up this section most aptly when he described it as the \"Pay to Slay\" fee. Endangered species are priceless, and no amount of money will help once they are gone. I am particularly disturbed that the proposed amendments to the Act would give politicians power to override the decisions of scientists.\nThe proposed changes also seek to \"(b)roaden the approach to minimizing adverse effects for permits and agreements... by shifting the focus from \u2018individual members\u2019 of the species to the \u2018species\u2019 more generally\". When it comes to endangered species, every single individual member of that species is of unprecedented import and deserves undiluted focus and complete protection! According to these changes, the habitat of an endangered species could be destroyed after a developer pays a fee or because that same species is reported to be maintaining population numbers elsewhere in Ontario. This will be completely devastating to the precious, fleeting presence of the animals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and plants which we, as human beings, are tasked with protecting. Please put a stop to the changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act. We won't get a second chance at this!\n",

To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.\n3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.\nI believe that the proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. Given that, I strongly advise you to reconsider the proposed changes and further consult with the public and professionals, to use a collaborative and transparent approach to responsible development while also protecting SAR.\n",

        "comment":"As a former government employee, it is shameful to see what the current government is proposing. Changes to the endangered species act will defeat the purposes and mandate of the act. It seems like the current proposal will allow businesses to pay a fee to destroy natural habitats of species and protected areas. The Ford government is saying we can delay the protection of endangered species and focus on economic development for now. Yes, the fee these businesses pay will go towards a fund that \"supposedly\" will protect endangered species, but perhaps if our premier has actually graduated high school, he would know that when a species is considered endangered, it needs to be protected immediately to ensure that extinction does not occur, delaying this protection to make money in the current defeats the entire purpose. The Ford government has made the OPS an unbearable environment for its employees where staff morale has gone down the shit hole, and it disregards scientific evidences and advices that protect the environment and the public interest.\nI have provided below a link to the definition of the term \"endangered species\", and I hope that the current government still has the ability to read and understand. I was able to read since grade school, but of course I cannot hold our premier to the same standard.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to oppose many changes to the Endangered Species Act proposed in the 10th Year Review by the Ministry of Environment, Conservation & Parks. As an environmental science university student and a concerned citizen of Ontario, I am utterly disappointed by the proposed changes by the Ontario government to potentially bring devastating effects to the protected species of Ontario. Below I have listed my concerns regarding the specific changes:\n1. the MECP wants to implement the so-called  \"Canada\u2019s first independent Crown agency proposed to be called the Species at Risk Conservation Trust\" that allow developers & other\nproponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund rather than fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground\ncompensation. This completely disregards the accountability developers and other proponents are currently held under and makes it extremely easy to simply \"Pay to Slay\". This attitude of allowing money to be exchanged for precious habitat and allowance of irreversible changes leading to habitat loss is dangerous and irresponsible. Quite frankly, an economic value should not be placed on endangered species and the greed to build should not have a way around the law.\n2. The broadening of the COSSARO membership to include individuals with \"community knowledge\". COSSARO is currently composed of qualified scientists who conduct science-based assessments of whether a species is at risk. By allowing the broadening of membership and community members to join the committee, this accountability and qualification is taken away from the COSSARO. You simply cannot provide a sound judgement on the status of a species without the proper scientific background pertaining to ecology, environmental science, ecological restoration, and wildlife management. This vague term will permit many loopholes for unrestricted personnel to join the COSSARO, what is the point of the committee if anyone can join? As the government of Ontario, it is your responsibility to ensure the natural resources and habitat of Ontario native flora and fauna are protected and that comes with holding your personnel accountable and ensuring their qualifications.\n3.  Ministerial veto of automatic protections. Within the proposed changes in section 2 Defining and implementing species and habitat protections, this line is particularly concerning: \"the proposed changes would provide the Minister with authority to temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years\". This is also mentioned to be exempt from the Environmental Bill of Rights posting and regulation requirements if proposed legislative changes are passed. The public will have no notice or input on said decisions and delays, with 3 years being the timeline my concern lies in the complete destruction of habitat and eventual extinction of species at risk during this 3 year period of absolute non-transparency. With a suspension of species and habitat protection of up to 3 years, what is the point of even having a regulation at all? There is no reasonable conclusion as to why this is acceptable other than the fact that social and economic considerations are again placed before the wellbeing of species at risk. This to me is the government's statement of \" we do not care\" and as a young environmental professional it disappoints me greatly to see that the political leaders of my province has this kind of non proactive attitude in place. Species at risk are also proposed to be \"de-coupled\" from automatic protections for threatened & endangered species & their habitats and the Minister would have greater \u201cdiscretion on protections.\u201d This can be unimaginably devastating to species at risk. Despite your statement that \"the temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario\", I find it hard to believe that you would be able to ensure no jeopardizing occurs with the broad timeline of 3 years. What are the proposed plans? How will you ensure there is no jeopardizing? If you are saying that you will suspend the protection for 3 years are you implementing monitoring plans so that the species population doesn't decline at all during this period? You are not holding yourselves accountable in anyway through this statement. Coming from an ecology background, I understand the effects of ecological cascade and the catastrophe it brings. By suspending the protection of one species, there are chain reactions that will fuel into an ecosystem issue beyond the scope of a single species at risk. What we are facing will be the ecological degradation of the entire province.\nI sincerely hope you will consider my comments on the proposed changes. I come from a place of disappointment yet I remain hopeful that the Ontario government will see the urgent needs and requests from concerned citizens around the province. The proposed changes to the endangered species act is not only dangerous to the species at risk but also opens up doors for corporate greed and sets the framework for further prioritization of the economy before our native flora and fauna. We rely on the environment and co-exist with the species around us. With the authority you have over how you regulate citizens and companies, it should be an intrinsic responsibility to consider the wellbeing of species at risk (and quite frankly the environment overall) before you propose any changes to the ESA.\n",

Furthermore, we are concerned about the apparent intention to speed decisions via Ministerial discretion, even without scientific evidence.\nWe cannot support the core intention of your changes to the Endangered Species Act, 2007, that prioritizes short-run economic development and developer profitability goals at the expense of long-run stewardship of our shared scarce resources, including species that are at risk or already endangered. This is short-sighted policy. We need more effort by government to more creatively design effective protections for species, and all resources, that also support economic growth.

I am worried that the Minister can order COSSARO to review their findings and Indigenous knowledge might not be included in the Minister\u2019s opinion. Having a lower classification based on areas outside of Ontario could be damaging to species inside Ontario. I believe automatic protections on habitat and wildlife are a good thing which could help reduce flooding as well. With 1 million species at risk having more protection of habitat should be considered a good thing. I believe suspending species and habitat protections for up to three years is reckless and could cause other species to be lost and increase flood risks for properties costing taxpayers more than if the habitat remains protected. One of my major concerns is that the government can pick and choose which species receive protection for political reasons. An example being that the Government Response Statement development can be extended. I am angered by the suggestion that this registry is a duplication and don\u2019t feel that payments to allow the destruction of habitat or species is good policy.\n",

Contrary to the claims made in the documentation, the changes will not improve outcomes for species-at-risk (SAR) as they will speed and empower those who propose damaging actions for individual species and their habitats.\nThese proposals come in the same month as a UN IPBES report that demonstrates a fifth of all life forms on Earth are at risk! Every jurisdiction has responsibility to protect species better.\nThus, the increased ministerial discretion to interfere with the scientific aspects of designation of species and habitats is deeply troubling and will surely lead to arbitrary abuses of power.\nThe \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d provisions are totally unacceptable and will lead to much damage to SAR and their habitats.\nIn summary, Schedule 5 should be removed from Bill 108. Additionally, future proposals of this kind should not be buried in unrelated legislation (A housing bill in this case). That smacks of secrecy and an intention to hide changes from the public.\nMy specific concerns follow (numbers and letters reference sections in the ERO listing):\n1.A. Extending ministerial review to 12 months will impede urgent designation of endangered species\n1.B. Making regulations retroactive is fundamentally abhorrent.\n1.D. Allowing the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider a decision made on a best-science-available basis, using other science (whose????) will interfere with COSSARO impartiality.\n1.E. Excluding species based on their presence outside Ontario weakens the protection for those species. If every jurisdiction took this approach there would be no protection at all for many SAR.\n1.F. COSSARO should remain a scientific committee. Adding other members muddies the waters by taking the political level of decision-making into the scientific forum.\n2. Decoupling ministerial decisions from scientific information is unwise and damaging.\n    2.A. Suspension of protections for up to 3 years is arbitrary and potentially extremely damaging to SAR.\n    The \u201cother criteria\u201d wording allows the minister to essentially avoid the requirement of the Act, which will be extremely damaging to SAR and their habitats.\n2A.i.4 This provision weakens the Act entirely and is thus potentially very damaging for SAR. Removing mandatory timelines is a recipe for inaction on urgent files. Removing cabinet responsibility is retrograde, indicating that the government has no regard for SAR.\n3A. Timelines are removed: A recipe for inaction. What does \u201dfor some species\u201d mean? Does it indicate that some species are more important than others, in which case, what are the criteria?\n3.D. Removing responsibility to post on the ERO is retrograde. It opens the door to political secrecy and is potentially undemocratic.\n4. The \u201cpay to slay\u201d scheme is totally unacceptable. It surely must be reconsidered! And who would decide which species are on the chopping block? What are the criteria, if any?\nUnder \u201cAdditional Changes\u201d:\nA.\tThis provision should not allow the minister to ignore expert opinion.\nB.\tWhen a species is at risk, the problem does come down to individuals. It did with passenger pigeons and greater prairie chickens and eastern box turtles, and it will with every other species at risk!\nC.\tAllowing \u2018business as usual\u201d for 12 months is open to extreme abuse of SAR.\nF. This provision gives the Minister carte blanche. It is potentially very damaging for SAR as it appears to allow any other legislation to override the ESA.\nG. This permits complete freedom to abuse any SAR!\n5.B. This provision could allow non-expert personnel being deployed in situations that require expert judgment. Ministerial discretion is potentially open to abuse here.\nThe pause of protections is open to abuse and potentially very damaging to SAR.\n",

I am very disappointed that the proposed changes do not to provide a definitive fix for Forestry.  Ontario has been operating under section 55 exemptions and a cloud of uncertainty for far too many years.  The proposed changes do nothing to address this serious concern.  As a professional I understand that we all want to do the right thing for species while at the same time manage for other values and protect jobs and forest dependent communities.  Ontario's Forests are well managed while providing for endangered species. Ontario has been well served by the CFSA Crown Forest Sustainability Act.  The CFSA and Forest Management Provisions provide the basis to manage endangered species while balancing many values.  The Forest sector requires a PERMANENT SOLUTION to the ESA.  This could be accomplished thru a PERMANENT section 55 Regulatory Exemption. Endangered species are important, but so are jobs, communities and the economy.  I firmly believe that making the balanced CFSA an equivalent process to the ESA can allow Ontario to meet these objectives and protect endangered species.  I implore the Ontario Government to do the right thing and provide a permanent fix and the certainty that the forest sector needs to continue to support the Northern economy.\n",

We should not presume that we know, or can predict, which prohibited activities officials can \"safely\" allow, how much damage a species habitat can receive before that damage is \"significant.\"  Nor can we predict how well we will be able to repair the damage.  That is why the levelling of a charge, a.k.a. \"pay to slay\" levy doesn't make any sense.\nI am alarmed at the proposal to remove expert scientific advice and leave crucial decisions that could wipe out entire species in the hands of elected politicians.  This appears several times in the proposed changes, e.g.  \"remove the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert in the \u2018D\u2019 permit process and replace the requirement for LGIC approval with Minister approval.\"\nNumber one, there is no guarantee the Minister will have the slightest knowledge of ecology.\nNumber two, the Minister will ALWAYS be pressured to follow the Premier's agenda.  Even when s\/he knows in their heart and mind it is the scientifically and morally wrong thing to do, it will be a tough choice to risk losing one's job as Minister by going against Premier's directives.\nFor these reasons, I am strongly opposed to giving the Minister the power to \"temporarily suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for some newly-listed species\"  (Section 2) or to\"Give the Minister discretion to extend the nine-month Government Response Statement development timeline, for some species,\"  or any of the other discretionary powers proposed for the Minister in the Act.\nWe need sound scientific decision-making.\nWe cannot afford to let our environment and our ecosystem be destroyed just so the government can win the next election.\nI am writing to you because I have children and grandchildren who I want to live in a healthy world.

If there is any province that needs evidence-based decision making it would be Ontario.\n1. I am deeply concerned about the proposed change that would allow developers and municipalities to pay a fee in lieu of undertaking on-the-ground protections for SAR. You state that the funds collected would be used \"to fund only those activities that are reasonably likely to support the protection and recovery of prescribed species.\"First, the term \"reasonably likely\" is weak and open to too much interpretation that could cause further damage to SAR. Second, I disagree with this tactic and would argue that the best activities that are \"reasonably likely\" to support the protection and recovery of prescribed species at risk are to not allow further development where they currently exist and to not offer a way to pay. Allowing developers to pay a charge rather than dealing with the impacts on SAR directly will disconnect the developer from understanding the impacts of their actions on the local environment. Furthermore, it is stated that the developers would still need to consider \"reasonable alternatives\" for their activities, and would have to take \"steps to minimize the adverse effects of the activity on SAR,\" but I think this language is also weak and open to too much interpretation that could effectively cause more damage to species at risk.\n2. 2.  I disagree with the proposed change that would \"Require COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened.\" Many species at risk in southern Ontario are at the northern limits of their ranges which can extend into the United States. The northern populations of SAR in Ontario, and habitat for species at risk in Ontario are important for future adaptation to climate change for the species at risk in all of its range.\n3. I disagree with the proposed change to the ESA that would \"De-couple the listing process from automatic protections\" and grant the minister more discretion to suspend protections for species for up to three years if the prohibitions would have social or economic impacts. Placing concern for economy over the environment is one of the main reasons why there are species at risk of extinction in the first place, so putting the ability of the Minister to suspend protections for economic concerns is counter intuitive and will undermine species protections in Ontario. Automatic protection is the best way to protect species at risk.\n4. I am concerned about broadening the membership of COSSARO to those who have \"community knowledge.\" This is a vague term that needs to be further defined because it is too open to interpretation and could open up COSSARO to people that have a different agenda or don't have adequate conservation knowledge to make informed decisions. COSSARO needs to be upheld as an expert panel of scientists that understand how to scientifically assess species at risk.\n5. I disagree with the proposed change that would remove the requirement of the Minister to consult with an independent expert in the regulatory and permitting process.\n6. I am concerned about the proposed changes that would allow the Minister to delay the nine-month Government Response Statement and to \"extend timelines for conducting the review of progress towards protection and recovery based on individual species\u2019 needs.\" The UN just released a major report stating that over 1 million species are at risk of imminent extinction.

The proposed changes to the ESA will negate the original purpose of the act which was to, protect Ontario\u2019s most venerable flora and fauna species. The act was put into place to provide legal protections to these species and their habitat, so that their populations can recover. The changes would undermine the very foundation of the ESA: science-based listing using expert and Indigenous Traditional Knowledge, mandatory habitat protection, and legislated timelines for planning and reporting. They would allow for organizations to take advantage of the new ambiguities in the act to destroy that which the act was put into place to protect, imperiled flora and fauna and their habitats.\nThe richness of habitat in the Oak Ridges Moraine and Greenbelt region is evident in the sight of turtles sunbathing on stream banks, the sound of birdsongs from the trees and the flicker of tiny movements in the grass as small mammals duck in and out. Slick-skinned salamanders and tiny, brightly striped fish rely almost entirely on the land and water of the Greenbelt for their survival. Indeed, the Greenbelt is home to 78 of over 200 provincially listed species at risk in Ontario. Their wavering but continued presence serves as a reminder of the importance in this area of the woodlands, wetlands, meadows, rivers and streams. Under Premier Harris, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act 2001 was supported by all parties to recognize and protect this important land form and the species at risk that live here.\nWe urge the government to remove Schedule 5 in its entirety from Bill 108 and thus not to proceed with the proposed changes to the ESA.\nBelow we outline our specific concerns about Schedule 5.\n1. Assessing and listing species at risk\nThe proposed changes undermine the ESA science-based approach to listing new species, delay or prevent species being added to the Species at Risk in Ontario (SARO) list, deny them of the protections that go along with being listed and endanger species in need of listing before protections are granted.\ni.\tDenying the listing of species assessed by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO). Currently the species must be listed within three months of the minister receiving the assessment from COSSARO. The proposed changes would allow the listing to be delayed for up to 12 months (proposed subsection 7(4)), as well as require public notice no later than three months after the minister receives the assessment. This transparency to the public along with the delayed listing would allow for developmental interests to destroy the species and their habitat before the species is granted legal protection. This preventable threat to imperiled species is not acceptable.\nii.\tIncreasing the minister\u2019s ability to second guess a species listing based on his interpretation of the scientific information, would further delay the recovery planning and implementation of protections necessary for at risk species survival. The current ESA allows for the minister to request a review of the COSSARO decision if \u201ccredible scientific information\u201d indicates that the listing \u201cis not appropriate\u201d (sec. 8(2)). The proposal changes the language to \u201cmay not be appropriate\u201d (proposed subsection 8(2)), the ambiguity in the new language allows the ministers ability to more broadly challenge COSSARO decisions. Under the current ESA when a species listing is challenged the species receives protection until further reassessment says other wise. The proposal would not grant species protection until the reassessment has confirmed that it is in fact worthy of protection (proposed subsections 8 (3) and (4)). Since there is no specified timeline in which the re-assessment must take place this allows for indefinite delays in the listing process. The listing of species should be based solely on good science and not the interpretation of a single person.\niii.\tThe new changes to the ESA would require COSSARO assessments be based on the species boarder \u201cbiological relevant geographic range\u201d rather than only the populations found in Ontario (proposed subsections 5(4) and (5)). This would lead to delisting of species with more stable populations in the US. Further, leading to extirpations of species at risk in Ontario that would no longer have protections in place on them and their habitats. Most of the species that would be affected are species that are at the edge of their range. Removal of these species would be detrimental to the species as a whole for several reasons. Species that live at the edge of their range show the tendency to be more tolerant of extreme conditions, with the onset of climate change this would allow them to be more adaptable to changing conditions. This adaptability may not be observed in the individuals who live in the core of their species\u2019 range making them more venerable to the affects of climate change. Habitat degradation in Southern Ontario has destroyed almost all travel corridors between Ontario and the US. This has made most of Ontario\u2019s terrestrial species at risk geographically isolated populations and they should be treated as such; there is little or no chance for genetic exchange or interaction between Ontario populations and the more stable populations found in the US. It is our responsibility to protect these genetic pools lest something happens to other populations. These species have cultural, social and economic value to Ontarian\u2019s and contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to the economy each year through numerous outdoor recreational outlets, a fact that is greatly overlooked. These species decline will be felt by Ontarians in more ways than one and will be sorely missed.\niv.\tBroadening of COSSARO membership so that it includes other than scientific experts (proposed subsections 3(4) (a) and (b)). Currently COSSARO members must have expertise in (a) a scientific discipline such as conservation biology, population dynamics, taxonomy, systematics or genetics; or (b) aboriginal traditional knowledge. Such qualifications ensure the credibility and transparency of the assessment and listing process. Every management decision is made on solid scientific findings with the inclusion of Indigenous Traditional Knowledge as should be decisions to list species imperiled. Allowing for input of a non-scientific or Indigenous knowledge base allows for political and industrial influence that pays little mind to the well being of these species.\n2. Species and Habitat Protection\nThe proposed changes would allow for, under the discretion of the minister, delaying and limiting of protections for species. This would allow for political and economic interests to weigh in on the listing of a species, a decision that should only be left to unbiased science. The ESA as it stands allows through permits and exemptions, flexibility when it comes to socio-economic issues.\ni.\tUnder the proposed changes the minister would be allowed to suspend the listing of a species for up to three years (proposed subsections 8.1(3)(b) and (5)(b)). For species that are endangered of becoming extirpated or extinct this is an unacceptable amount of time. There are several conditions that need to be met for this delay to be imposed. Of these conditions the species should have \u201ca broad range within Ontario\u201d and \u201chabitat availability is not a limiting factor\u201d. If a species were to have a broad range within Ontario and ample habitat it is most likely not in need of protection. There is no room for this within the ESA.\nii.\tProposed is a \u201cscoping of species protections where appropriate\u201d. This would allow protections to apply only to specific geographic ranges or in specific circumstances, given is an example \u201cto species that are not affected by disease\u201d (proposed subsections 8(1)(1.2) and (1.3). This could allow critical habitat and populations of species to be overlooked and not gain protections because they are not with in the targeted geographic range. The ability to develop a geographic range would undoubtedly play a role in protected geographic ranges. Furthermore, not applying protections to species that are affected by disease is oxymoronic. Species whose populations are affected by disease deserve just as much protection than those who are not as they face an imminent threat. The individuals within that population who survive the disease will then carry immunity to that disease and will then be able to pass that on to their offspring and other populations thorough genetic exchange. If we were to not provide protections for these populations those who would have become immune could be destroyed and the disease could entirely wipeout populations. Ecologically we can not allow this to happen.\n3. Species at Risk Recovery Policies\nThese proposed changes would allow for delayal of required policies and reports necessary to take action to assist species in recovery as well as reduce transparency to the public.\ni.\tCurrent guidelines require a Government Response Statement (GRS) to be produced within nine months of the publication of a Recovery Strategy (for Endangered or Threatened species) or a Management Plan (for Special Concern species). The proposed changes would allow the GRS to be delayed without any timeline under ministerial digression (proposed subsection 12.1(4)). This would affect the recovery of the species as there would be no government accountability for that species until a GRS is produced.\nii.\tThe removal of requirements to post notices on the Environmental Bill of Rights Registry when the Minister publishes Recovery Strategies or Management Plans serves no purpose (proposed subsections 11(5) and 12(4)). Posting these notices serves to provide transparency to the public of the government\u2019s fiduciary duties and responsibilities to the recovery of these species. The Environmental Bill of Rights Registry, which \u201centrenches the rights of the public to receive notice of and provide input into environmentally significant acts, regulations and policies\u201d (Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, 2013, p. 34). To hide this from public eye by posting them on an unknown government site only serves to allow the government to escape from their responsibilities to endangered species.\niii.\tUnder the current ESA it is required that the minister reviews the progress toward protection and recovery of a species no later than five years after the publication of a GRS. The proposed changes would allow the minister to specify a timeline in which the progress will be reviewed. (proposed subsection 12.2(2)(a)). The ambiguity of this language allows for timelines that would be inappropriate for the recovery of species. The current five-year period is sufficient to assess what has been done and what still needs to be done for the protection and recovery of the species.\n4. Permits, agreements and exemptions to allow harmful activities\nThrough various channels in the current ESA allow harmful activities to take place including permits, agreements and exemptions. Permits must be mediated with on-the-ground work that provides a net benefit to the species being affected. However, the lower set standard for exemptions only requires mitigation of harm.\nThe proposed changes serve only those who think that species at risk habitat has no importance other than what can be built on or extracted from it. The ESA was put into place to aid those species who have been affected by human activities, now it is our duty to protect them as best we can.  Yes, authorization processes may result in delays; but this is the Endangered Species Act and should protect these species. Enabling economic development is NOT the purpose of the act, and so-called routine activities can have devastating cumulative impacts \u2013 aptly described as \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts.\u201d\ni.\tAllowing proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling on-the-ground requirements that would otherwise be imposed under the ESA (proposed section 20). A-fee-in-lieu would allow for industry to destroy habitat with greater ease and without providing any benefit to the species that they are affecting. The proposed changes would charge companies what would be within the \u201crange of costs\u201d that a client doing the remediation work would have charged to fulfill the requirements of the current ESA. This charge would most certainly be the lowest possible cost to the company without any real work being done to aid the species affected. Furthermore, there is no mention of a required timeline in which the remediation work must take place. With habitat only being destroyed and little if any being created endangered species will surely pushed closer to extinction.\nii.\tRemoval of the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert and to obtain Cabinet approval prior to issuing permits for harmful activities that would provide a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario (section 17(2)d permits). Currently the ESA requires the expert consulted to submit a report on the potential impacts of the proposed harmful activities on the species at risk, including an opinion on \u201cwhether the activity will jeopardize the survival or recovery of the species in Ontario.\u201d Removing these requirements would allow for activities to take place with unknown consequences. The purpose of having independent expert consultation is to ensure that the best actions are being taken for the health of that species. The removal of this process would inhibit the ability to provide appropriate remedial responses in the wake of harmful activity.\niii.\tRemoval of the requirement for the Minister to consult with an independent expert regarding the potential impact of a regulation (e.g., an exemption regulation) on species at risk if it is likely to jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario. This change would make it easier to pass regulations that could result in serious harm to species at risk and their habitats. It would undermine the rigour and credibility of the Minister\u2019s decision.\niv.\tThose authorized by a permit to proceed with harmful activities would no longer be required to take measures to avoid adverse impacts to individual members of a species (subsections 17(2)(c)(iii) and 17(2)(d)(v)).  This proposed action would no longer provide protections to individuals in the area where harmful activities are taking place. This could be disastrous to species with a tendency to spread out and live individually in times of non-breeding, an example of this is Ontario\u2019s turtles. Biologically turtles are slow to mature and have high nest predation due to raccoon\u2019s success with living in close proximity to humans. This makes EVERY individual in that population essential to their species\u2019 survival.\nv.\tCreation of \u201clandscape agreements\u201d for proponents undertaking multiple harmful activities throughout a geographic area (proposed section 16.1). This would allow development to sweep across the landscape with little regard for all the species present. In this proposal there is little or no room for site-specific or species-specific consideration. Although it would be required for the proponent to take action to mitigate harm done, this only applies to a single species. If multiple species are found within the geographic area all but one will suffer.\nvi.\tRemoval of the current requirement to provide an overall benefit to negatively impacted species when harmful activities approved under other pieces of legislation are authorized to proceed under section 18 of the ESA. Section 18 of the ESA already provides a means to harmonize its requirements with other legislative or regulatory frameworks. But it is premised on providing an overall benefit to species negatively impacted. This high standard is intended to promote species recovery, whereas the proposed change aims only to ensure that steps are taken to minimize adverse effects. Minimizing adverse effects indicates that there is going to be a net loss for the species. Section 18 should remain as is so that the ESA can continue to ensure the recovery of species rather than be used for damage control.\nSummary remarks\nOn May 6th, only four days after the government of Ontario tabled Bill 108 and Schedule 5, the United Nations released a report documenting extinction rates unprecedented in human history. According to the Chair of the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), \"The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide\" (IPBES media release, May 6, 2019 Paris). Species and ecosystems in Ontario are very much part of this global trend, and thus the report provides an appropriate frame for understanding the broad implications of the proposed changes to the ESA. These changes would weaken, delay, limit and remove protections for Ontario\u2019s most vulnerable plants and animals and in doing so contribute to ongoing biodiversity decline across the province. They amount to nothing less than a proposal to sacrifice the recovery of species at risk to those with vested short-term economic interests in unbridled development. These species are neither Liberal nor Conservative, they pay no mind to the bipartisan debates of this country. Their fate should not be at risk while we debate amongst ourselves.\nWe urge the government to remove Schedule 5 in its entirety from Bill 108.\n",

Ontario is the most densely populated province with the highest concentration of endangered species. If there is any province that needs evidence-based decision making it would be Ontario.\n1. I am deeply concerned about the proposed change that would allow developers and municipalities to pay a fee in lieu of undertaking on-the-ground protections for SAR. You state that the funds collected would be used \"to fund only those activities that are reasonably likely to support the protection and recovery of prescribed species.\"First, the term \"reasonably likely\" is weak and open to too much interpretation that could cause further damage to SAR. Second, I disagree with this tactic and would argue that the best activities that are \"reasonably likely\" to support the protection and recovery of prescribed species at risk are to not allow further development where they currently exist and to not offer a way to pay. Allowing developers to pay a charge rather than dealing with the impacts on SAR directly will disconnect the developer from understanding the impacts of their actions on the local environment. Furthermore, it is stated that the developers would still need to consider \"reasonable alternatives\" for their activities, and would have to take \"steps to minimize the adverse effects of the activity on SAR,\" but I think this language is also weak and open to too much interpretation that could effectively cause more damage to species at risk.\n2.  I disagree with the proposed change that would \"Require COSSARO to consider a species\u2019 condition around its broader biologically relevant geographic area, inside and outside Ontario, before classifying a species as endangered or threatened.\" Many species at risk in southern Ontario are at the northern limits of their ranges which can extend into the United States. The northern populations of SAR in Ontario, and habitat for species at risk in Ontario are important for future adaptation to climate change for the species at risk in all of its range.\n3. I disagree with the proposed change to the ESA that would \"De-couple the listing process from automatic protections\" and grant the minister more discretion to suspend protections for species for up to three years if the prohibitions would have social or economic impacts. Placing concern for economy over the environment is one of the main reasons why there are species at risk of extinction in the first place, so putting the ability of the Minister to suspend protections for economic concerns is counter intuitive and will undermine species protections in Ontario. Automatic protection is the best way to protect species at risk.\n4. I am concerned about broadening the membership of COSSARO to those who have \"community knowledge.\" This is a vague term that needs to be further defined because it is too open to interpretation and could open up COSSARO to people that have a different agenda or don't have adequate conservation knowledge to make informed decisions. COSSARO needs to be upheld as an expert panel of scientists that understand how to scientifically assess species at risk.\n5. I disagree with the proposed change that would remove the requirement of the Minister to consult with an independent expert in the regulatory and permitting process. Experts are experts for a reason, and there should be independent experts to keep the Minister in check.\n6. I am concerned about the proposed changes that would allow the Minister to delay the nine-month Government Response Statement and to \"extend timelines for conducting the review of progress towards protection and recovery based on individual species\u2019 needs.\" Furthermore, I am strongly against the proposed change to delay the time period for when the Minister has to list a species based on COSSARO's report from 3 to 12 months. That is an extra nine months of delay where species at risk are not protected from killing, harm, or habitat destruction. The UN just released a major report stating that over 1 million species are at risk of imminent extinction. We need swift action to protect Ontario's biodiversity, not more delays.\n7. I am opposed to the changes in the listing process that would \"Allow the Minister to require COSSARO to reconsider the classification of a species\" that is not currently listed based on the opinion of the Minister. Allowing the Minister to send back, for a second review, a recommendation from COSSARO to list a species is another delay that will allow continued killing, harm, and habitat loss of species that need protection. There is no timeline stated for this process which could effectively mean that the fate of the species protection could be in limbo for months to years. Furthermore, the power that would allow the Minister to suspend a species listing should be removed from the proposed changes as this power would result in threats to the species at risk to continue. These proposed changes will result in fewer species being listed and for the status quo of species loss and extinction to continue.\nThe proposed changes are inconsistent with, and will undermine the purpose of, the Endangered Species Act which is to protect species at risk in Ontario. I mentioned this already but the UN just released a report outlining the fact that over a million species are at risk of extinction worldwide and that the extinction rate is accelerating. The primary driver of loss is changes in land and sea use. The proposed changes to Ontario's ESA would allow for more land to be altered by development without consideration of species at risk. I would also like to mention that another report was just released that states that Canada is warming at twice the global rate which will place added stress on species at risk, so more protections need to be in place, not more delays.\nBy rolling back protections on species at risk in Ontario through these proposed changes, the government of Ontario is not showing any actual concern for the future of Ontario's biodiversity and is continuing with the status quo of favouring economy over environment. These two things, economy and environment, are not mutually exclusive. We need a healthy and thriving ecology to support a sustainable economy, and we are at a point in history where we need to be creative and build the economy in ways that don't undermine the integrity of the environment by focussing on green energy and ecological restoration.\nThank you for accepting my comments on this issue.\n",

        "comment":"\u200b\nMany species are declining across the world and in Canada. The province of Ontario is not immune to these declines; there are currently more than 200 species at risk (SAR) in the province. The main purpose of the ESA should be to protect species, not to expedite development. Any changes to the ESA should be made with great care, as without diligent legislation there is a risk of additional habitat loss and population declines. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extirpated from Ontario, and such losses to our natural heritage are unacceptable in the face of so many other unmitigated threats to biodiversity. Ontario has an opportunity to be a leader in biodiversity conservation, with an ESA that is the gold standard to which other jurisdictions aspire.\nI agree that the public should be notified quickly of COSSARO\u2019s species\u2019 assessments, but listing should be immediate. Waiting one year after the species is listed could result in harmful effects on the species. I must stress that a lot of these species, particularly amphibians and reptiles, are already facing rapid declines, so immediate protection is strongly recommended. I also strongly disagree with the possible suspension of listings for up to three years, as such long delays could allow large developments and lack of mitigation, potentially wiping out populations of species that should be listed but whose listings have been unnecessarily delayed. Furthermore, threatened and endangered species should have habitat regulations, as these species are especially vulnerable.\nCOSSARO is an independent committee with expertise in scientific disciplines and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (TEK), and these individuals take great care and consideration when making decisions about which species should be listed as at risk. I do agree with broadening member qualifications, but this should not take away from the legitimacy of the organization. The current proposal calls for including those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d \u2013 a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have unbiased expertise in species assessment or that have a different agenda altogether. I still strongly oppose that the minister should be able to overrule decisions made by COSSARO, as such veto power explicitly undermines the arms-length scientific approach that is supposed to be used to assess species.\nI also strongly oppose COSSARO being required to base its assessments on the status of a species throughout its range, as opposed to in Ontario only. For species that have a small portion of their range in Ontario, these populations often present unique adaptations and reservoirs of genetic variation, facilitating resilience to climate change. Loss of our Ontario populations means loss of global diversity in the species. As Aldo Leopold said, \u201cTo keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.\u201d Allowing species to be wiped out in Ontario simply because they occur elsewhere is short-sighted.\nThe Species at Risk conservation trust could be a powerful tool under some circumstances, but there is great room for such a program to be abused. This trust could allow for areas facing development to be developed by simply paying into the trust as opposed to protecting the resident species at risk. Such a proposal runs the risk of jeopardizing the social license that many large companies currently have. If companies are seen to be \u201cbuying\u201d the right to destroy the habitat of endangered species, they will be viewed as poor corporate citizens and likely lose business in the long term. Under certain circumstances, SAR habitat may be lost, and such a program could result in compensatory habitat creation elsewhere. In those cases there should result a net gain in quality SAR habitat for the same species. Net gains or losses should not be measured as simplistic aerial extent of habitat lost versus created, as the quality of habitat and whether it is actually occupied by viable subpopulations is more meaningful. Although complex to measure, indicators that are relevant to the SAR classification system should be used, such as numbers of mature individuals, survival rates, reproductive rates, area of occupancy, and long-term viability of the mitigation project.\nThe proposed changes include amending the act to strike out \u201cthe environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d and substituting \u201ca website maintained by the Government of Ontario\u201d. Such a change would mean that the opportunity for public input is lost.  Removing opportunities for public input eliminates government accountability to the public and prevents the public to participate in the protection and recovery of species at risk.\n\u200bLastly, I agree that better enforcement is necessary to protect SAR. There is a strong need for enforcement of the ESA through fines and if necessary, incarceration.\nThe purposes of the ESA are:\n1. To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge.\n2. To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk.\n3. To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk. 2007, c. 6, s. 1.\nI believe that the proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals. Given that, I strongly advise you to reconsider the proposed changes and further consult with the public and professionals, to use a collaborative and transparent approach to responsible development while also protecting SAR.\n",

Canada still has something to protect so we need to at least protect the legislation that is attempting to protect its endangered species. Proposed legislative amendments needs to be science-based, not politically or financially motivated.\nThe habitat for endangered species is already quite fragmented in southern Ontario, reduced further due to low-density urban sprawl. Proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) under Section 5 of Bill 108, \u201cMore Homes, More Choice Act\u201d makes endangered species more susceptible to destruction rather than lending to furthering their protection.\nProtecting communities, protecting the environment should be a priority for this government.\nAmendments to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) defeats the purpose of the ESA. The ESA was developed to \u201cprotect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk\u201d. The proposed amendments as described below provide developers with exemptions and contradict this goal.\nFirst, the proposal to charge a fee so developers would be able to destroy the fragile ecology of the lands that harbour protected species is quite problematic as proposed under sections 20.1 to 20.18. Creating a fund to compensate for the loss of endangered species in developing the lands that would normally be protected under sections 9 to 10 of the ESA, is not going to bring back a species once they are extinct.\nSecond, stretching timelines to list species as endangered as proposed under section 7(4), 8(3), 8(4), 8.1 and 8.2 only further undermines the overall objective of the endangered species act. One must weigh the cost of wiping out the last of the species to the expense of delaying business for someone.\nThird, new subsections 9 (1.2 to 1.4) which gives the Minister the power to make regulations which override science-based species listings is unacceptable. The continuation of science-based listing of species at risk by the independent panel of scientists of COSSARO and the protection of their habitats (sec. 9, 10) is a cornerstone of the ESA and must remain as such. Based on the news and personal pledges, people in Ontario value evidence-based policies not motivated by the special interests of a few small parties, which would be suspect, if ministerial discretion about protection became policy. The ESA already provides enough flexibility through permits and exemptions.\nFourth, the landscaping agreements for developers in sec. 16.1, is problematic because it goes beyond the landscape-level to large-scale level building authorizations and with obviously larger impacts. Although \u201clandscaping\u201d is a nice buzzword, the ecosystem and species-specific approaches are the equivalent as per sec. 13, 14 and so there is no reason for this new amendment.\nFifth, expanding those who can join the COSSARO advisory panel with those without scientific or aboriginal-knowledge, or to those who have an invested interest in the decision is not best-practice and is dangerous. There is no reason to change the way the current system appoints people via the Lieutenant Governor. As currently proposed, Bill 108 offers few details on who will be allowed into the broadened membership of the advisory panel.\nIn summary, I would like to point out that there is a fundamental difference between revising and amending the law and improving its implementation which seems to be the theme of many critics of Bill 108. To improve outcomes for species at risk we need to improve ESA implementation not weaken the law.\nAlthough, there was a news release of a new fund to do exactly this, exactly one month ago at website : https:\/\/news.ontario.ca\/ene\/en\/2019\/04\/implementing-recommendations-of-\u2026 the deadline to apply was so time- limited and given its timeframe coinciding with this submission process, I expect there wasn\u2019t enough time for many organizations or interested parties to apply.  By reconsidering expanding the deadline and announcing this to those who submit in this process may be a positive step to helping fix the problem.\nThank you for taking the time to read and consider these concerns. Lastly, I would like to point out that as a landowner, organizations with broad mandates may not necessarily represent the general population of its membership but these organisations seem to have a great deal of influence. The fact of the matter is that we will all be poorer by the loss of these species which are endangered if we weaken the laws that protect them. I urge you remove Schedule 5 from Bill 108 (the schedule that contains the changes to the Endangered Species Act).\n",

I strongly disagree that this should be changed. In the area of species at risk and environmental well-being, unbiased, species-at-risk experts must be  consulted and respected in order to understand the long-term impact and unintended consequences of new legislation and regulations\nDecisions around species-at-risk must be made by species-at-risk experts and not developers and lobbyists.  The Minister should not, nor anyone else,   have the ability to  suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years based on social or economic considerations.\nThe Minister would be able to limit ESA protections so that they apply only in specific geographies or under specific circumstance. The Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario should  be required to base its assessments on the status of a species in Ontario and not throughout its range. This is especially important where a southern Ontario endangered species at the northern limit of their range may receive less or no protection, depending on their status outside Ontario. This is especially concerning in the face of climate change because healthy species populations are needed at their northern limits to help species adapt to changing climatic conditions.\nI understand the importance of development and economic sustainability, but we lose biodiversity we are losing other economic gains.

        "comment":"1) Landscape Approaches\nWhere recovery approaches for individual species conflict with one another, a landscape-level approach can be effective in some cases as a compliment, but certainly not as a replacement.\nThe act already includes the tools needed to apply a landscape approach. No changes to the legislation are needed to implement this.\nExisting landscape connectivity modeling tools based on circuit theory (e.g. circuitscape) have been successfully used by ontario university researchers and by research scientists in the ministry of natural resources to model the movements or gene flow of specific species or species guilds.\n2) Listing Processes\nThe discussion paper cites the challenge of not enough public notice before listing, and that automatic listing may result in delays or cost to development projects.\nEvidence from the federal Species at Risk Act and former ESA legislation suggests that \u201cpolitical listing\u201d often results in delayed protections or no protections at all. Longer timelines for listings and delayed protections serves only the developers who stand to experience complications from listing, it in no way serves the species that are in dire need of protection and recover.\nMany improvements could be made with regard to COSARROs process of assessment and classification. COSARRO members are not paid for their work. With compensation they would be able to do much more in terms of communications\/notifications with stakeholders. To increase transparency, they would also be able to invest in monitoring of recovery effort effectiveness (to improve the scientific basis of assessments).\n3) Recovery Processes & Habitat\nThere is no benefit to changing the legislated timelines of the GRS and progress reviews. Evidence suggests that the most effective way to help species recover is by protecting habitat, and therefore that habitat regulations are extremely valuable and necessary.\nMore attention should be devoted to coordinating the process of GRS and recovery strategies by creating recovery strategies and GRS for multiple species sharing particular geographies or facing similar threats (i.e. landscape approach).\n4) Authorization Processes\nA habitat banking system (I.e. paying into a conservation fund) in lieu of activity-based requirements is not sufficient as there is no assurance that direct compensation for impacts will be completed. Instead, the focus should be on habitat protection measures that are effective for listed species and benefit multiple species, and addressing the needs of species as early as possible in development activities (i.e. at the planning stage). The more protection is deferred, the more complicated and expensive it becomes to address recovery needs\n",

Please consider this my submission to the public consultation.\nAs you know, more than 230 species in Ontario are currently at risk. Habitat loss and degradation are the major drivers of decline. That is why it\u2019s more important than ever to strengthen protections for wildlife, especially those already at risk.\nThe Endangered Species Act already provides significant exemptions to industry. We need legislation that makes it harder \u2014 not easier \u2014 for habitat to be destroyed. While I appreciate the need to encourage development, we can\u2019t do so at the expense of habitat and wildlife, or soon we will have nothing left. Limits must be set. Businesses of the future will demand healthy, thriving ecosystems in which to function. By opening for business at any expense, we will soon be paying the ultimate price through destruction of the nature that sustains us.\nI, therefore, am asking you to:\n- Prioritize the recovery of at-risk species over the demands of developers.\n- Repeal the industry exemptions under section 55.\n- Ensure that habitat is protected and restored to facilitate species recovery, instead of merely mitigating the adverse impacts of harmful activities.\nA strong Endangered Species Act will mean a stronger Ontario now and in the future.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act will gut the program and render it ineffectual in protecting Ontario's biodiversity. I cannot support the proposed changes as written. I believe that accepting these changes and putting them into practice would be a huge step backwards for Ontario, and would open the door for corruption.\nOne of my major concerns with the proposed changes is the amount of power the Minister will wield. These changes allow the Minister to veto recommendations from COSSARO. This is a gross misuse of power. The Minister should not be able to undermine a committee composed of independent experts based only on the Minister's opinion. Not only does this open the door for major corruption from outside sources, but this also isn't logical. Ministers do not have to come from a scientific background relevant to their position - our current Minister, Rod Phillips, has no scientific background or training in environmental policy, conservation, or restoration science, and his previous experience was as the former CEO of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. Allowing someone without the background or understanding of species to veto the decisions of people who do have this specialized knowledge is, frankly, asinine. This increased authority for the Minister is a recurring theme in the proposal, exacerbating other problematic proposed changes.\nAnother major problem with the proposed changes are the added delays at almost every step of the process. Currently, COSSARO submits a report to the Minister, who must then list the species on the SARO list within 3 months. The proposed changes extend this time period to 12 months, a needless delay and one that can be very harmful to species that are struggling to survive. Further delays are combined with the extra power that would be allotted to the Minister, as the Minister can decide to delay the development of Government Response Statements and review of the protection and recovery progress. There is no reason for these delays, which only hinder progress. Furthermore, the Minister can decide to suspend species and habitat protections for up to three years for newly listed species. This means that even if the Minister doesn't veto the recommendation, they can wait 12 months to even list the species then delay protections for that species for another three years. That means that a species that is identified as endangered right now could wait 4 years before any measures are taken to protect it. By that time, it could be extinct, and Ontario would have lost an important piece of its biodiversity. None of these delays help species recoveries, nor are they based on scientific or environmentally sound reasoning.\nAnother major problem lies with issuing Endangered Species Act permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions. Allowing corporations, municipalities, or anyone else to pay a fee instead of following protections put in place by the ESA is one of the worst changes proposed. I don't support this change, or any \"pay to slay\" policy. Allowing money to decide the future of Ontario's biodiversity is a crime to those who don't have the money to fight back. The average Ontarian can't stop corporations or industry from coming into our province and doing as they please. One way that we are protected is by putting regulations like the ESA into place, so that rich people can't decide what happens to our province just because they have money. The proposed system takes these protections away from us. Once again, this problem is exacerbated by the overwhelming amount of power that the Minister will be given. Within the proposed changes, the Minister no longer needs to meet with with independent experts when considering applications for permits and exemptions. This once again means that someone with no background in the field can make decisions without truly understanding the potential ramifications of that decision. It once again opens the door to corruption.\nAnother objection I have to the proposed changes are the changes to the SARO listing protocols. These changes will result in fewer protections for edge-of-range species. Ontario is the northernmost extent of ranges for many species currently listed under SARO. Protecting species over their entire ranges is important to preserving the species as a whole.\nFinally, there is vague language around COSSARO membership being open to those with \"community knowledge\". While this seems like an effort on the part of the policy writers to be inclusive of non-traditional streams of knowledge, it is poorly defined, leaving the door to membership open to anyone who claims that they have \"community knowledge\". This language needs to be tightened up to reflect that COSSARO members need to have deep, intimate knowledge of the systems rather than superficial.\nIn summary, I disagree with the proposed changes to the Ontario Endangered Species Act. The goals of the proposal are to \"improve the effectiveness of the program for species at risk by ensuring Ontario\u2019s best-in-class endangered and threatened species protections; include advice and species\u2019 classifications from an independent scientific committee and modern approaches to enforcement and compliance; species and habitat protections; and recovery planning\". I do not think that the proposed changes meet any of these goals. It gives the Minister unprecedented (and unnecessary) power, and allows them to ignore the advice of experts. It weakens species and habitat protections, and delays the process at almost every level. It allows people with money to make decisions contrary to the will of the people who live here. It opens the door to corruption and scandal.\nI do not support these changes. I am disappointed in the proposal and charge Ontario with the creation of an ESA that actually protects our species rather than selling them out to the highest bidder. Protecting our biodiversity is of the utmost importance during the ongoing global biodiversity crisis. We need to start by protecting our species at home, and the first step to that is fixing this proposal.\n",

        "comment":"Hello,\nI'm writing to express my concerns over proposed changes in 013-5033.  We've seen unprecedented declines worldwide in species declines due to human activity world wide.  We need to continue to act locally, as a province to protect species and biodiversity in Ontario.    The proposed changes allow people to pay when developments threaten habit.  It also ignores empirical evidence and lets those with no science background to decide.   We need to understand how important it is to protect species at risk within Ontario and be leaders in their protection.  It shouldn't be about the edge of their range in Ontario but show how Ontarian's value nature.   We need to be a voice for wildlife not continue to abuse them by allowing habitat destruction.\nI've researched various other input and concur that the changes proposed do the following:\n1. \u2018Pay to Slay\u2019: Ministry of Environment, Conservation & Parks (MECP) wants to allow developers & other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund rather than fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground compensation. This reduces accountability, making it far easier to proceed with activities that harm species at risk & their habitats.\n2. Rejecting Science: The Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) is comprised of qualified scientists who perform science-based assessments of whether a species is at risk. MECP is proposing to broaden COSSARO membership so that it includes those with \u201ccommunity knowledge\u201d \u2013 a vague term that could open up COSSARO to those who do not have adequate expertise in species assessment or have a different agenda altogether.\n3. Deserting \u201cEdge of Range\u201d Species: COSSARO would be required to base its assessments not on the status of a species in Ontario, but instead on its status throughout its range. For example, southern Ontario endangered species at the northern limit of their range may receive less or no protection, depending on their status outside Ontario. This is especially concerning in the face of climate change because healthy species populations are needed at their northern limits to help species adapt to changing climatic conditions.\n4. Limiting Protections: The Minister would be able to limit Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections so that they apply only in specific geographies or under specific circumstances. This could exclude important habitats and species from protection.\n5. Ministerial Veto of Automatic Protections: The listing of species at risk would be \u201cde-coupled\u201d from automatic protections for threatened & endangered species & their habitats and the Minister would have greater \u201cdiscretion on protections.\u201d They could suspend species & habitat protections for up to three years based on social or economic considerations. Such delays would be exempted from Environmental Bill of Rights posting & consultation requirements, leaving the public with no notice & no input on such decisions. Meanwhile, those with political connections could undermine species protections without full public scrutiny.\n6. Sweeping Authorizations for Harmful Activities: MECP proposes to create \u201clandscape agreements\u201d for proponents undertaking harmful activities in multiple locations. Such an approach does not lend itself to addressing site-specific or species-specific concerns and consequently presents unwarranted additional risk for species already in peril.\n7. Dodging ESA Requirements: MECP wants to allow activities approved under other laws to be carried out without any additional authorizations under the ESA, even if they harm threatened or endangered species or their habitats. This could result in permanent exemptions from the ESA for industries like the forestry sector.\n8. Interfering with the Listing of Species at Risk: The Minister would be able to require COSSARO to reconsider its science-based listing decisions. This change would make it possible for developers and others who have the ear of government to derail the listing process if they don\u2019t like a COSSARO decision.\n9. Goodbye Expert Input: Currently, the ESA requires the Minister to consult with an independent expert prior to creating regulations that would jeopardize the survival of a species, or issuing permits for harmful activities that would provide a significant social or economic benefit to Ontario. This requirement would be removed.\n10. Delays, Delays, Delays: Multiple delays are proposed for the listing, planning and reporting on species at risk, undermining species recovery. The proposal to list species nine months after COSSARO makes its assessments public \u2013 during this time vulnerable plants, animals and their habitats could be eliminated before protections kick in.\nThank you for your consideration.\n",

John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry\nRe: Proposed Amendments to the Endangered Species Act, 2007, as outlined in Section 5 of Bill 108, More Homes, More Choice Act, 2019\nSince 1984, Carolinian Canada Coalition has been a leading ecoregional group in Canada.  We bring together thousands of people and groups who care for the environment of Ontario\u2019s most populous region, extending from the Greater Toronto Area to Grand Bend and Windsor.\nOntario\u2019s Carolinian Zone is home to approximately 200 different species at risk, almost 90% of Ontario\u2019s total.  Many of these species are found nowhere else in Canada and are critically endangered.  Why are there so many species at risk in Ontario's Carolinian Zone?  Primarily because of habitat loss.  Right now only 16% of the Carolinian Zone is natural, and in some parts of the Zone there is less than 7% natural cover.  Widely accepted guidelines recommend 30-50% natural for healthy landscapes.\nIn this context, we are writing you to express our concerns regarding proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act, 2007, as described in Section 5 of Bill 108, More Homes, More Choice Act, 2019.  Specifically,\n\u2022\tSubsection 7 (4): The Schedule amends the subsection to extend the time frame for making the regulation to 12 months (from the current 3 months) after receiving the COSSARO report.\n\u2022\tUnder new sections 8.1 and 8.2, the amendments temporarily suspend all or some of the prohibitions in subsections 9 (1) and 10 (1) of the Act with respect to the species for a period of up to three years.\n\u2022\tSubections 9(1.2) to (1.4) would \u201cgive the Minister the power to make regulations limiting the application of the prohibitions with respect to a species. The limitations may limit the prohibitions in various ways, including by indicating that some of the prohibitions do not apply, by limiting the geographic areas in which they apply or by providing that the prohibitions only apply to the species at a certain stage of their development.\u201d\n\u2022\tNew Section 16.1 allows the Minister to enter into landscape agreements authorizing \u201ca person to engage in activities that would otherwise be prohibited under Section 9 or 10 with respect to one or more species that are listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List as endangered or threatened species\u201d and states that \u201cthe species impacted by the authorized activities are not necessarily the same as the species that benefit from the beneficial actions.\u201d\n\u2022\tNew sections 20.1 to 20.18 providing for the establishment of a Species at Risk Conservation Fund also would authorizes a person to engage in activities prohibited under section 9 or 10 of the Act through payment of a charge as a condition of a permit or other authorization issued or entered into under the Act.\nIt is our position that each of these amendments could and likely would work against the protection of species, many of which are, on the basis of scientific evidence (as presented by COSSARO), known to be stressed, seriously declining, and\/or already at the brink of extirpation, at the point of listing.\nIt is our position that allowing extirpations of species in any given location in Ontario does not account for the fact that an ecosystem is made up of not just physical conditions and processes but also an intricate web of species with interdependent roles and functions (predators, prey, pollinators, oxygen-production, nutrient cycling, erosion control, carbon storage, etc.).  Removing any piece of the system, including any native species, weakens ecological integrity, and may cause irreversible damage, including the decline and potential loss of additional species.\nA widely-cited example is how the extirpation of the Gray Wolf in Yellowstone National Park resulted in erosion and declines in water quality far beyond the Park\u2019s boundaries.  This is because of the explosion of the elk population that occurred when the top predator was removed from the ecosystem.  Foraging by the high numbers of elk degraded the riparian vegetation that was integral to maintaining water quality. Reintroduction of endangered wolves to Yellowstone has resulted in marked and rapid improvements to water quality.\nThe ecosystems of Ontario\u2019s Carolinian Zone are equally fragile, and the relationships among its thousands of species are equally complex and potentially far-reaching.   It is difficult to predict the repercussions of the removal of any given native species from any given ecosystem, but it is our position that allowing extirpations is not an experiment worth embarking on, especially during a well-documented global extinction crisis.\nFurthermore, allowing extirpations of species that may not be at risk elsewhere in their range would have particularly serious consequences in the context of climate change.  Science tells us that populations tend to be smaller towards the edges of their range because ideal conditions at the range edge tend to be more limited.  This partially explains the high prevalence of rare species in Ontario\u2019s Carolinian Zone.  However, if the climate warms as science predicts, conditions found further south in the United States where these species\u2019 ranges are centred will likely become more widespread and pervasive in Ontario.  Populations of the same species further south in the United States may not be genetically as well suited to edge-of-range conditions that occur in Ontario.  If the populations in Ontario are extirpated, it may become difficult or impossible for a native species expand back into Ontario in response to climate change, resulting in a net biodiversity loss.\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that many species (especially many plants, reptiles, amphibians, insects and small mammals) already face great challenges in expanding or shifting their populations in the highly fragmented landscape of southern Ontario, where urbanization, conversion to agriculture, road networks and other infrastructure have created nearly-insurmountable barriers to their movement.  This makes it especially important to protect what little habitat is left, and to restore natural corridors and linkages on Ontario\u2019s Carolinian landscape, and to protect the remaining populations of species at risk.\nIt is our position that Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act:\n\u2022\tShould ensure that the Species at Risk in Ontario List be entirely evidence-based, and that the listing, regulation and protection at-risk species populations should not be influenced by considerations other than credible biological\/ecological science.\n\u2022\tShould result in net gains for all Ontario species at risk and for ecosystems as a whole.\n\u2022\tNeeds to be monitored as part of a rigorous, regular review process.\n\u2022\tNeeds to take climate change into consideration and should therefore ensure protection of edge-of-range species, regardless of the status of their populations in other jurisdictions.\n\u2022\tShould recognize that protecting species at risk habitat generally provides ecosystem services that contribute in an economically positive way (e.g., clean water, clean air, flood control, reduced erosion, reduced insurance costs, improved soil quality for agriculture, better recreational opportunities, better hunting, better fishing, ecotourism, education and public health benefits).\n\u2022\tShould recognize that species at risk are often critical to overall ecosystem integrity, playing important roles in the ecosystem.\n\u2022\tShould respect all constitutional obligations with First Nations (consultation requirements, free prior and informed consent, etc.) and be undertaken in accordance with, and in the spirit of, Reconciliation.\nPopulations of endangered and threatened species often persist only in the last patches of high-quality habitat on the land.  Such high-quality patches of habitat are becoming increasingly rare, especially in Ontario\u2019s Carolinian Zone.  Endangered and threatened species typically share these habitats with a great diversity other species, many of them also being sensitive to human activities.  Many of the species that share habitat with species at risk are also important to the people of Ontario.\nThe key to reversing the trend of an ever-expanding list of species at risk is not to weaken the Endangered Species Act and its protections for species on the brink.  Instead, the Province is encouraged to develop and implement policies and incentives that effectively create a balanced and secure economic environment for the business sector over the long term.  This would best be done by protecting and conserving Ontario\u2019s natural assets and the ecological goods and services these assets provide.\nComment from Carolinian Canada Coalition, a charity growing a green future for thriving communities.  www.caroliniancanada.ca\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express my opinion on the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act. As an Ontario citizen and an environmental sciences student, I strongly oppose the changes, as it is not benefiting the vast flora and fauna in the province whatsoever. A few reasons I disagree with the proposed changes are as follows:\n- Broadening the COSSARO membership so that it includes \"community knowledge\" is not beneficial at all. This leads to less credibililty, as reporting on the status of species is something that needs to be done by experienced, qualified people. By opening the committee to people that are not qualified to join, and do not hold the expertise needed, overall knowledge on at risk species in Ontario will decrease, and the right protocols to reverse declining species numbers will not be followed.\n- Limiting ESA protections should not be allowed. With this happening, certain areas could be excluded from protection. This is not okay, considering ALL flora and fauna in ALL areas of the province should be extensively protected with no hesitation.\n- Allowing activities to be approved under other laws without input from the ESA should be illegal. As an example, exempting the ESA from vital decisions in the forestry sector will be detrimental to life in the forests in Ontario. Although the forestry sector is important for our province, there are ways to benefit from this while also protecting species that call the forest their home.\nThere are many more reasons as to why I do not agree with the proposal, and I could go on and on about it. The environment is a sacred place, and to see the government wanting to implement such negative changes disappoints me to no end. We should be aiming to protecting, preserving, and having a positive impact on the world around us - and unfortunately, if the government gets to make these changes, it will be more difficult for us as citizens to preserve what's around us. With the government implementing these changes, we are only undoing what Canada as a country has worked so hard to become.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act will have a decidedly negative impact upon the survival of numerous species in this province, but I don't need to tell you that. Clearly, changes that include delaying and allowing ministerial interference in the species listing process, removing automatic protections for newly-listed species, allowing developers to pay a fine rather than undertaking recovery or mitigation actions, and reducing the role of independent science in species assessments are not designed to improve, or maintain, protections for species at risk. They blatantly delay, remove, and weaken these protections. The goal, we can easily infer, is not to improve the Endangered Species Act but rather to weaken it to remove \"red tape\" and increase activities that harm the species in question.\nTherefore, rather than explaining how the proposed changes fail species, I would like to comment on why it is important that we have legislation to protect these species in the first place.\nOntario's wildlife is the heart of our province. It is not an \"inconvenience\" to developers. We rely on wildlife for resources, food, essential services, economic development, and recreation without which Ontario would not be a suitable place to live. As all of us learned when we were young, the natural world exists in a balance where actions that are detrimental to certain species can have negative repercussions across the entire system.\nOntario's current species at risk are the canaries in the coal mine of environmentally destructive practises. They are not to be protected simply because there is inherent value in allowing the threatened Blanding's Turtle to survive in our world (although that should be reason enough), but also because the decline of the Blanding's Turtle is a sign of general environmental destruction that is impacting other species and the overall system. If the Blanding's Turtle is extirpated from Ontario, it will be because we have lost wetlands that also provided flood resilience, purified water, and allowed our fish populations to reproduce. It will be because we allowed the expansion of roads through natural areas, increasing wildlife-related accidents that negatively impact both humans and a wide range of our province's animals. It will be because our lifestyle and laws are not in line with what it takes to live responsibly and sustainably within our environment.\nEach time habitat is protected for an at-risk species, it is protected for every species that uses or benefits from it - and that includes humans. We should be grateful to the Endangered Species Act for mandating that development and other activities are not able to entirely destroy the environment upon which we depend. We should also be grateful that they allow us the possibility to walk through this province with our children and find a Blanding's Turtle basking in a wetland, something that adds value to the lives of all who experience it.\nOntario is a wonderful place not in spite of our environment but because of it. It is time the current government realized that. We must have laws that protect the natural features of this province for the benefit of all Ontarians, rather than exploit and exterminate them for the benefit of a few wealthy developers. The proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act do the latter, and I strongly oppose them.\n",

        "comment":"I am against the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act.  Having decision makers consider the range of the species outside of Ontario to designate its rarity does nothing to preserve and protect Ontario's rare species, reduces our biodiversity and leaves that species vulnerable to threats outside of our control.\nHaving greater wait times to list species does nothing to protect that species and gives developers a longer timeline to eliminate that species from their properties before they do get listed.  If a species is designated at risk by scientists, then that species should be protected immediately.\nAllowing anyone to pay a fine to kill endangered species is a horrendous practice.  Protecting that species and its habitat is the key to bringing a species back, not paying a fine.\nOur scientists exist to assess the vulnerability of a species and they know best. These decisions should be made and based on science and never be made by politicians and the political whim of the day.\n",

They will not improve outcomes for species at risk. On the contrary, they would make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals.\nMore specifically, I do not support changes which would introduce broad ministerial discretion to interfere with the science-based listing process, to suspend and limit protections, and to ignore legislated timelines for policies and reporting. Nor do I support the \u201cpay-to-slay\u201d scheme that would grease the wheels of destruction by allowing developers and other proponents of harmful activities to pay into a fund in lieu of fulfilling requirements for on-the-ground reparation for the damage they do to species and their habitats.\nImproving outcomes for species at risk requires enforcement, not weakening, of the law. It also requires investment in stewardship, not writing off species at risk and their habitats as red tape.\n",

        "comment":"Please accept this as my comment regarding Environmental Registry posting # 013-5033, \"10th Year Review of Ontario\u2019s Endangered Species Act: Proposed changes\".\nThe ESA is important, evidence-based legislation that recognizes Ontarians\u2019 role as stewards of our beautiful province, as well as sustainability as key to our viability. The ESA seeks to ensure that development is done in a forward-looking and democratic way.\nColouring this ten year review has been concerning language about \u201cstreamlining\u201d processes, an unnecessary dichotomy established in the Minister\u2019s comment seeking \u201ca balanced approach between a healthy environment and a healthy economy,\u201d and the proposal noting that the ESA has been criticized \u201cfor creating barriers to economic development.\u201d\nMy concern is that the provincial government intends to put narrow economic interests of the few, ahead of the needs and interests of the many, including species-at-risk, as well as future generations of human life in our province, and all the ecosystems within which we live.\nAs experts and other dedicated individuals and groups will be able to provide specific comment and guidance, I will keep my comments brief.\nWe have seen this legislation go from a gold standard for environmental protection to a watered-down version under the previous government. With the industry exemptions and permitting created by that government in 2013, it is hard to imagine what \u201cbarriers\u201d might still exist to economic development in the ESA. The fact is, barriers should exist to ensure that economic development is responsible, not unfettered; that it is sustainable and democratic, and not for the needs of the few. The ESA should do just that.\nAs renowned Indigenous legal scholar John Borrows has written:\n\u201c[A]t a primary level human society is a subset of the ecosphere. The viability of our settlements requires that our ideologies and decision-making structures take account of the fact that we are embedded in nature. [\u2026] In the last decade the publication of Our Common Future popularized a vital clue about how we might start to re-frame our relationship with the environment. This report, by the World Commission on Environment and Development (The Brundtland Commission), suggested that our activities should \u2018meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u2019 This notion, termed sustainable development, advocated a renewed approach to planning human settlements that attempts to integrate human economic and natural ecological activities.\u201d\n(Emphasis added. \u201cLiving Between Water and Rocks: First Nations, Environmental Planning and Democracy,\u201d 1997. University of Toronto Law Journal. Pages 421-422.)\nI urge this government to come out of this review with a renewed and strengthened approach to species protection. Experts, and in particular Indigenous communities, must be listened to so that we may strengthen environmental responsibilities and rights (including those of the non-human and of future generations). In doing so, we can have an economy that is sustainable and democratic; that is, an economy that is truly healthy.\nI wish to conclude with these thoughts, which I share with the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition:\n\"It is becoming a pattern with this government to hear, once again, that Ontario\u2019s most sensitive and valuable environments are being offered to the highest bidder. 'Open for business' now also means trading protection for species at risk to anyone willing to pay the price. A strong and prosperous Ontario has a healthy and bountiful natural environment.\nBy weakening and outright removing protections in exchange for money this government weakens our province and sells our natural heritage out from under us. This move is particularly shocking given the global epidemic of species loss.\nOntario\u2019s Endangered Species Act was already insufficient. This proposal effectively removes the small safety net species at risk had remaining.\nLike Bill 66, the process to determine which regulations can be avoided are taken out of the public eye and at the discretion of the Minister. Local habitats could be under threat without any notification or public input opportunities.\nThe government will establish a second set of rules for those that are able to pay more. Instead of following the rules everyone else has to, sprawl developers, aggregate companies, even our own municipalities can just pay their way out of the process, regardless of whether it undermines Ontario\u2019s environmental integrity.\nYet again citizens are forced to point out to this government that this proposal is not needed.\nIn Simcoe County we have a surplus of land available for houses and employment. We do not need to sacrifice our forests, wetlands and shorelines for more.\nWho does this benefit?\nDredging wetlands that prevent flooding or paving over forests that purify our air destroys highly effective, low-cost natural solutions to climate change. The profit gained by developers and the sum paid to the government cannot match the ongoing value these natural ecosystems provide to our communities.\nSimcoe County has a wealth of globally, provincially, and locally significant wetlands and shorelines.  We are home to Ontario\u2019s largest municipally owned forest system. Our area is also home to over 60 species that are deemed vulnerable, threatened, or endangered.\nWhich of these will be the first to be offered up to the highest bidder?\nI am particularly concerned with proposals that:\n- Would allow industry, municipalities, and developers to bypass rules and regulations within the Act for a price;\n- Would allow the Minister to avoid consulting with experts for species at risk, event if the suspension of the regulations would, \u201clikely jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario\u201d;\n- Would allow the Minister to avoid consulting or even notifying the public if they decide to suspend regulations within the Act;\n- Would suspend the protections for locally threatened species as long as the species is \u201chealthy\u201d outside of Ontario. This would lead to extirpation and further jeopardize local ecosystems;\n- New additions to the Species at Risk list would take longer to get protection (from 3 months to a proposed 12 months). At a Minister\u2019s request the committee that adds new species may be asked to re-evaluate the listing, which would only lengthen the time that the species and their habitat would be vulnerable to development and other damaging activities;\n- Would no longer issue stop work order permits on damaging activities for newly listed species or their habitat for up to one year of listing. This means that damaging activities, such as mining, excavation etc., would be allowed to continue, unfettered, as the new species\u2019 habitat and species protections are reviewed by committee.\nI ask that the government strengthen the Endangered Species Act rather than weaken it. To do this I ask the government to fully and in good faith engage with experts in the field, as well as with the public, in crafting and establishing a renewed, expert-led, evidence-based commitment to protecting Ontario's species at risk.\nI ask that there be full and transparent public consultation required when considering impacts and changes to the Act and species listed under it. Further, that this public consultation include individuals, organizations, and other bodies that have proven expertise in areas relating to protection of species at risk. Transparency is required to ensure the Act is not politicized in a partisan way.\"\nGiven what we now know from the shocking UN report on biodiversity and the loss of one million species that our planet faces (https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/technology\/canada-biodiversity-1.5125108) I hope that our province will step up and be leaders on this front.\nNo \"pay to slay\" and a more robust protection for all species and their ecosystems!\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to the ESA make it virtually worthless for the protection of species.  The listing of species needs to be done in an impartial way by scientists not with unqualified appointees to COSSARO.  The current ESA should be strengthened not weakened.\nOne of the main problems with the proposed bill is it creates numerous loopholes to get out of actually protecting a species at risk.  Industries covered under other laws like the forestry sector should not be exempt from protections of the ESA.  One should also not be able to side-step protection of species or their habitat by paying a token amount into a fund.  That is like having trophy Elephant hunters pay to kill an African Elephant in order to fund conservation of African Elephants.  It doesn't make any sense.  The Minister should not have a veto to stop automatic protection of a species at risk or limit the geographic area or circumstances where the act would apply.\nOne of the other main problems with this proposed act is the numerous delays being inserted at every step of the process.  It could take many years before a Threatened or Endangered species is actually offered the weak protection that is proposed in this act.\nAlso, abandoning edge of range species if they are doing fine in other areas, demonstrates the lack of scientific understanding of the crafters of this bill and should not be included in the bill.  The edge or range populations are where speciation often occurs and with climate change, species will need to migrate north if they can.\nAs Ontarians, we value our wildlife and our wild spaces and we don't want them destroyed in the name of profit.  We do not have a problem in this province of a lack of land to develop.  There is lots of land which doesn't house species at risk that can be developed, but there are some areas that are too important for species that they should never be built on no matter what.  This act does not seem to be \"for the people\" it seems to be \"for the business people\".\n",

        "comment":"The proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act largely undermine its intended purpose, at a time when we need it to strongly protect our most vulnerable biodiversity. With the May 2019 publication of the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), we have unequivocal scientific evidence that our global biodiversity is being lost at an unprecedented rate. Weakening our ESA , for instance by allowing developers to pay into a conservation fund to be allowed to continue destroying habitat of a listed species is incredibly shortsighted and detrimental to the survival of endangered species in Ontario. Habitat for many endangered species is rare itself, and once it is gone, the conditions to allow for the survival of species that rely upon that habitat cannot be easily restored. There is no amount of restitution paid into a conservation fund that can cover the costs of restoring that habitat, and inevitably, the species that relies upon that habitat, once it is forced to become locally extinct, or worse, completely wiped off the earth.\nA key element mentioned by the changes to the Act include an analysis of whether a species assessed as endangered should be considered as such based on its population elsewhere in other adjacent provinces, countries, etc. This does not take into account the adaptations of species that are at the northern limits of their range that are therefore rare and at risk in Ontario. Many species that are listed in Ontario which may be more common in other regions should not be discounted as not worth protecting - they represent evolutionary adaptations at the edge of the northern limits of their range, and may provide genetic diversity in their species that can allow for survival in the face of climate change. Additionally, if they are lost from their range in Ontario, any members of that species that move north as our climate warms, will likely have less or no habitat conditions in which they will survive, and will become further endangered.\nDe-coupling the listing process from automatic protections and allowing increased ministerial control, such as with the temporary suspension of listing a protected species puts the ESA on an incredibly dangerous road. Combined with the open season for developers to pay out of conducting proper protective measures, this is absolutely disastrous for any species that dare live somewhere a company wants to put another subdivision. This is not a scientific way to protect our species, and is founded on partisan politics that place big businesses ahead of the foundation of our society - the natural world we rely upon. Scientists and community members and the advice they provide through COSSARO is expertise that the minister should rely upon - not their own personal opinion of what species and habitats should be protected. By ignoring the precautionary principal, and delaying the listing of species assessed as endangered, we are risking the survival of rare, extraordinary species in Ontario, and sacrificing our identity as Ontarians, and Canadians, who see our wild spaces and species firmly linked with our culture and pride in our home. Do not sacrifice this for extra developer dollars. They are not enough.\nOntario's Endangered Species Act was once lauded as one of the most stringent and potentially effective ESAs in  North America, if not the world. It does need to have some amendments, in order to allow for better communication with stakeholders to provide a stronger understanding of the parameters and process of protecting species. Action plans must also be developed and implemented more quickly, in order to actually put the ESA to work. But the amendments proposed by the current government do not achieve this goal. They aim to make our ESA a sham - a shell of legislation that has no teeth and no actual ability to protect our most vulnerable species. This is unacceptable. This is bulldozing our biodiversity, both literally and figuratively, and our province will suffer consequences that will be felt for decades, if not centuries, into our future.\n",

Our community is bounded by the Oakridges Moraine and the Niagara Escarpment with the Pine, Boyne, and Nottawasaga Rivers transversing our municipality and  where there exists more than sixty species of plants and animals which are deemed vulnerable, endangered or threatened. Our forests, wetlands and parks provide a healthy habitat for residents.  However, we are now concerned about the treatment and protection of sensitive flora and fauna in the future.\nWhere do we start?\nThe Environmental Commissioner of Ontario stated in their annual report 2014-2015 that using the 'Hine's Emerald' as a scientific property, we have evidence of environmental explanation. Our provincial government takes their own approach at the expense of species at risk. It is clear that certain landscapes and species must be protected from urbanization and invasion. In our community the Bobolink and Meadowlark, at risk species, were ignored in favour of a gravel pit.   Other species of concern such as aquatic, birds and mammals will no doubt suffer from the placement of this 'industrial production' in an established farm and freehold community.  Under subsections 9.1-9.4 in this new proposal, the minister will be able to permit prohibitions protecting a species by removing them-when, how, to where, and how will this affect the ecosystem?  This is an arbitrary decision made not by scientists but by bureaucracy.  This is not only an affront to animal species but to the probable effect on humanity in general.\nWe fear for the loss of more than 240 Species at Risk in Ontario. A recent UN report finds that one million species face extinction worldwide according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.  Three quarters of the land on the planet has now been \"severely altered\" by human actions.   The same goes for 66% of the marine environments.   Shockingly, 85% of the world's wetlands have disappeared.\nOur infrastructure coexists in delicate balance.  \"Nature's Contributions to People\" includes the provision of food, production of energy, sources of medicine, maintenance of options for the future--clearing a forest will decrease pollination, climate regulation and destroy habitat.\nWe have so much more in Ontario-scientific education, clean water, a vast wilderness-we must do better!  We must stop exploiting our environment!\nWhat we request:\n*   DO NOT ALLOW THE ESA TO BECOME POLITICIZED BY DELEGATING AUTHORITY TO THE MINISTER TO REMOVE OR DELAY PROTECTION\n*   DO NOT CHANGE THE LISTING PROCESS AND THE ROLE OF COSSARO\n*   ENSURE THAT HABITAT LOSS IS SCIENTIFICALLY AND MORALLY PROTECTED FROM DEVELOPMENT\n*   DO NOT ALLOW DEVELOPERS \"PAY TO SLAY\"-- SKIRTING ANIMAL PROTECTION\nEconomic development cannot and must not override natural laws.\nBiodiversity is our heritage, the wildlife, land and water-inherited by each generation since the dawn of civilization.  Our economy will not thrive in a faltering environment with the loss of our species at risk. Human beings, from voters to policy makers need to see the natural world as more than something to admire or exploit.\nMost sincerely,\nJanet Budgell\nCONCERNED CITIZENS IN ADJALA TOSORONTIO INCORPORATED\ncc\nJim Wilson MPP\nBoard of Directors\n",

        "comment":"Comments on the proposal summary:\nProposals 1A and 1B and Proposal 2 (all of it):\nIt is odd that this government thinks 3 months notice of changes to the SARO List, with press releases and public announcements, is not enough time for industry or the government to adjust to the changes, but 30 days is sufficient for the public to find out about and comment on extensive changes to this law that were quietly published with no announcements. Odder still that this government allowed people more time (47 days) to comment on a simple change to the regulations about the placement of bear bait. Worse yet, the bill went through second reading in the legislature before the 30 day public comment period ended. Sounds like the \"Government for the People\" doesn't actually want to hear from the people on this.\nUp until this point, the government has been successful in passing regulations that provide temporary exemptions for newly listed species in that 3 month time frame. It has also been successful in publishing habitat descriptions and other documents in that time frame. Is this government less efficient than the Liberals?\nSpecies don't suddenly become at-risk when COSSARO makes its assessment; they were already declining\/at-risk and need immediate action to reverse the trend. One year is far too long for species to go without protection once COSSARO has made its assessment. Three years is unacceptable. In the US, this type of delay has repeatedly led to to developers\/landowners rushing in to destroy species habitat or directly kill any members of the species on their land before the species can be protected. The goal of this legislation should be to provide better protection for species at risk and speed up their recovery, not wipe them out faster.\nProposal 1C: COSSARO meets 2 times a year and can hold emergency meetings when they, the species experts, feel it is warranted. The meeting dates and species to be assessed are posted on the COSSARO website and have been for a few years now, so the timing of the meeting report should not be a surprise, nor should the list of species being reviewed. I'm ok with requiring them to submit a report every January, but COSSARO must be allowed to submit additional reports at other times of the year, too. It is not efficient or transparent to make them hold on to species assessments for months. It is also not reasonable or efficient to expect them to assess all of the species on the annual priority list at a single annual meeting. These people are not full-time government employees; they have regular jobs that they have to take time away from to attend the meetings. Their per-diem barely covers travel expenses (according to the information on pas.gov.on.ca most of the members barely get enough to cover the cost of most hotel rooms these days) so they are essentially volunteering their time and expertise to do this.\nProposal 1D: COSSARO reports are based on the best scientific information, community knowledge, and aboriginal traditional knowledge available at the time the species is reviewed (Clause 5 (3)). COSSARO and COSEWIC always send out requests for new information to the scientific community and others before finalizing the species report. What \"credible scientific information\" could the Minister possibly have access to that COSSARO does not? This sounds like a loophole that the Minister can abuse to delay the addition of species to the list (by insisting that COSSARO re-assess the species, or by tying up COSSARO's time with mandatory re-assessments of species already on the Species At Risk In Ontario List).\nProposal 1E:\nThis proposal shows a lack of understanding of the principles and importance of biodiversity at the regional level and to the spin-off benefits to air quality, water quality, and other species (including humans) that come from protecting the habitat of species that are rare in Ontario. It is much easier and cheaper to recover a species that still has healthy populations in neighbouring states and provinces than species that have already become at risk there too. No species should be allowed to become extirpated from Ontario due to human causes just because it's still common in other parts of its range. Ontario has no control over the actions of other provinces or countries. Therefore the legal status must only reflect the status of the species in Ontario.\nThe reports on biodiversity published by IPBES (referred to as the UN in media coverage) in early May 2019 (the \"Summary for Policymakers of the global assessment report on Biodiversity and ecosystems services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\" and the \"Summary for Policymakers Report of the IPBES Regional Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services for the Americas\") emphasize the importance of acting immediately to slow the rate of loss of biodiversity, even at the local level. Section D2 of the main report: \"Strengthening environmental laws and policies and their implementation, and the rule of law more generally\" is one of the five main interventions that \"can generate transformative change by tackling the underlying indirect drivers of nature deterioration\". It is embarrassing that Ontario would chose to dismiss these reports and go in the opposite direction. It makes us look like a bunch of backwards ignorant slackers who are either incapable adapting to the new reality or are waiting for someone else to do all the work for us. Is that really how you want to portray Ontario to the world?\nFinally, all of these changes are being made under the Better Homes, More Choices Act, which is written under the assumption that it is municipal development fees, environmental protection regulations, and other planning regulations that are causing the lack of affordable housing. None of these address the real causes: poor urban planning, allowing developers to design our cities instead of social engineers, houses that are sitting vacant because the owner is just going to resell it as soon as the price increases a few months later, and allowing developers to build subdivisions full of 5 bedroom 3 bathroom monstrosities instead of houses that are a suitable size for today's smaller families. All this Act will do is put more money in the pockets of developers while impoverishing the struggling families you promised to help if elected (E.g., restricting development charges means municipalities will have to increase property taxes for everyone to pay for servicing new developments instead of the developer - and the people who will buy those homes - paying for it).\nCOMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED REVISIONS TO THE TEXT OF THE ACT:\nClause 3 (4) (a) - these changes are positive, although ecology and wildlife management are typically considered to be aspects of conservation biology so the distinction isn't really necessary\nClause 3 (4) (b) - addition of \"community knowledge\" experts to the committee is concerning. Community knowledge experts tend to have only very localized knowledge (i.e., what's found in their immediate area), not the broad range of knowledge and expertise that is required to assess the status of species throughout Ontario. I noticed in the comments on the 10-year review discussion paper (publicly available on the Environmental Registry) that several farmers made statements along the lines of \"we know what's on our land, we could have told you where to find more of x species if we'd been included in the review\". As someone who comes from a farm background, I can tell you that is somewhat true; many (but not all) small farmers know what is on the land that they farm, but most do not have the ability to identify plants or animals that are not directly relevant to their farm operations. Farmers that are managing several hundred acres are not likely to know anything except what is their barns or cultivated fields. COSSARO members rely on data from many reputable sources not just their own personal knowledge. The committee needs members who have the ability to assess the validity of this information. Instead of having a \"community knowledge\" expert on the committee, COSSARO needs better ways to access community knowledge in preparation for a status assessment. COSSARO also needs ways to verify any community knowledge (e.g., funding for surveys to confirm new populations) before meeting to assess the species.\nDuring preparation of my comments I looked at the biographies of the current COSSARO members (Available to anyone on the COSSARO website). It includes people who have worked in the forest industry, consultants whose full time work is helping developers design and build good projects, NGOs like the Nature Conservancy of Canada that work directly with private landowners all the time, and people heavily involved in large amateur and professional associations like the Entomological Society of Canada. Anyone would consider these people as having \"expertise drawn from community knowledge\" as well as having relevant scientific expertise.\nAboriginal traditional knowledge is generally not available through other traditional channels. ATK experts are needed on the committee to facilitate access to this information. A \"community knowledge expert\" would not be able to perform the same function.\nOntario's \"Government for the People\" needs to assure the people of Ontario that anyone with an anti-listing agenda will NOT be appointed to the committee for their \"community knowledge expertise\". Better to just leave this criteria out and instead give COSSARO more resources and tools for accessing community knowledge.\nProposed additions to Section 5:\nThe intent of the Endangered Species Act is to ensure no more species become extirpated FROM ONTARIO, not just to prevent extinction at the global level. Adding these clauses to the Act compromises the intent of the Act. Ontario has no control over other jurisdictions. Similarly, only Ontario can take action to protect its biodiversity and prevent species from disappearing within the province (unless the federal government invokes section 61 the Species At Risk Act because we fail to adequately protect a species listed under that act!).\nThe species on the Species at Risk in Ontario list that are \"at the fringe of their range\" in Ontario are there because they used to be more common and widespread in Ontario but human activity has destroyed the habitat (Prothonotary Warbler, all salamanders, most invertebrates, all prairie and alvar species) or killed off populations either inadvertently (Red Mulberry and other plants, invertebrates) or through deliberate collection (Ginseng, Goldenseal, Spotted Turtle) or persecution (Gray Ratsnake, Eastern Hog-nosed Snake). As others pointed out in their comments on the discussion paper, climate change (which the province admitted is real in its opening arguments to its constitutional challenge of the carbon tax) is causing species to disappear from the *southern* fringes of their range. Maintaining populations at the northern fringe of the range will become more critical if we are going to maintain global biodiversity.\nMore importantly, COSSARO ALREADY TAKES THE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL STATUS OF SPECIES INTO ACCOUNT during its review, and they do it in a biologically valid way! See pages 5 and 6 of the Categories and Criteria for Status Assessment which is accessible to anyone on COSSARO's website (www.cossaroagency.ca\/species). These criteria are based on the internationally recognized standard (the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN) and were refined through consultation with stakeholders.  COSSARO's approach to incorporating the status of the species in its broader range is more appropriate than the proposed new clauses. The criteria for assessing the status of species should be left to the experts (i.e. COSSARO and the stakeholders they consulted), not politicians.\nInstead, I recommend revising Section 5 as follows to make it clearer that the intent is to protect Ontario's biodiversity:\n5 (1) 3. A species shall be classified as an endangered species if it lives in the wild in Ontario but is facing imminent extinction or extirpation from Ontario\n5 (1) 4. A species shall be classified as a threatened species if it lives in the wild in Ontario, is not endangered in Ontario, but is likely to become endangered in Ontario if steps are not taken to address factors threatening to lead to its extinction or extirpation.\n5 (1) 5. A species shall be classified as a special concern species if it lives in the wild in Ontario, is not endangered or threatened in Ontario, but may become threatened or endangered in Ontario because of a combination of biological characteristics and identified threats.\nIf you insist on going ahead with this weakening of the act by forcing species assessments to be based solely on the species status' on areas outside of Ontario where the species is doing better instead of sound biological science (e.g., an expert assessment of the species' ability become re-established naturally through immigration from the rest of its range) you also need to adjust the status in Ontario if the species' status worsens outside Ontario afterwards. Add the following to either section 5 or section 6:\n\"Where a species was classified at a lower level of risk to the survival of the species under subsection 5 (5), if any government within the broader biologically relevant geographic range of the species classifies the species at a higher risk of survival after it has been classified in Ontario, the species shall automatically be reclassified to the same higher level of risk in COSSARO's next report to the Minister.\"\nSection 6:\nI support the proposal to revise subsection 6 (2) of the current Act to set a consistent deadline for the mandatory annual report (so it cannot be delayed to a time that is politically convenient for the Minister)\nI DO NOT support the proposed prohibition on submitting additional reports. COSSARO is required to meet a minimum of 2 times a year. This is necessary to keep up with the COSEWIC assessments, clear the backlog of rare species that have not yet been assessed, and re-evaluate species on a regular basis. The committee should not be forced to sit on non-emergency status changes for 6-8 months. While this may be more convenient for politicians, it will create a workload issue for the Ministry responsible for actually implementing the Act as well as making it more difficult for them to find enough qualified experts to write the recovery strategies to meet the deadlines. An experienced business person knows it is a much more efficient and effective use of staff and resources to spread out the reports, and the workload, over the course of the year.\nAlso, if COSSARO becomes aware of new credible scientific information that a listed species is actually not at risk, they should not have to wait for the Minister to request the report. Instead of putting this in the Act as another clause, keep it simple. Don't prevent COSSARO for submitting additional reports as it sees fit!\nProposed clause 6 (3) (b). If you go ahead with prohibiting COSSARO to submit additional reports, this clause should not be restricted to species that are not already listed as threatened, endangered, or extirpated. If COSSARO becomes aware of new credible scientific information that indicates that a threatened species is now facing imminent extinction or extirpation (e.g., a forest fire has wiped out half the population in Ontario), they should be able to submit a new report. COSSARO should also be able to submit a new report if the committee becomes aware of new credible scientific information that indicates that a species previously thought to be extinct or extirpated is still present in Ontario but is facing imminent extirpation or extinction.\nProposed amendment to Subsection 7 (4):\nI applaud this government for keeping the species assessment and status assignment as a strictly science-based, arms length process. Species status should only be based on how the species is faring. Socio-economic impacts should only be addressed through regulations and permits, not the listing process.\nHowever, 12 months is far to long to wait to list a species, especially species that are at imminent risk of extirpation or extinction (i.e., endangered). That is plenty of time for landowners to deliberately wipe out any populations and habitat on their properties, resulting in worse outcomes for species at risk instead of the government's stated goal of improving outcomes. The previous government managed to prepare exemption regulations, habitat descriptions, and other supporting documents in 3 months. Why does this government believe they will be incapable of meeting that deadline? Because you cut the responsible ministry's budget so they won't have the resources to meet the deadline?\nIf you absolutely must increase the time between receiving the report and revising the list, choose a shorter timeline than 12 months.\nAlso, until the list is revised, the status assessment must be kept confidential in order to protect the species from persecution. Even the people\/corporations who provided generous campaign contributions to the Minister and other members of parliament must not be informed of the decision until the list is revised.\nSection 8: Much of this section is a directly contrary of the government's stated goal of \"improving outcomes for species at risk\". It's impossible to improve the outcome for a species if you delay protection for individuals of the species or their habitat for too long. The only possible outcome in that scenario is extinction or extirpation.\nSubsection 8.1 (1):\nInstead of making a regulation that \"temporarily\" suspends the subsection 9 (1) and 10 (1) prohibitions for all people and activities, it would be better to revise section 23.13 of Ontario Regulation 242\/08 to provide temporary exemptions for developments that are already at an advanced stage of planning. This would allow those developments to proceed as is (as long as they take steps to avoid killing or harming individuals of the species) and give them time to come up with a mitigation plan (e.g., to create replacement habitat somewhere else). Any projects that are in an early stage of planning do not need extra time to include the newly listed species in their plans; there are a lot of other things other than species at risk that are going to cause revisions to the plans anyway!\n8.1 (3) (a): this is a good requirement!\n8.1 (3) (b) (i): in this situation, individuals of the species should still be protected. Otherwise, as has been demonstrated many times in the United States, people will deliberately kill individuals of the species so their property won't be affected when the habitat protections come into effect.\n8.1 (3) (b) (i): Also, \"parts of Ontario\" is troubling. It sounds like you will delay protecting the species in all of Ontario just to address challenges it causes in a relatively small area like the Golden Horseshoe. There also needs to be transparent, standard, measurable criteria for what \"significant social or economic implications\" means (similar to the clear and transparent criteria COSSARO uses to determine a species' status)\n8.1 (3) (b) (ii): this is a good requirement! As long as the Minister makes this decision based solely on the advice of qualified experts - preferably COSSARO. For transparency,  way that the Minister came to this conclusion (e.g. List of people consulted) is included in the subsection (4) order as part of the reason for suspension.\n8.1 (3) (c) (i): it's not enough for the species to be widely distributed. There must be viable populations broadly distributed across the province.\n8.1. (3) (C) (ii): this is a critical requirement\n8.1 (3) (c) (iii): this is not a valid excuse for failing to take action to protect a species. You can prohibit people from killing, harming, harassing, possessing, collecting, buying, selling etc. individuals of the species and destroying their habitat while figuring out how to address other threats e.g., climate change. Otherwise, by the time you figure out how to address the other threats, there's a good chance that the species will be in much worse condition because populations have been wiped out by development.\n8.1 (3) (c) (iv): this is unacceptable. The purpose of the ESA is to protect the species in Ontario from threats in Ontario. Species need full protection in Ontario while inter-jurisdictional negotiations are ongoing. This sounds like an excuse to never protect species like migratory birds. It doesn't matter what's going on in other jurisdictions that could be causing a decline; Ontario needs to take responsibility for what happens in this province and lead by example. Ontario can't demand that other jurisdictions to takes steps to recover shared species when Ontario openly refuses to do anything other than put the species name on a list.\n8.1 (4) (d): include a summary of the information and the experts that were used to come to this conclusion. This will ensure transparency in decision making and assure the people of Ontario that the Minister used credible sources.\n8.1 (5) (b): the date should be no later than three years after the day the Minister received the report from COSSARO. The Minister should be taking full advantage of the time between receiving the report and the date the species at risk list is changed (which you are proposing to be 12 months!!!) to develop habitat descriptions\/regulations, strategies for addressing the primary threats, and suitable mitigation measures to protect and recover the species. As written, this could mean that a species would go FOUR years without protection after COSSARO has determined that it is at imminent risk of extinction\/extirpation (endangered species) or is likely to become endangered (in Ontario) if steps are not taken quickly to protect the species\n8.1 (5) (b): since endangered species are facing imminent extinction or extirpation, the maximum end date for an order for a newly listed endangered species should be shorter than for threatened species\n8.1 (6): this is fine, as long as the species is not likely to disappear from these geographic areas during the transition period (I.e. As long as populations here are not at greater risk than in other parts of the province)\n8.1 (7) this is a good requirement and provides clarity.\nSubsection 11 (8): this sounds like an excuse to never reintroduce an extirpated species - unless it's a game species (e.g., wild turkey). Feasibility should be the only factor. Reintroducing species, where feasible, is another way Ontario fulfill its obligations to help preserve global biodiversity.\nSection 12.1:  This is one area where a longer time line may have been beneficial. The Government Response Statements that have been published so far have been laughably lacking in tangible commitments from the government, and have instead made vague statements about \"supporting\" non-government organizations to do the government's work. If a longer time period would result in the government actually committing to real, measurable actions, I would support changing the standard time limit to 12 months as well as the option set out in 12.1 (4).\nSection 12.2: This is a big improvement over the previous Act. I fully support this change.\n15 (2) (c) (i) (B): ABSOLUTELY NOT! Paying into the fund should be an optional PART of the overall benefit plan for the species, not a substitute. The person must still obtain a permit and follow the conditions of the permit to minimize direct adverse effects on the species and its habitat, and take steps to provide a direct benefit to the species. What good will this money be to the species if you allow developers\/industry to destroy all the habitat and kill all the individuals of the species? People should take more than financial responsibility for their actions.\n15 (2) (d) (ii): since this should only apply to projects that would bring billions of dollars into the economy (.e.g. Ring of Fire development), the \"species conservation charge\" should be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars; it should be equal to the savings the proponent would realize by not doing extensive activities to bring benefit to the species that would have been required under the previous version of this Act.\nThe Species At Risk Conservation Fund:\nI do see value in having this fund. However, the wages and compensation packages for the employees of the fund must come from the province's general coffers, not from the contributions to the fund. 100% of all money given to the fund or earned through its investments must be used for projects that benefit the species.\nI also do not want to see a long list of conservation fund employees on the sunshine list! For example, I was horrified to see that there are 140 people in the WSIB who make over $100K a year. No wonder they do everything they can to avoid paying someone who was injured on the job, and then pay out as little as possible. Don't let this happen to the Conservation Fund!\nMost importantly, this should not be turned into yet another opportunity for a Premier to give a plum high-paying CEO position to his or her friends and political supporters. The most important work for this fund (deciding which funding requests will be approved) can be done by a Board of Directors, with members remunerated similar to COSSARO and the Fish and Wildlife Heritage Commission.\n20.18 (1): No. Since The Crown is ultimately responsible for the activities of the Agency, the people of Ontario need a legal means to hold The Crown accountable for the actions of the Agency.\n55 (1) (f) (viii): what commercial activities would the Agency need to carry out? The only thing it should be doing is funding species at risk research and recovery projects.\n57 (1): this is good, but it shouldn't have to be stated in the Act, it should be automatic! For transparency, add a requirement to publish the reasons that the Minister is of the opinion that the regulation will not jeopardize the survival of the species or have an other significant adverse effect on the species.\nFinally, I noticed that proposed changes include striking out every reference to the \"environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\" and replacing it with a reference to an unnamed website \"maintained by the Government of Ontario\". First, this makes me suspicious that you are planning to repeal the Environmental Bill of Rights, something that a true \"Government for the People\" would not do. Second, it makes me suspicious that you are going to make it more difficult for the public to find out about, and provide input to, proposed regulation changes, permits and other authorizations, draft recovery strategies, and Government Response Statements. This is the opposite of transparency! The new Environmental Registry website is quite nice and is easier to use than the previous one, which did need some updating. Please keep using this registry, so the people of Ontario only need to monitor one website to find out what their government is doing for the environment, including species at risk.\n",

It was like the ultimate goal that we had and spent years improving our system, raising awareness, hoping that one day people will band together and make this happen. After seeing the proposals, it almost seems like the goal was forgotten, and replaced with modernized thoughts for the benefit of economy. This is could no doubt be a step back for Ontario if they were to be passed.\nPeople often wonder why squirrels run away when you try to take pictures with them. Why birds automatically take off when we are too close. It\u2019s almost like...they don\u2019t trust us. They don\u2019t have a reason to, really. Despite all the good that people do for these animals, whether they are endangered, injured, or simply running freely in their habitat oblivious as to what's coming, there are people out there whose terrible actions outweigh the ones of the good. Speaking of which, brings us back to the proposals. Many species will not only lose their homes, be harmed, but also sent on the express lane to extinction as the result of these proposals. One of the proposals include letting the developers pay a fund instead of following the requirements for on-ground compensation. What if every developer paid a fund to turn houses (that citizens lived in), into huge corporate buildings? And get this: no compensation for the people living in them? Doesn\u2019t sound good does it? This is could happen to the species living on those grounds. If it\u2019s not okay to do it to humans, then it\u2019s not okay to do it to other species.\nAs a concerned citizen of Ontario, I strongly urge that you reconsider the proposal. We can do better than this. We ARE better than this. Here\u2019s to a better Ontario.\n",

I see no support in this proposal for your claim that it will improve outcomes for species at risk.\nSpecies at risk will not be helped by delaying their listing or by ministerial interference in  COSSARO's decisions.\nSpecies at risk will not be helped by allowing the Minister to suspend and limit their protection, and to develop habitat regulations only \u201cwhen needed\u201d in someone's opinion.\nSpecies at risk will not be helped by allowing the Minister to delay recovery actions indefinitely.\nAllowing developers to pay into a fund instead of following rules will encourage the harms they do, and a fund is no substitute for protection. Recovery after further population and habitat losses is many times more difficult and expensive and risky than protecting in the first place.\nYour proposals regarding permits, agreements and exemptions will allow more sweeping authorizations that may be nice for business but will not help species at risk.\nIn your last paragraph you propose that the Minister be allowed to pause protections without review, in order to \u201cminimize associated social or economic impacts\u201d. The quoted phrase represents the whole proposal. You think that minimizing social or economic impacts of protecting a species at risk is more urgent and important than avoiding further losses to that species.

People will be relying on science for the future. Disregarding science and involving people in the COSSARO that are not properly educated or with the right intentions can be detrimental to the future. The ecosystem is quite fragile, and endangered species contribute to this system. The repercussive waves can be enormous and affect Canada environmentally and economically, despite the attractiveness of short term financial gains. Deserting edge of range species is neglecting the entirety of the status of the species, relying on availability heuristic, which is not an accurate measurement of the true population. It is analogous to a doctor observing part of a patient's body and using only the healthy parts to diagnose the person as healthy, turning a blind eye to the unhealthy parts which can fester and overtake the healthy parts. It lacks big picture thinking and education. Decoupling species at risk from protection and allowing a 3 year suspension before mandated protection is also unwise, risky and dangerous. Also, delaying the report of species at risk doesn't permit any time for recovery. Please consider reviewing these changes, and consider what will occur in longevity, and not just for the short term gains. To conclude, I oppose the changes to the Endangered Species Act proposed in the 10 year review.\n",

        "comment":"The world is in an extinction crisis, with biodiversity disappearing at a rate not seen since the catastrophic impacts of a meteorite changed the earth almost instantaneously and caused the last mass extinction event. This time it\u2019s different: equally catastrophic but rather than instantaneous, this is more like a train wreck in slow motion. And in Ontario, these proposed changes do nothing to slow the train; they simply accelerate it.\nThe UN says that 25% of plants and animals are at risk of extinction. This isn\u2019t an epidemic happening just in far-away Africa or Antarctica- it is happening here, in Ontario, in our own backyards. Ontario is Canada\u2019s most biodiverse province, largely because it is Canada\u2019s deep south. We have much, but as a result, we also have more to lose than any other province.\nOntario has had an Endangered Species Act that offers protection to species in decline, and despite this, populations of a huge proportion of our province\u2019s plants and wildlife are in decline. Bird populations have declined up to 70% in recent decades, largely due to habitat loss both here and in locations where they migrate and overwinter. Most recently aerial insectivore populations have plummeted, following the declines in the insects they eat (which is expected to be caused by neonicotinoid pesticides running off into local waterways- chemicals that kill insect life in minute parts per billion concentrations (but these are insects that perform huge ecological services- what do we lose when we lose them?).\nI live in Hamilton, a municipality blessed with incredibly diverse habitats and therefore high biodiversity. However, we are also a municipality that is home to close to 60 species at risk, and that number is increasing every year or two, not decreasing. This isn\u2019t because the ESA has been ineffective, though it could be ramped up.  However, the proposed changes to the Act will undermine the current levels of protection and action that the Act now offers. The SAR number is increasing because new species decline to crisis levels each year due to habitat loss and environmental toxicity; the proposed changes to the Act will accelerate the rate at which many species will decline.\nAs it as been, the ESA is a piece of legislation that is meant to prevent decline and extinction; it should be to protect species, not to expedite development, and undermine the role that good science plays in our understanding of the environment and the interrelationship between species in the natural world.  As is, the proposed legislation introduces an enhanced a risk of additional habitat loss and population declines. Further declines in some species may cause them to become extirpated from Ontario, and such losses to our natural heritage are unacceptable in the face of so many threats to biodiversity. We still have much to learn about how ecosystems work; for example, the role of flying squirrels as keystone  species in deciduous forest ecosystems because they help to move and revitalize the soil fungi upon which so many species of Ontario trees and wildflowers (including Ontario\u2019s own tree and flower emblems) rely upon. The decline and loss of this species of mammal would have a rapid catastrophic impact on our hardwood forests, already under siege from invasive species like garlic mustard and emerald ash borer, beech blight aphid, and perhaps soon, hemlock woolly adelgid. And climate change models, some of which include scenarios showing sugar maple as disappearing from much of southern Ontario over the next 30 years, as the tree\u2019s climate envelope moves north. Aldo Leopold said, \u201cthe first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts.\u201d These proposed amendments, and in particular Schedule 5 in its entirety, undermines this basic principle.\nIn particular, the public should be notified quickly of COSSARO\u2019s species\u2019 assessments, but listing should be immediate. Waiting one year after the species is listed could result in harmful effects on the species, especially with our changing climate creating additional pressure. Immediate protection is strongly recommended and there should be no possible suspension of listings for up to three years. As well, threatened and endangered species should have habitat regulations, as these species are especially vulnerable.\nCOSSARO is an independent committee with expertise in scientific disciplines and Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge and these individuals take great care and consideration when making decisions about which species should be listed as at risk, and this should remain the case. The Minister should not be able to overrule decisions made by COSSARO, as such veto power explicitly undermines the arms-length scientific approach that is supposed to be used to assess species and makes the process political rather than science-based.\nCOSSARO should not be expected to base its assessments on the status of a species throughout its range, as opposed to in Ontario only. For species that have a small portion of their range in Ontario, these populations often present unique adaptations and reservoirs of genetic variation, and this is critical today as these are the genetic tweeks that are likely to facilitate resilience to climate change. Loss of Ontario populations means loss of global genetic diversity in the species. Allowing species to be wiped out in Ontario simply because they occur elsewhere is short-sighted.\nThe proposed changes include amending the act to strike out \u201cthe environmental registry established under the Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993\u201d and substituting \u201ca website maintained by the Government of Ontario\u201d. Such a change would mean that the opportunity for public input is lost.  Removing opportunities for public input eliminates government accountability to the public and prevents the public to participate in the protection and recovery of species at risk.\nIt is true that better enforcement is necessary to protect SAR. There is a strong need for enforcement of the ESA through fines and if necessary, incarceration.\nThe purposes of the ESA as currently stated are in no way held up by the proposed changes.\nThe proposed changes do not align with the stated and intended purposes of the ESA. These changes will make it easier for industry and developers to destroy the habitats of our most vulnerable plants and animals, making disastrous permanent changes that destroy the legacy we hold for our children and grandchildren.  Schedule 5 should be removed entirely.\n",

Instead, more changes which highlight direct and practical protections should be considered as amendments to the Act.\nHuman\u2019s economic progress is important, but not in the sacrifice of the lives and health of other species. Especially here in Ontario, the increasing number of endangered species do not live on a list, they view wild spaces as their homes. However, we don\u2019t, or at least, many stakeholders in the provincial government and the economic sector don\u2019t. The word \u201cendangered\u201d marks an emergency, and in this case, several ones. Our hospital\u2019s emergency room does not start taking care of a patient nine months after they are confirmed to be in a life-threatening condition, so the vulnerable plants, animals and their habitats should not be treated with delayed attention and lack of protection. In addition, the treatment of a patient should not have a quality difference across the province, so the protection of a species should not have varying levels of effectiveness in different regions.\nFurthermore, the government needs to consult an \u201cexpert prior to creating regulations that would jeopardize the survival of a species, or issuing permits for harmful activities\u201d similar to a hospital needs to hire a doctor to diagnose a patient. All updates should be recorded and the information should be open to the public because we have the right to know anything not-so-confidential as long as we wish to know.\nDespite all the precautions, life is full of conflicts, so it is understandable that other laws may come into conflict with the ESA. However, ask the Ontario citizens, especially the youths, and they will likely say: the future (supposedly re-amended not with the current proposals) ESA should be the top, top priority!\n",

        "comment":"I am very disturbed by the proposed changed to the Endangered Species Act. It is vitally important that we do everything we can to protect the species living here, especially as the environment gets more and more challenging for their survival. Maintaining the protection of these species and their habitat relies very much on the valuable work of scientists, and this must not be opened up to being subject to the uninformed opinions of those with other political and economic agendas.  It is unacceptable to change this Act to reflect an attitude that our endangered species are something for developers to mess with at will, as long as they pay. There is no substitute for the natural world that can be bought by developer dollars. The \"landscape agreements,\" the decoupling of Endangered Species list and automatic protections, ministerial veto powers, strategic delays in applying protections, reduction of required expert consultation, and abandonment of edge-of-range species, all betray the integrity of this important Act. We must do more, not less, to protect the species that live here, while we still can. These proposed changes are unacceptable.\n",

        "comment":"I work daily with proponents and the ESA and would like to provide the following comments with regard to the proposed changes to the ESA, with the focus on the fact that the legislation is intended to protect species and habitats, not business interests, but that it should also not be a planning or financial \u201cblack hole\u201d for proponents required to comply with it.  Balance is required, however, the cost of losing species and habitats is much more difficult to calculate than the cost of not developing a building lot or subdivision.  I have commented on the proposed changes in the order presented.\n1. Assessing species at risk and listing them on the Species at Risk in Ontario List\nA. Extension of the period between listing and list amendment only allows landowners more time to remove species or their habitats prior it being a contravention.  This is change is detrimental for species at risk in Ontario.\nB.  As above, delays in listing are of no benefit to species.  However, projects in progress or nearing initiation, should, at the discretion of the Minister, receive recognition of this aspect.  This could including a \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of qualifying projects to complete activities that would otherwise contravene the Act, however, these projects would still be required to mitigate for impacts, such as salvage of species and actions to prevent incidental harm.\nC.  I have no issues with this change.\nD.  I disagree with providing the Minister with the power to force COSSARO to reconsider species classification based on their \u201copinion\u201d, as there is a strong likelihood that this opinion will be biased against species.  Unless the Minister has a scientific education and is able to weigh and measure the information provided, this amounts to little more than sanctioned bullying.\nE.  I strongly disagree with this proposed change as it has the potential to not only remove many\/most species from protection, but also their habitat, which supports many other species and processes.  Furthermore, species that are extremely rare in Ontario, such as the Grey Fox that the Minister mentioned, are so infrequently impacted that changing their listing would be inconsequential.  Most Ontario species would lose protection if COSSARO was forced to consider their entire geographic range, which is not biologically sound, as many rare species in Ontario are at the edge of their range or isolated from main populations and as a consequence may have unique adaptations and traits.\nF.  This statement is too vague to allow proper comment.  COSSARO membership makes the designations; the government makes the policy.  Weakening COSSARO membership requirements to (presumably) encourage removal of species from listing is wrong.\n2. Defining and implementing species and habitat proections\nA. Again, suspending protections after listing allows landowners three years to remove habitat and species.  This is detrimental for species at risk.  Landowners currently regularly remove habitat for species at risk currently protected with, typically, no negative ramifications, so this change will only support continued loss of species and habitats.  In certain instances, grandfathering of projects could be considered if appropriate mitigation was implemented.\nB.  This proposed change is too vague to comment on.  This could be neutral or negative for species, depending on the protections.  Again, this legislation is to protect species with the potential to be extirpated in Ontario.  If scoping results in the reduction of protections, then it is generally not conducive to protecting species and their habitats.\nC.  I disagree with this proposed change.  Habitat regulations take far too long to be developed as it is.  Habitat regulations allow good ecological and planning decisions to be made.\nD.  I suspect this change will also be detrimental to species at risk, but am not familiar enough with this process.\n3. Developing species at risk recovery policies\nGenerally, I am not supportive of delays in government timelines.  Currently, most recovery documents are not completed within the time frames specified.  Changing the time frame will simply allow government to continue to lag on completing these statements and reviews.\n4.  Issuing ESA permits and agreements and developing regulatory exemptions.\nCreation of Regulatory Charge and Agency\nI am cautiously supportive of the creation of this Crown agency and the cash-in-lieu concept, despite its potential pitfalls.  However, additional information is required to determine how effective this agency and its related processes will be at contributing to Overall Benefit for protected species.  In many cases, the costs a client would incur to meet a species-based authorization often requires the purchase of new lands or the protection of existing lands formerly planned for development.  Depending on the location and project scale, this cost can vary wildly.  How will this variation be accounted for in the process?  How often will cash-in-lieu be considered?   This concept has potential to solve serious problems with the implementation of the Act, however, it also opens up the Act to political attack as a \u201ccash grab\u201d or a \u201ctax\u201d, which could then quickly lead to its repeal.\nA.  This change downloads considerable authority to the Minister with regards to the \u2018D\u2019 permit process.  I am not supportive of this change, as the Minister generally has no formal education on the topic of their portfolio (e.g. scientific training), so their review of the permit in consultation with an independent expert is preferable to ensure an informed final decision.\nB.  I am not supportive of this change as it weakens the ESA permit process and would seem to support loss of individuals without compensation, through the described focus on the species \u201cmore generally\u201d.   Details requiring the \u201cbroadening\u201d measures are required to elicit more meaningful comments.\nC.   I am in agreement that a transition process is required for existing operators, however, mitigation to reduce harm to newly-listed species should come into effect immediately.   Once mitigation is in place, overall benefit actions or permit modification could be phased in over a 12 month period to reduce impacts to existing activities.\nD.  This statement sounds reasonable and any guidance and direction offered by the government to establish standards and guidelines will be of benefit to those navigating the ESA.\nE.  In very general terms, Overall Benefit actions that are directed to landscape-scale initiatives are preferable to the current random \u2018bit and piece\u201d method.  More details on how this would be required for a more complete comment, but in theory, I support this change.\nF.  No comment.\nG.  Though this change is favourable to species at risk, I still feel consultation with experts is of value to ensure balance.\n5. Enforcing the Endangered Species Act\nThe Act is so abysmally enforced I support ANY improvements in this aspect.\nThe current ESA is cumbersome and creates high levels of uncertainty for proponents.  Decreasing review time through additional staffing would assist greatly in reducing this uncertaintly.  For proponents tasked with performing Overall Benefit actions, landscape scale approaches would be of great benefit, however, these actions require support from lower levels of government to be accomplished successfully.  This support is not currently available and mechanisms to encourage municipalities to support the province\u2019s goals will be required for this approach to work, which this document does recognize.\nThe ESA not only protects species currently at risk, it also serves to prevent additional species from becoming at risk through habitat protection measures which benefit more than one species.  The legislation itself is not the major issue.  The processing time for information and applications is an issue.  Inadequate enforcement allowing dishonest proponents to contravene the Act while forcing honest proponents through YEARS of government back and forth is an issue.  Uncertainty regarding habitat requirements and critical habitat for existing listed species is an issue.  Uncertainty regarding the time and cost of an Overall Benefit permit is an issue.\nIf the government wants to assist species at risk and proponents, it would do itself a great service to look inwards.  Hire more review staff, fund more research, engage municipalities on landscape-scale approaches and make the process predictable for proponents. It is my opinion that these changes would have a large, positive effect for all involved in the process and would not require drastic legislative changes, such as those proposed.\nThank you for allowing me to comment on these proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act.\n",

        "comment":"I am disgusted by the very thought of Ontario descending down the road trod by the very worst of countries, with little to no care about the repercussions of its own actions. Canada is now joining a list of bad actors and will be viewed as a place no longer ruled by compassion, sense or even sanity.\nI wish to express my blatant opposition to the proposed changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act. In particular, the section entitled \"Creation of Regulatory Charge and Agency\" is especially dangerous as it suggests the implementation of a \"regulatory charge that could be paid by persons who are permitted to carry out otherwise prohibited activities\". Mike Schreiner of the Green Party summed up this section most aptly when he described it as the \"Pay to Slay\" fee. Endangered species are priceless, and no amount of money will help once they are gone. I am particularly disturbed that the proposed amendments to the Act would give politicians power to override the decisions of scientists.\nThe proposed changes also seek to \"(b)roaden the approach to minimizing adverse effects for permits and agreements... by shifting the focus from \u2018individual members\u2019 of the species to the \u2018species\u2019 more generally\". When it comes to endangered species, every single individual member of that species is of unprecedented import and deserves undiluted focus and complete protection! According to these changes, the habitat of an endangered species could be destroyed after a developer pays a fee or because that same species is reported to be maintaining population numbers elsewhere in Ontario. This will be completely devastating to the precious, fleeting presence of the animals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and plants which we, as human beings, are tasked with protecting. Please put a stop to the changes to Ontario's Endangered Species Act. We won't get a second chance at this!\n",
