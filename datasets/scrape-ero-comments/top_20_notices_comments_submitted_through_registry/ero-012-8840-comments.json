Work will begin in 2020 instead of 2016. This will make the best use of our existing nuclear fleet and save $1.7 billion compared to what was forecasted in the 2013 LTEP. The government also plans, pending regulatory approvals, to operate the Pickering nuclear station up to 2024, saving ratepayers as much as $600 million; and Suspending the second round of the Large Renewable Procurement and the Energy from Waste Standard Offer Program. This is expected to save up to $3.8 billion in electricity system costs compared to the forecast in Ontario\u2019s 2013 LTEP. This would save the typical residential electricity consumer an average of approximately $2.45 per month.\n[Original Comment ID: 195673]\n",

We will still have radioactive waste coming out of the plants for generations. Funnelling more and more funds into aging plants is good money thrown after bad.\n\nAlthough I disagree that nuclear power generation is clean, I will grant you that small portion of the \"green\" argument. In no way, however, is the rest of the radioactive material lifecycle clean or safe. Mining, processing, and disposing of nuclear material is filthy and dangerous.\n\nCentralized power generation leaves the entire grid at risk. If we invested, rather, in publicly owned, distributed, renewable power generation, few people are inconvenienced or endangered by a plant failure.\n\nAnd delivery charges on my hydro bill speak for themselves. I'm paying for wasted energy as it dissipates along the route from southern to eastern Ontario.\n\nPlease look to the future and bring citizens of this province the clean, reliable energy we all deserve.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206670]\n",

Go back to provincially available programs without the arduous task of assigning and dividing up target and budget ahead of time. LDC\u2019s have a difficult enough time keeping track of the monthly reporting to the IESO, let alone being expected to predict how many customers will take part in a specific program, and\/or how many specific measures (i.e. how many A-type light bulbs) are going to be installed by participating customers.\nEliminate the requirement for continual updates of the CDM plan.\u00a0 LDCs are well aware of their assigned target and budget.\u00a0 The issuance of IESO reports on a monthly basis (Participation & Cost Report and Value-Added Services), along with LDCs own internal tracking mechanisms, are sufficient to ensure the monitoring of achievements program-to-date.\u00a0 A single annual update from the LDC on programs that will be offered for the upcoming year, with start and stop dates, along with a basic projected annual budget would eliminate the administrative burden most LDCs experience in the current framework in terms of reporting and planning.\nConsistency - The ongoing scenario where programs are offered, then taken away, then offered again leads to lack of interest and confusion; not only for customers but also for channel partners and service providers. LDC\u2019s in rural and remote areas of the province are tasked continuously with higher costs associated with attaining trained, willing and enthusiastic channel partners to be able to offer all aspects of the programs. Retaining these partners is even more difficult when the longevity of a program is not in the forecast.\nWinter Peaking Programs and Innovation Funding \u2013 The demand for residential programs in the North has gained interest and speed exponentially over the past decade. LDS\u2019s are constantly asked by their whether there are any programs available for adding insulation, siding or replacing windows and doors. The results of pilot funding that Algoma Power Inc. took advantage of for the \u201cMy Energy Kit\u201d program lend to a prime example of this need for residential programs in the North; the pilot participation target was fulfilled in one week! Implement more pilots and local programs for winter peaking areas of the province and implement them directly in those areas. Add to this, provincially offered programs (i.e. Whole Home Program) offered to residents of Ontario via natural gas companies is confusing and leads to exclusion for those residents who are not natural gas customers. The \u201cnon-natural gas\u201d or \u201celectric only\u201d residents of the province need attention and programs which offer incentives to home-reno\/building envelope type projects as these customers are the hardest hit when it comes to energy costs.\nProvincial Program offers need to be \u201cProvincial\u201d \u2013 Introducing new programs for an entire province without the necessary resources in place across the board is discourteous and shows a true lack of concern for the struggling customers without access to all services. If any resident of Ontario should be offered a specific program to help them conserve electricity, it should be the residents who have to use electricity for every energy need in their home.\nCost Effectiveness on Residential Programs \u2013 Historical performance of residential programs across the board typically falls into the non-cost effective category. LDC\u2019s have vested interest in creating residential programs which suit the needs of their service territories; especially those LDCs which are composed of a heavily weighted residential customer base. A re-evaluation of current residential pilots, local programs and past programs for residential customers is vital.\nCustomer Service\nInformation on Customer\u2019s Bills \u2013 Clarification and more information for consumers, given the availability of information on everything else today, are far overdue when it comes to provincial energy bills. An entire review and revamp of the breakdown of charges on bills should be implemented. Consultation with specific LDC staff members, who deal directly with the customer when it comes to explaining the bill, is paramount.\nEnergy Retailers \u2013 Consult with LDC\u2019s on their struggles and frustrations when dealing with customers who have absolutely no idea of what an energy retailer is, yet have signed a contract with one. Going back to information on the bill, there is far more that can be done for customers seeking a contract with an energy retailer (or not seeking one) to explain the implications on the billed costs associated with entering into a contract.\nPrices \u2013 The OEB, in issuing its Regulated Price Plan (RPP) Roadmap, concluded that two of the four objectives originally set out in the RPP were not being met.\u00a0 Specifically, the RPP Roadmap concludes that the current TOU price structure is not easily understood by customers, nor does it set prices that provide consumers with incentives and opportunities to reduce their electricity bills by shifting their time of electricity use.\u00a0 More recently, Minister Thibeault questioned time of use pricing and suggested that the industry explore ways of providing consumers with more options.\nA number of LDC\u2019s have submitted proposals for RPP Pilot Programs that incorporate a wide range of technologies and rate structures and in some cases offer elements of customer choice.\u00a0 The results of these pilot programs should not only be compared to one another, but should also be considered in the wider context of customer preference, cost effectiveness, and achievement of overall conservation targets.\u00a0\u00a0 Consideration should also be given to pricing options in the context of the OEB\u2019s Regional Planning initiatives.\u00a0 Areas of the province with little to no load growth and\/or winter-peaking areas may not realize the avoided infrastructure benefits that are often touted as justifications for TOU pricing.\u00a0 Pricing options that encourage overall conservation as opposed to load shifting or demand response for residential customers in these areas may provide similar or greater overall benefits with greater customer acceptance.\n[Original Comment ID: 205386]\n",

        "comment":"I am extremely concerned about the rapidly increasing cost of electricity which appears to have resulted from high priced wind and solar contracts. Whilst the wind power industry claims future projects would have lower costs, this fails to take into consideration than standby capacity must be paid for and idled to pick up load when wind power isn't available. As well, there are high costs associated with disposal of excess electricity produced by wind power when it isn't needed.\nThe fact is, electricity prices have been shooting up since Ontario Hydro was broken up. \u00a0We lost \"Power at Cost\" for the mistaken belief that privatization would be cheaper and more efficient. Plainly it isn't!\nOur government must recognize that the only real force holding down electricity prices is publicly owned Ontario Power Generation. \u00a0However, once the Pickering nuclear power plant is phased out in the early 2020's, OPG will become a bit player in the Ontario electricity production industry, and will no longer be able to moderate cost of power. At this point the auctioning of power at spot market prices could cause catastrophic increases in electricity costs.\nIt's time for our government to wake up and realize that action is needed now to maintain or increase OPG's capacity via new nuclear plant construction, and if feasible, increased hydroelectric construction, both of which are carbon free.\nAs well we desperately need to cancel sales of Hydro One shares to avoid the added costs to cover profit that result of partial or full privatization.\nExpand nuclear as part of Canada's green energy plan and, to the extent possible, put electricity production back in the public sector by maintaining or increasing OPG's capacity.\n[Original Comment ID: 195845]\n",

        "comment":"I would like to express my support for the continuing role of nuclear power in Ontario's Long Term Energy Plan. In particular I strongly support refurbishment of the 4 reactors at Darlington and remaining 6 reactors at the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station.\nTwo serious concerns of mine, like many Ontarians, are the availability of quality jobs and the price of energy.\nI am a relatively recent graduate and have witnessed a truly disturbing number of my classmates and friends having difficulties finding quality, long term jobs. Many have gone back to school or have had to make do with short term contract jobs here and there with little to no long term promise. One thing I can say with certainty is that Ontario's nuclear operating companies (OPG and Bruce Power) as well as their suppliers do offer long term, career-worthy employment opportunities. The vast majority of these companies are also based in Ontario which ensures that the skills that Ontario invests in via funding for schools are kept in Ontario and are able to benefit the province.\nThe price of energy is of concern because it not only affects the economic well being of families, it also affects the cost of manufacturing goods in Ontario. More expensive power means higher operating costs for factories either leading to more expensive goods (which further stretch the budget of families) or relocation of manufacturing to places where power is cheaper. Nuclear provides a reliable baseload at lower than the average cost of electricity which helps keep electricity costs low.\nLastly, there are several asthma sufferers in my family (including myself) who are concerned about air quality. Smog days present a serious health risk to anyone with respiratory issues which is why I support Ontario's decision to phase out coal. However I am still concerned about the emissions of vehicles and am hoping to see the transition towards plug in hybrid and full electric vehicles. However this only results in an improvement in air quality if the generating stations powering the grid do not pollute the air. Otherwise the emissions are simply being relocated. Since nuclear power does not result in the emission of airbourne pollutants, maintaining our nuclear stations will allow Ontarians to reap the benefits of electric vehicles through cleaner air. Furthermore, since nuclear power does not generate greenhouse gases, it will not jeopardize our climate change targets.\nThank you for taking the time to consider my input,\nCurtis McEwan, P.Eng.\n[Original Comment ID: 195854]\n",

We believe that fossil fuels\u00a0 and nonrenewable sources of power should be eliminated and Ontario should work towards 100% renewable forms of energy as soon as possible. Climate change is such a severe threat and very drastic changes need to be implemented if we are to stop the terrible consequences of the warming of the planet through current use of fossil fuels. We need to leave them in the ground and stop subsidizing the fossil fuel companies but rather start subsidizing all green forms of energy production. We need to act now as the tipping point of the planet is already here, we cannot ignore this problem of climate change any longer and we need to be leaders in this endeavour before we reach the point of no return. No matter what other countries are doing, i.e. Trump and the USA, we need to be independent thinkers and act now to help this climate change disaster we currently are facing. Thank you for your attention to this matter. We are retired and in the last stage of our lives but we need to find a solution for the sake of our grandchildren and their children for generations to come.\n\nSincerely, Trish Dundass\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206705]\n",

Nuclear energy has historically been a key pillar of Ontario\u2019s electricity mix and should in the foreseeable future continue to provide Ontarians with a supply of clean electricity. \u00a0As greenhouse gas emissions continue to be a major cause of global warming, we as a society, we must do everything we can to minimize the production of these gasses to the greatest extent possible. \u00a0This includes both in the production of our electricity and eventually discontinuing the use of hydrocarbon powered vehicles. \u00a0As we start the transition to electric vehicles the province's electrical power usage will once again see significant increases. \u00a0Nuclear power generating stations, although expensive to construct, have proven to be a safe, economical, and a reliable source of power for the province. \u00a0This is important if we want to stimulate the growth of new industry here in Ontario. \u00a0The nuclear industry in Canada continues to produce an exceptionally trained workforce that is extremely safety conscious, well above what most other industries have achieved to date.\nWith Pickering Nuclear Generating Station nearing the end of its life expectancy, the government must consider adding new nuclear plants to assure Ontario has a clean source of baseline power in the future. \u00a0The foundation of our economy is our infrastructure. \u00a0A good transportation system (roads, shipping, rail, and air), a safe economical power system, robust telecommunication systems, a clean and secure water supply, strong emergency and public health services are all key to our maintaining a prosperous society.\n[Original Comment ID: 195883]\n",

        "comment":"Ontario needs to be part of a Canada-wide clean energy, green economy and environmental bill of rights. We have relatively clean energy although we should not be refurbishing nuclear stations. Instead, we should be building links with other jurisdictions so as to trade clean, safe renewable energy (use HVDC - electricity \"super highways\"). The hydro link with Quebec is an obvious alternative to nuclear which should be phased out. We have to build more renewable energy plants to replace the nuclear as it is phased out.\nWe should be implementing a carbon tax of over $100\/ton, not $50\/ton sometime in the future. Oil & gas companies know that below a $100\/ton doesn't make a difference to them. They have been pricing carbon for a long time now and you can even find a Harvard case study about BC's implementation of a carbon tax that discusses this carbon tax level issue. Take a look at European countries with carbon taxes such as Sweden, at almost $200\/ton (Cdn). Everyone knows cap and trade is a game (a joke) that climate change deniers enjoy. They can delay real change and make a lot of money off of it in the meantime, moving carbon emissions around. No matter what policy is implemented, multiple policies are required to reach a goal such as a reduction of GHGs. Thus, one cannot say that because we have a (useless) cap and trade system, then we don't need a carbon tax. Multiple policies are required and a carbon tax is one of them along with regulation to renewables, etc.\nWe should be keeping all of the oil & gas in the ground, at least the majority of it that is being extracted for energy consumption (burning). We should be shutting down tar sands and other operations, off and on shore - no more pipelines - and investing in the green economy so that those people who so desperately believe they need that dirty industry, can change to the kinds of jobs that actually make a positive contribution to our society and the world. Working for oil and gas companies is a destructive undertaking and only perpetuates a world wide addition that is killing us all. It is very much like a drug addiction and the only way to stop the addition is to stop the addicts' consumption.\nWe need to regulate changes so that everyone's next car is either a hybrid or an EV. The taxi industry should have to switch over its vehicles as they get old and also pay for some of the charging infrastructure. They use our roads for their businesses and idle and drive around constantly. They have to pay and help Ontario switch rather than making tax payers foot the bill for them. All commercial users of our roads should have to switch to clean vehicles and help pay for the charging infrastructure - it supports their businesses.\nWe also have to regulate builders so that we don't use natural gas or other fossil fuels for home heating or other uses. Instead, we have to regulate that all new buildings have closed envelopes for maximum efficiency and that they only use renewable energy.\nJust like we forced the change to high efficiency light bulbs, the same kind of actions need to take place in our transportation and building sectors. We have to make it required that the next vehicle is a hybrid or an EV and that our homes and other buildings are not contributing GHGs.\nAlso, I fully support John Tory's road tolls. We have to pay for the expansion of mass transit. Toronto and other cities like it cannot be successful mega cities without becoming \"Smart Cities\" and this includes integrated systems that ultimately support a circular economy supported by the respective circular\/clean infrastructure (for waste, water, energy, transportation, etc.). We have to start looking at our cities as holistic ecosystems within a province that should be broadly aligned with these changes.\nI also would suggest that we start regulating the reduction of waste at the source. For example, all the food and other things that we buy come in wasteful packaging and while a portion of it can be recycled, this is not the way to handle all of this garbage. The garbage should be drastically reduced. We can take our reusable containers to the grocery store and refill them. We don't need a new carton, box, etc. each time we buy the same thing. I am tired of getting home and unpacking everything that is over packaged and feeling the pang\u00a0 as I throw it all away (the boxes, plastic, styrofoam, etc.)\u00a0 after a one time use (whether it is recycled or not, it is so wasteful).\nIn addition, everything we buy should be labelled if is GMO or not. The recent salmon debacle is astounding, that we would actually allow GMO salmon to mix on our shelves with other real salmon and that consumers would not know what they are buying. The power of Monsanto and others like it, like the power of the oil and gas industry, has reached dangerous levels, putting all of our lives and future generations in danger. Our politicians should be held accountable when they engage in corruption by selling out to corporate lobbies.This has become such a regular phenomenon that no one realizes it as corruption anymore.\nI am 100% for a 100% clean energy, clean transportation, clean everything in Ontario. I would like to see all of Canada go 100% clean on all dimensions. We need to go back to the Canada I remember when we respected the environment and saw ourselves as part of it, not dominant over it. Listen to the native people. They understand and I understand that I am part of the environment. I do not stand separate from it. I am one of the many beings on this earth and I do not want to take from those others who thrive on this earth. They make the world a beautiful place.\n[Original Comment ID: 205476]\n",

Those in government who wasted 2 Billion installing smart meters well knew what they were doing. Access to affordable energy is a basic need. On our first Winter Cycle on Smart Meters it cost 98% to cook breakfast and supper. The new exploitive Delivery Charge was trailing along at about 92% of the energy charge. Tell me why the delivery charge when the same wire has been linked to my home for 60 years. I have no intention of becoming a Raw Vegan Fooder and enjoy eating a warm meal at the traditional times.\n\nPaying a Solar Farm 1,500% more for power produced is scandalous. Multiply 0.051 cents X 1500% = 0.765 cents + 0.051` = 0.816 cents Kilowatt which is the 0.80 cents being paid out. This is cronyism and Vote Buying of those that were financially capable of installing these solar units. Try and debate with them when they are drinking the Greed Kool Aid.\n\nAbout natural gas the first pipeline through Northern Ontario in 1957 was paid for by taxpayers. The Northern Ontario Pipeline Crown Corporation paid for it, then leased it to TCP, Trans Canada Pipelines. We have countless communities in Northern Ontario without natural gas service, even in some where there is a TCP Compressor Station. TCP obviously took the golden goose and ran with it never looking back. Recently learning that Bruce & Kent County have NO natural gas is disgraceful some 60 years after Toronto was blessed with this low cost commodity.

        "comment":"Andrea Pastori\nCabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator\nMinistry of Energy\nStrategic, Network and Agency Policy Division\nStrategic Policy and Analytics Branch\n77 Grenville Street\nFloor 6th\nToronto Ontario\nM7A 2C1\nDear Ms. Pastori,\nFollowing are comments from the David Suzuki Foundation with respect to EBR Registry number 012-8840.\nIntroduction\nOur overall recommendation is that Ontario should use the LTEP to facilitate a transition to a society whose power, heating and transportation are supplied from 100 per cent renewable sources. We believe this is a necessity based on economic and environmental considerations.\nThe Economic Case for Renewable Energy\nThe cost of renewable energy is on a downward trajectory. In 2012, then-U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu told Scientific American, \"Renewable energy is getting cheaper and cheaper. Perhaps within this decade, wind and solar will be as inexpensive as any form of new energy.\"\nThe International Energy Agency says that, in 2015, renewable power \"expanded at its fastest-ever rate...thanks to supportive government policies and sharp cost reductions.\"\nMore recently, in August 2016, an article in Bloomberg New Energy Finance argued, \"The rapid uptake of renewable generation in the power system [is] unstoppable now because of cost reductions in wind and solar...\" Turning specifically to Ontario, we have seen solar costs \u2014 reflecting FIT prices and LRP bids \u2014 drop 66 per cent since 2009.\nAt the same time that the renewables' cost-curve has been trending downward, the curve for nuclear power has been trending upward. Ontario Power Generation recently sought permission from the Ontario Energy Board to raise nuclear base payment amounts by 11 per cent a year from 2017 to 2021. Nuclear costs will also be under pressure from expensive rebuilds and the unknown, but likely considerable, expense of decommissioning the reactors and keeping them isolated from humanity for the rest of time. Needless to say, the significant cost of managing radioactive waste is not something renewable projects face.\nIn sum, shifting to renewables is a necessity if we are to contain the costs that Ontarians pay for their power.\nExpanding renewables can also lead to significant job growth. As Environmental Defence makes clear in a recent report, \"continuing to develop increasingly low cost wind and solar energy post 2021 would not only keep the valuable supply chain the province has developed intact, it would also sustain the thousands of jobs in Ontario's renewable energy industry.\" It is crucial to remember that from 2008 to 2014, Ontario's solar and wind sectors saw the creation of some 180,000 direct and indirect jobs. A further roll-out of renewable power would enhance job creation even more.\nThe Environmental Case for Renewable Energy\nThe importance of tackling climate change cannot be overstated. Ontario is to be commended for its coal-power phase-out, one of the world's most important climate change mitigation actions. However, if we are to ensure a temperature rise of no more than 1.5 degrees C \u2014 as the science says we must \u2014 it is essential that Ontario fully decarbonize its electricity system. This means, to start, that we must phase out our natural-gas-fired power plants. Fortunately, we are now in a strong position to do this. Seventy-five per cent of our natural gas stations' contracts are set to expire by 2018. The province should simply refuse to renew them. Instead, it should ramp-up solar projects \u2014 which are ideal for replacing gas during the summer \u2014 and purchase additional hydro-power from Quebec. We were gratified to see that, in the October 21, 2016, statement on Ontario-Quebec electricity trade, the provinces wrote that Ontario will import \"up to 2 terawatt hours annually of clean hydro power from Quebec at targeted times when natural gas would otherwise be used.\" This is a significant start and we would like to see much more of it.\nWe also believe that, to protect our climate, renewables must replace nuclear power. The process of uranium production \u2014 an essential component of the nuclear system \u2014 is carbon-intensive. Writing in Scientific American, Mark Jacobson and Mark Delucchi argue, \"Nuclear power results in up to 25 times more carbon emissions than wind energy, when reactor construction and uranium refining and transport are considered.\" Renewables are a climate solution; nuclear is not.\nCommunity Power\nTo build a 100 per cent renewable grid, the province needs to offer more support to community-based renewable initiatives. These projects \u2014 many owned by co-ops, First Nations, religious groups and farmers \u2014 have numerous benefits. First, they are popular with Ontarians. A recent poll from Ekos Research found that 78 per cent of respondents think it's important for the province to \"increase community ownership of renewable energy projects.\" This is not a small consideration because if we are to build out renewables we need widespread citizen support; community-based projects build that support. Second, these projects are advantageous to the local economy. A June, 2016, report produced by TREC Renewable Energy Co-op compared the economic benefits of local solar projects with those from non-local commercial projects. Conclusion: If the project was locally owned and the solar panels and inverters locally manufactured, the economic impact was 77 per cent greater than if ownership and production were non-local. Overall, TREC estimates that \"every dollar of the FIT rate spent on community energy results in more than $2 in additional economic activity.\"\nFinally, community power is a good source of employment. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance says renewable projects that are community-owned usually generate twice as many jobs as projects that have a corporate owner.\nRecommendations\nIn sum, the David Suzuki Foundation believes the Long-Term Energy Plan should:\n1) Set out a clear trajectory to take the province to 100 per cent renewable power, transportation and heating by 2050 at the latest.\n2) Replace costly nuclear reactors with affordable wind, solar and water power.\n3) Keep in place the FIT program for community-owned renewable projects.\n4) Create a new FIT for community-held wind projects.\n5) Commit the province to providing loan guarantees for renewable energy co-ops and other community power organizations.\nThank you.\n[Original Comment ID: 196190]\n",

It is equally important to ensure a strong reliable base-load is maintained to support a healthy, well functioning, system. With the increasing concern and focus on climate change one of the best methods to reducing greenhouse gas emission is through a cheap, low carbon emitting, clean energy source, Nuclear Power. Bruce Power has proven that it is a cheap, safe, low carbon emitting energy source. Through safe and reliable operation, Bruce Power has contributed to reducing carbon emissions in Ontario by providing the makeup energy required to allow coal fired plants to be shut down. But, not only does Bruce Power provide safe, clean reliable energy, it does so by producing one of the lowest cost forms of energy than most all other sources, Nuclear Power. This is most important as Ontarians are seeing first hand how skyrocketing electricity prices have recently been a major focus for Ontario. The capability to provide low cost, clean, reliable energy must be maintained and embraced well into the future to ensure energy is kept affordable for all.\nWith these critical points in mind, I support the full operation of Bruce Power's 8 operating units to 2064. This will provide a strong basis for a long-term energy plan that promotes clean, reliable, affordable electricity for all Ontarians well into the future.\nRegards,\nDan McArthur\n[Original Comment ID: 196256]\n",

Having said this I beg the government to do the right thing as suggested above and move as quickly as possible to the most environmentally sound sources of power generation.\n\nThank you\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206745]\n",

As such, the BGPTF encourages the Government of Ontario to ensure that all discussions related to long-term energy strategies at the provincial planning level include the needs of vulnerable populations and the availability of affordable housing as outlined in the Government of Ontario's Long-Term Affordable Housing Strategy.\nOn November 1, 2016, BGPTF partner and Executive Director of the United Way Bruce Grey Francesca Dobbyn attended the Barrie consultation on the LTEP and shared local input on how energy plans can be better integrated with provincial planning and to ensure broader community planning and local community needs are taken into account during long-term fuels and electricity planning.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nRecommendations for the Ontario government's Long-Term Energy Plan include:\n\u2022Control escalating utility costs to ensure Ontario maintains a sustainable supply of affordable housing;\n\u2022Ensure greater transparency to inform and educate tenants of the costs associated with utilities when they enter into a new lease (e.g. consumption patterns of previous tenants);\n\u2022Legislate disconnection policies preventing winter disconnects and waiving re-connection fees for low-income populations. While some companies (e.g. Hydro One, Union Gas) have general policies against winter disconnects, others continue to enforce disconnects during the winter, placing vulnerable populations at risk;\n\u2022Investment in additional conversion programs which provide individual households and non-profit housing units access to efficient and affordable heating systems;\n\u2022Entice landlords to upgrade rentals with efficient heating systems through the provision of incentives and home insulation programs;\n\u2022Increase the range and depth of social security benefits to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to safe and affordable housing. For example, 1. Increase rent supplements - or non RGI programs - to provide a broader range of options and opportunities for households in need; 2. Increase the availability of affordable housing stock; 3. Reduce the risk of re-housing by promoting inclusive rental agreements which include utility costs in the monthly rent; \u2022Increase engagement with community-based organizations who provide direct support to low-income clients who face eviction or disconnects as a result of being unable to pay utility bills; \u2022Increase recognition of agencies that provide services to assist low-income families manage utility usage and bill payment, including the provision of funding for services offered; \u2022Examine the role of third party (or 're-energy') providers over concerns that low-income earners and seniors in our community are being taken advantage of;\n\u2022Review the merits of the current delivery fee system against a more equitable flat-fee rate system;\nQUICK FACTS:\n\u202220% of families in Owen Sound-Georgian Bluffs and 41% of lone-parent families earn a median income of only $15,590 - half of Statistic Canada\u2019s Low Income Cut-off for a family of 4.

        "comment":"In a world that absolutely needs to stop producing greenhouse gases, it is critical to start on the paths to energy conservation and renewable energy generation.\n\nNatural gas is not an answer to a cleaner energy future. It may turn out to be a short term bridge to a fully renewable energy future, but it should be the shortest possible bridge. I attended one of the government's energy open houses in St Catharines. What I couldn't understand is why there was such an emphasis on natural gas at the open house. While it is understandable that it is presently cheap and plentiful thanks to fracking (which has a whole set of its own problems), this cheapness and plenty comes at the cost of exacerbating the problems of anthropologically induced climate change. In terms of heating, an electrically powered (by wind and solar coupled with advances in energy storage) solution using air- and ground-source heat pumps would seem to be an excellent path to avoid falling into a natural gas trap.\n\nProponents of the nuclear industry are fond of saying that nuclear energy is green-house gas free. While this is basically true (discounting the large amount of greenhouse gases expended in building nuclear plants), I believe that there are too many problems with nuclear energy to pursue it any further. Nuclear has had its opportunity. It has failed by almost all measures. All nuclear development or refurbishment should be stopped immediately. Nuclear is expensive, although this is difficult to determine this since the nuclear industry is not the least bit forthcoming with its financial details. The industry likes to say that if provides jobs. Again, this is true but a lot of the jobs are relatively short-term construction jobs. After that, there are indeed, high-paying jobs for a few, but how can an energy industry that pays cafeteria workers more than $100,000 per year and executives unconscionable salaries and then requests an 11% increase in its rates for ten years running expect us to believe that it represents a cost-effective and fiscally responsible energy source for Ontarians? Nuclear energy can be extraordinarily dangerous as demonstrated at Fukushima Daiichi. And, finally, how can an industry that has no credible plans for waste products that will be dangerous for 60,000 years expect us show support.\n\nThank you for reading. To summarize briefly: maximize all possible energy conservation opportunities, minimize the use of natural gas as a bridging solution, stop all nuclear generation at the end of its planned (not artificially extended) life, and maximize the use of renewable energy by supporting new solutions for energy storage.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206759]\n",

Current plans have Ontario headed down the most expensive path with unacceptable risks to the economic health and safety of Ontarians in future.\n\nWe should be planning for 100% renewable energy as many countries and cities around the world and in Canada are doing. We should be investing heavily in conservation which is by far the cheapest alternative.\n\nOur plans to continue operation of Pickering reactors beyond their designed life span and to refurbish other nuclear reactors is irresponsible. The risk of continuing to operate Pickering and other nuclear plants is great enough that the market place and the government dictate that residents of and businesses inToronto and other municipalities have no insurance on persons\/ properties should they be harmed by a serious nuclear accident. The $1 billion liability provided by federal legislation is totally inadequate. Any assistance would have to be provided by the government - in effect this is a huge subsidy to the nuclear industry and places Ontarians at serious risk despite the low probability of an event like Fukushima.\n\nOntario should be seeking more electrical energy from Quebec - it comes from renewable resources and is far cheaper than nuclear energy which is not renewable. Recently Quebec has indicated that it wants to enter into long term contracts for some 3 GW of energy and continues to discuss opportunities to export this energy to New York State and New England States. It is madness, economic and otherwise, that Ontario is not seeking to obtain more energy from Quebec.\n\nGiven the recent history of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), there is no reason for anyone to have confidence that it places the safety of Canadians above its priority to promote nuclear energy. CNSC has not learned the lessons of Fukushima and the conclusion that the Japanese government, regulator, and industry bear the primary responsibility for the Fukushima event - our situation does not appear to be much different.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206760]\n",

This government needs to do some explaining.\nOn a similar subject, what is the rationale for selling off Ontario Hydro? Money can be borrowed at 3%, and Ontario Hydro gives a 9% to 11% rate of return.

Ontario electricity is generated at about 20 GW from 95% carbon-free sources, while the other sectors currently still use about 70 GW of carbon power. This 70 GW carbon energy requirement should be substituted with reliable, affordable, predictable carbon-free electric power from additional nuclear generation.\nThe additional carbon-free energy should come from compact load-following nuclear-waste-burning fast-neutron reactors.\nNuclear\n1) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is carbon-free,\n2) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is our second-cheapest source of energy and therefore affordable (hydroelectric is cheaper, but Ontario has exhausted most of our potential hydro sources; wind and solar are 2 and 7 times more expensive respectively and require fossil-fuel back-up),\n3) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is reliable 24\/7 compared to intermittent wind and solar. Moreover,\n4) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 fast-neutron reactors are load-following, being able to follow the variations in daily power demand.\n5) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As a bonus, fast-neutron reactors (FNRs) can have their fuel replenished with highly radioactive used CANDU fuel waste to eliminate the long-term radioactivity of that material. The over 99% heavy atom component in used CANDU fuel can be completely consumed by recycling through FNRs. Thus, in addition to major amounts of carbon-free energy such an approach eliminates a major societal concern: the million-year radiotoxicity of currently stored used CANDU fuel.\n6) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In addition, the fuel is available, already stored at reactor sites, with the result that the carbon footprint of nuclear power using FNRs is further reduced since no fuel mining is required.\n7)FNRs have been tested under full power and proven to be safe, such that this type of reactor would have survived the events that led to the Fukushima and Three-Mile-Island accidents and even avoided the disaster of Chernobyl, unscathed.\n8) FNRs come as modular units of reasonable size (200 to 600 MWe; e.g. GEH PRISM at 300 MWe), factory-built, and can be introduced piece-meal at a reasonable cost as required. This lowers the up-front financial commitment, lowers the time to profitable operation, and also builds up Canadian expertise.\nFinances\n9)An FNR\/recycling approach by the Ministry of Energy would not require new monies to be raised\nvia taxes or levies. The FNR\/recycling approach of consuming highly radioactive used CANDU fuel waste means that a long-term deep geological repository (DGR) for disposal of such used CANDU fuel waste is no longer required, making the $20 \u2013 40 billion slated for such a DGR now redundant. Such monies currently being accumulated in trust for the DGR (amounting already to $9 billion at present) would become available for use towards the introduction of the nuclear-waste-consuming load-following FNR\/recycling approach of providing carbon-free power in Ontario as replacement power or as additional power for Ontario\u2019s carbon-using economic sectors.\n[Original Comment ID: 196451]\n",

Fossil fuel adds new heat because it comes from underground, both direct release from burning and indirectly from GHG's elevating C02. For example coal, and fossil oil, could be replaced by wood, and plant oil which were trees\/plants absorbing C02 before being made into fuel. ,(which means coal fired plants could have been switched to wood)\n\nNuclear generation is clean in the sense of not producing GHG's. However nuclear generation comes from inside atoms and 100% of its energy - both 75% released at source and 25% when electricity is used. How much direct heating causes global warming compared to GHG's is still a matter of debate, but the reality is Ontario nuclear releases numerous atomic bombs worth of heat per yr, to the environment while hydro by comparison releases NO new heat (since natural energy simply diverts energy in nature towards humans.)\n\nOntario pursuit of wind energy was stupid. Being inspired by wind energy in Europe where there is little opportunity for hydro, is a mistake since Ontario is filled with hydro potential. Energy must be tailored to the natural resources of the area that needs it. There is no need for Ont to pursue the irregularity of wind when hydro offers a continuous resource that can even store energy by controlling the outlet of a reservoir. For example the Trent-Severn waterway offers a great deal untapped hydro resources. Do not flirt with nuclear or wind because its sexy, if it is a bad choice.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206782]\n",

There is no safe way to dispose of nuclear waste. Certainly burying it in rock on the shores of Lake Huron is a ridiculous notion, for the rock shores of the Great Lakes are constantly moving, shifting, currently rising up, and radiation could migrate into Lake Huron. Our power plants are close to urban centres, and millions of people will be affected by a nuclear accident. Nuclear accidents cannot be cleaned up. Look at recent attempts to finally enclose Chernobyl. Look at the ongoing effects of Fukushima. Why do we risk such expensive, life-threatening catastrophe?\n\nEven if running perfectly, nuclear power is not cheap. It is heavily subsidized by the taxpayer. Construction is always over budget, by billions of dollars. The taxpayer pays.\n\nWe have had some financial issues with Solar power, but it is coming down in cost, and research is expanding potential exponentially, so that soon we can have solar panels in roofing materials, as well as in roadways. It would be easy to require that all new construction of towers include solar power - a small cost compared to the cost of the overall construction. Small windmills also hold great potential.\n\nI strongly urge, plead with you to make Ontario's future green, with no nuclear power, but instead renewable, sustainable power.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206789]\n",

Methane levels made a startling jump in the past few years and evidence indicates that warming soils will be a major source of carbon dioxide.\u00a0 The urgency of investments in conservation and renewable energy is becoming ever more obvious.\n\nWind, solar, and energy storage technologies continue to decrease in cost.\u00a0 Feed-in-tariffs under the Green Energy Act contributed to these cost decreases but have been incorrectly identified as the main contributor to high hydro rates.\u00a0 A renewed emphasis on renewable technologies is needed, and particularly smaller-scale, locally owned, cooperative ventures rather than contracts with large off-shore companies.\n\nNuclear technologies show increasing cost trends and have been a larger contributor to high hydro rates than renewables.\u00a0 Costs and risks of nuclear power make refurbishment projects unwise. The statement in the discussion guide that \"Nuclear generation is important because it is reliable, cost-effective and GHG-free\" is post-truth rather than factual.\u00a0 This ignores the unsolved, risky and extremely expensive issue of dealing with the huge amounts of nuclear wastes.\u00a0 Use of unenriched uranium in Ontario's CANDU heavy water reactors means that they generate roughly five times more high-level nuclear waste than light water reactors.\n\nLarge crown corporations and unions have had far too much influence in terms of promotion of nuclear power. Hydro power should be imported from neighboring jurisdictions in preference to continued investment in nuclear plants.\n\nIn the longer term, Ontario (and other jurisdictions) should make a transition to a much more distributed electricity system with local generation and less grid maintenance costs.\n\nHeating buildings without burning fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases is a challenge that must be tackled immediately.\u00a0 This can be done with a combination of geothermal energy, wood-based systems (including electricity cogeneration and district heating), and much more progressive r building codes which take building orientation and passive solar energy into account, not just insulation. Biomass fuels - particularly in the forestry sector - are extremely underutilized and undervalued in Ontario, perhaps because of the province's over-emphasis on large-scale engineering projects rather than smaller, distributed, diversified energy sources.\u00a0 It is discouraging to see (in Figure 2) an actual decline in the share of biomass fuels between 2005 and 2015, even as the share of fossil fuels in the fuel supply mix has grown.\n\nEnergy use in the agriculture sector warrants particular attention.\u00a0 Agricultural biofuels should be dedicated to on-farm use rather than put into the general transportation fuel stream.\u00a0 Biodiesel is better suited to rural than urban use because of pollution concerns, and is also good a powering equipment such as tractors which require high torque.\u00a0 There is merit in pursuing a sector-by-sector approach (agriculture,forestry,transportation, urban bukldings, etc.) to energy sustainability.\n\nGiven the political clout of the auto sector in Ontario, it is politically difficult to argue for taking cars off the road, but this is exactly what needs to happen.\u00a0 The electric car market will grow but the fossil fuel car market must decline at a much faster rate.\u00a0 Development of active transportation infrastructure - cycling and walking - is an encouraging trend but should be given even higher priority.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206792]\n",

        "comment":"Cancel the contracts, Minister Thibeault (we\u2019re asking again)\nIt\u2019s been quite windy the last few days in Ontario, as it often is in the fall. Temperatures have been mild, too \u2014 all that stacks up not only to a beautiful fall but a very expensive few days for Ontario\u2019s electricity customers, already hard-hit by their power bills which are the fastest rising in North America.\nParker Gallant has done the analysis on a single day last week, November 10, which he says points out everything that is wrong with Ontario\u2019s electricity policy. Too much power produced when we don\u2019t need it means cheap exports to our neighbours and more expense for Ontarians.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from his recent blog posting:\nNovember 10th serves as a perfect example of what\u2019s happening to electricity customers in Ontario: that day, the government\u2019s electricity policy shows we reward huge corporate wind power developers and it also highlights the intermittent nature of power generation from wind \u2014 it is out of phase with demand.\nNovember 10 should be the basis of a message to the Minister of Energy, Glenn Thibeault on the Large Renewable Procurement (LRP) program: Ontario should cancel both the LRP I contracts awarded last April and cancel the now \u201csuspended\u201d LRP II process. \u00a0The Minister has already admitted our electricity supply is more than adequate for the next 10 years (\u201crobust\u201d in fact, he says) so acquiring more wind generated power (and solar) should be immediately suspended. It does nothing other than drive up the costs for \u201caverage\u201d households.\nThe $9.4 million of ratepayer dollars handed out November 10 neither reduced emissions nor provided useful electricity. Time for a complete overhaul of electricity policy in Ontario, starting with those contracts and the LRP process.\nWhen the subject of cancelling contracts (which is government\u2019s right) comes up, the immediate response from the influential wind power lobby is that to do so will incur lawsuits, and wreck Ontario\u2019s reputation in the business\/investment world. The fact is, anyone knows that building your business on a subsidy program is not good planning; it\u2019s also true that the Ontario government included \u201coff-ramps\u201d in the latest contracts, so that it could change its mind if the power is not needed, and pay out the power developers\u2019 documented expenses.\nHere are the details for the five contracts awarded by the IESO last spring.\nProject name Capacity MW 20-yr cost $ Max payout liability $\nOtter Creek 50 218 million 500,000\nRomney Wind 60 261 million 520,000\nStrong Breeze 57 250 million 515,000\nEastern Fields 32 139 million 464,000\nNation Rise 100 436 million 600,000\nSource: data from IESO contracts\nSo, in the case of Strong Breeze, for example, in the community of Dutton Dunwich which resoundingly expressed its Not A Willing Host status but got a wind power project anyway, the government could get out of a $250-million contract by paying, at most, $515,000. Similarly, Nation Rise, in another unwilling host community, could be cancelled for a maximum liability of $600,000 and save Ontario electricity ratepayers from having the $436 million cost added to their bills.\nLet\u2019s go farther! Among the projects with Renewable Energy Approvals (REAs) but not yet operating, are the much contested White Pines in Prince Edward County and the Windlectric project on Amherst Island, both of which are in legal battles and both are in danger of not meeting their contracted Commercial Operation date. Cancelling them would save a lot of wildlife and also save Ontario electricity customers almost $1 billion.\nMr Gallant says that November 10 is emblematic of what\u2019s wrong with Ontario\u2019s electricity policy; we add, why buy more power Ontario doesn\u2019t need and inflict more damage on the natural environment and Ontario\u2019s rural communities, when the answer is so simple.\nCancel the contracts, Minister Thibeault.\n[Original Comment ID: 196585]\n",

Enabling communities to power their own facilities will allow the province to grow sustainable and quickly, setting us up for success. Let's empower communities and citizens to go 100% renewable\n\nMore and more communities, countries and companies are opting to go 100% renewable. \u00a0 Ontario\u2019s next energy plan should put policies in place to enable citizens, communities and First Nations to go 100% renewable.\n\nTo fight climate change and reduce our environmental footprint, I think Ontario\u2019s next energy plan should make conservation and efficiency the first priority for all energy decisions.

Ontario\u2019s 2013 energy plan committed to close the Pickering nuclear station between 2017 and 2020, but earlier this year the government announced they would renege on this promise and keep operating Pickering until 2024. Almost all of Pickering\u2019s output is surplus and exported to Michigan at a loss.\u00a0 This is needlessly driving up energy costs.\n\nPickering\u2019s continued operation also puts the public at risk. Ontario has not updated its nuclear emergency plans since the Fukushima disaster. And many highly populated cities are in close proximity to this nuclear station.\n\nI want the government to keep its promise to close Pickering before 2020. Shutting Pickering down should be a first step in Ontario\u2019s long-term transition to renewable energy.\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider my comments.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206801]\n",

        "comment":"Personally, I am a believer in moving towards \"other\" renewal types of transportable liquid energy such as the BioDiesel and BioPropane or whatever else can be used for gasoline other than Ethanol. In our area (Northern Ontario), Bio normally comes in 100% pure and needs to be blended with regular diesel to get to the B5-B20 mix. \u00a0 During the summer months this can be a labour intensive process, but it can be done. \u00a0Issue is during the winter months, Bio turns to Jello. \u00a0meaning it does not flow and actually can cause mechanical issues. \u00a0From a distributors perspective, we would have to keep any bio inside a heated building and the truck that delivers would also have to be kept inside during the colder months. \u00a0Even if all was heated, when you left to make deliveries and got stuck or a flat tire or any other mechanical issue, the entire load and the vehicles fuel system now is in jeopardy of turning into Jello and the repair costs to fix this is astronomical.\nAs for the Ethanol in our area (Hub of the Great Lakes) any customer that is near water does not like anything to do with Ethanol as it seems to grab water at an astounding rate. \u00a0Most of our Marinas have in their contracts with us that they will refuse any fuel that has Ethanol in it. \u00a0as for as lawnmowers and ATV's or snowmobiles, they too have major issues with Ethanol. \u00a0You cannot get a snow blower to run on Ethanol blended gas as any small snow or water particles will freeze and cause fuel issues with the engine. \u00a0Keeping them inside heated building helps, but it can also allow more condensation to build up and then the Ethanol grabs even more water and if allowed to freeze stops the engine.\nI have heard that in the US, they are making Propane from Algae blooms and it seems to work quite well in all areas. \u00a0there seem to be many ways to make BioPropane but I have not had any access to it in our area. \u00a0 BioDiesel works great when it is warm, but not when it is cold. \u00a0Plus it can go bad (rotten) if made from Vegetable Oils.\nHaving set thresholds to use or consume a certain percentage of Bio\/Ethanol in our Fuels in Ontario is commendable, but during times of the year, it is not practical. \u00a0Those that want to put the effort into all the additional steps to deal in the Bio\/Ethanol world are willing to work thru these challenges. \u00a0But to force this across the board will be very costly and will hamper and potentially hurt many industries and residents. \u00a0Until manufacturers can come up with some ideas to keep the fuel warm or make the fuel to flow during cold temps in all aspects of equipment (snow blowers up to snow plows) we may need to rely on conventional Petroleum products. \u00a0Thanks for your time.\n[Original Comment ID: 196675]\n",

But those urban electricity demands were forced onto rural dwellers far from the source of the demands without public discussion. The political and moral issues of this dislocation were still with us in Oakville recently. Demands of urban dwellers should not be allowed to impact distant citizens or natural processes without full public discussion.

People need to know that renewable energy is not CO2 neutral because you have to cost the CO2 created in the mining of the components; the manufacture of the components; the transportation of the components; the installation of the components; the operation of the IWT\/ solar panels; the servicing of the IWT\/solar panels; the decommissioning of the IWT\/solar panels much of which is toxic waste and can not be recycled. How much concrete are we leaving in farm land when we decommission an IWT? How is that green, clean or cheap?. All these processes are very much dependent on the oil industry and create CO2, plus in West Lincoln the equivalent of 24,000 trees were cut down to put up 44 industrial wind turbines. Renewables are not clean, not green and not cheap. IWT's are a failure on every front and only exist because of the subsidies. If the subsidies disappeared the industry would disappear.\nPeople need to know that the over build on renewables is 400% because they are intermittent and only function 25-28 % of the time - and less for solar.\nPeople need to know that base load power is required to run the grid.\nPeople know that hydro is renewable energy, but in Ontario we spill water to accommodate wind and solar!\nPeople need to know that we paid $2 BILLION for Big Becky in Niagara Falls and not one drop of water has gone through the tunnel to produce hydro - the cleanest greenest cheapest energy available.\nPeople need to know we are producing way more energy than we are using and are exporting energy for less than the cost of production which ratepayers pay to Quebec, Manitoba, Michigan and New York State.\nPeople need to know what the deal with Quebec is? We will be paying for it. Where is the transparency?\nPeople need to know what is the long term costs of the FIT contracts unless we renegotiate them or find a way to tax back the profit so we can level the playing field. Fit contracts cost us $2 billion per year and that will increase each year for the next 20 years. This will be a constant reminder to the voting public of the folly of the renewable energy initiative of the Liberal Party of Ontario. Add to that the cost of 'cap and trade' which will also be reflected in the energy bill and Liberals will be as popular as Bob Rae of the NDP with Rae day's\nPeople need to know that there are health effects from infra-sound and low frequency sound and people that are affected deserve to be heard and compensated.\nPeople need to know that the government still has not done a cost benefit analysis of the renewable energy portfolio.\nPeople need to know that people connected to the Liberal government are getting rich in the industrial wind energy eg Mike Crawley\nPeople need to know that neither the Ministry of Energy, the IESO or Hydro One were at the bargaining table prior to \u00a0Minister of Energy, George Smitherman inking the $9 billion renewable energy deal with Samsung. (Without a discussion in parliament.) You have been given the task of implementing a governmental initiative that is neither justified or justifiable. You are responsible for providing affordable and reliable power, renewables are neither.\nIf you truly wanted to address issues of Climate Change you would put forward household solar and help people become independent generators of their own energy. Helping people to generate power at source - eg solar, geothermal reduces transmission costs and losses. As soon as the storage issue is solved and the cost of private generation is less than provincial generation, distribution and profit people will move to 'get off of the grid' and we will abandon Hydro One like rats off of a sinking ship. And all this incompetence will become stranded assets!\n\nPeople need to know that we are downloading $330 BILLION of unpaid provincial debt on the next generation \u2013 we are destroying the future of our children and grandchildren. \u00a0We can not afford to commit to government initiatives that do not work, line the pockets of the corporate elite - most of the IWT money goes to foreign countries- Samsung, Enercon, Nextera\u2026- and bankrupt the next generation.\nWe are on the financial path to bankrupt this country.

More than 80% of the people of Ontario think that their hydro bills are too high. Regardless of the rhetoric, cap and trade will be a disaster in the energy field. Australia found that \u2018cap and trade\u2019 increased unemployment and skyrocketing electricity prices didn\u2019t outweigh the insignificant reduction in carbon emissions. For Ontario the additional costs will be on our electricity bills Jan 2017, just in time for the next election.\nRead more: http:\/\/dailycaller.com\/2014\/07\/21\/aussie-carbon-tax-repeal-discourages-cap-and-traders-across-the-p lanet\/#ixzz4QMDU7xNQ\n[Original Comment ID: 196685]\n",

        "comment":"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Ontario Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP). I believe that the LTEP puts too much reliance on nuclear power, and that Ontario should invest the money earmarked for rebuilding nuclear reactors into renewable energy instead. I bring the following supporting arguments.\n\nRebuilding nuclear reactors is a time consuming and expensive task and, if history is to be repeated, fraught with very real risks of schedule and cost over-runs (Pickering, Gentilly-2, Point Lepreau for example). Solar projects, on the other hand, are straightforward and predictable because they are smaller and more numerous. If one solar project fails, there are many backups but if a nuclear project fails, there is no backup.\n\nNuclear energy has an availability problem. One nuclear reactor can produce an enormous amount of power, but this massive scale means that a shutdown (even just for routine maintenance) removes a large portion of the grid's capacity for weeks. In the case of a breakdown such as the Pickering failure of a pressure tube, the loss to the grid is a long term problem. It's like saying my car can do 250 kph, but it's in the shop 4 weeks of every year.\n\nNuclear energy could not have become as big in the electricity mix if it weren't for massive subsidies. Ontario taxpayers and ratepayers will never see a return on investment. Continuing to subsidize nuclear power is good money after bad.\n\nSolar photovoltaics will continue deployment even without subsidies as PV materials and manufacturing improve and lower the cost per kW-h. Nuclear reactors are stuck in 50 year old technology and new designs are both financially risky (they might not work) and hazardous (they might leak).\n\nThe availability of very powerful low cost \"Industrial Internet of Things\" microcontrollers and networking equipment contributes to improving the kind of distributed control systems required for the \"smart grid\" of small generators with local consumption.\n\nElectricity storage systems are becoming commercially viable and will help to reduce the daily peak demand while also addressing the sporadic nature of wind power. Power generated in off-peak periods could be stored to supplement peak demand.\n\nThe nuclear industry still has not solved the problem of radioactive waste. Deep geologic dumps are not a solution, merely deferring the problem to future generations. We enjoyed the benefits, they get the burden. It hardly seems fair.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206819]\n",

There are cleaner forms of energy including hydroelectricity which is being developed in places like Quebec periods I would prefer if we purchased our electricity from Quebec. It would be cleaner and less expensive. We seem to have it all wrong in this province. We are making terrible mistakes. Proliferation of nuclear energy is something that future Generations will not forgive us for because the price they will pay will be much higher than you admit. The cost of this nuclear energy is\u00a0 too high when measured by healthcare costs and environmental costs.\n\nI strongly urge that you discontinue developing nuclear energy and work toward building safer electricity sources.\n\nI also urge you to stop the insanity that has led to such high energy costs in our province. No matter how you spin it, this is unfair to citizens of Ontario. The political games that have resulted in a completely disastrous electricity policy need to be addressed and stopped.

Despite this, the government\u2019s past energy plans have made no requirement for nuclear projects to undergo public review against alternatives. This needs to change.\nOntario\u2019s next energy plan needs to ensure there are a full and fair comparisons of the total costs of nuclear with alternatives and an opportunity for the public to have a say about which approach they prefer.\nClose Pickering:\u00a0 Ontario\u2019s 2013 energy plan committed to close the Pickering nuclear station between 2017 and 2020, but earlier this year the government announced they would renege on this promise and keep operating Pickering until 2024.\nAlmost all of Pickering\u2019s output is surplus and exported to Michigan at a loss.\u00a0 This is driving up energy costs.\nPickering\u2019s continued operation also puts the public at risk. Ontario has not updated its nuclear emergency plans since the Fukushima disaster.\nI want the government to keep its promise to close Pickering before 2020. Shutting Pickering down should be a first step in Ontario\u2019s long-term transition to renewable energy.\n[Original Comment ID: 205921]\n",

        "comment":"I am opposed to nuclear energy because it is too costly both in its energy production and sequestering of the hazardous waste generated, too dangerous in its radioactive fuel, too complex to be a safe technology, too deadly that a slight error could cause catastrophic results, too large and centralized in its power production, and\u00a0 too egregious in its regulatory anti-democracy.\n\nI think the process of shutting down reactors needs to begin immediately, while fossil fuel energy is still reasonably available and inexpensive, so as to facilitate the energy costs of decommissioning and decontamination.\n\nNew sources of renewable energy combined with energy conservation offer a transition to a new society not based on exploitation.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206831]\n",

        "comment":"I support clean, renewable energy in Ontario. As a taxpayer, I expect that energy will be purchased by the province in a cost-effective manner. While people have questioned the increased investment in renewables, these are decreasing with the advances in technology and production scale. In comparison, the costs to support nuclear are astounding and even then so little information is available to determine its benefits against renewables. The nuclear power system is a 20th century model that is becoming increasingly outdated.\nAdditional usage of clean renewables is good for our communities as well. Organizations like OREC have given Ontarians a vehicle to help build the power grid while providing a return on investment, which stimulates the local economy and creates value. Giving First Nations the opportunity to invest as well can have long-term benefits to communities and their economies as well.\nOntario's large population, manufacturing capacity and progressive outlook make it a natural choice to invest in green energy and to be a leader, much like it was in the automotive industry. I hope that we will be able to look on this period and say that we made the right decisions for the future, and not simply the most convenient ones for the present.\n[Original Comment ID: 205956]\n",

        "comment":"The Ministry of Energy uses only three criteria when determining where future and current generation facilities will be constructed according to a representative at the November 3rd public consultation session held in Peterborough. The three criteria are: distribution availability, resource availability and those willing to lease land. \u00a0According to the same representative, impacts to the environment as well as negative economic, social and cultural impacts on communities that multiple industrial energy generation projects inflict is not the responsibility of the Ministry of Energy.\nOver the past seven years, Ontario has signed numerous agreements with energy producers guaranteeing revenue even when energy production has to be curtailed due to environmental conditions or problems with the grid.\nThere is no land planning consideration or measure of what the cumulative impact will be from hundreds of generating stations plunked helter-skelter across rural Ontario. \u00a0It appears the LTEP has no plans to institute energy generation facilities within urban areas where arguably they should be constructed and where there is greatest public support.\nTo date there are hundreds of industrial facilities dotting the rural landscape across Ontario in various geographic zones and within various ecosystem regions. According to the IESO, as of June 30, 2016 there are 3588 generation contracts without any consideration of their overall impact on Ontario\u2019s landscape; 110 were for large scale wind energy facilities.\nAccording to one media report, \u00a0a developer stated that, \u201c more concrete was poured for the project than was used to build the CN Tower \u2013 36,472 cubic metres, and that \u00a0in addition 70 kms of gravel access roads were created and 35 km of new transmission lines. http:\/\/www.chathamthisweek.com\/2014\/06\/25\/south-kent-wind-project-officially-opens\nOne of the wind energy projects proposed under the now \u2018suspended\u2019 but not cancelled LRP2 program, if approved will cover 12,000 acres. http:\/\/www.wellingtonadvertiser.com\/comments\/index.cfm?articleID=32815\nThis proposed 63 turbine project covering 12,000 acres on hold until the LRP2 program is re-instituted will have installed capacity of 100 MW which will be produced intermittently. By contrast, the Darlington Nuclear Station which is the second largest energy generating station in the Province creates 3,480 megawatts of carbon-free electricity covering a fraction of land at 480 hectares or 1200 acres.\nOver the past 6 years, thousands of letters of objection were sent to various government ministries and both Premiers objecting to the plan to industrialize the Oak Ridges Moraine for 4 large scale wind energy facilities and 1 solar facility. Rural residents and environmental organizations such as STORM (Save the Oak Ridges Moraine) continuously sought to stop the cutting down of over 2500 mature trees along wildlife movement corridors and in designated significant woodlands. \u00a0 \u00a0First Nations peoples vigorously sought to protect their traditional hunting and gathering grounds granted under Treaty 20 knowing the plans of the industrial developers include decimating habitat for 12 species at risk, wiping out area raptors and endangering medicinal and food plants including species at risk butternut trees.\nThe MOECC recognized that the ministry received record numbers of comments of concern and objection posted on the EBR seeking denial of approval of these energy facilities on the Moraine. Additional concerns raised included the planned elimination of savannahs and open country bird habitat, redirecting and preventing and contaminating water flow to trout streams as well as threatening hydraulic connections to designated significant wetlands, the construction of many kilometers of new roads and 1000 ton permanent concrete bases and 30,000 pilings will have on sensitive surface and groundwater resources on the Moraine. \u00a0The Cham Shan Buddhists met with the former Minister of Energy Chiarelli \u00a0pleading for a halt to the 3 energy projects stating that construction of the industrial energy facilities through visual and noise pollution will prevent the build-out of their unique 100 million dollar project. \u00a0 Instead, like rural residents and First Nations, the Buddhists were dismissed in favour of providing tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to companies for an intermittent energy source even when not producing energy.\nhttp:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/thenational\/buddhist-temple-project-in-rural-ontario-threatened-by-wind-turb ines-1.3655375\nThe Ontario Energy Board does not have the ability to reject applications based on environmental concerns and the EBR appeal process is cumbersome with an unfair, often untenable burden placed on residents who are faced off against developers with deep financial pockets. Even still there have been dozens of appeals filed which should send a clear message to the Ministry to stop the industrialization of rural Ontario.\nThe MOECC \u00a0(verified by staff) does not look at the cumulative environmental impact of REA applications.\nSince O. Reg 359\/09 strips municipalities of the ability to determine the suitability or possible locations for industrial development and the ability to veto projects that are determined not to be in the best interest of the community, there needs to be master plan in place similar to the MAH\u2019s Places to Grow Act unfortunately also amended under O. Reg. 359\/09 as are 19 other Acts.\n\u2022Building Code Act, 1992;\n\u2022Conservation Land Act;\n\u2022Co-operative Corporations Act;\n\u2022Energy Conservation Leadership Act, 2006;\n\u2022Environmental Bill of Rights, 1993;\n\u2022Greenbelt Act, 2005;\n\u2022Ministry of Natural Resources Act;\n\u2022Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998;\n\u2022Places to Grow Act, 2005;\n\u2022Public Lands Act; and\u2022Clean Water Act, 2006;\n\u2022Conservation Authorities Act;\n\u2022Electricity Act, 1998\n\u2022Energy Efficiency Act;\n\u2022Environmental Protection Act;\n\u2022Ministry of Energy Act;\n\u2022Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development Act;\n\u2022Ontario Water Resources Act;\n\u2022Planning Act;\n\u2022Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act, 2006.\nI attended one of the LTEP \u2018public\u2019 sessions and when suggested the MoE might step back and take a look at the overall picture and the cumulative impact with an eye to sustainable development, I was told by a senior MoE rep that this suggestion would not be taken back to the Minister because this would mean an overhaul of the current procurement system. (so much for valuing public consultation).\nWhile the revised LRP program stipulates the applicant needs to demonstrate that Site Considerations Information is to be collected this is only done by conducting preliminary desktop studies to determine the presence of certain environmental features at the proposed project site. This is meaningless unless there is some veto power from the MOECC and MNRF. \u00a0Unfortunately neither the MOECC nor the MNRF has \u00a0complete or in-depth data on species at risk. Every developer will argue through their own consultants (on their payroll)there will be no environmental harm no matter where the project is sited even in the most environmentally sensitive lands like the Oak Ridges Moraine. \u00a0The MOECC\u2019s role is to expedite the application process (confirmed by staff).\nThe MoE in consultation with conservation authorities, municipalities, landowners, the MOECC and the MNRF needs to draw out a specific land use map that would organize energy development only into specific areas identified as having the least environmental and least cumulative impact such as brownfields or other such environmentally bankrupt lands.\nContinuing on the topic of environmental degradation in the name of energy security, the internet is filled with dozens of media reports of tree butchery and wide-scale poisoning of vegetation by Hydro One and Ontario Land Clearing across Southern Ontario. \u00a0Many of the media reports indicate perfectly healthy trees have been mangled and\/or cut down without providing any demonstrable measure of increased safety or prevention of power failures. This is a very costly exercise that infuriates the populace and degrades the environment.\nAll too often the larger picture is lost to tunnel vision focussed on immediate political gains with disastrous results.\nThe online survey is a terrible disappointment. \u00a0The questions are seemingly directed to \u2018blame the victim\u201d. \u00a0There has been extensive media coverage recently of the financial challenges and heartbreak energy users across the Province face despite doing everything possible to cut energy consumption. \u00a0People are going to extraordinary lengths to decrease energy consumption to no effect.\nThe online survey seemingly directs the current high cost and responsibility of conservation onto the shoulders of consumers instead of re-examining \u00a0flawed government policies pointed out by various energy experts over the years and which have continually been ignored.\nWhen energy consumption drops due to conservation, the Global Adjustment fee must be increased to make up the difference. So the less power Ontarians use, the higher their electricity costs must be in order to cover the minimum revenues energy producers are guaranteed.\nIn addition, consumers like myself are being penalized further being one of the over 50,000 households disconnected from smart meters because Hydro One has difficulty obtaining information. We are paying for these meters that do us no service. We are further penalized by now paying higher utility costs based on usage and a median rate per kilowatt. For those of us who routinely restricted electricity consumption over 80 % of the time to off-peak hours under TOU, we now pay higher bills \u2013 why are we being financially penalized for faulty equipment? We are also penalized for living in rural Ontario by paying exorbitant delivery charges.\nhttp:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/2808094\/sky-high-hydro-rates-an-absolute-crisis-for-rural-ontario\/\nOntario government's polling found 94% of residents wanted relief from hydro bills http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/ontario-hydro-polling-1.3848893\nThe temporary offer of an 8% reduction will not fix the long-term problem and ratepayers will have to pay for this reduction in some form. \u00a0It appears that the Province is failing to listen to energy experts and the Auditor General and solutions proposed by these external reviewers. Why?\nSo\u2026 what do residents such as I want included in a long-term energy plan?\nRecommendations:\n1.Provide affordable energy without continual periodic nickel and dime increases that accumulate to much more than the government touted \u2018no more than a cup of coffee\u2019 increase especially in rural areas. Delivery charges need to be re-examined and made more equitable.\n2. Terminate temporary band-aid reactionary solutions after continual increases exasperate consumers to the point of public outrage; opt instead for a long-term sustainable plan based on the input and modelling from recognized energy experts. Listen to expert opinion \u2013 listen to the Auditor General.\n2. Those disconnected from the smart meter program will be compensated.\n3.The MoE \u00a0will step back and engage in a sustainable land-planning strategy and mapping for future energy facilities before any new LRP applications are accepted; \u00a0a strategy that considers the cumulative environmental, social, cultural and economic impact on communities first.\n4. An end to the needless tree mangling, cutting and poisoning of ground vegetation under the line clearing plan \u2013 this very expensive practice has not proven to be effective and is the constant cause of frustration and anger on the part of residents \u2013 a different forward thinking holistic strategy needs to be adopted.\n5. Concentrate industrial renewable energy projects such as wind and solar in urban and industrialized areas along the Lake Ontario shoreline where both wind and solar resources are optimum and there is public support.\n6. Respect First Nations. The LRP application format opens the door to manipulation by developers for projects that are of no actual direct benefit to First Nations communities. First Nations should dictate what is needed to sustainably service their community and then there should be a bidding process and plan to make that happen.\n7. Keep utilities in private hands. \u00a0Stop the privatization of small utilities as well as selling the remainder of Hydro One\u2026 listen to the majority of Ontarians. https:\/\/keephydropublic.ca\/\n[Original Comment ID: 196716]\n",

Please provide us with renewables so we can get healthy and save our planet.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206845]\n",

        "comment":"Dear Premiere, Minister and Commissioners,\n\nOntario is at a crossroads for decision making on nuclear energy that will affect generations. I urge you to not only stop any further proliferation of our reliance on nuclear energy, but to also plan a gradual phase out of existing plants.\n\nThough nuclear is touted to be less harmful on the environment regarding carbon emissions, it is an extremely dangerous form of energy. As you know, the management, disposal and long term life of spent rods, and the possible water contamination issues and storage for hundreds of years to come, are some of the most pressing issues for this form of energy. It would be most egregious and irresponsible to sadde future generations with this responsibility. Inevitably there will be failure, whether it is with water spills, containment, or long term storage.\u00a0 We cannot accept even the small percentage of contamination that does occur, or the long term radioactive garbage that this system produces.\n\nAs well, the vulnerability of these plants to natural or man made disasters, and most especially when these are close to densely populated urban areas, is incredibly short sighted.\u00a0 All decisions must be made with the utmost safety in mind for generations into the future when none of us will be on this earth.\n\nRenewable and sustainable energy is the most intelligent, responsible, innovative, and affordable energy alternative. For the long term.\u00a0 It's far sighted and requires leadership.\n\nPlease make the right choices for future generations, for other sentient beings and for the planet. b.h. Yael\n\nToronto\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206847]\n",

As a former auditor of renewable energy domestic content, I saw how many jobs were created and sustained by renewable energy. Family farms remained viable because of lease payments from generation facilities. This option is now gone, all due to lack of will from Government.\n\nOntario needs to look properly at conservation. Very few of the scenarios in the the LTEP considered conservation properly, and only one considered an overall reduction in demand as a long term strategy. As the province's demand becomes less baseload and more peaks, large investment in maintaining non-manoeuvrable nuclear facilities makes little sense. Ontario's nuclear plants are already causing issues during low demand, and this situation cannot be blamed on renewables. Our current path is not sustainable.\n\nWhile I am a Professional Engineer, I am not a member of the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (OSPE). I disagree strongly with their stance on energy policy, which is more aligned towards keeping their members in jobs at OPG than what's good for the province. I'm sure OSPE have produced a fulsome response to this consultation, and if it's similar to their previous work, it will likely be based on cherry-picking data, conveniently forgetting externalities, and assigning all exports to renewables.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206849]\n",

        "comment":"Dear Sirs and Madams,\nWe need more renewable energy in Ontario's electricity mix.\nThe current plan of nuclear refurbishments doesn't adequately address several key issues, cost being the main driver. The full costs of the nuclear plants have never been transparent. One easy example is the matter of insurance. The cost of the Fukoshima disaster was over 50 B CAD (http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2016\/08\/28\/national\/public-cost-fukushima-nuclear-accident-cleanu p-topped-%C2%A54-2-trillion-end-march\/#.WDSaELIrLIU) and the liability carried by the plants would nowhere near cover these types of costs.\nFurther, transmission projects such as the $700M Bruce to Milton transmission reinforcement project (http:\/\/www.hydroone.com\/REGULATORYAFFAIRS\/Pages\/BrucetoMilton.aspx) which is dedicated to the nuclear industry is a cost borne by ratepayers, rather than the nuclear industry.\nThese two areas seem to contravene section 25.33 of the Ontario Electricity Act (which I will refer to as \"the Act\" which prescribes that electricity prices should reflect costs.\nFurther, the projected cost of nuclear power is between $72\/MWh and $81\/MWh (https:\/\/news.ontario.ca\/mei\/en\/2016\/01\/ontario-moving-forward-with-nuclear-refurbishment-at-darlin gton-and-pursuing-continued-operations-at.html) which is significantly higher than the current price of wind power, which came in at $63\/MWh in Quebec and $65\/MWh in Ontario. Nuclear plants have a poor track record of coming in on time or on budget. With an IPP model (such as that in the LRP) this risk is shifted to the developer. Were you to tweak contracts slightly (for example, extend them to 25 years, allow the developers to own the environmental attributes, or change the escalation rules) you would easily be able to set a ceiling price of $70\/MWh and get wind power which is easily deployed and quick to build.\nOur aging nuclear fleet is located on the biggest source of fresh water in the world. These reactors have run their course. We should not extend their operating licences at a huge cost and a massive liability.\nI understand the need for new or upgraded transmission capacity in certain areas, however it seems that S.26 (1.1) isn't being honoured due to large interconnection costs being applied.\nThere are instances where Hydro One has refused access to feeder lines for even small 10kW solar projects as it claims there is no capacity. This is based on poor science- the arbitrary 15% rule for renewable penetration has been shown to be incorrect in jurisdictions around the world. Denmark, Scotland and Hawaii are three of such examples.\nThis means that transmission reinforcement isn't even required in many instances- rather we simply need to grant equal and fact-based access to the electrical system.\nTransmission poses a big opportunity for the IESO to monetize their grid in an efficient way. Were we to build transmission into the New England states we could offer \"firm wind\" at a premium to those IESOs. The cost of the transmission would be outweighed by the ability to ship clean power at a profit. Further, the offshore wind projects proposed in Lake Ontario would have inherent transmission benefits- it would ease congestion in Toronto and would provide most of the transmission link required at low or no cost.\nA similar case could be made for working closer with Qu\u00e9bec. Qu\u00e9bec has a winter-peaking system. whereas Ontario has a summer-peaking system. From an energy storage standpoint, an easy fix is to work with Qu\u00e9bec to allow the water to build behind their dams during windy or sunny periods and then to run that water through the dams at low wind or low sun times.\nStorage and renewables can provide a way to reinforce the transmission system and ease congestion. Having clearer transmission maps would allow developers to help by putting generation and storage close to load centers rather than having centralized generation.\nNet metering poses a unique opportunity as well as challenges for grid operators. I would challenge the fact that net metered facilities, for example by a solar array revert away from time of use pricing to flat rate pricing. This seems contradictory to the Objectives of the Smart Metering Entity as outlined in S.53.8 (4) of the Act.\nElectric vehicles provide an excellent opportunity for the current grid. With the smart metering system, strong market signals that lined up with time of use pricing (for example, dropping the price from 11pm-5am) would create an incentive for EV users to charge at those times. I drive an EV, and my charger and car both have the functionality to set when my car charges. I use this already, but would be happy to push this out further to line up with the grid requirements. Incentives such as pricing pressure would help shift the load to off-peak times.\nMoving away from natural gas in our homes provides a big opportunity as well. Rather than approving expensive gas line extensions, we should work to provide smarter homes using clean electricity. A water heater can heat up at night, for example. Similar to the car scenario outlined above, you can shift load efficiently in these cases.\nWe need more renewable energy, upgraded transmission, and to work with neighbouring jurisdictions. We can lower the price of power by investing in renewable energy and by embracing the load shifting opportunities available to Ontario. Now is the time to remain a leader in the energy sector in North America. Together we can have the cleanest, safest and most cost effective system possible.\nThank you for your time, and I would welcome the opportunity to engage further. Though I attended the LTEP engagement meeting in Guelph last night, I think there is a lot to be gained through actual consultations that engage citizens.\nThank you very much.\n-David Estill\n[Original Comment ID: 196755]\n",

Additionally, our Local Union was able to start over 100 apprentices, of which we are proud to declare that 98% of them have become certified journeypersons who are registered with the Ontario College of Trades. \u00a0These employment opportunities in the nuclear power sector have provided good paying jobs for our members as well as creating many employment opportunities in the sector supply chain within our jurisdiction such as at BWXT, formerly Babcock and Wilcox, located in Cambridge. The significance of the Bruce Power site to our Local Union members is well documented and we appreciate the opportunity that you have given us to share our views with you on Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan and how our members will be affected both as employees in the electrical industry but also as permanent residents and tax payers in Ontario.\nLet me say from the start that our organization, our affiliated union locals and our members support the objectives of Ontario\u2019s green energy plan. \u00a0We applaud the provincial government for leading the way in North America by shutting down all of Ontario\u2019s coal-burning generators. \u00a0We also applaud the provincial government for showing the courage and foresight to introduce a cap-and-trade system in Ontario. \u00a0Of course, there will be problems along the way but the path that the government has chosen, is the correct path. \u00a0We must reduce green-house gases. \u00a0To do that, we must reduce our reliance on high carbon emitting fossil fuels.\nIn my remarks to you today, I want to focus on three issues or themes. \u00a0The first of these is what we see as a tension between the important commitment to reduce the role of fossil fuels in meeting the province\u2019s overall energy requirements, and the need for a much clearer vision of the alternative strategy to meet those energy requirements. \u00a0Ontario\u2019s Five-Year Climate Change Action Plan envisions an Ontario which will substantially reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet the province\u2019s energy needs. \u00a0The Action Plan also envisions a concurrent increase in the use of electricity to meet those energy needs. \u00a0The Action Plan is clear in its intention to bring about a greater role for electricity in heating buildings, both residential and non-residential, and in meeting the energy needs of our transportation sector. \u00a0The shift to greater reliance on electricity inevitably raises the question: how will that electricity be generated. \u00a0While we strongly support increased generation from renewable resources, we do not believe that renewable sources can be expanded sufficiently to meet the increased role that electricity will play in a low carbon future.\nWe need; therefore, a much clearer picture of what Ontario\u2019s strategy will be to bring increased generation capacity on line and to deliver that energy efficiently and reliably.\nThat takes me to the second point that I would like to make;\nNuclear power today accounts for almost two thirds of the province\u2019s power; emissions-free, at approximately half the average unit cost of overall electricity service. \u00a0In a time when the Government of Ontario is coming under immense pressure regarding the high cost of electricity, it is difficult to see a future in which the role of electricity will increase without upgrading and expanding Ontario\u2019s nuclear generating capacity. \u00a0The nuclear power sector gives Ontario the best opportunity to stabilize and lower the cost of electricity to the rate payer and draw support for the Action Plan.\nThe government has indicated a timetable for refurbishing our existing nuclear reactors and there are two reasons to bring the refurbishing timetable forward. \u00a0The first is interest rates. Long-term interest rates are currently at historic lows. \u00a0No one expects these conditions to continue indefinitely. \u00a0The interest rate is a major factor in the financing costs for refurbishment. \u00a0In our view the government should take advantage of the low interest rates that currently prevail to bring forward the refurbishment timetable. \u00a0The apparent savings from delaying the refurbishment will be more than offset by the higher financing costs that will prevail in future years.\nThe second reason to consider bringing the refurbishment timetable forward is the availability of labour and contracting capacity. \u00a0The downturn in the Alberta energy sector means that there is capacity available. \u00a0Ontario will not be competing with Alberta\u2019s energy sector for materials and manpower which was, until recently, the single most important factor shaping construction costs in Canada. \u00a0However, the downturn in Alberta is cyclical. \u00a0Oil prices have been edging up. \u00a0When producers can be confident that prices will stay above $60 per barrel, the construction cycle in Alberta\u2019s energy sector will resume.\nBy bringing the refurbishment timetable forward, Ontario can avoid some of the costs that will inevitably arise when large-scale projects in Ontario must compete with large-scale projects in Alberta for skilled labour and skilled contractors. \u00a0By taking advantage of current economic and financial conditions, the government will achieve important, long-term cost savings. \u00a0The government will also ensure that we have the low carbon generating capacity that Ontario needs to meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets.\nIn our view, Ontario cannot achieve its objective of increasing the role of electricity in our energy supply without ensuring the continued reliability and efficiency of our nuclear power sector. \u00a0 \u00a0 We strongly believe that the government should give serious consideration to bringing forward the timetable to refurbish our nuclear capacity.\nThe third topic that I want to raise with you is conservation and, more particularly, the need to remove obstacles to investments in conservation. \u00a0The typical commercial tenancy agreement and a great many residential tenancy agreements pass the cost of utilities on to the tenant. \u00a0Aside from changing the lighting and time of use, there is often very little that a tenant can do to conserve on the use of energy. \u00a0 A tenant cannot invest in insulation, nor can a tenant invest in more energy efficient mechanical systems. \u00a0In many residential tenancies, the appliances are owned by the landlord. \u00a0The majority of tenants, whether they are commercial tenants or residential tenants, bear the burden of inefficient buildings and appliances. \u00a0In the residential sector, the majority of tenants are in the lower income groups. \u00a0It is unfair to tenants to raise the cost of energy when they have no realistic way of dealing with energy inefficient buildings, energy inefficient mechanical systems and energy inefficient appliances. \u00a0That may involve incentives or penalties that are delivered through the tax system. \u00a0It could involve direct grants or property tax surcharges. Or perhaps, there should be a requirement that landlords pay a portion of the utility costs in the buildings that they own. \u00a0We acknowledge that the government has put in place some incentives. \u00a0These incentives do not appear to be in corresponding size with the scale of the upgrade investments that will be required in the rented building stock.\nIf Ontario is to achieve its goal of making buildings more energy efficient, we have to find a way to incentivize landlords to make the investments that are needed in energy efficient structures, energy efficient mechanical systems, and energy efficient appliances and lighting systems.\nI want to conclude my remarks by reiterating the points with which I began. \u00a0 \u00a0The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \u2013 Central Ontario Local 804 supports the objectives of Ontario\u2019s green energy plan. \u00a0We support the decision to shut down all coal-burning generators. \u00a0We support the decision to introduce the cap-and-trade system in Ontario. \u00a0What we hope emerges from these consultations is a clear message to the government that we need a much clearer picture of what Ontario\u2019s strategy will be to bring increased generation capacity on line and to deliver that electricity efficiently, economically and reliably. \u00a0We believe the government needs to develop a system that compels landlords to install energy efficient structures, mechanical systems, appliances and lighting systems. We do not see how the role of electricity can be increased in Ontario\u2019s overall energy usage without at the same time increasing capacity from our nuclear generating plants, such as Bruce Power. \u00a0We believe that the government must seriously consider bringing forward the refurbishment timetable to achieve the Five-Year Climate Change Action Plan. Thank you again for affording us the opportunity to share our views.\nRespectfully submitted,\n[Original Comment ID: 196983]\n",

        "comment":"I find the planning assumptions that of course residential heat is going to move from oil to electricity quite puzzling. Most folks move from oil to gas (or propane) where available. If they have electric heat, replacing it with gas of some sort is the general direction due to the crushing power costs associated with it -- and demand pricing that places the highest costs when people are likely needing power the most. In rural areas the visible movement is from electric baseboards to wood. Granted that burning wood is at least vaguely green, it does release particulates that the baghouse of a conventional powerplant would not. At least wood can provide heat when the grid goes down.\nAlso, there has been a lot of discussion about forcing people into electric cars to replace fossil fuels -- did not find any inclusion of that potential demand in the planning model. Or any estimate of the impact of carbon taxes, which would cover a large portion of the planning horizon -- I would be surprised if that were economic impact neutral.\n[Original Comment ID: 197339]\n",

        "comment":"I work for Ontario Power Generation however these comments are my own opinions and not those of Ontario Power Generation.\nThank you for the opportunity to submit to the LTEP process. \u00a0Here are a couple of points that I believe should be considered when developing and implementing the plan.\nThe Darlington Refurbishment is critical and should proceed as scheduled. \u00a0It will add $89 billion to Ontario's economy over the next 30 years and provides cost effective reliable power.\nExtending Pickering into 2022\/2024 will provide a backstop for refurbishments at both Darlington and Bruce.\nFighting climate change is important, and government has a leadership role - however the current electricity energy mix is now about 90 per cent free of GHG. \u00a0The plan should look at ways of reducing GHG in other sections - heating, industry, and transportation. \u00a0Take a holistic approach across all sectors to ensure the reductions are achieved in the most cost effective manner. \u00a0If spending $1 billion in industry achieves twice the reduction in CO2 or methane that spending $1 billion in electricity infrastructure would achieve - spend the dollars in industry.\nElectrification may be the way of the future. \u00a0That means that Ontario should not lose sight of long term clean sources of electricity, including hydro in the far north (Albany River, Moose River Basin) and new nuclear at Darlington. \u00a0Both would provide considerable economic benefit to Ontario during construction and operation.\nExisting GHG-free generating sources (especially hydro) should be maximized, refurbished, and considered before any new generation. \u00a0Existing proven storage, like pumped storage at Niagara, should be maximized for the benefit of consumers. \u00a0Having generation that can deliver at times of day when most needed is critical. \u00a0We should be investing in electricity that is dispatchable not in forms of electricity that require enormous investments in unproven electricity storage.\nElectricity produced here in Ontario benefits Ontario through wages paid to Ontarians, spin off spending by generators and their staff, goods and services purchased in Ontario, and taxes paid to Ontario and Canada. \u00a0When electricity is imported from Quebec, dollars go out of Province. \u00a0A holistic approach should be taken when comparing a $ spent for MWh from Quebec vs $ spent for a MWh from an Ontario generator.\nConsideration should be given to moving some of the costs for electricity and gas infrastructure into the tax base - so that tax payers pay their share of the benefits clean reliable electricity brings. \u00a0For example, savings in the Health Care sector from closing coal are paid for by the rate payer although the benefit is to taxpayers. \u00a0The downtown Toronto Financial Industry and retail businesses derive enormous benefits from having a reliable electricity supply. \u00a0(imagine brownouts on Black Friday or Boxing Day and the impact on sales) - far greater than what they pay for the electricity they consume. \u00a0Transmission infrastructure, pipeline infrastructure is similar to roads - they benefit everyone. \u00a0In my home I have several taxpayers living with me, but I'm the sole ratepayer. \u00a0Moving some costs to the tax-base would help reduce the price paid for electricity and better reflect the societal benefits of clean electricity.\nThanks for the opportunity to submit my views.\n[Original Comment ID: 197419]\n",

        "comment":"Planning Ontario's Energy Future should include close examination and protection of all international migratory flyways.\nFor example, I have looked at the REA for the Windlectric Project, (unfortunately this directly impacts my family as 6, 51-storey industrial wind turbines are proposed within 1 1\/2 km of our house - the closest being 800 meters from the middle of our home! - but that is another issue) and can see that there is no reference to impact on the North American international migratory flyway, where Amherst Island plays a major role, along with other sites in this region - and cumulative impacts in particular.\nAs industrial wind turbine sites along the shorelines of Lake Ontario get filled with industrial wind turbines or \u201cbird blenders\u201d as a local Green Party representative referred to them as, there is greater and greater long term devastation to the migrating species who use these corridors - be they bats, birds, butterflies or dragonflies (yes dragonflies migrate as well - see: http:\/\/news.nationalgeographic.com\/news\/2006\/05\/dragonfly-1_2.html ).\nYou will note that the migratory species are all mosquito predators and do a great deal to keep mosquito and other insect populations under control. \u00a0As you certainly are aware, mosquitoes carry diseases that threaten human health.\nIf the Ontario government allows wind turbines in migratory flyways, it follows that there will be an increase in mosquito population. \u00a0How will the Ontario government deal with the logical outcome of increased mosquito population and its threat to human health? \u00a0DDT?\nMy greatest concern is that the Ontario government does not seem to be looking at the impacts of your decisions - especially the cumulative impacts - especially on the migratory flyways.\nThe Ontario government has a responsibility to examine the \u201cbig picture\u201d and to protect all from increasing our mosquito population.\nThere is no reason why a group of responsible citizens (in this case the Association to Protect Amherst Island) are forced to carry the financial burden and associated stress in order to take our own government to court along with Algonquin Power to prevent such a project from moving forward, when it is the Ontario government\u2019s responsibility to protect its citizens.\nI must say what has been so shocking to see a table on one side of the \u201cERT court\u201d shared by both the proponent AND our own government, where they actively converse and share observations and the other side of the \u201ccourt\u201d is a table with the one lawyer our small group of citizens can afford. It truly is a David vs Goliath fight and reflects very poorly on the government - making people feel like we are experiencing a 3rd world country mock trial - where people clearly have no voice or government support. \u00a0Government representatives have no problem speaking to the corporations but won\u2019t discuss issues with the people.\nThere is enough power being generated in Ontario to meet the demand for many years to come.\nPlease stop this \u201cWind Rush\u201d so that we may examine the impacts of what has already been done and make smarter choices for future development.\nWho in the Ontario government is looking at protecting migratory flyways and what input do they have in your approval process?\nDo they consult with their US counterparts and national Canadian colleagues?\nPlease inform the public about what is being done to protect these vital transportation networks.\nThank you for any information you can provide - even if the Windlectric Project is under appeal - surely there is public information that you are able to provide.\nI await your response.\nIBAs (Important Bird Areas) recognized as environmentally sensitive and significant by international organizations should not be locations for industrial wind turbines!\nAgain, to quote former Premier Dalton McGuinty, \u201cThere is no wrong time to make the right decision.\u201d\nPlease stop the proposed Amherst Island industrialization now and protect the international migratory flyways in Ontario.\nRespectfully submitted\n[Original Comment ID: 197464]\n",

Any energy project MUST have the support of the community being asked to host it.\u00a0 Support by any other groups, including First Nations, should not supersede the wishes of the local community and should not be used in the ranking of proposed projects.\n\n2. Community support should consist of ALL adjacent landowners to project infrastructure, 75% of all residents with the project area, and 50% of all residents within 2 km of the project boundaries.\n\n3. If the government wishes to encourage participation by First Nations groups, it could grant tax incentives,\u00a0 providing funding options, etc., to these groups.\n\n4. Revise the community engagement process to prohibit any \u201ccash for support\u201d schemes.\u00a0 This often places the elected community representatives in a conflict of interest and at odds with a majority of the residents.\u00a0 It is insulting for elected community representatives to hear energy project proponents state they will receive funds if they support their project, but if the project is approved without their statement of support, they will get nothing.\u00a0 At least one rural mayor has called this practice \u201cextortion\u201d.\n\nEVALUATING AND RANKING ENERGY PROJECTS\n\nEnergy Minister Thibeault recently commented during a speech given at the Empire Club that future energy contracts would not have quotas based on the type of technology and would be awarded based on cost.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nThis should not be limited to the commodity price quoted by the proponents, but must include ALL costs, both direct and indirect.\u00a0 The indirect costs include:\n\n1. the ability, or inability to deliver electricity during peak hours.\n\n2. ALL costs of curtailment that the project in question will generate\n\n3. Loses incurred from the export of surplus electricity.\n\n4. Costs incurred for any required backup generation.\n\n5. Costs incurred for any additional transmission line construction or expansion.\n\nABILITY TO DELIVER ON-PEAK VS OFF-PEAK\n\nCommentary:\n\nHydro and nuclear are able to deliver 80 to 90 % of their nameplate capacity and are not weather dependant as wind and solar.\n\nWind projects typically are able to deliver about 30% to 40% of their nameplate capacity due to the availability of suitable wind conditions.\n\nIn addition to the nameplate capacity, wind energy is often out-of-phase with demand; wrong time of day, wrong time of year.\u00a0 In their 18 month forecast published in October 2015, the IESO has estimated that the installed wind generation capacity will produce about 12.6% of nameplate capacity during the peak summer months June \u2013 September.\n\nThus a 100 MW wind project would deliver 30 MW per hour when averaged over a year, but only 12.6 MW per hour during peak summer hours.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. For the purpose of evaluating and ranking the desirability of any new contracts,\u00a0 the amount of electricity able to be delivered during peak demand AND the amount of electricity that can only be delivered during off-peak demand should be taken into account, with preference to projects with higher peak demand capability.\n\n2. Only non-intermittent sources should be considered for base load requirements.\n\n3. Any new projects producing electricity during times of surplus base load should be curtailed without compensation for the \u201cpotential\u201d electricity to the project owners.\n\n4. The output of existing projects that have contracts requiring the IESO to accept their output during times when all requirements, including those of the North America Electric Reliability Corporation and the Northeast Power Coordinating Council Inc. can met with base load generating capacity from nuclear and hydro, should be taxed to cover the difference between the price paid to the generator and the price the surplus electricity is sold for. These costs should not be included in the Global Adjustment for the ratepayers, nor should they be a burden on the taxpayers through tax rebate programs.\n\nCONSIDERATION FOR THE OTHER COSTS OF CURTAILMENT:\n\nCommentary:\n\nSince September 2013, the IESO has been able to curtail some wind after reaching an agreement with the wind developers that requires those developers to be compensated for the majority of the curtailment.\u00a0 This cost is currently included in the Global Adjustment.\n\nWhen wind is accepted into the grid during off-peak hours, the IESO has curtailed nuclear and hydro to give wind its preferential access.\u00a0 This results in additional costs from nuclear and hydro that are included in the Global Adjustment.\n\nDue to the intermittent nature of wind energy, the IESO requires standing reserves of gas generating capacity.\u00a0 These generators are compensated for their standby hours.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nFor the purpose of evaluating the true cost for wind or solar, all these indirect costs must be included in the cost evaluation:\n\n1. The cost paid to wind or solar generators when their output is curtailed to balance the grid.\n\n2. The curtailment costs to nuclear and hydro when those sources are curtailed to accommodate wind or solar.\n\nCONSIDERATION FOR COSTS INCURRED WHEN STANDBY GENERATION IS REQUIRED\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. For the purpose of evaluating new project proposals, the additional costs paid to gas generators on standby for wind or solar should be included in their proposed price.\u00a0 The IESO has sufficient historical data to determine the amount of backup generation is required.\n\n2. If a new energy project requires additional new backup generating capacity, those capital costs should be included into their proposed pricing unless the proponent pays for the full cost.\n\n3. If a new energy project requires additional transmission capacity, those capital costs should be included into their proposed pricing unless the proponent pays for the full cost of the additional transmission capacity.\n\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. Environmental considerations must be evaluated based on the full life cycle for projects under consideration.\n\n2. Environmental considerations must include the carbon footprint of manufacturing the components, including offshore, used in the equipment, as well as any costs for the decommissioning and disposal of components, such as wind turbine blades and solar panels, at the end of their life cycle.\n\n3. For wind turbines that are direct drive requiring the use of rare earth magnets, the extensive damage to air and groundwater quality from the extraction and processing due to a lack of adequate environmental controls in China should also be an environmental consideration.\n\n4. For proposed projects, the carbon footprint of the backup gas generators, if required, should be included as part of their carbon footprint.\u00a0 The Ontario Society of Professional Engineers has produced yearly assessments for the amount of carbon emissions produced by the renewable\/gas hybrid generation.\n\n5. The IESO should establish a hierarchy of generator sources with nuclear and hydro running at their full available capacity without any curtailment. This should be followed by any available renewables, followed last by natural gas generation.\n\n6. The new tunnel at Niagara, built at a cost of $1.5 Billion, should actually be used to increase the hydro generation.\n\n7. For new energy projects, priority should be given to hydro and nuclear sources; both are non-intermittent, and do not require back up gas generation.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206866]\n",

Hate heat that a heats up the cooling water supply is another.\n\nOn the economy side there is the problem that nuclear power has always cost much more than originally estimated. We have seen the consequences of that in the high price that Ontarians have paid over the years in surcharges.\n\nThere is also the problem that uranium is a non-renewable resource. In the long run that will become a real problem that is apparently ignored.

Glenn Thibeault\n\nMinister of Energy\n\n4th Floor, Hearst Block\n\n900 Bay Street\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nM7A 2E1\n\nDear Minister Thibeault,\n\nPlease find enclosed Bruce Power\u2019s formal submission to the 2016 Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP) review process. In this submission, we outline our commitment to being a low-cost provider of electricity to Ontario families and business for many years to come, while keeping the air we breathe clean and the economy strong.\n\nBruce Power recognizes the importance of the LTEP in Ontario and supports the review of the policy on a regular basis to engage the public, energy sector and other stakeholders in an open and transparent way.\n\nWe are proud to be a part of Ontario\u2019s energy solution \u2013 both today and over the long term. Based in rural Ontario, we have a significant economic presence in Bruce, Huron and Grey counties and continue to drive significant economic activity throughout the province. In addition, with families working harder than ever to balance their household expenses and businesses striving to remain competitive and strong, the clean, low-cost, stable electricity we provide positively supports Ontarians every day.\n\nWe are proud to generate 30 per cent of Ontario\u2019s electricity at 30 per cent less than the average residential price of power, and look forward to being a low-cost generator for many years to come. To date in 2016, Bruce Power has produced power at 6.6 cents per kw\/h, while the average residential price is approximately 11 cents per kw\/h. While there are many components that make up an electricity bill, including distribution and transmission charges, if Ontarians received 100 per cent of their electricity from Bruce Power, the cost of their energy consumption would be about 30 per cent less.\n\nTo help Ontario secure low-cost electricity over the long term, we are carrying out life-extension work on all of our units. This $13 billion program, which commenced in January 2016, is on time and on budget, and through our agreement with the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), we will remain accountable to meet the investment requirements of these projects and assume all risk of cost overruns.\n\nWe are aware of the importance your government places on meeting Ontario\u2019s and, by extension, Canada\u2019s climate change targets, and understand the role nuclear plays in achieving these goals. Combined, Bruce Power, Darlington and Pickering will generate approximately 50 to 55 per cent of Ontario\u2019s electricity from 2017-24 and 40 to 45 per cent from 2024 to beyond 2050, while generating zero carbon emissions. This makes nuclear critical to these long-term climate change goals.\n\nWithout this high volume of clean, reliable generation, these targets cannot be achieved in an affordable way. In fact, between 2017 and 2064, clean nuclear from these facilities, when compared to alternatives, will avoid between $18 billion and $95 billion in carbon costs that ratepayers would have to fund if this output was replaced by fossil fuels.\n\nThroughout our LTEP submission, we have outlined the positive role Bruce Power plays broadly in the province from both economic and social perspectives. These contributions are only possible thanks to the fact Ontario has a stable policy environment, with a long-term outlook that allows Bruce Power, as a private entity, to invest in, and take a broader view of, Ontario\u2019s future.\n\nIn closing, there is one final item outside of our submission that is important to raise and it is related to the overall role of nuclear power in Ontario. As you know, Bruce Power and Ontario Power Generation (OPG) are working in collaboration to build a stronger nuclear industry in the province for decades to come through life-extension programs and long-term operations.\n\nI want to commend your government for committing to the Darlington refurbishment project back in January of this year, as well as the life extension of Pickering to 2024. These are decisions that are important to the LTEP. It is only with all of us working together that we can offer Ontario families and businesses low-cost electricity, system reliability, clean air and a strong economy.\n\nAs always, I would be pleased to meet with you any time to discuss these matters further. Thank you and the Government for the opportunity to participate in this LTEP process.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMichael W. Rencheck\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nBruce Power\n\nCopy: Hon. Kathleen Wynne, Premier of Ontario\n\nMembers of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario\n\nSerge Imbrogno, Deputy Minister of Energy\n\nBruce Campbell, President & CEO, IESO\n\nAndrea Pastori, Ministry of Energy\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206870]\n",

        "comment":"1.True Energy Plan - We are pleased to note that unlike the 2013 LTEP which was almost entirely focused on electricity, this is a more balanced energy plan with more focus on fuels as well as electricity.\n\n2.Conservation First - We are shocked to see that in the Discussion Guide, the section on conservation is in the middle of the last section.\u00a0 In the 2013 LTEP, the section on Conservation was the second chapter and was titled \u201cPutting Conservation First\u201d.\u00a0 We strongly recommend that the LTEP reaffirm the government\u2019s commitment to Conservation First, not 6th!\n\n3.Importance of Existing Buildings \u2013 While it is important to ensure that any new buildings are built to meet ever improving minimum energy efficiency standards, it is critical that there be even more focus on existing building.\u00a0 As new buildings typically contribute 1-1.5% to the building stock every year, more than 75% of the building stock in 2030 will have been built before 2015.\n\n4.Separate Section on Institutional Buildings \u2013 The buildings that the Ontario government owns\/leases as well as those of the Broader Public Sector (BPS - Municipalities, Schools, Universities\/Hospitals and Hospitals) produced 4.2 MT of GHGs or about 3% of Ontario\u2019s total (see p. 5 of attached \u201cWhite Paper\u201d).\u00a0 While this is significant on its own, even more important is the example that these buildings can and must set.\u00a0 The Ontario government must be a leader in reducing its own emissions.\u00a0 Progress has been made but much more remains to be done.\u00a0 We therefore strongly recommend that there be a separate section in the LTEP on the governments past actions, current targets and future plans.\n\n5.Important Role of Guaranteed Energy Service Performance Contracts in Institutional Buildings\u00a0 We were pleased that the government\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan recognized the important role that these contracts play by recommending that \u201cthe government will enable the use of energy performance contracts in the Ontario Public Service\u201d.\u00a0 We strongly recommend that the government also ensure that these contracts are used by the BPS to dramatically increase the energy efficiency of these existing buildings.\u00a0 As noted in the attached \u201cWhite Paper\u201d, experience over the last 30 years has shown that these contracts result in more comprehensive and deeper energy efficiency upgrades, are turnkey, avoid need for multiple contracts\/ responsibilities, can reduce pressure on capital, the energy savings are guaranteed and are not more expensive than traditional approaches.\n\n6.Infrastructure Renewal Funded Through Energy Savings - ESPCs have also been proven to be an effective way to finance infrastructure renewal priorities.\u00a0 This is done by extending the typical term of these contracts so that the energy savings achieved in the additional years added to the contract are used to finance non-energy infrastructure renewal investments.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206873]\n",

        "comment":"The Sarnia Lambton Chamber of Commerce appreciates this opportunity to comment on the 2017 Long Term Energy Plan, because we feel that our community will play a central role in Ontario\u2019s energy future.\n\nAs an energy centre for more than 100 years, Sarnia-Lambton has been a leader in energy exploration, processing, conversion, handling, storage and management. We have extensive energy related infrastructure, industrial facilities, Lambton College, Western University Research Park all complemented by a wealth of experience and knowledge. Our underground storage facilities are among the largest in North America, ensuring reliability of Ontario\u2019s energy supply. Sarnia-Lambton also offers abundant sources of electricity generation, including high efficiency gas, solar, wind and energy-from-waste. We are in an ideal position to manufacture solar panels, micro-grid testing, energy storage, bio-fuels research and development and bio-gas production and injection into natural gas. This is why companies like Ubiquity Solar and Comet Biorefining are investing in our community. It is why Bioindustrial Innovation Canada, a world-class incubator for bio-based start-ups, is based in Sarnia.\n\nIn addition to our energy expertise and facilities, we would also be a willing host of electric vehicle charging stations and a test site for electric public transit. Our members are hopeful that the Minister will recognize and utilize the opportunities and strengths that Sarnia-Lambton has to offer Ontario and Canada in the 2017 LTEP.\n\nOver the past few years Ontario has successfully invested to improve electricity system reliability, system capacity, power quality, and reduce GHG emissions.\u00a0 These improvements are pre-requisites for a sustainable, prosperous and wealth generating energy future.\u00a0 However, our members are concerned about the present state of electricity pricing.\n\nThe cost of electricity is the number one concern we hear about time and time again and changes in the energy sector are happening faster than many businesses are able to adapt. They are struggling to keep up. They see little incentive to invest further in energy conservation when there is no apparent cost savings on their utility bills. Moreover, the common perception is that Ontario\u2019s electricity costs are the highest in North America, yet, there are independent studies that say otherwise. No matter what studies show, however, the lack of transparency within the sector, the monthly variability of the Global Adjustment and the rising costs despite conservation efforts will deter economic development due to the belief that Ontario is not an affordable place to do business.\u00a0 We welcome the opportunity to work with the government to overcome these perceptions and to help resolve these issues.\n\nThe Sarnia Lambton Chamber recommends that the 2017 LTEP add the guiding principles of affordability and transparency, which we believe are as important as conservation, cost-effectiveness, reliability, clean energy and community engagement. We urge the Minister to commission an independent economic analysis of the Plan before it is implemented and to include in the Plan a 20-year forecast of the price (not just demand) of electricity, fuels and natural gas. We also urge the Minister to work with the Ontario Energy Board to increase transparency and stabilize prices.\u00a0 This is important for businesses to better manage their monthly cash flow and plan for their future.\u00a0 It is our belief that these moves would bring certainty to rate payers and improve Ontario\u2019s reputation as an affordable place to do business. It will also allow the Province to move forward on the opportunities that await the energy sector.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206877]\n",

First, it has been proven to quite unweildly, in that it totally lacks the flexibility necessary to meet Ontario's fluctuating energy needs. This results in Ontario Power Generation often selling, at a loss I might add, to other jurisdictions. This energy being paid for those of us who live in Ontario and leaves us paying exorbitant fees for our electricity! It also makes Ontario a very unattractive place for bussinesses to set up operations. Premier Wynn, and her sizeable entourage, have been travelling the globe seeking new businesses to operate in our province. Yet, why would they do so when the cost of electricity makes it nigh unto impossible for them to make a profit here in Ontario.\nThe second, and what I believe to be even more problematic issue of nuclear energy is the safe disposal of the spent uranium fuel cells. This is already giving the Ontario Government a huge \"headache\", so to speak, and it is a problem that is only going to get larger, with the refurbishment of tjhe Darlington Nuclear Generating Statio.\nPlease, I implore you to start spending considerable more money in renewable forms of energy. It will certainly make Ontario a much more attractive province in which to do business. Ontario has the potential to set the bench mark for the development of renewable forms of energy. The time is now for us to lead the way!\nThank you,\nNancy Veals\n[Original Comment ID: 206021]\n",

        "comment":"To whom it may concern,\n\nAs a resident of Toronto and a Canadian citizen I am deeply concerned regarding energy issues in this country and in my province. As the Federal Liberal gov't is planning to build more pipelines, I feel that the voices of regular people must be heard and taken into account.\n\nAt this point in time, the initiative must be for Ontario to turn to 100% renewable energy. This is not an incredible and impossible idea. There are countries right now, as we speak in Europe who are moving to ban petrol cars (i.e. Germany, Netherlands, Norway, etc) yet, here in Canada we are barely moving in a positive direction on this issue.\n\nWe basically need solar panels anywhere where they can catch sunlight, we need wind-farms, research in geo-thermal energy but most of all we need the right attitude from politicians and civil servants. With the use of renewable energy we can get everyone involved: industry, regular citizens, foreign investment, etc. and everyone will benefit out of this.\n\nThe continuation of pipelines and nuclear energy is simply not safe and it would be good if gov't officials would recognise this. Nuclear power produces radio-active waste which we do not know what to do with and we just bury in the ground. Out of sight, out of mind seems to be the norm nowadays (until we get a Fukoshima disaster then, it's too late). In my opinion all nuclear projects must be independently and publicly reviewed. I do not trust the CNSC (Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission) because it is mostly made-up of people who were involved in the failing energy industry which we have now, be it mining, or others.\n\nIt is the same story with pipelines. The Nexen Pipeline spill in Alberta, is the best example. A brand new pipeline, with double walls, with sensors which were supposed to detect leaks, still burst-out leaking oil for weeks until a contractor noticed the pools of oil. This is tragic, it is irresponsible and it must end. We need renewable energy that is not going to result in damaging the environment and putting people's lives at risk.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that we have the opportunity to change, we have people who need work and a renewable energy industry which needs to get off the ground. What are politicians waiting for? This is what we should be investing our time and energy in: conservation and renewable energy, not pipelines and nuclear power stations. Prices on renewable energy and smart-grid technologies are constantly dropping, we have absolutely no reason not to follow the lead of countries such as Germany. It is shameful that we have not acted sooner when we indeed can.\n\nI wish the gov't will make thoughtful decisions regarding this issue, keeping in mind the future generations and the well-being of the environment (which we depend on). Any new money invested should only be going to renewable energy because this is the future.\u00a0 Thank You.\n\nSincerely,\n\nI\u00a0 (Andrei Neacsu)\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206886]\n",

This is not the direction we want and it stifles our economy to expand. Ontario should join the global movement toward 100% renewable energy which is providing lots of new jobs and businesses. Ontario\u2019s next energy plan needs to come clean on the true cost of nuclear power and help citizens and communities to empower themselves with renewable energy.\n\nOntario\u2019s next energy plan needs to remove barriers to citizens and communities becoming energy self-sufficient. This will the lower energy costs for the government which is what the sell-off of Ontario Hydro was suppose to do.\n\nI want Ontario to take the renewable path to a low-carbon future. Ontario\u2019s next energy plan needs to ensure Ontarians can take advantage of the declining cost of renewables. I would love to put up solar panels on my downtown Toronto home to reduce my drain on the dangerous and expensive Nuclear Power.\n\nAlso, the top priority of the next energy plan should be reducing energy demand wherever possible. The next energy plan should pursue all affordable conservation where renewable energy should be the top priority of Ontario\u2019s next energy plan. This will boost our economy with new company startups and bring the cost of renewable energy down.\n\nOn the electrification of transportation and heating, I support electrifying transport and heating to displace fossil fuels, but conservation and renewables should be used to address any increased electricity demand.\n\nWe are looking to you, our elected government to manage our province better than in the past and take this province to a 100% RENEWABLE ONTARIO.\n\nThank You\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206888]\n",

        "comment":"Statement by\nJack Dowding\nExecutive Chairman\nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \u2013\nElectrical Power Council of Ontario (IBEW-EPCO)\nMy name is Jack Dowding. \u00a0I am the Executive Chairman of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \u2013 Electrical Power Council of Ontario. \u00a0The union locals that are affiliated to our organization represent 17,000 skilled men and women who are employed in the electrical industry in Ontario. \u00a0Our members work in construction, maintenance, renovation and retrofitting in every sector in Ontario. \u00a0We also install and maintain transmission and distribution lines and we have installed a significant amount of Ontario\u2019s new solar and wind generation capacity.\nWe appreciate the opportunity that you have given us to share our views with you on Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan.\nLet me say from the start that our organization, our affiliated union locals and our members support the objectives of Ontario\u2019s green energy plan. \u00a0We applaud the provincial government for leading the way in North America by shutting down all of Ontario\u2019s coal-burning generators. \u00a0Of course, there will be problems along the way but the path that the government has chosen is the correct path. \u00a0We must reduce green-house gases and to accomplish that, we must reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\nIn my remarks to you today, I want to focus on three issues or themes. \u00a0The first of these is what we see as a tension between the important commitment to reduce the role of fossil fuels in meeting the province\u2019s overall energy requirements and the need for a much clearer vision of the alternative strategy to meet those energy requirements. \u00a0Ontario\u2019s Five-Year Climate Change Action Plan envisions an Ontario which will substantially reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet the province\u2019s energy needs. \u00a0The Action Plan also envisions a concurrent increase in the use of electricity to meet those energy needs. \u00a0The Action Plan is clear in its intention to bring about a greater role for electricity in heating buildings, both residential and non-residential and in meeting the energy needs of our transportation sector. \u00a0The shift to greater reliance on electricity inevitably raises the question: how will that electricity be generated. \u00a0While we strongly support increased generation from renewable resources, we do not believe that renewable sources can be expanded sufficiently to meet the increased role that electricity will play in a low carbon future.\nWe need; therefore, a much clearer picture of what Ontario\u2019s strategy will be to bring increased generation capacity on line and to deliver that energy efficiently and reliably.\nThat takes me to the second point that I would like to make;\nNuclear power today accounts for somewhat more than 60% of the electricity that we generate. \u00a0It is difficult to see a future in which the role of electricity will increase, but the role of our nuclear sector will not. \u00a0The government has indicated a timetable for refurbishing our existing nuclear reactors, although support appears tepid for arrangements beyond Unit 2 at Darlington nuclear Generating Station.\nThere are two reasons to bring the refurbishing timetable forward. \u00a0The first is interest rates. Long-term interest rates are currently at historic lows. \u00a0No one expects these conditions to continue indefinitely. \u00a0The interest rate is a major factor in the financing costs for refurbishment. \u00a0In our view the government should take advantage of the low interest rates that currently prevail to bring forward the refurbishment timetable. \u00a0The apparent savings from delaying the refurbishment will be more than offset by the higher financing costs that will prevail in future years.\nThe second reason to consider bringing the refurbishment timetable forward is the availability of labour and contracting capacity. \u00a0The downturn in the Alberta energy sector means that there is capacity available. \u00a0Ontario will not be competing with Alberta\u2019s energy sector for materials and manpower which was, until recently, the single most important factor shaping construction costs in Canada. \u00a0However, the downturn in Alberta is cyclical. \u00a0Oil prices have been edging up. \u00a0When producers can be confident that prices will stay above $60 per barrel, the construction cycle in Alberta\u2019s energy sector will resume.\nBy bringing the refurbishment timetable forward, Ontario can avoid some of the costs that will inevitably arise when large-scale projects in Ontario must compete with large-scale projects in Alberta for skilled labour and skilled contractors. \u00a0By taking advantage of current economic and financial conditions, the government will achieve important, long-term cost savings. \u00a0The government will also ensure that we have the low carbon generating capacity that Ontario needs to meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets.\nOntario cannot achieve its objective of increasing the role of electricity in our energy supply without ensuring the continued reliability and efficiency of our nuclear power fleet. \u00a0We strongly believe that the government should give serious consideration to bringing forward the timetable to refurbish our nuclear assets.\nThe third topic that I want to raise with you is conservation and, more particularly, the need to remove obstacles to investments in conservation. \u00a0The typical commercial tenancy agreement and a great many residential tenancy agreements pass the cost of utilities on to the tenant. \u00a0Aside from changing the lighting and time of use, there is often very little that a tenant can do to conserve on the use of energy. \u00a0 A tenant cannot invest in insulation; nor can a tenant invest in more energy efficient mechanical systems. \u00a0In many residential tenancies, the appliances are owned by the landlord. \u00a0The majority of tenants, whether they are commercial tenants or residential tenants, bear the burden of inefficient buildings and appliances. \u00a0In the residential sector, a significant number of tenants are in the lower income groups. \u00a0It is unfair to tenants to raise the cost of energy when they have no realistic way to deal with energy inefficient buildings, energy inefficient mechanical systems and energy inefficient appliances. \u00a0 Improvements there may involve incentives or penalties that are delivered through the tax system. \u00a0It could involve direct grants or property tax surcharges. Perhaps there should be a requirement that landlords pay a portion of the utility costs in the buildings that they own. \u00a0We acknowledge that the government has put some incentives in place. \u00a0These incentives do not appear to be commensurate with the scale of the upgrade investments that will be required in the rented building stock. The government needs to take steps to incent or to force landlords to make the investments that are needed.\nWe don\u2019t know what the best solution would be but what we do know is that if Ontario is to achieve its goal of making buildings more energy efficient, we must find a way to incentivize landlords to make the investments that are needed in energy efficient structures, energy efficient mechanical systems, and energy efficient appliances and lighting systems.\nI want to conclude my remarks by reiterating the points with which I began. \u00a0 \u00a0The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \u2013 Construction Council of Ontario and the Electrical Power Council of Ontario, support the objectives of Ontario\u2019s green energy plan. \u00a0We support the decision to shut down all coal-burning generators.\nWhat we hope emerges from these consultations is the reception of a clear message to the government that we the citizens, need a much clearer picture of what Ontario\u2019s strategy will be to bring increased generation capacity on line and to deliver that electricity efficiently, economically and reliably. \u00a0We believe the government needs to develop a system that compels landlords to install energy efficient structures, mechanical systems, appliances and lighting systems. We do not see how the role of electricity can be increased in Ontario\u2019s overall energy usage without utilizing the full capacity from our nuclear generating plants. \u00a0And as previously suggested, we believe the government should seriously consider bringing forward the refurbishment timetable.\nAnd on a regional note (for the Pembroke & Ottawa sessions), investment in the Chalk River facility would be welcomed by everyone employed and affected by its operation. The expertise that is currently still available would be exceedingly difficult to replace if it were allowed to disperse.\nThis region is also a leader in solar farm assets, for the obvious reasons. As long as nature continues to cooperate, both wind and solar projects are welcome and supported as part of the LTEP. Thank you again for affording us the opportunity to share our views.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJack Dowding\nExecutive Chairman\nIBEW Electrical Power Council of Ontario\nTel: \u00a0416-674-6940 ext 231\nFax: 416 674 9541\nCell: 416-999-6055\n[Original Comment ID: 202520]\n",

        "comment":"Statement by\nJohn Grimshaw\nExecutive Secretary\nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \u2013\nConstruction Council of Ontario (IBEW-CCO)\nMy name is John Grimshaw. \u00a0I am the Executive Secretary Treasurer of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \u2013 Construction Council of Ontario. \u00a0The union locals that are affiliated to our organization represent 17,000 skilled men and women who are employed in the electrical industry in Ontario. \u00a0Our members work in construction, maintenance, renovation and retrofitting in every sector in Ontario. \u00a0We also install and maintain transmission and distribution lines and we have installed a significant amount of Ontario\u2019s new solar and wind generation capacity.\nWe appreciate the opportunity that you have given us to share our views with you on Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan.\nLet me say from the start that our organization, our affiliated union locals and our members support the objectives of Ontario\u2019s green energy plan. \u00a0We applaud the provincial government for leading the way in North America by shutting down all of Ontario\u2019s coal-burning generators. \u00a0We also applaud the provincial government for showing the courage and foresight to introduce a cap-and-trade system in Ontario. \u00a0Of course, there will be problems along the way but the path that the government has chosen is the correct path. \u00a0We must reduce green-house gases. \u00a0To do that, we must reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\nIn my remarks to you today, I want to focus on three issues or themes. \u00a0The first of these is what we see as a tension between the important commitment to reduce the role of fossil fuels in meeting the province\u2019s overall energy requirements and the need for a much clearer vision of the alternative strategy to meet those energy requirements. \u00a0Ontario\u2019s Five-Year Climate Change Action Plan envisions an Ontario which will substantially reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet the province\u2019s energy needs. \u00a0The Action Plan also envisions a concurrent increase in the use of electricity to meet those energy needs. \u00a0The Action Plan is clear in its intention to bring about a greater role for electricity in heating buildings, both residential and non-residential and in meeting the energy needs of our transportation sector. \u00a0The shift to greater reliance on electricity inevitably raises the question: how will that electricity be generated. \u00a0While we strongly support increased generation from renewable resources, we do not believe that renewable sources can be expanded sufficiently to meet the increased role that electricity will play in a low carbon future.\nWe need; therefore, a much clearer picture of what Ontario\u2019s strategy will be to bring increased generation capacity on line and to deliver that energy efficiently and reliably.\nThat takes me to the second point that I would like to make;\nNuclear power today accounts for somewhat more than 60% of the electricity that we generate. \u00a0It is difficult to see a future in which the role of electricity will increase, but the role of our nuclear sector will not. \u00a0The government has indicated a timetable for refurbishing our existing nuclear reactors.\nThere are two reasons to bring the refurbishing timetable forward. \u00a0The first is interest rates. Long-term interest rates are currently at historic lows. \u00a0No one expects these conditions to continue indefinitely. \u00a0The interest rate is a major factor in the financing costs for refurbishment. \u00a0In our view the government should take advantage of the low interest rates that currently prevail to bring forward the refurbishment timetable. \u00a0The apparent savings from delaying the refurbishment will be more than offset by the higher financing costs that will prevail in future years.\nThe second reason to consider bringing the refurbishment timetable forward is the availability of labour and contracting capacity. \u00a0The downturn in the Alberta energy sector means that there is capacity available. \u00a0Ontario will not be competing with Alberta\u2019s energy sector for materials and manpower which was, until recently, the single most important factor shaping construction costs in Canada. \u00a0However, the downturn in Alberta is cyclical. \u00a0Oil prices have been edging up. \u00a0When producers can be confident that prices will stay above $60 per barrel, the construction cycle in Alberta\u2019s energy sector will resume.\nBy bringing the refurbishment timetable forward, Ontario can avoid some of the costs that will inevitably arise when large-scale projects in Ontario must compete with large-scale projects in Alberta for skilled labour and skilled contractors. \u00a0By taking advantage of current economic and financial conditions, the government will achieve important, long-term cost savings. \u00a0The government will also ensure that we have the low carbon generating capacity that Ontario needs to meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets.\nOntario cannot achieve its objective of increasing the role of electricity in our energy supply without ensuring the continued reliability and efficiency of our nuclear power sector. \u00a0In our view, the government should seriously consider bringing that timetable forward. \u00a0 We strongly believe that the government should give serious consideration to bringing forward the timetable to refurbish our nuclear capacity.\nThe third topic that I want to raise with you is conservation and, more particularly, the need to remove obstacles to investments in conservation. \u00a0The typical commercial tenancy agreement and a great many residential tenancy agreements pass the cost of utilities on to the tenant. \u00a0Aside from changing the lighting and time of use, there is often very little that a tenant can do to conserve on the use of energy. \u00a0 A tenant cannot invest in insulation, nor can a tenant invest in more energy efficient mechanical systems. \u00a0In many residential tenancies, the appliances are owned by the landlord. \u00a0The majority of tenants, whether they are commercial tenants or residential tenants, bear the burden of inefficient buildings and appliances. \u00a0In the residential sector, a significant number of tenants are in the lower income groups. \u00a0It is unfair to tenants to raise the cost of energy when they have no realistic way to deal with energy inefficient buildings, energy inefficient mechanical systems and energy inefficient appliances. \u00a0 That may involve incentives or penalties that are delivered through the tax system. \u00a0It could involve direct grants or property tax surcharges. Perhaps there should be a requirement that landlords pay a portion of the utility costs in the buildings that they own. \u00a0We acknowledge that the government has put in place some incentives. \u00a0These incentives do not appear to be commensurate with the scale of the upgrade investments that will be required in the rented building stock. The government needs to take steps to incent or to force landlords to make the investments that are needed.\nWe don\u2019t know what the best solution would be but what we do know is that if Ontario is to achieve its goal of making buildings more energy efficient, we must find a way to incentivize landlords to make the investments that are needed in energy efficient structures, energy efficient mechanical systems, and energy efficient appliances and lighting systems.\nI want to conclude my remarks by reiterating the points with which I began. \u00a0 \u00a0The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \u2013 Construction Council of Ontario supports the objectives of Ontario\u2019s green energy plan. \u00a0We support the decision to shut down all coal-burning generators. \u00a0We support the decision to introduce the cap-and-trade system in Ontario. \u00a0What we hope emerges from these consultations is a clear message to the government that we need a much clearer picture of what Ontario\u2019s strategy will be to bring increased generation capacity on line and to deliver that electricity efficiently, economically and reliably. \u00a0We believe the government needs to develop a system that compels landlords to install energy efficient structures, mechanical systems, appliances and lighting systems. We do not see how the role of electricity can be increased in Ontario\u2019s overall energy usage without at the same time increasing capacity from our nuclear generating plants. \u00a0We believe that the government should seriously consider bringing forward the refurbishment timetable.\nThank you again for affording us the opportunity to share our views.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJohn Grimshaw\nExecutive Secretary Treasurer\nIBEW Construction Council of Ontario\nTel: \u00a0416-674-6940 ext 222\nFax: 416 674 9541\nCell: 416-770-0689\n[Original Comment ID: 202524]\n",

        "comment":"I strongly support reducing our dependency on nuclear on Ontario and moving toward 100% renewable energy as quickly as possible. Nuclear is not safe. Pickering and Bruce reactors sitting right beside the Great Lakes and such high populations in cities along the Great Lakes is insane. The increasing amount of toxic waste from these plants means that our grandchildren and great grandchildren for many generations into the future will be paying the price for our energy use today by having to manage this waste for hundreds of years. Uranium from its first disturbance in the ground as it is mined through its use in reactors to its post-reactor use is a dangerous material that produces hugh risk throughout its life cycle. There are far safer and more secure alternatives today.\u00a0 Let's leave uranium undisturbed in the ground.\n\nFinancially uranium and nuclear reactors are incredibly expensive and irresponsible. World-wide, nuclear reactors cost billions of dollars to build, have always taken longer than predicted to build, and cost billions more than expected. And that is even without the financial cost of dealing with post-use toxic waste for hundreds of years into the future! And that does not include the cost of insurance and clean-up in case of accident! Nuclear compared to renewables is far too costly, carries too high risks, and passes too high a burden on to future generations.\n\nAging nuclear reactors need to be closed down and the shift to renewable energy technologies speeded up. That is what I hope for Ontario. That is what I want for my own future and most definitely for my children's future in this province.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206898]\n",

        "comment":"A comment on Water and Long Term Energy.\nThe laws governing the right to draw water from public waterways are outdated. The intention of the laws at the time they were passed does not align with today's situation. Our natural environment is now under threat and the availability of clean, fresh water for human survival is not to be taken for granted any longer. \u00a0Therefore, citizens of any community in Ontario should not have to compete with corporations in order to be provided with water for living.\nThe days of enjoying the convenience of having water put in a bottle can no longer continue and it is not sustainable. The environment and the provision of water to municipalities MUST come ahead of the sale of water to a multinational corporation. The corporation does not pay a lot for the water, but the single use bottles they manufacture make a lot of waste. A lot of waste. \u00a0Also, the proliferation of the bottles of water in our communities sends our children the wrong message about water and allows corporate involvement in a basic human need.\nI do not buy bottled water.\nIt should be the goal of the Ontario Government to have solar panels on every roof top in the province. \u00a0It must be made affordable for everyone who owns property. \u00a0Instead of continuing with nuclear energy that generates dangerous waste, put a plan in place to get solar panels manufactured and put on all houses. Every rooftop in Ontario ought to have them; it's just wasted space otherwise and a huge wasted opportunity to generate clean energy if not acted upon.\nI do not have solar panels but plan to buy.\nThe success of a long term (clean) energy plan is found in the people's willingness to act. \u00a0The people of Ontario are ready to act. Can the government work with the people. \u00a0Let's protect our water and generate CLEAN energy together.\n[Original Comment ID: 202531]\n",

        "comment":"Dear Honorable Minister Glenn Thibeault,\nRE: Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP)\nAs an Ontarian, I support a LTEP that is supportive, more aligned and in synch with Ontario\u2019s vision of a healthy environment. \u00a0This vision is described in many of Ontario\u2019s legislations and strategies such as:\n- Environmental Bill of Right (EBR) which purposes are:\n- to protect, conserve and restore the integrity of the environment;\n- To provide sustainability of the environment; and\n- To protect the right to a healthful environment\n- Ontario\u2019s Climate Change Strategy which confirms Ontario\u2019s commitment to combat climate change; - Green Energy Act which was created to expand renewable energy generation, encourage energy conservation and promote the creation of clean energy jobs;\n- The Climate Change Mitigation and Low-Carbon Economy Act which purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas and protect the environment; and\n- Green Energy and Green Economy Act which main purpose is to develop Ontario\u2019s green industry.\nThe current LTEP is almost a misfit to Ontario\u2019s vision. \u00a0In order to further align the LTEP to the vision, I support gradually increasing the use of renewable energy until Ontario becomes 100% renewable.\nIn 2015, 58% of Ontario\u2019s electricity was generated by nuclear energy. This is of particular concern. \u00a0Radioactive nuclear wastes are harmful to the environment, as well as all life. \u00a0Further, there are risks associated with nuclear energy. \u00a0A Fukushima type accident could occur. \u00a0At a minimal nuclear projects need to be independently and publicly reviewed.\nAnother reason why Ontario should invest more in renewable energy is because the world has already entered into the age of renewables (http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/citi-the-age-of-renewables-is-beginning--2014-3). \u00a0Eventually, nuclear and other types of energy will become outdated and harder to maintain and therefore more costly; whereas renewable energy will be in high demand and thus less expensive ((http:\/\/www.100reontario.org\/img\/costs-large.jpg).\nOntario should join the growing global movement of communities that have pledged to go 100% renewable by mid-century. \u00a0Prior to last year\u2019s Paris climate summit, over 1000 communities committed to transition to 100% renewable energy. \u00a0In the United States, 17 cities, including San Francisco, San Diego, and Boulder, have already committed to go 100% renewable. \u00a0In Canada, both Vancouver and \u00a0Ontario\u2019s own, Oxford County pledged to go 100% renewable.\n100% renewable is possible, Ontario is already producing about a quarter of its electricity from large hydro stations like Niagara Falls. \u00a0With the cost of renewables dropping, Ontario can continue to develop sources like wind, solar and biogas, and explore the option of importing low-cost hydro power Quebec. Ontario should empower its citizens and communities to become energy self-sufficient; help the traditional energy industry to transition to 100% renewable, as well as continue to develop its green energy economy. \u00a0The Green Energy and Green Economy Act has helped created a green economy in Ontario and develop ten of thousands of jobs. \u00a0Ontario needs to continue to support green energy, otherwise these jobs are at stake. \u00a0Walking away from green energy would also see emissions from Ontario\u2019s electricity sector rise after having invested heavily in its decline in the past decade. This will affect Ontario\u2019s ability to fight climate change and be contradictory to the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-Carbon Economy Act. \u00a0It will also mean missing out on one of the largest global economic opportunities, as around the world renewable energy continue to soar.\nTo reach 100% renewable, the top priority should be to reduce energy demand, followed by emphasizing conservation and then moving to 100% renewables. At the same time, empowering Ontarians to become energy self-sufficient and produce energy locally. \u00a0Ontario should also help traditional energy industry transition to 100% renewable, and continue to develop its green energy economy, particularly in the field of energy storage. The above will hugely help Ontario meet its environmental vision and related legislations, plans and strategies.\nLastly, the majority of Ontarians vote for green energy. \u00a0In a recent poll (http:\/\/environmentaldefence.ca\/report\/getting-fit\/), 81% of Ontarians ask that Ontario continue to develop renewable energy sources.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\n[Original Comment ID: 202707]\n",

I consider nuclear energy to be too dangerous and expensive to justify in a full cost analysis. A nuclear power plant is a potential target for a terrorist attack. It produces radioactive waste whose costs of containment are incalculably high - because it lasts thousands of years. It's also inadequately insured by the operator. So be forewarned. Should the Province approve the operation of a nuclear power plant within a proximity which puts my property, my health and\/or my family at risk, then, if ever there is an accident, I will seek to be fully compensated by the Province (and also by those who allowed this known risk to exist) for all my losses. Please factor this insurance cost into your cost analysis matrix. I'm sure if there's no risk then this insurance will be cheap. But I also think we both know it won't be cheap - which validates my concern. Nuclear energy is risky business. Therefore the best solution for everyone is not to build more and not allow the present NPPs to continue to operate. Not sure how? Then go to Germany and learn how! They do it for a much larger population. If they can do it surely Ontario with all it's resources can! I say have faith in yourselves and do the right thing.\n\nOn other forms of energy generation. I would rather pay more for other forms of power generation or takes measures to remove myself from the power grid - than live with the risks associated with nuclear power generation and everlasting waste containment.\n\nAgain thank you for the opportunity to comment.\n\nYour truly,\n\nTom Omstead.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206906]\n",

We recognize the importance of energy security for the continued high quality of life and economic and social growth of Ontario and we strongly agree there is a need for the development of a strategic plan for growth and development of sustainable and responsible energy.\u00a0 Ensuring sustainable growth provides long term ecological and social health and is an integral part of ensuring our environmental rights, as Ontarians and Canadians, is protected.\n\nLong-term planning for energy growth and development must incorporate environmental considerations and provide direction to help ensure the protection of healthy ecosystems and protect the habitat of fish and wildlife from the risks associated with energy development. While it is important to reach greenhouse gas emissions targets, it is imperative that decisions and actions to reduce emissions do not come at the expense of other environmental services and functions related to biodiversity on both landscape and site specific scales. It is equally important to ensure that decisions take all stakeholders into consideration and do not negatively impact natural heritage and cultural activities, specifically angling, hunting and trapping. We wish to provide the following feedback on areas of particular interest to our organization, our members, and outdoorsmen and women across the province.\n\nOntario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan should operate with other guiding provincial statements and initiatives, and most notably among these other pieces is Ontario\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan (Action Plan). To accomplish the emissions goals of the Action Plan there will need to be a transition from higher carbon output fuels to low carbon output. The Guide predicts an increased reliance on electricity as the key energy source for all purposes, from transportation and distribution to residential and commercial temperature control (heating and cooling). With many consumer initiatives manipulating demand-side economics to lower the use of higher carbon fuels\/energy, coupled with provincial commitments to use low carbon electricity, the production expansion of solar, hydroelectric, wind turbine, and biofuel production is likely.\n\nWhile low carbon energy sources are also called \u201cGreen Energy\u201d these sources often have their own suite of social, economic, and ecological concerns. Lowering local biodiversity, soil degradation, environmental services disruption, land use conflicts, habitat degradation\/fragmentation, intermittent energy production, direct mortality of wildlife, the removal of land from agricultural production, and many other issues have been observed from Green Energy sources\/practices. Therefore it is imperative that these technologies are continually improved on for efficiency, have appropriate mitigation strategies in place, and are only strategically installed where it economically and ecologically sustainable to do so (e.g. as close to demand locations as possible). The first round of Large Renewable Procurement installations has increased the amount of low carbon energy in Ontario, but significant local and broad-scale ecological impacts have been observed. Therefore, it is important to remember that even with current mitigation, some projects (e.g. wind turbines, hydroelectric, etc.) have the potential to seriously compromise our terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, including the fish and wildlife they support.\n\nDecision-making criteria for this provincial strategy must include ecological rationale, specifically at the landscape and site specific level, as a fundamental consideration in addition to social, economic, and political concerns. In conjunction with site specific considerations, improvements in cumulative effects and integrated land management is necessary to ensure each project is not considered in isolation and fits appropriately into a broader strategy for determining where, when, and how energy projects will be established in Ontario. Other fundamental considerations that need to be included are heritage and cultural uses like angling and hunting. The suspension of the next round of Large Renewable Procurement agreements should also be used to better evaluate the impacts of previous installations and advance technologies, in regards to both the actual production of electricity and mitigation procedures for observed impacts, in order to be able to produce ecologically sustainable low carbon energy at a landscape level.\n\nThe OFAH appreciates the opportunity to review the Planning Ontario's Energy Future: A Discussion Guide to Start the Conversation and participate in the conversation about the long term security of energy and the environment in Ontario. We look forward to working with the province further on this and any future initiatives.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206908]\n",

        "comment":"I believe as the Pickering retirement nears a strong consideration should be given to a renewal of the contracts for the CES combined cycle assets. \u00a0By this time these assets will have been paid for but still have considerable life in them, which makes them cost effective to continue running. These assets have the ability to provide power intermittently whenever their is a large demand or other forms of generation are unable to perform. \u00a0They are able to sit idle for long periods and still be available to provide large amounts of power in short notice with great reliability. \u00a0The power they supply is flexible and responsive to the load demand.\nLocal generation is also an important consideration versus importing power from outside the province. \u00a0The salary and supply chain costs of local generation stays within our economy whereas imported power (generally more expensive) is money that leaves our economy.\nI also believe as we consider the Long Term Energy Plan with respect to emissions, all sources of emission should be considered. \u00a0Ontario has already invested over $20 billion dollars to reduce emissions in the power sector to the point where fossil burning (natural gas) only accounts for 10% of the generation in the province. \u00a0We need to consciously consider whether the resources and dollars to reduce the remaining emissions in the power section would not achieve better reductions in other areas such as industry, transportation or domestic use. \u00a0Let's get the best bang for our dollar.\n[Original Comment ID: 202810]\n",

        "comment":"December 11th, 2016\nMinistry of Energy\nEnvironmental Bill of Rights Registration # 012-8840\nVia: ltep@ontario.ca\nRe: I want Ontario to go 100% renewable\nTo whom it may concern,\nI am writing to share my view that Ontario's next Long-Term Energy Plan needs to not only recognize 100% renewable as a viable option, but lay out concrete steps for achieving this objective as soon as possible.\n100% renewable is not an environmentalist's fantasy; it is a future which communities, companies, and even countries around the world are already successfully striving towards. Here in Canada, both Vancouver and Victoria have made this pledge; closer to home, Oxford County, ON, has followed suit. They are already beginning to reap the social, economic and environmental benefits.\nA 100% renewable Ontario begins, first and foremost, with conservation. The less energy we need, the less we will have a need for polluting and dangerous forms of energy such as nuclear and gas plants. A recent government study showed we have the potential to cost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30% by 2035. Why have we not already begun aggressively pursuing this target?\nA 100% renewable Ontario also empowers communities to become the producers of their own energy-- not just passive consumers. From rooftop solar to community geothermal installations, Ontario\u2019s next energy plan should provide a variety of options for the province's communities, individual households, co-ops, and First Nations communities to go renewable.\nFurthermore, it must be recognized that the biggest barrier to a 100% renewable Ontario is the government's unwavering and illogical affection for nuclear power. Year after year, renewables get cheaper and nuclear gets more expensive-- yet the government keeps approving life-extension and refurbishment projects that will cost Ontarians billions.\nPast energy plans have contained no requirement for nuclear projects to undergo public review against alternatives. I'd like to see this change, and to see our next energy plan require full and fair comparisons of the total costs of nuclear with alternatives. The public should then be given an opportunity to provide input into what type of energy they prefer.\nFinally, no criticism of nuclear power in Ontario would be complete without mention of the aging Pickering nuclear plant. Just 30 km from downtown Toronto and its millions of residents, this facility is beyond its design life and needs to be shut down to ensure public safety, in addition to the reasons outlined above.\nWith no real plan for dealing with a large-scale INES Level 7 nuclear disaster such as the Fukushima disaster, I don't see how the Ontario government can justify running such an old and outdated reactor a stone's throw from the most densely populated region in Canada.\nOntario\u2019s 2013 energy plan committed to close the Pickering nuclear station between 2017 and 2020, but earlier this year the government announced they'd keep it running until 2024, effectively breaking their promise. I would like this promise honoured, as we don't need Pickering's energy anyway, almost all of it being surplus and exported at a loss.\nIn summary, I would like to see Ontario's next energy plan prioritize conservation and renewables, empower citizen- and community- led small-scale renewable energy projects, and recognize nuclear power's true costs and risks. Since the energy it produces is not needed by Ontarians, shutting Pickering down would be a great first step in Ontario\u2019s long-term transition to renewable energy.\nThank you for considering my comments in this review.\nSincerely,\nFawn Edwards\nToronto, ON\n[Original Comment ID: 206045]\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Thibeault,\n\nI am a founder, director, member and investor in Oxford Community Energy Co-operative (18 MW Wind), Sustainability Brant Community Energy Co-op (~1 MW solar PV), ZooShare Biogas Co-op (500 kW Biogas), Sustainability Ontario Community Energy Co-op and windfarm owner in Germany.\n\nI strongly believe that Ontario must change course now to be 100% powered by distributed renewable energy by 2050 and has to start planning for and actually decommission its nuclear fleet starting with the\u00a0 Pickering plant right now to ensure that we will be able to achieve this goal.\n\n1. We need a comprehensive and inclusive plan\n\nFrom any Long-Term Energy Plan one expects it to be based on thorough research of the available and most promising options for a sustainable, reliable and socially acceptable future energy system. The plan thus has to include:\n\n\u2022full lifecycle and risk evaluation of the present and most promising future technologies, \u2022firm goals, actions and timelines and milestones\n\n\u2022sensitivity and risk analysis\n\n\u2022be comprehensive and include all forms of energy, i.e. electrical, heating and cooling, transportation, industrial processes\n\n\u2022be based on comparative models and scenarios for the most viable options wrt achieving overall environmental sustainability and lowest possible GHG emission.\n\nThe current base for planning provided by the IESO, the Ontario Planning Outlook, falls short in almost all of these requirements for a solid technical analysis on which such long term decisions should be made.\n\nAlthough the OPA does, somewhat fuzzily, assume that in the future there will be more distributed generation in Ontario, it barely touches the actual important questions (when, where, how much, how deeply embedded?) and displays no understanding of what this means for our current centralized system or even a future integrated energy system.\n\nThe OPO perpetuates and builds all it assumptions and projections on the baseload paradigm, which has long been proven to be a myth. All present research into sustainable energy systems indicates that loads can be easily followed and no baseload bulk generation is needed if smart grid technology, distributed renewable generation and storage are implemented.\n\nFurther the future LTEP must not underestimates the effects a successful implementation of the Climate Change Action Plan will have, past projections for energy demand and penetration of new technologies have always tended to do so.\n\n2. Conservation is the cheapest form of energy\n\nTo fight climate change and reduce our environmental footprint, Ontario\u2019s next energy plan must make conservation and efficiency the first priority for all energy decisions. This principle has to apply to our buildings, institutions, industries and transportation systems.\n\nA recent government study* showed we have the potential to cost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30% by 2035. \u00a0 The government should pursue and promote all cost-effective conservation measures immediately and work together with the many NGO and companies that already provide expertise and mature technological solutions to homeowners and businesses to conserve energy and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n3. Economic and societal opportunities\n\nOntario can continue to be a leader in the green energy transition and seize the economic opportunities that come with this leadership. Phasing out coal and increasing energy from renewable sources was a courageous first step. But we need to go further and have to reduce GHG from all sectors, specifically buildings, transportation and the industry.\u00a0 Recent polls have shown that Ontarians are willing to follow this path, it needs your commitment and will to clearly and transparently communicate the message to all stakeholders including those that are perceived as standing to loose from an energy transition (i.e. OPG, Bruce Power, Power Works Union etc.).\n\nLong term energy planning provides this opportunity of paving a new way and missing out on it can very soon have costly consequences for us all.\n\n4. The Energy Transition is a bottom up change project\n\nIf the future of our energy system is to have Ontarian\u2019s Social License is must be a distributed system, which will and must empower community groups, LDC, Municipalities as well as First Nations & M\u00e9tis communities to become the owners and operators of the new energy assets. Government policies like the Feed-In-Tariff program have allowed communities to participate in and benefit from renewable energy production, which has led to a number of important and tangible benefits, these program should be continued and streamlined to become the accelerator for the rapid build up of the integrated distributed system to replace nuclear power in the required time frame.\n\n5. Reliability, safety and affordability are paramount\n\nOur current heavy reliance on a bulk energy supply from three large nuclear plants has systemic reliability and safety issues. Decreasing our reliance on nuclear power and increasing distributed generation will lead to a more flexible, more cost-effective energy supply in the long run.\n\nDespite massive and costly efforts to train for the upcoming refurbishment at Darlington, these projects should be seen as \u201cOpening the Pandora\u2019s Box\u201d. Given the recently revealed negligent inspection practice of the CNSC it can be safely assumed that time and cost overruns attributed to unforeseen safety concerns that need to be addressed are soon coming. Locking Ontario into a nuclear future with continuously increasing population density in the vicinity of Pickering and Darlington is irresponsible and cannot be justified by saving jobs in an industry that is in decline worldwide. The exportability of Candu reactor expertise is steadily shrinking due to the massive investments required compared to alternative energy sources. The long awaited renaissance of nuclear power should be considered wishful thinking of those resisting the change because of their highly vested interests.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to consider and review public input into Ontario\u2019s next Long Term Energy Plan.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Ingo K\u00f6nig\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206917]\n",

        "comment":"While identifying pathways to a low-carbon energy system there is a critical aspect of engaging and educating Ontarians on how this energy transition will affect their lives and businesses. An important part of our programming at Pollution Probe is through the work of Energy Exchange.\u00a0 Our goal is to engage Canadians and communities that have the most influence on Canada\u2019s energy system in order to increase their energy and climate literacy about the system and about the broader context surrounding their particular area of expertise. We support this community to collaborate and build relationships with an overall focus on creating specific societal or system benefit (i.e. EV deployment and adoption, time-of-use pricing, energy efficiency, and conservation behaviours).\n\nTHE STORY ON ENERGY LITERACY IN CANADA IS CHANGING.\n\nThe traditional focus on energy literacy in Canada and Ontario was on building awareness and decision making capacity around our vast and diverse energy endowment. However, things have changed significantly and though it is still critical to educate people across Ontario on our energy system and the value it creates in their lives, we also need to address climate change and the transition towards a low carbon economy; new technologies and innovations; the need for conservation and efficiency; and an increasingly complex energy system that is evolving more rapidly than most can handle. This has caused uncertainty in the marketplace, leaving industry and energy end users confused and polarized on what path we should take as we move forward. Through engagement with our key stakeholders and our community of practice, we believe government focus on the following strategic areas would allow Ontarians to work together towards providing solutions to our transition to a low-carbon energy system:\n\n1.Invest in Initiatives that Support Effective Change Management:\u00a0 Ontario has repeatedly tried to make significant change (and in many instances scaled back or reversed this change) within our energy system.\u00a0 Whether it be implementing a commercialized wholesale\/retail electricity marketplace, shifting our supply mix toward renewable power, or introducing time-of-use pricing, we have collectively agreed and attempted \u2013 with varying degrees of success \u2013 to drive changes that many\/most agreed were needed, but have repeatedly fallen short of executing them in a way that end use customers could understand.\n\nThe change we have committed to is even more significant. The type of complexity involved in a transition to a low-carbon energy system is incredibly challenging. Targeted energy and climate literacy\u2014supporting the motive and call-to-action\u2014form the critical link to supporting the kind of changes that will be required in order to more easily adapt to new technologies and behaviours.\n\nMost organizations fail to accurately assess how difficult it really is to drive change initiatives \u2013 especially ones that have (at end point) impact on the general consumer (Kotter, J., Harvard Business Review, 2007). The key issue is that when social-technical changes are being developed many organizations make (often rational) assumptions about their intended audiences, while forgetting to think of some critical aspects about design (i.e. key barriers and enablers of change), what education\/information consumers require, how these audiences being asked to absorb the change will feel (and react emotionally) and\u2014most fatally\u2014what the actual \u201cuser defined\u201d version of the call to action is.\n\nFrom an energy literacy perspective this means that the focus should be on taking a systems approach: developing critical thinking skills, ensuring messages are tailored to the audience and providing balanced information that activates collective values. Often we find this means translating information into an engaging format that is easy to understand, easy to digest, and easy to connect to personally. \u00a0 It is important that the energy and climate literacy community has enough resources to provide Ontarians with the right information, at the right time and in the right format. \u00a0 A few specific examples of programming where consumer focused change management and enhanced literacy\/communications might be beneficial from a LTEP perspective include:\n\n\u2022Load Shifting:\u00a0 Helping end-use consumers shift electricity usage to off-peak hours and to use overnight baseload potential (especially in the context of EV adoption) will help increase the effectiveness of the government\u2019s demand-side management initiatives.\n\n\u2022Energy Conservation and Efficiency:\u00a0 There are multiple incentives coming from various governments in 2017 and beyond to encourage at home energy conservation and efficiency behaviours; however, most consumers struggle with time, cost, and ability to implement.\u00a0 Developing turn-key programs that create real and meaningful conservation and efficiency behaviours will help reduce energy supply needs at the lowest cost.\n\n\u2022Adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs):\u00a0 Helping consumers in the decision-making process and providing the necessary EV adoption tools will be critical to the success of the province\u2019s goal for EV sales by 2020 (For more detailed recommendations please see Pollution Probe\u2019s submission to EBR Registry number 012-8840).\u00a0 This will be particularly important with regards to free overnight EV charging and how this incentive will be deployed.\n\n\u2022Low Carbon Commuting:\u00a0 Helping consumers understand what their low-carbon commuting options are and how to actually support behaviour changes with regards to active commuting, public transit, and EVs will support the provinces transportation decarbonization policies.\u00a0 Pollution Probe is developing a consumer facing program called the \u2018Low Carbon Commute\u2019 which will be based off of the success of the Clean Air Commute\u2014established by Pollution Probe in 1992 and operating for 22 years\u2014to help drive the changes and mindset needed for low carbon mobility.\n\nWe\u2019ve also segmented the Ontario population to identify those most interested or open to learning about energy for a more targeted and efficient approach to reach Ontarians in a dialogue around energy issues. These \u201cEnergy Engaged Citizens\u201d want to learn more about energy issues and are stewards in their communities. Even though we need a provincial approach to energy and climate planning, communities want to have a say in their energy future and it is so important that they are engaged in a more effective way than they have been in the past. This means using new engagement and communication tools to ensure that we are engaging a wider demographic in a dialogue around energy and climate issues.\n\nEnergy Exchange is currently developing a community-level energy engagement initiative called the Energy Ambassadors Program.\u00a0 This program will engage communities early on in the energy decision-making process in order to provide solid and credible foundational information about energy systems in Ontario and Canada.\u00a0 The goal is to establish science\u2013 and fact-based discussions at the outset of the project approval processes.\n\n2.Improve Publicly Available Energy and Climate Information and Data:\u00a0 Ontarians do not have access to high quality, timely and robust energy and climate data sets that balance economic, environmental and social indicators. This information is not only critical to develop strong businesses cases and provide policy direction, but it is also essential to crafting our energy narrative. We know from our research that Ontarians want more reliable, accurate, and transparent data in order to help support their decision making abilities. This should include benchmarking of large energy users and GHG emitters by sector as we know that this kind of transparency and competition drives results quickly.\u00a0 Two areas in which Energy Exchange has been active on providing Ontarians with better energy system information and data include:\n\n\u2022Primer on Energy Systems in Canada 1st and 2nd Edition:\u00a0 This comprehensive resource is intended for the onboarding of new employees with energy-related roles, for educators and students at the high school or post-secondary level, for civil society and public sector employees, and for any citizen interested in furthering their understanding of how Canada\u2019s energy system functions.\u00a0 It has been peer-reviewed by a committee of nationally-recognized subject matter experts. It is full of useful facts and figures and practical examples of how to optimize energy use.\u00a0 The first edition has been distributed to over 25,000 Canadians and the second edition is currently being launched. We will also be developing an e-learning platform to complement the primer in the coming months.\u00a0 For more information: http:\/\/www.energy-exchange.net\/energyprimer\/\n\n\u2022Public Opinion Research:\u00a0 In 2015, Energy Exchange partnered with a team of researchers from the University of Alberta, the University of New Brunswick, Dalhousie University and Cornell University to develop a nationally representative survey about Citizen Perspectives on Energy Issues.\u00a0 In 2017, we are planning to conduct similar primary and secondary research in order to benchmark how well the broader energy end-user understands current energy issues and has accepted and\/or absorbed recent and upcoming changes to the energy system.\u00a0 For more information: http:\/\/www.energy-exchange.net\/resources\/citizen-perspectives-energy-issues-research\/\n\n3.Use a Collaborative Approach to Energy and Climate Decision Making:\u00a0 The Province of Ontario must actively work in collaboration with the federal government, other provinces and territories, First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit leadership and communities (FNMI), local communities, businesses, and civil society to ensure that there is a coordinated and streamlined approach to energy and climate policies and regulatory processes. \u00a0 This includes internal collaboration within the government of Ontario\u2019s different ministries; for example, the LTEP should align with Ontario\u2019s GHG emission reduction targets. \u00a0 A collaborative approach that informs and authentically engages stakeholders will maximize the benefits of our energy and low-carbon future.\n\nThis is the approach we use at Pollution Probe and Energy Exchange to build consensus across stakeholder groups\u2014even though it can take more time upfront and can be complicated and uncomfortable, ultimately it is more effective and efficient.\u00a0 Our key recommendation is that all LTEP scenarios are rigorously evaluated and stacked against each other through a marginal abatement full cost accounting (i.e. externalities and co-benefits) methodology. This should be completed for each sector by a government sub-committee that engages with an external, independent multi-stakeholder advisory committee to ensure balance and foster public confidence in policy and regulatory recommendations. Innovation is moving rapidly and policy and regulatory processes must be nimble in order to keep up and maximize the potential benefits of new developments. A responsive policy environment that allows multiple solutions to be implemented with performance and cost dictating which options will progress is needed.\u00a0 Given the likelihood of disruptive technologies coming into the energy system marketplace in the next 10 to 30 years, a decision-making process such as this will also help build resilience into the LTEP, minimizing the probability of stranded assets.\n\nAs citizens of an energy-rich nation possessing immense potential for wealth creation, Ontarians must champion a responsible and informed low-carbon energy transformation. It is essential that we help Ontarians feel comfortable engaging on energy issues and excited about our low-carbon energy potential so that they can participate meaningfully in the transition and help be a part of the solution. Members of Ontario\u2019s energy community acknowledge that energy and climate literacy is an essential ingredient to build public confidence and expand investment opportunities into our future low-carbon energy system.\n\nAbout Energy Exchange\n\nEnergy Exchange\u2014a division of Pollution Probe\u2014is dedicated to advancing energy and climate literacy in Canada. It aspires to a future in which Canadians are united in their energy prosperity. Energy Exchange sees energy and climate literacy at the core of a sustainable future for Canada.

There are plenty of alternatives that exist and not one will prevail. Consider a mix of wind, solar and geothermal. How about offshore wind farms in the Great Lakes regions? I know! Crazy, right!?\n\nOther countries in Europe, North Africa and even some in South America are making or have made the switch and it is shameful we have little to no renewable infrastructures to speak of in this country. But ignorance is bliss I suppose, and most Canadians don't realize the lack of will only stems from the deliberate lack of information so that some businesses and sectors of industry don't suffer from the arrival of renewables. So enough already. This isn't fooling as many people as you'd think any more.\n\nGet on with renewables.

Our rural recreation facilities are becoming too expensive to operate. Rural Ontario and Municipalities have been left out of planning and decisions that affect our lives. You will never get support for large \u00a0energy projects that are forced on unwilling host communities. The adverse affect on rural communities is devastating.Cancel LRP2 and cancel the projects that were awarded under LRP1 in the spring of 2016. The savings will be in the hundreds of millions to the rate payers in Ontario. The cost to cancel the contracts is minor in comparison. In the future any contracts must be transparent and fair and include local municipal support as well as local aboriginal support. Rural electricity bills are higher than urban bills and yet the Ministry forces Large scale wind projects on unwilling rural communities. How unfair as we must put up with these landscape scarring industrial turbines and pay a higher cost on top of it. Many areas do not have access to the only affordable energy source out there, natural gas. There was a commitment by this Government many months ago with money to connect more of rural Ontario to natural gas . We have seen no action on this issue. This Government and the Minister of Energy ,say they are listening ,BUT DO YOU HEAR RURAL ONTARIO? I hope this exercise is not just a stunt for this Government to use as a political propaganda campaign , but instead a real change in their approach to listening to the people of Ontario. This mess is going to hurt future generations ,but we have to find a way out of it.\n[Original Comment ID: 203217]\n",

I read the 2010 and 2013 LTEPs when they came out. I have also read the Auditor General\u2019s 2011, 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports on the Ministry of Energy sector.\n1. The IESO and Ministry of Energy need to thoroughly read and implement the recommendations of the Auditor\u2019s Annual Reports of 2011, 2014 and 2015 concerning the energy sector.\n2. Show Global Adjustment in a separate line on the electricity bill.\nOne such recommendation from the Auditors has gone unheeded: \u201cdisclose the components of the TOU rates (electricity market price and Global Adjustment) separately on electricity bills so that the impact of the Global Adjustment is transparent to ratepayers.\u201d (P.386, 2014 Annual Report of the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, \u201cSmart Metering Initiative\u201d, Chapter 3, Ministry of Energy, Section 3.11)\n\u201cThe total Global Adjustment (GA) charged to ratepayers has grown from $654 million in 2006 to 7.7 billion in 2013. With more new contracted generators, especially of renewable energy expected to begin producing energy at higher contract prices, the total GA is expected to grow further to $8.5 billion in 2014 and $9.4 billion in 2015. From 2006 to 2014, electricity consumers have already paid a total of $37 billion and they are expected to pay another $133 billion in Global Adjustment fees from 2015 to 2032.\u201d (P.222, 2015 Auditor\u2019s Report.) \u201cGlobal Adjustment accounts for about 70% of each TOU rate. Even though the GA has increased significantly and accounts for a substantial proportion of the TOU rates, its impact is not transparent to most ratepayers because it does not appear on electricity bills as a separate line; instead it is imbedded in the TOU rates used to calculate the electricity charge.\u201d (P. 377- 380, 2014 Auditor\u2019s Report) Meanwhile, the market price of electricity continues to fall due to increasing supply to about 2 cents\/kWh. \u201cThe GA increased by 1,200% while the market price dropped by 46% between 2006 and 2013.\u201d (P.377) The more supply of electricity, the more the market price drops causing more difference between the GA and market price causing more increasing costs to ratepayers.\n\u201cAlmost one-third of the GA in 2014 is attributable to renewable energy contracts.\u201d \u00a0(P. 94 Auditor\u2019s 2011 Report)\n2. We have too much surplus power. Stop procuring more power.\n\u201cThe Ministry\u2019s attractive guaranteed prices program has been one of the main contributors to the surplus power situation Ontario has faced since 2009, in that it has procured too many renewable projects, too quickly, and at too high a cost.\u201d (P.226, 2015 Auditor\u2019s Report)\nSurplus power exported at lower prices and at a loss is costing us over a $ billion each year. Our neighbours who buy the power do not have to pay the Global Adjustment on that power but Ontario ratepayers do.\n3. Cancel all LRPI contracts. (300 MW of wind and 145 of solar) They were issued in March 2016 but construction has not begun. These extra MW of power will cause higher ratepayer costs in the GA.\n4. Cancel any further LRP contracts. The LRP II was recently cancelled as well it should have been as it should never have been offered. We already have about 9,000 MW of natural gas power plants sitting mostly idle with two more plants on the way at Napanee and Lambton that are not needed. We are still paying for these plants to be maintained and back up wind power. \u00a0\u201cRenewable energy sources such as wind and solar provide intermittent energy and require backup from coal or gas-fired generators to maintain a steady, reliable output. 10,000 MW electricity from wind would require an additional 47% of non-wind power, typically produced by natural-gas-fired generation plants to ensure continuous supply.\u201d (P.91, Electricity Sector-Renewable Energy Initiatives, Auditor\u2019s 2011 Annual Report) We also paid about $950 million, according to the Auditor for those two new gas plants previously when they were cancelled from Oakville and Mississauga.\n5. Conduct cost\/benefit analyses well before implementing any new energy policies. That was not done before the Green Energy Act or the Smart Meter program. So costly.\n6. The Ministry of Energy must stop issuing directives to the IESO. Consult with the IESO, LDC experts, energy technical experts as in the former OPA and engineering experts and let the IESO make the decisions. \u201cBut over the last decade, this power system planning process has essentially broken down and Ontario\u2019s energy system has not had a technical plan in place for the last ten years. Operating outside the checks and balances of the legislated planning process, the Ministry of Energy has made a number of decisions about power generation that have resulted in significant costs to electricity consumers.\u201d (P. 213, 2015 Annual Report of the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, Electricity Power System Planning, Ministry of Energy, Chapter 3, Section 3.05) \u201cWe calculate that electricity consumers have had to pay $9.2 billion more for renewables than they would have paid under the previous program.\u201d (P.214, 2015 Auditor\u2019s Report) \u201cIn 2009, the Ministry directed the OPA to create a new guaranteed price program that offered significantly more attractive contract prices. At the same time the OPA had suggested to the Ministry to use a competitive procurement process but the Ministry decided against it.\u201d (P.214, 2015 Auditor\u2019s Report) \u00a0Now, there is finally competitive procurement for wind power contracts but the prices are not made known to the public.\n7. The OEB\u2019s mandate to oversee electricity prices must remain and not be taken away by the Ministry of Energy. As the Auditor stated in 2011, the renewable programs prior to 2009 were very successful but the gov\u2019t offered outrageously high FIT prices, \u201ctwo to ten times higher than those of conventional energy sources.\u201d (P. 102, 2011 Auditor\u2019s Report) \u201cAlthough the OEB has historically been mandated to oversee and approve electricity prices, it has no role or legislative responsibility to review or approve FIT prices.\u201d P,104, 2011 Auditor\u2019s Report) In 2014, the auditor found that prices for wind were still twice the market price and three and a half times the market price for solar. (P. 214, 2015 Auditor\u2019s Report)\n8. Consult with all local distribution companies in Ontario prior to any changes. If that had been done prior to the Green Energy Act, we wouldn\u2019t have these high electricity costs. They saw the pitfalls of it and knew the costs involved. (LTEP round table discussions 2013 in which I participated in St. Catharines and heard them)\n9. Stop conservation programs.\n10. The previous RES and RESOP programs that were very successful prior to the GEA, did not have an \u201cadditional contract payment\u201d but the FIT program does and the LRPI still does. These generators are compensated for lost revenue as a result of curtailment. \u201cAccordingly, electricity ratepayers still have to pay renewable energy developers even when those generators are not producing electricity during periods of curtailment.\u201d (P.107, 2011 Auditor\u2019s Report)\nIf the wind is blowing well and the sun is shining, our system first spills hydro-electric power, our cheapest energy source meanwhile paying high prices to wind generators. We even have to shut down nuclear reactors at times and compensate them and keep natural gas plants maintained and backing up wind power. If wind is curtailed, we still pay for their compensation.\n11. Repeal the Green Energy and Economy Act. It\u2019s putting ratepayers in poverty and killing our economy! More and more industries and businesses have closed or left the province to go where electricity prices are much cheaper.\n12. Do not sell Hydro One.\n13. Leave natural gas alone. Natural gas heats 75% of homes in Ontario. As Union Gas advertises: prices dropped about $50\/yr on Jan.1, 2016. Heating your home and water with gas saves up to $3,000\/year compared to using electricity, oil or propane. Homeowners pay the same price as Union Gas with no mark up. There are no expensive time of use rates for natural gas as there are for electricity. The use of natural gas for businesses strengthens the economy: it is reliable and affordable allowing businesses to thrive. It supports hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs across the country. More businesses need access to natural gas. Ontario should continue assisting to provide more natural gas lines for agriculture, homes, businesses and industry. Do not put a carbon tax on natural gas.\n14. Do not put carbon taxes on anything in Ontario. Electricity prices will increase again thanks to the carbon tax.\nLTEP 2017 Discussion Guide Comments\n1. P. 8 \u201cFor example, because Ontario\u2019s electricity supply is largely emissions free, commitments in the Climate Change Action Plan foresee a switch from conventional fossil fuels to the use of electricity for heating and cooling buildings and powering transportation.\u201d\nYou will not see people switching from conventional fossil fuels to heating with electricity because it is so costly. Give your head a shake! People will be switching from electricity to natural gas and propane to lower their costs.\n2. P. 14 \u201cConservation and energy efficiency remain the most effective ways to manage electricity bills for all consumers. Shifting usage to off-peak periods can also reduce the strain on the electricity system and avoid or defer future system upgrades.\u201d\nSwitching from electricity to natural gas or propane for heat would help manage their bills.\n3. P. 15 The discussion Guide for the 2017 LTEP omits the fact that the Global Adjustment is a big part of the costs in the electricity line on residential and small businesses\u2019 electricity bills. The Guide only says that Global Adjustment is a part of costs for industrial users. Not correct.\n\u201c\u2026the electricity charge is made up of two components: the electricity market price and the Global Adjustment.\u201d (Auditor\u2019s 2014 Report, P. 377) The Glossary in the Discussion Guide for LTEP 2017 doesn\u2019t even have Global Adjustment included.\nI repeat: The Auditor wrote: \u201cdisclose the components of the TOU rates (electricity market price and Global Adjustment) separately on electricity bills so that the impact of the Global Adjustment is transparent to ratepayers.\u201d (P.386, 2014 Annual Report of the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, \u201cSmart Metering Initiative\u201d, Chapter 3, Ministry of Energy, Section 3.11)\nGlobal Adjustment must be shown in a separate line on the electricity bill.\n4. P.41 Questions for Consideration\na) What role should distributed renewable energy generation play in the ongoing modernization and transformation of Ontario\u2019s electricity system?\nIt would be great if everyone could afford their own energy off the grid such as solar panels on the roof.\nb) What strategies should Ontario pursue to harness the potential of its nuclear sector to meet its future energy needs?\nKeep the nuclear fleet going and consider new build. It is reliable and great for baseload generation but wind and solar are not. It has provided 50% of our power for many years. Many jobs are involved in the nuclear industry, directly and indirectly.\nc) What factors should Ontario focus on as it pursues opportunities for electricity trade agreements with nearby provinces and states?\nCost. Make sure Ontario\u2019s ratepayers will not have increased costs. The bi-directional cables from Nanticoke to Pennsylvania on the floor of Lake Erie were not mentioned in the Guide. \u201cITC said it expects approvals to come in the second quarter of 2017, and construction would begin shortly thereafter. It could be fully operational by 2019.\u201d\n[Original Comment ID: 203289]\n",

I believe that the only way forward is to work toward 100% renewable energy sources for Ontario.\n\nTo me this means shifting away from aging and dangerous nuclear facilities such as the Pickering nuclear plant and investing in innovative and sustainable renewable energy technology. Such steps should be coupled with measures to conserve energy and increase energy efficiencies across households, businesses, and all buildings. Ontario needs to join the movement towards renewable energy happening around the world and leave behind dangerous energy sources such as nuclear.\n\nRenewable energy is the right path forward for Ontario in order to reduce the impacts of climate change and to end our dependence on risky and costly nuclear power.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChristine Saraceno\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nfarfallaverde2@gmail.com\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206937]\n",

        "comment":"To stop or even reduce green energy projects will have long-term implications. I cringe if I think that we haven't yet fully paid for the construction of nuclear power plants built decades ago and are borrowing many billions more to restore those plants. On top of this there is still no solution for the disposal of high level radioactive materials that will have to be stored safely for many 10s of thousands of years to become harmless. Nuclear power plants have only produced electric power for about 60 years. Then add the cost of decommissioning nuclear power plants, which will cost many times the original construction cost. Politicians must start to think way past the next election and plan for a longer term future. This cannot go on the way it does now. Producing energy using renewable resources must be included with an eye on the long-term future. I do not want to leave sorting out this problem to my grandchildren.\nThere are already three long-distance high tension power transmission lines coming out of Bruce. If green power, such as solar, is not produced locally, how many more of these expensive lines will be needed as the population in major centres, such as Toronto, continues to grow? Just as the demand for air conditioning in summer is greatest, solar power fits perfectly into the mix to supply the peak demand locally without the need for more transmission lines with it's inherant line losses. Please take politics out and insert science into the decision making process. We don't need more politics, we need long-term solutions.\nWe must do better, it's 2016 after all.\nHartmut Kayser\n[Original Comment ID: 206067]\n",

Maintain the FIT program for qualified community organizations...\nIncluding co-ops, First Nations, M\u00e9tis, municipalities, public utilities, school boards, non-profit institutions, religious organizations, and other authentic community-based entities.\n2. FIT for community wind that allows community groups to lead projects...\nIn 2014 the FIT for wind projects over 500 kW was cancelled and replaced with a competitive procurement process called the Large Renewable Procurement (LRP). The LRP is only open to bidders with deep pockets and extensive experience and therefore not inclusive of community proponents, even while community ownership has been proven to decrease local resistance. While the LRP does encourage Indigenous participation, there are no incentives for developers to work with co-ops. The community power sector needs a level playing field to participate in wind projects. A FIT for wind up to 20 MW can address the current imbalance introduced by the LRP.\n3. Raise the capacity cap for FIT projects to 1 MW...\nto help increase economies of scale, to increase local distributed power supply and therefore local grid resiliency in the face of increasingly erratic weather patterns, and to benefit from new technology trends such as energy storage.\n4. Provide provincial loan guarantees for co-op and other non-profit renewable energy projects\n5. Help to export community expertise\n[Original Comment ID: 203711]\n",

        "comment":"The review of the Long-Term Energy Plan will profoundly impact Ontario\u2019s efforts to fight climate change. Now is the time for the province to commit to the long-term goal of completely decarbonising the electricity grid and moving to 100 per cent renewable energy by mid-century. Clean, renewable energy is the surest \u2013 and cheapest \u2013 pathway to a low-carbon economy. Natural gas is cleaner than coal, but natural gas is a fossil fuel. Fighting climate change means phasing out fossil fuels, and that means getting rid of natural gas.\nRenewable energy prices are dropping while the cost of nuclear power is rising. Prices for wind power in Ontario have already dropped by 66 per cent and are projected to drop by another 50 per cent over the next ten years. Meanwhile, Ontario Power Generation wants to increase the price it receives for nuclear power by 180 per cent. Solar power prices have come down even more dramatically than wind. In several jurisdictions, solar power is now the cheapest form of energy available, period. We see this trend continuing.\nAs part of this review, the real prices paid for different sources of power must be made public, so Ontarians can have an informed conversation about what\u2019s behind rising electricity bills. External benefits, such as job creation and investment are important to the overall economy, but should not interfere with cost clarity. We need to factor in externalities, as they are currently understood, with the costs of climate change, environmental impacts, costs of emissions pollutants and actual nuclear liability costs. The Federal government has recently adjusted the liability caps, and continues to recognize that the nuclear industry\u2019s liability is artificially, and quietly, subsidized by the average homeowner, provincial and municipal governments, without which, financing of these projects, at reasonable electrical rates, would not be possible.\nRenewable energy is only responsible for a small fraction of provincial electricity costs. This needs greater clarity and should be divulged to, and understood by, rate payers and taxpayers. Source and delivery cost clarity should not be a difficult, or convoluted, process to undertake by the Province.\nOntario\u2019s leadership in supporting renewable energy has paid off. Ontario leads Canada in solar and wind development, and is home to half of clean tech spending in this country, which returns billions of dollars to our economy and sustains tens of thousands of jobs. \u00a0Ontarians overwhelmingly support renewable energy. In a recent poll by EKOS, 80 per cent of Ontarians said they want to see more renewable energy in the future. A true understanding of current procurement and future planned procurement costs will allow for informed decision making by the public. The Long-Term Energy Plan must reflect that.\n[Original Comment ID: 203858]\n",

If we have so much power that we need to sell it at bargain basement prices then why are we importing Quebec power at $50\/mwh ?\n*$100 million to help 37,000 households retrofit to become energy efficient. What about the other 4 million customers and what is the criteria to apply for the measely $2,700 ? Similar to the $45 per month Hydro One credit, must a household have less than $24,000 annual income ? Why is this only available to natural gas consumers ? There is no gas in rural Ontario, the people who need the help the most.\n*The debt retirement charge was finally removed from Hydro One bills but so was the clean energy credit and now we have the cap & trade to look forward to, but you will reduce the h.s.t. by removing the 8% provincial portion however, you may be changing the TOU (time of use) to make up for that cash loss. Robbing Peter to steal from Mary and still stick it to Paul.\n*Rural Ontarians get it in the rear with exorbitant delivery charges that is usually 3 x the amount of actual usage for a household (more for a business). The delivery charges pay in part for new infrastructure (transmission lines & poles) that all the turbines and solar panels require. It is truly a catch 22.\n*FIT contracts continue to pay proponents between 17 and 29 cents per kwh yet our average kwh bill is 14 cents, the difference made up through global adjustments and delivery charges, so why not reduce the FIT prices to a reasonable level ? Why should the majority pay for the greed of the minority ?\n*This coming week's weather forecast has between 0 & 8 kph winds so turbines will be turning using gas fired energy but producing zero energy (wind turbines start producing at 12 kph) so we will be paying for FIT as well as the gas plants to power them.\n*The cloud cover is expected to be 70 - 88% so the most expensive producer of power will have zero output. Justify the millions of panels leaching toxins and carcinogens in this province that have permanently removed hundreds of acres of agricultural land from producing food.\n*Justify paying biomass proponents 18 cents per kwh for the least efficient yet dirtiest of all energy sources, even dirtier than coal.\n*Explain why cheap and clean hydro is spilled, nuclear steamed off yet gas plants are ramping up and down (much like the wear & tear and higher cost if you constantly switch from your brake pedal to gas pedal in your car) in order to provide back up power to wind & solar.\n*How can wind & solar be called green when the transformers are anything but ? Full of oils & fluids that need to be replaced and require to be heated or cooled (using nonrenewable electricity) depending on the season. Giant sub stations that are plunked where wildlife used to live among the thousands of trees in forests that have been razed. Oil in the nacelles of wind turbines that leak and again need non renewable power to turn, stop, start, pitch, light, heat & cool them.\n*Why is the Premier currently in Asia encouraging businesses\/corporations to set up shop here when our local businesses, both large and small, are leaving in droves to where electricity is cheaper. Why is she wasting taxpayers dollars for her and her entourage to go to Tokyo & Korea and talk to Honda; who already have manufacturing plants here?\n*Justify the CEO of Hydro One (and others on the sunshine list) annual salary, not including benefits and perks, of $4 million when the wages of 140 people in my township don't add up to that ? How can he have an empathetic ear ?\n*Why don't you cancel all LRP contracts as they have been proven to be expensive, inefficient, an economy killer and detrimental to our precious environment and eco system and removes ag land from producing food ?\n[Original Comment ID: 204076]\n",

The LRP-1 wind projects, as well as several other projects that are not yet under construction, from previous contracting arrangements \u2013 Amherst Island, White Pines, and Fairview Wind. Also, the recent FIT 5.0 bids. Cancel them all! We do not need the energy, most of the communities do not want them, they will continue to produce energy that is out of phase with demand, and that we will need to sell at a loss. \u00a0And most of all, they will add tremendously to our electricity bills in the future. And cancel LRP-2, don\u2019t just \u201csuspend\u201d it.\nThe Ministry needs to do a comprehensive cost\/benefit analysis of the energy mix that is planned for the next LTEP. Benefits and costs to the communities where the energy is produced needs to be clearly factored in \u2013 if it\u2019s wind energy, the costs in terms of health issues for 16% of the population, cost of property devaluation and tax base deterioration as a result, cost to our natural environment, especially birds and bats, lost tourism, and somehow you need to factor in the emotional costs to communities that are driven apart by the controversial installation of wind turbines in our quiet rural setting.\nDecrease the time-of-use off peak rate, if you really want people to conserve energy. There is no incentive for people, if you just increase the on-peak and off-peak rates equally.\nIf Wind Energy is included in the LTEP, Municipal agreement MUST BE MANDATORY. And Indigenous support for the program MUST BE LOCAL. This is the worst abuse of our democratic rights that I have ever seen in Canada, where we prize our democratic rights! Return decision-making to the people where energy projects are going to be sited. Or compensate us appropriately by giving our community free electricity, and buying out our homes, when Turbines are sited within 2KM.\nSave money by discontinuing wasteful \u201cconservation\u201d programs and advertising. Stop sending shaming letters to people, comparing their energy usage to their neighbours.\nFunding of Indigenous groups to assist them to support\/create their own energy projects, while an admirable program, should come through Indigenous Affairs, not from the Energy Ministry, where the costs of such subsidies must be added to my electricity bill.\nFunding of the low-income subsidy for hydro costs, also a needed program for the growing number of citizens experiencing energy poverty, should be paid through Community and Social Services, a Ministry that is well positioned to know and support these families. The cost of this subsidy should not be paid through my hydro bill. It has nothing to do with my usage, or the energy being transmitted to me.\nStop the Sale of Hydro One! This is not the way to find money for your programs, by selling off our assets. If I did this with my own household budget\/property, I would be bankrupt in no time. The privatization of Hydro One will end up costing us more for poorer service.\nThank-you for considering my suggestions.\n[Original Comment ID: 204634]\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister Thibeault:\nThe Ontario Sustainable Energy Association (OSEA) welcomes the opportunity to submit its recommendations to the Long Term Energy Plan on behalf of its members. The following is a summary of a more detailed submission that will be submitted via the Environmental Registry by December 16, 2016.\nAs part of our pre-consultation, the OSEA conducted a survey of its membership to identify the key areas of consideration for the next long-term energy plan (LTEP). These have already been submitted as part of our pre-consultation submission in June 2016. The following key messages have been identified by our membership:\n1.Any future Long-term Energy Plan should be based on a publicly available, transparent, and full lifetime feasibility and cost analysis of the most sustainable technology and policy options. 2.Define clear, ambitious energy conservation and GHG emission reduction targets in the LTEP for all economic sectors and government agencies in line with Canada\u2019s commitment to the Paris Agreement.\n3.Improve stability and predictability of renewable energy procurement programs for all participants.\n4.Design the regulatory process to support and simplify the economic participation of the communities hosting the projects.\n5.Change building code to include mandatory and ambitious energy efficiency standards for new buildings.\nOSEA\u2019s Vision\nOSEA\u2019s vision is of a prosperous Ontario with a thriving sustainable energy sector, good jobs, resilient communities and healthy environments powered, heated, cooled and moved by portfolios of sustainable energy. We are championing the transition to a low-carbon, decentralized, integrated, and inclusive energy system that is built on portfolios of sustainable technologies to meet our heating, cooling, electricity, and transportation needs.\nOSEA\u2019s main concerns with the current planning approach taken\n1.Current approach: \u00a0Assume continued centralized energy delivery model\nRecommendation: Communities are the key element to the solution.\nOur communities hold the keys to the development of a low-carbon energy system that also supports local economic development. Communities should be mandated and supported to develop sustainable community energy plans. The goal should be to move towards regional and community energy self-sufficiency. This can be achieved through microgrids, based on integrated district energy systems, residential solar PV, cogeneration, community-owned bioenergy, geothermal, and water power as well as community wind farms where economically feasible and socially acceptable.\n2.Current approach: \u00a0Top-down, centralized planning process\nRecommendation: Taking a bottom-up and integrated approach to energy planning.\nThe ministry\u2019s approach seems to be built on the assumption that Ontario will continue to only fill temporary gaps in its supply with distributed generation and that the bulk electricity system will continue to provide baseload electricity to the system. It therefore takes on a top-down planning approach. This justifies the omission of a comprehensive analysis of the actual potential for distributed electrical and thermal renewable energy generation but is contrary to observable trends, globally and also within the province itself.\nOnly a comprehensive analysis of the potential for a distributed system (or a bottom-up approach) will allow energy system planners to fully understand the aggregated effects that increasing privately-owned, distributed generation, energy conservation, storage, and community energy self-sufficiency will have on the future distribution and transmission systems.\n3.Current approach: \u00a0Alternative energy sources de-emphasized\nRecommendation: Bioenergy \u2013 the untapped asset\nBioenergy is largely ignored in all planning documents, yet there is great potential for it across Ontario. Many Bioenergy technologies are very mature and range from landfill- and sewer-gas to anaerobic digestion of agricultural and food waste, to biomass combustion, all of which can be operated as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, thereby providing maximum efficiency and flexibility to meet local peak demands for heat and electricity. Renewable natural gas is the important linkage between the currently separately owned, controlled and operated electrical, thermal, and transportation systems. Bioenergy technologies and process are also crucial to the future of commercial transportation and heavy trucking, one of the greatest sources of Ontario\u2019s GHG emissions.\n4.Current approach: \u00a0communities develop local energy plans in isolation from central planning Recommendation: Encourage integrated community energy planning and avoid the risk of stranded assets and resulting high electricity rates\nMany communities are concerned about the high cost of energy, being able to provide their communities with reliable supply of energy, even when faced with extreme weather events, and with providing their citizens with a vital economy, in which to live and to conduct business. And many communities are starting to understand the potential of using the development of local energy assets to meet local demands \u00a0as an opportunity to meet these concerns head-on. We see more and more communities considering or already developing their own Community Energy Plans, with a growing desire to become energy-independent and the transmission grid becoming a source of back-up support to the local system. If this trend results in the development of energy islands and micro-girds, the need for centralized electricity supply will decrease to a point where extensive, unchecked investments into the continuation with the bulk electricity system will result in stranded assets and high electricity rates.\nOSEA further recommends:\n5.International trends and technological breakthroughs are showing us the way.\nProgressive jurisdictions around the world are transitioning to more resilient, efficient, and diversified renewable energy-based systems. These systems are built on distributed generation and are moving away from baseload and bulk supply designs to smart, digitalized, and highly adaptable distributed generation infrastructure.\n6.We need to understand the alternative.\nMuch research and planning has gone into the whether and how to continue with existing assets of the bulk electricity system. While the alternative of a decentralized, modular built-out based on locally-sourced, -owned, and \u2013operated resources has not been studied in-depth and the benefits are not fully understood or appreciated.\nIt is important that the future of our energy system is based on evidence. Any analysis of options should take into account the full cost and benefits to all people of Ontario\nIn conclusion, we thank the Ministry for allowing us to provide input into the long-term energy planning process. As this process evolves, we would like to support the Ministry\u2019s efforts to study the potential for a low-carbon, decentralized, integrated, and inclusive energy system. In this regards, OSEA has started to work on this through our Combined Energy Options Ontario project, an early presentation and executive summary have already been submitted to the Ministry. Our consortium of academic partners, community, and industry leaders would welcome the opportunity to work closely with you on this project to help future long-term energy system development efforts. Sincerely,\nNicole Risse\nExecutive Director\n[Original Comment ID: 204690]\n",

GRID20\/20's SGF project has been publicly considered a 'Success Story' by the Ontario Ministry of Energy.\nAccording to the 2015 Ontario Energy Board's (i.e., OEB) LDC data, all distribution providers collectively experienced losses equating to 4,639,679,517 kilo Watt hours (i.e., 4.64 Billion kWh, or 4.6 Tera Watt Hours). \u00a0At an average cost of $0.1117 per kWh in Ontario, these distribution grid losses exceeded $518 Million in 2015 alone. \u00a0 \u00a0Given Ontario's endpoint meter count of 5,054,739 (2015 OEB data), these losses equated to $102.53 per every rate payer in the Province. \u00a0In other words, every rate payer in Ontario 'subsidized' the 2015 distribution losses by each paying on average $102.53 above and beyond their own personal power consumption; just to offset the distribution losses in 2015. \u00a0 Thus, we can conclude that Ontario's rate payers are subsidizing over $518 Million annually for un-metered losses occurring throughout the Province\u2019s distribution grids.\nCurrently, LDCs are permitted to experience up to 5.0% losses without being required to exercise reductions. \u00a0According to 2015 OEB data, LDCs collectively experienced \"ONLY\" 3.72% losses --- thus being below the required losses limit of 5.0%. \u00a0 But, \"ONLY\" 3.72% losses equated to over one-half a Billion dollars (i.e., over $518 Million) just in one year (i.e., 2015). \u00a0This type of loss level, and the seriously negative financial burden upon Ontarians occurs annually due to ongoing losses within the distribution grids, thus making this matter a serious topic requiring direct attention.\nGiven the Ministry of Energy's vetting of GRID20\/20, and the public comment by an Ontario LDC supporting the GRID20\/20 intra-grid sensor solution, we propose that the adoption of intra-grid sensors become mandated in Ontario to help remedy a substantial portion of the significant annual losses occurring within Ontario's grids. \u00a0The cost-effective technology now exists to address unmetered losses so that rate payers are less burdened by their hydro bills.\nPresently, GRID20\/20 projects a potential savings of nearly half of the annual distribution losses in Ontario via a full deployment of intra-gird sensors throughout the Province. \u00a0 \u00a0 The anticipated ROI associated with an intra-grid sensor deployment will be approximately 5 years, depending upon how rapidly and aggressively LDCs deploy such devices.\nIn essence, based upon the 2015 OEB data, GRID20\/20 projects losses reductions\/losses prevention of approximately $250 Million - $300 Million per year within the Province's grids, which also equates to nearly 2.5 Billion kWh being reduced annually for Conservation purposes.\nAs can be more thoroughly explained in person, GRID20\/20 can assist the Ontario Ministry of Energy to bend down the rate curve by approximately $56 or more per every rate payer, annually; and, GRID20\/20 can substantially assist the Ministry's Conservation First program to shave up to 2.5 Tera Watt Hours annually from within the Province via line losses\/waste reduction from within the distribution space.\nIn addition to the anticipated identification of un-metered line losses within the LDCs distribution grids, and the indicated Tera Watt Hour reductions, the versatile GRID20\/20 intra-grid sensor solution will simultaneously help to:\na) reduce power outages,\nb) reduce LDC operating expenses,\nc) ready the grids for emerging Distributed Energy Resources\/Distributed Generation impacts,\nd) help to improve AMI data value,\ne) assist with Conservation Voltage Reduction,\nf) reduce technical losses, and\ng) ready the grid for Electric Vehicle impacts.\nBecause GRID20\/20 manufactures its hardware within Ontario, the Province will gain not just in financial and conservation-related distribution grid savings, but also will experience increased jobs, and increased HST revenue to further benefit the Province.\nThe GRID20\/20 Distribution Transformer intra-grid sensor solution will comprehensively drive significant energy efficiency benefits and cost reductions within Ontario, complements of the Ontario Ministry of Energy\u2019s foresight in 2014 to fund a meaningful Smart Grid Fund project designed to create powerful savings in Ontario, and throughout the world.\n[Original Comment ID: 204705]\n",

        "comment":"Dependence on high carbon, fossil fuels for our energy needs is now not only ecologically unsound and a threat to our survival on this planet, it is also increasingly economically unsound with a declining rate of return for investment. The single minded and reckless harnessing of our country's economy to resource extraction and in particular the export of oil resources, is what has cost the Ontario economy so dearly, especially in our manufacturing sector.\nIt is therefore time for the Province of Ontario to determine its own future and to strike out to free ourselves from this dependence, and to establish itself as a leader in the new energy future. A plan to develop a new economy based on 100% renewable energy, and free from dependence on dirty energy, is achievable and will lead us to a more prosperous and a more sustainable economy. It will also provide us with a cleaner and healthier place to live.\nIt has long been recognized that an economy based on renewable energy and on energy conservation as well as passive technologies, can produce more well paying jobs and greater benefits without as much pollution and environmental degradation, than can the status quo.\nFossil fuels are no longer tenable or economic. Clean energy and green economies are the way of the future. We need to start now to rebuild our economy and our society if we are to enjoy a sustainable future, or any future at all.\n[Original Comment ID: 204712]\n",

        "comment":"The province should substantially increase the percent of renewable energy generation and reduce the nuclear contribution. Wind is the best choice. There are no health consequences as we know from Health Canada and other sources.The government should look at offshore wind which likely would be very cost competitive with a higher price on carbon. The recent decision to not make further large renewable energy purchases was done strictly for pathetic political reasons,saving consumers a pittance. That was a sad day. Nuclear projects all are associated with substantial cost over runs ( world wide examples of this are to be found) and there is the waste storage issue. Safety is a major issue both in terms of generation and waste storage. To provide increased base load capacity, import hydroelectricity from Quebec not gas plants or nuclear. The province must do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Ontario price on carbon is much too low to change societal behaviour or to improve the price competitiveness of renewables. There is a push for more electric vehicles which is a great decision. Hydrogen fuel cell technology as demonstrated by the Toyota Mirai should be encouraged. This would reduce the strain on the grid. It is excellent and safe technology. The province should equally support all vehicle technologies that substantially reduce emissions and not just support EV. Hydrogen can also act as a storage form for renewable energy.The province should be a leader in supporting industry, research and innovation that improve energy efficiency, storage technology and producers of goods that will move the world into a low carbon future. The energy efficiency of energy consuming goods sold in the province must be further strengthened. The heightened energy efficiency \u00a0standards of buildings and net zero buildings should be \u00a0accelerated.\n[Original Comment ID: 204723]\n",

Despite this, the government\u2019s past energy plans have made no requirement for nuclear projects to undergo public review against alternatives. This needs to change , and now instead of someday or later.\nOntario\u2019s next energy plan needs to guarantee there are a full and fair comparisons of the total costs of nuclear with alternatives and an opportunity for the public to be consulted about which approach they prefer.\nClose Pickering\nOntario\u2019s 2013 energy plan committed to close the Pickering nuclear station between 2017 and 2020, but earlier this year the government announced they would break their promise and keep operating Pickering until 2024.\nAlmost all of Pickering\u2019s output is surplus and exported to Michigan at a loss.\u00a0 This is driving up energy costs.\nPickering\u2019s continued operation also puts the public in serious danger.

Pollution is caused by traffic, industry, agriculture, open dump sites and natural gas backup for wind turbines.\n\nThe use of wood and waste oil stoves in rural Ontario is increasing to save on high electricity costs, not an environmentally sound solution, but it keeps people warm.\n\nThe high price of electricity is incentive enough to save energy. Spend the $ 400 million \u201csave energy budget\u201d on enabling home solar, and energy efficient appliances. Make LDC\u2019s accept home solar with or without net metering; promote grid zero solar. See foot note.\n\nOntario has a surplus of generating capacity. Wind turbines produce most at night and in winter time when the energy is least needed. On hot summer days with low wind, electricity is needed for air conditioners. Wind turbines do not produce on hot summer days. Storing energy that is generated in the winter, for summer use, is not realistic.\n\nSolar is more in sync with demand, it\u2019s producing most on hot sunny summer days, when power is needed for air conditioners. Solar can be less intrusive small scale.\n\nThe Ontario government has made mistake after mistake, and now Glenn Tibeault wants us to believe that power sold at a loss is actually a profit. Then why is my electricity bill so high? Why don\u2019t you show the global adjustment on the bill? I bet it will show\u201d WYNNE LOWERED YOUR BILL 8% THIS MONTH\u201d (and then she adds the carbon tax, hidden in the delivery fee!)\n\nGreat idea from Glenn to introduce personalized power plans. I will happily give up the 200 AMP connections for 100 AMP, if it reduces delivery costs by half.\n\nListen to; Bonnie Lysyk, Dianne Saxe, Parker Gallant, Scot Luft, the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, they are knowledgeable and have no financial ties to wind companies. (except Dianne Saxe)\n\nElectricity prices have doubled since 2008. Electricity is unaffordable for many Ontarians.\n\nFix the broken electricity system;\n\nStop the sale of Hydro One!\n\nEnergy storage will increase electricity prices. Stop the energy storage experiment, do a cost benefit analysis first.\n\nRenegotiate the wind and solar contracts (Spain could do it, so can Ontario). Tax the wind on wind companies.\n\nStop paying for curtailed wind. Give planning power back to municipalities!\n\nBut most effective; Cancel LRP 1 and LRP 2.\n\nBert Zegers\n\n* \u201cSolar grid zero\u201d is a technology were home owners can use solar with a smaller battery pack. It is financially attractive compared to \u201coff grid\u201d systems with a large battery pack. If more energy is needed than the home solar system can produce, than power is used from the grid.\n\nSolar power is not allowed to feed into the grid. This makes solar power possible were LDC\u2019s have the grid not ready yet for net metering. When the LDC grid allows net metering, the home solar system can easily be converted to net metering.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206946]\n",

        "comment":"I would like to encourage the Ontario government to endorse a 100% renewable energy policy. I applaud the government's foresight in eliminating coal-sourced energy, and would like them to continue to be a leader in the move towards renewable energy.\nNuclear is a renewable energy. A few years ago I read the book, SuperFuel: Thorium, the Green Energy Source for the Future by Richard Martin. I am not a scientist, and I found parts of the book difficult to understand, but I persevered because I thought it was extremely important. I was astounded to learn that nuclear energy, produced using thorium instead of uranium, eliminates the risk of nuclear meltdowns, significantly reduces waste products and renders them less dangerous, and that spent uranium can be recycled and used again as a fuel source instead of having to find some way to safely store the stuff.\nSince then, I have learned that Candu reactors, which we invented, can be adapted to burn thorium as a fuel source. Why are we not doing this???!!! Our reactors are being used in China to do this. http:\/\/www.candu.com\/en\/home\/news\/mediareleases\/CanduEnergyWelcomesPositiveReviewofAFCR.aspx\nIn this article it said, \"China currently operates two CANDU reactors at the Qinshan site, and both are expected to be modified to use recycled uranium fuel in 2015.\"\nI am all for adopting any other forms of renewable energy as well, but to me, this would make the most significant difference. We have the technology, it is abundant, and it is safe. What are we waiting for? I am not sure if there is some reason this is not possible yet, but seeing as we were the inventors of these Candu reactors, I'm sure we could be the first to start adapting them to using thorium - well maybe second- I'm not sure if China already has; but this is where the government should be making investments.\nOntario\u2019s next energy plan needs to remove barriers to citizens and communities becoming energy self-sufficient. Ontario\u2019s next energy plan should empower everyone from citizens and co-ops to municipalities and First Nations to become energy producers, especially if you are going to continue with the sale of Hydro One. The price of hydro is already too high. People need the ability to create their own energy in order to safeguard themselves from price hikes, or maybe make a little profit themselves. Many small producers also make the system less likely to be subject to a major shutdown.\nWe can not afford to go backwards. We need new vision, and though we will probably make mistakes along the way, it is the leaders of new technology who benefit the most. I hope you move forward towards 100% renewable energy. The province, as well as the planet, depend upon it.\n[Original Comment ID: 206094]\n",

        "comment":"Andrea Pastori\n\nCabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator\n\nMinistry of Energy\n\nStrategic, Network and Agency Policy Division\n\nStrategic Policy and Analytics Branch\n\n77 Grenville Street\n\nFloor 6th\n\nToronto Ontario\n\nM7A 2C1\n\nPhone: (416) 327-7276\n\nThursday December 15th, 2016\n\nThe following comments are submitted on behalf of Sinopa Energy Inc.\n\nDistribution and Grid Modernization\n\nWhat are the significant challenges facing utilities and what can government do to meet them?\n\n1.The legacy grid inadequacies increase for meeting the evolving energy needs in Ontario.\u00a0 - The viability of the century old, legacy bulk power grid has been declining, and will continue at an accelerating rate. The bulk power grid is wearing out, where depreciation exceeds new investment. New investment is not keeping up with grid deterioration because:\n\na.Legislative and regulatory barriers based upon environmental and sustainability concerns constrain, even prevent, the siting, construction and operation of new grid facilities,\n\nb.The cost of new generation, transmission and distribution plant is increasing and any\n\nsignificant new construction means higher rates to consumers in the increasing competitive environment, and\n\nc.Utilities face significant risk of not recovering all their costs, or an adequate return, for\n\nnew infrastructure investment,\n\nd.Climate issues further threaten grid adequacy.\u00a0 Aside from the disputed linkage of climate\n\nchange and utilities\u2019 carbon-based fuels usage; the number, duration and severity of weather events have had steady growth.\u00a0 The adverse effect on grid reliability is undeniable, even if the ultimate causes may be disputed,\n\ne.Distribution system failures cause more customer service outages than bulk power grid failures. The declining adequacy of the bulk power grid makes this worse, but perfect bulk power grid reliability does not result in perfect distribution grid reliability. Increased distribution grid reliability required, as it will be essential in the digital future.\n\n2.Growing competition with the legacy grid \u2013 Electricity costs are increasing, reliability decreases, and sustainability is becoming a more important issue.\u00a0 All this issues together drives the customers to seek alternatives to legacy grid service.\u00a0 Electric utilities help sensitize customers to their energy usage and alternatives with program such as demand response and critical peak pricing.\u00a0 Originally these programs were intended to change customers\u2019 behaviors to prolong the viability of the grid. However, customers have not truly been motivated to change their behavior to help their electric utility remain viable. Instead, they have greater interest in the more convenient, and effective ways towards obtaining, managing, and using electric energy for their own life, business, and financial objectives.\n\nThere is a limit of convenience that customers are willing to concede for demand reduction.\u00a0 A balance between convenience and demand reduction is key during times when customers want to use electricity the most. Customers tend to reduce their consumption during times that utilities want energy purchasing.\n\nCustomers are finding other alternatives on their side of the meter, notably distributed generation: conventional backup generators, rooftop solar arrays, combined heat and power facilities, including microgrids. The ways that customers utilize and manage their electric energy is changing with the advent of electric vehicles, battery storage, smart homes \/ buildings, etc.\n\nOntario should consider allowing customers to shop for, and purchase, energy in competitive retail markets.\u00a0 Enabling customers to purchase and sell electric energy in transactive energy markets.\n\n3.Distributed generation, storage and management \u2013 Large electricity generators are centrally dispatched for delivering power over transmission lines to load centers and distributed through electric utilities meters to customers.\u00a0 This centralized, one-way model is being turned on its head by distributed generation, storage and management.\n\nThe penetration of distributed energy is growing, and the policies and procedures from the electric utilities to the Ontario Energy Board need to catch up, allowing distributed energy to show its true benefits.\u00a0 Provincial wide standard interconnections from delta Y grounding of appliances to meter grounding issues vary between electric utilities.\u00a0 This need to become a provincial standard to allow for simple distribution grid interconnections to take place.\n\n4.New disruptive enabling technologies - A rapidly growing array of new energy, electronics, information, and telecommunications technology devices and applications are entering the market. Their cost to performance is steadily increasing, meaning their prices steadily drop while the value steadily rises. This hastens the obsolescence of traditional generation, transmission, distribution, sales, management and utilization of electricity. Each has reached their peak in value while steadily rising in cost.\n\nNew technologies are doing more than revolutionizing the grid from the edges inward. They make it possible to meet the existing challenges, and new opportunities they afford. Utilities must stay abreast of what they are, what they do, and how they can be best utilized to plan, operate, and manage their increasingly complex and challenging business.\n\n5.Change & complexity - The relatively simple, vertically-integrated, centrally monitored, and controlled monopoly paradigm is on its way out. In its place a new decentralized model is emerging, involving a greater number of components. Systems will be owned and operated independently by customers for their own benefit. They will be small, intermittent, and surely random. These system\u2019s primary operation will not be maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the legacy grid.\n\nConsider the growing number of electric vehicles, which represent roaming energy consumption, each with comparable demand of a residence. Combined with smart technologies, (fridge, stove, thermostats) this will fractionalize the Ontario electric energy business that opposes today\u2019s Ontario central monitoring and control grid. Ontario electric utilities need to consider new methods of retrieving, analyzing and operating electric distribution systems in the presence of probabilistic, rather than deterministic, variables. More independent moving parts will require a true smart distribution grid, not labelled \u201csmart\u201d meters and time of use pricing schemes.\u00a0 The new grid will be real-time, requiring greater bandwidth in comparison to today\u2019s grid.\u00a0 Real-time data must be instantaneously retrieved, analyzed and acted upon.\n\n6.Cost & revenue - Costs of generation, transmission and distribution are all increasing, therefore the costs of doing business is increasing.\u00a0 Meanwhile the electric utility revenues are decreasing because of conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation and competition. The typical reaction for the electric utility would be to raise rates, ensuring recovery of costs, and incentivizing customers to find alternatives.\u00a0 Cost cutting measures are taken either by reducing staff or maintenance practices, both increasing degradation of equipment.\n\nTraditional cost of service and rate design approaches are no longer sufficient. The objective cannot be ensuring cost recovery with a reasonable profit. No other business benefits from this type of assurance. They must provide products and services at a price consistent with the value that customers perceive in comparison to competing offerings. Occasionally that price will be will above cost, and occasionally below. Electric utilities should be required to sell products and services based on what the customers will pay, as with normal competitive markets. Meanwhile, through best business practices, improve on maintaining financial viability of the enterprise.\n\n7.Telecommunications - The profusion and complexity of the new grid will require the monitoring, analysis and automation of distribution lines and devices and of the new grid components. It will not be possible to accomplish this through closed proprietary silos of devices, communications systems, databases, and applications. The new grid will require complex integration and enhanced operability. Every device, application, and communications channel must interoperate effortlessly with each other. An open network design needs to be set as the new grid\u2019s standard.\n\n8.Workforce - The workforce challenge is threefold. First, the longtime stability of the electric utility industry has enabled longevity of employment unparalleled in most other businesses. Thus, utilities find themselves with an aging workforce that has begun to rapidly dissipate. The retiring workers carry decades of institutional knowledge and expertise. This leaves utilities with the challenge of reaching, recruiting, training, and retaining new employees.\n\nConcurrently, as described above, utilities need new expertise and experience to deal with new complexities and components of the grid. This means new types of employees, increasing information and communication technology capabilities than ever before.\n\nA new work force is emerging. It is essential to rethink the recruitment and management of electrical utility staff. \u00a0 Finally, with the scope and depth of change that the industry faces, the industry greatly needs their new reasoning, skills, and methods.\n\nWhat are the most important benefits of a modern grid?\u00a0 Increased reliability? Greater information on your energy usage?\n\nThe modern grid has many benefits.\u00a0 Firstly, it overhauls aging equipment.\u00a0 The current electrical system is decades old and dependent upon equipment approaching the end of its usable life. Smart grid approach will update this infrastructure, ensuring that safety standards continue, power is delivered, and the system is managed efficiently.\n\nThe modern grid will equip the grid to meet increasing demand, and changing usage.\u00a0 Today, people use more electronic devices, and the demand for power continues to grow. The grid system is currently strained in many areas of Ontario. Without smart grid improvements, the grid system will be unable to meet the challenges of the near future.\n\nThe modern grid has the potential to decrease the risk of brownouts, blackouts, and surges. Brownouts and power surges can leave damaged TVs, audio equipment, and computers in their wake. Smart grid applications smooth the flow of power, and when aberrations do occur, they are quickly and easily dealt with on the system.\n\nThe smart grid gives you control over your electricity bill, with the potential to lower your energy costs.\u00a0 From an end-user\u2019s perspective, it is possible to monitor and adjust your energy usage through smart meters and home energy management systems offering 24\/7 rate and usage readings. Meaning you can schedule your energy-intensive tasks to low-demand periods when energy costs are lower.\n\nFrom the electric utility perspective, when an issue occurs in the electrical system, a utility worker must drive to the location and collect data before a solution can be determined.\u00a0 The modern grid improvements can instantaneously convert system events into retrievable information, where problem solving can begin in the control room.\n\nThe current grid relies on standby generation plants to meet peak energy consumption.\u00a0 Standby generation plants sit idle for most times, with the rare exception during critical demand periods. Smart grids allow direct communication with end-user equipment, reducing consumption during peak periods, and lowering the need for costly standby power plants.\n\nA modern grid allows the implementation of electric vehicles in a shorter time frame.\u00a0 When electric car owners plug in to charge their electric vehicles, the modern grid will be ready to manage that demand.\n\nRobust modern grid systems are needed to strategically manage diverse, and geographically scattered, renewable power sources like wind farms, solar plants, and hydro stations. The modern grid will ensure this type of energy is stored safely and distributed as needed.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of the modern grid is allowing Ontario to remain competitive in a global market.\u00a0 Our electric grid once gave us a competitive advantage, and now it\u2019s causing us to fall behind. A modern grid safeguards Ontario\u2019s position at the forefront of the transition toward a clean energy future.\n\nWhat additional policies should the government consider to expand access to natural gas?\n\nThe Minister of Energy should direct the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) to develop a Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) standard for natural gas utilities operating in Ontario.\u00a0 The OEB should set a renewable standard for natural gas utilities with reasonable increases over time.\u00a0 For example; the standard starts at 2% of the specific utility supply for 2017. Incrementing by 2% for the next 10 years, reaching a 20% goal by the year 2027.\u00a0 This approach would provide the predictability and certainty that is required for participants in a new RNG market.\u00a0 In addition, the OEB should set a standard 20-year contract term for the RNG contracts.\u00a0 This will provide certainty for lenders and investors, promoting such projects and supporting their development.\n\nThe Minister of Energy should develop a program like the IESO FIT program for industrial end-users that could create RNG from existing processes, for self-consumption or injection into a natural gas utility in proximity of the facility.\n\nMicrogrids\n\nWhat are the best uses of microgrids in Ontario?\n\nMicrogrids are localized grids that can disconnect from the traditional grid and operate autonomously. Microgrids can operate while the main grid is down, can strengthen grid resilience, help mitigate grid disturbances, and function as a grid resource for faster system response and recovery.\n\nMicrogrids support a flexible and efficient electric grid by enabling the integration of growing deployments for distributed energy resources like solar and wind. Additionally, using local sources of energy to serve local loads help reduce energy loss in transmission and distribution, increasing efficiency of the electric delivery system.\n\nPreparing for growth in Ontario\u2019s electricity usage, microgrids are a favorable compliment to the centralized grid\u2019s legacy equipment. There would be no reason to preclude the possibility of various microgrids coexisting within a given Independent System Operators (ISO) grid. Various designs might be appropriate for different requirements and opportunities. Depending on the design of the microgrid, it can provide various benefits, such as:\n\nStability - The control approaches based on appropriate droop in frequency and voltage at the terminals of each of the devices in a microgrid can allow the entire network to operate in a stable manner during nominal operating conditions and during transient events.\n\nCompatibility - Microgrids compliment and participate as a functional unit within the existing centralized legacy grid, where expansion has inhibited. This combination ensures no stranded assets, and utilizing resources to their design capacity for their planned lifetime.\n\nFlexibility - The rate of expansion and growth of microgrids does not need precise forecasting. Adding devices as the need arises and presuming they are compatible with operating protocols, with neighboring microgrid(s), or with the \u201cgrid\u201d, as appropriate. Microgrids should be technology neutral and accommodate diverse sources such as solar, wind, conventional fossil fuel, storage devices, and end-use equipment.\n\nScalability - Expanding existing microgrids, or establishing new microgrids, will meet future growth needs.\u00a0 This allows for many small devices to operate together in a parallel and modular manner and scale to higher power levels.\u00a0 Typically, installing smaller devices need less permitting and shorter lead time.\n\nEfficiency - Energy management layers can be accommodated within the framework to allow for concerns such as operating efficiency, environmental emissions, heat harvest, etc., to be optimized in a systematic manner.\n\nEconomics - The droop control technique allows for behavioral properties in response to costs, and market signals can be programmed into the operating protocol of the microgrid. The technical conceptualization does not dictate any particular pricing, market, or settlement mechanism within the microgrid, or in the transactions with the \u201cgrid\u201d.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Model - This paradigm requires adopting a true peer-to-peer model for operation and control of the microgrid and its interactive energy transactions with the centralized utility grid. The conceptualization does not dictate the size, scale, number of peers, or the growth rate.\n\nAre there any barriers preventing the use of microgrids?\n\nStandby Charges - A common contentious issue concerns standby charges. Typically, levying these on any installed on-site generation of a connected customer, where generation is for more than emergency use. Logically, standby charges assert that infrastructure must be in place to serve the site\u2019s load in the event of its self-generating capacity being unavailable, and the site should pay this cost. This would occur if the on-site capabilities have shut down; e.g., for maintenance, because economics dictate, or because of equipment failure. With such a circumstance, the \u201cgrid\u201d will serve the site\u2019s full load, and one can argue that the cost of establishing and maintaining capacity for this purpose must fall on the site. Generator and utility debates over such charges in Ontario has been acrimonious. If capital expenditure collection occurred in volumetric charges for electricity sales, truthfully, a self-generator will avoid the burden of these costs. On the other hand, using these facilities by the site might be rare, which case they are serving other customers at that time.\u00a0 Consideration of utility costs deemed close enough to the customer, and only usable to serve the customer, should be charged in one demand charge. More versatile assets further away are available on a contract basis to the customer. Note that this problem could be eliminated if charging customers an energy-only real-time electricity market price. In this case, including the high capital cost recovery required for peak time deliveries in the price of electricity. If the microgrid purchased during such times, e.g., in the event of equipment failure, would it be responsible for significant capital cost recovery, and there would be a clear, strong incentive for it to avoid such costly purchases. Further, creating correct incentives would be for equipment sizing and operation.\n\nInterconnection - One of the most contentious issues that will arise for microgrids is interconnection. Absent clear provincial standard rules, utilities can discourage interconnection for generation they do not control. The regulatory environment makes this probable, if, for example, lost revenues directly affect the utility\u2019s bottom line. Ontario must implement interconnection rules that dramatically lower this barrier and its associated costs. For example, Ontario could follow California and implement \u201cRule 21\u201d as an approach to stem the potential abuse by utilities. Adopting IEEE 1547.4 in Ontario is a prerequisite for Ontario microgrid development.\n\nTransmission\n\nHow can Ontario continue to strengthen reliability of the transmission system in all regions of the province?\n\nMaintenance and installation for new transmission structures is an area for improvement.\u00a0 Adopting new developing transmission technologies with a focus on lowering installation costs, maintenance costs, environment foot print, visual pollution, and an overall increased lifetime for structures and equipment.\u00a0 Additionally, with Ontario\u2019s climate, ensuring due diligence with preventative maintenance will save costs in the long term.\n\nThe interconnection between nodes is restricting assistance with load during peak hours.\u00a0 This congestion is causing greater wear on the equipment than necessary.\u00a0 Implementing a microgrid strategy can reduce congestion during peak hours.\u00a0 The smaller scale distribution grids will pull congestion away from the main grid.\n\nMoving forward with smart grid development and deployments is Ontario\u2019s best approach to strengthen transmission system reliability in all regions.\u00a0 Transforming the provinces current electric grid into a more intelligent, \u201csmart\u201d system involves deploying numerous advanced technologies that address areas such as outage management, voltage optimization and demand response to improve reliability, resiliency and security of the grid.\u00a0 While modernizing, the provincial grid is a complex task that will take years to complete.\n\nWhile the increased digitization of a smarter grid brings numerous benefits, it introduces additional risks from cyber-attacks. Security for the provinces electric grid is of critical importance. Developing a rigorous, comprehensive cybersecurity approach for all the \u201cSmart Grid\u201d projects is required.\n\nIs the current \u201cuser pay\u201d model an effective way to meet Ontario\u2019s needs? Does it appropriately balance the goals of economic development and protecting taxpayers?\n\nRetail rate design must reflect the structure of wholesale power costs.\u00a0 Even in the post-transition period, utilities will likely still be required to offer tariffs for customers who choose not to switch to alternative suppliers, such as competitive power marketers. Given the highly-differentiated nature of wholesale power costs, retail rate design and cost recovery mechanisms must reflect the nature of how these costs are incurred by the utility in the competitive wholesale marketplace.\u00a0 This synchronization of wholesale and retail rate design should also address the potential over\/under revenue recovery operating risk that distribution utilities with continuing energy service obligations face because of wholesale market price volatility.\n\nUsage-based volumetric rates should not be overemphasized.\u00a0 Current rate designs, which usually overemphasize usage-based volumetric rates, will tend to encourage uneconomic bypass because customers can avoid paying their appropriate share of a utility\u2019s fixed costs for distribution by using alternative sources of power or using less energy.\u00a0 This could cause an increased burden on the remaining utility customers. Volumetric rates create artificial incentives to bypass the local distribution system, especially if the customer can return to regulated service at will.\n\nUtility rates must reflect both the utility\u2019s economic costs and demand-related considerations. Cost and demand-responsive rate designs, such as time-of-day rates, seasonal rates, or even real time rates (possibly offered to end users by intermediaries providing hedges against volatility) would be ways to accomplish this.\u00a0 In addition, demand response programs that result in voluntary load reductions at peak periods can be used at the utility level to improve the functioning of wholesale markets.\n\nRetail tariff rates should contain separate demand, energy, and customer charges.\u00a0 Larger commercial and industrial customers can be priced using separate demand, energy, and customer charges.\u00a0 Use of this rate design with smaller residential and commercial customers is more difficult given the cost of new metering and meter reading expenses.\u00a0 As the costs of metering and related technologies fall, more rate structure options will be possible.\u00a0 The real challenge over the longer term, however, will be political acceptability.\n\nTo the greatest extent possible, customer or demand-related fixed costs should not be rolled into energy charges.\u00a0 The end-use customer often sees too high a price for energy and too low a price for demand and customer charges.\u00a0 Hence, the customer never receives the economically efficient price signal for either one.\u00a0 Moreover, where fixed distribution costs are recovered through usage-sensitive rates, distribution utility cost recovery may be threatened by changes in prices and usage.\n\nTime-of-use, interruptible, and seasonal rates are preferred rate designs.\u00a0 For larger commercial and industrial customers, these rate designs are an important way to improve demand response and thereby increase the efficiency of power supply procurement by the utility or other provider.\u00a0 As metering costs decrease over time, these rate options can be extended to other classes.\n\nCustomer education relating to the need for rate restructuring must be given a high priority. Customers must be informed about the rationale for rate design changes.\n\nWill Ontario\u2019s pipeline principles protect the best interests of Ontarians and allow for informed participation in the National Energy Board\u2019s review of the Energy East project? What considerations should be taken into account?\n\nOntario should consider including the following principles to protect the best interests of Ontario:\n\n1.Successful completion of the environmental review process.;\n\n2.The pipeline(s) must provide a world-leading practices for environmentally sensitive land spill response, prevention and recovery systems to manage and mitigate the risks and costs of pipelines;\n\n3.World-leading practices for land\/stream and water spill prevention, response and recovery\n\nsystems to manage and mitigate the risks and costs of pipelines;\n\n4.Addressing legal requirements regarding aboriginal and treaty rights, and providing First\n\nNations with the opportunities, information and resources necessary to participate in, and benefit from, a heavy oil project where the project crosses treaty lands; and,\n\n5.Ontario receives a fair share of fiscal and economic benefits for proposed pipeline projects\n\nthat reflects the level, degree and nature of risk borne by the province, the environment, and citizens.\n\nStorage\n\nWould you be willing to participate in a program where your utility could use your home storage device from time to time to operate a more reliable electricity distribution system?\n\nThe simply answer would be it depends.\u00a0 It would depend on the requirements, capital investment, rates, and risk ownership for technology failures such as premature battery failure.\u00a0 The service provider needs to replace the unit, remove the old unit, and maintain connections, at no cost, if a battery has a premature failure. If the customer bared no risk in participating and is not impacted by such factors as increased insurance for their house, or building ventilation systems etc., the option is beneficial.\n\nWhat role do you foresee for natural gas to supplement and complement the province\u2019s existing electricity storage options?\n\nNatural gas will play a significant role as a transitional fuel for Ontario to effectively, and efficiently, reach a sustainable energy market.\u00a0 Natural gas employed as a cost efficient transitional fuel will allow Ontario to effectively progress to a sustainable energy market earlier than without its inclusion in the solution.\u00a0 Natural gas operates on a daily market, while electricity in Ontario operates on an hourly, or 5-minute clearing price.\u00a0 Therefore, this is an opportunity to leverage natural gas to supplement electricity storage which will benefit Ontario. In applications, such as microgrid, combined heat and power plants can operate at times of high electricity demand.\u00a0 At times where the grid can provide the required energy, the combined heat and power plants are switched off.\u00a0 A futuristic approach would be to use electricity in times of low demands to create hydrogen and inject it into the natural gas system, within appropriate quality limits and extract fuel mixture to fire a peaking plant or other energy generating device at appropriate times.\u00a0 This approach provides an effective solution to electricity storage while greening the natural gas in the distribution system.\n\nHow can Ontario further support innovative energy storage technologies that leverage our existing natural gas infrastructure assets and take advantage of our clean electricity system?\n\nOntario can support both research and project capital funding for embedding innovative natural gas \u201cgreening\u201d technologies in an electrical distribution system, and near demand.\u00a0 Cleaning or greening natural gas will be costly; therefore, Ontario needs to take a long-term approach to greening the natural gas system.\u00a0 This is possible with supporting the electrical system through the provisions of 20-year Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) supply contracts at a premium rate.\u00a0 This encourages the development of RNG that can be used in electrical peaking solutions, which keeps Ontario clean and green.\n\nInnovative and Economic Growth\n\nWhich innovations offer the greatest benefit to your community and the energy system as a whole?\n\nThe smart grid combined with Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) offers the best benefit to the system. The smart grid allows for the control of energy usage and cost, while RNG allows for the use of existing natural gas infrastructure and appliances.\u00a0 The combination of the two will allow Ontario to remain competitive in the global market.\n\nHow should the public and private sectors cooperate to encourage innovation in the energy section?\n\nA reduction of red tape, regulations and processes to allow private sectors access to energy systems needs to occur.\u00a0 Barriers to innovation exist from current regulation models, used for both electricity and natural gas utilities, that do not promote cooperation for innovation.\u00a0 Removal of such barriers will be one key step needed.\n\nWhat actions could the government take to support the adoption of alternative fuels?\n\nThe Ontario government could increase the ethical fuel additive level in gasoline from the current 10% to a higher level such as 15% or 20%.\n\nFor microgeneration technologies, the government could offer home owners or small business a tax credit for the purchase and installation of specified alternative fuel technologies.\n\nRegarding alternative fuels such as Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), the government could direct the Ontario Energy Board to make a renewable standard for natural gas utilities.\u00a0 For example, natural gas utilities must purchase a percentage of Ontario created RNG supply.\n\nThe government could offer a Feed-in Tariff like contract for industrial companies that could create RNG, thereby displacing their own load or sell to the natural gas utility.\n\nPromotion and research into how Ontario can leverage its forestry and create RNG to displace natural gas.\n\nConservation and Energy Efficiency\n\nShould Ontario set provincial conservation targets for other fuel types such as natural gas, oil and propane?\n\nYes, conservation targets should be set for natural gas, oil and propane on an annual base.\u00a0 These could reflect a similar approach taken in Ontario with electricity conservation targets.\n\nTo meet the province\u2019s climate change objectives, how can existing or new conservation and energy efficiency programs be enhanced in the near and longer term?\n\nEnhancing Conservation and Demand Management (CDM) programs for near and long term by creating a better incentive program for specified industries. Typically, if the incentives are insufficient from a financial perspective, industry will not take the opportunity to investigate energy efficiency opportunities. This would interfere or complicate their production process or product quality.\u00a0 Once an industry participant has undertaken one or a few energy efficiency projects they are likely to do other efficiency projects.\n\nMany industries do not have time to complete the forms and submissions required to obtain funding for energy efficiency programs.\u00a0 The government could offer financial incentive for paying consultants to complete the required applications and communications, allowing a higher pick up rate on energy efficiency programs.\n\nHow can we continue to inform and engage energy consumers?\n\nThe best approach is with simplicity.\u00a0 Many residential energy consumers wish to have predicable energy prices, invoices and information.\u00a0 Segregation of invoicing items or billing items adds confusion to many consumers.\u00a0 Education on cause and effect is vital to gain a behavioral change required to reduce the cost of energy.\u00a0 Simple programs that require the involvement of local utilities with customers to simplify the process for residential and small commercial customer to undertake programs.\u00a0 Energy saving tips on the weather network when it is cool or hot can be beneficial.\u00a0 Local radio announcements can also work with the same premise.\n\nClean Energy Supply\n\nWhat role should distributed renewable energy generation play in the ongoing modernization and transformation of Ontario\u2019s electricity system?\n\nA wide variety of renewable energy generation exists in Ontario today.\u00a0 Solar and wind are the most common, however as these are non-dispatchable and they serve as a supplement to the grid.\u00a0 Battery assisted non-dispatchable renewable energy technologies can provide dispatchable benefits, but many battery technologies are environmentally unfriendly and this can put the government on the wrong side of the environment issue.\u00a0 Renewables that can be dispatchable, such as biomass or hydro, can provide both baseload or peaking supplies.\u00a0 The government needs to better develop the biomass and small hydro developments to leverage these opportunities. The end state of the modernization and transformation of Ontario\u2019s electricity system should have a 100% renewable energy generation target.\n\nNorthern remote communities experience unreliable fuel-based energy generation, specifically during the winter months.\u00a0 Developing microgrids for participating remote communities is a high priority. Reducing their fuel oil dependency for energy generation is a necessary step in modernizing Ontario\u2019s electricity system. This drives a reduction on fuel transportation and energy generation to northern communities, and alleviates rural community energy issues.\u00a0 A biomass solution would create jobs while maintaining the reliability of a baseload generator.\n\nWhat strategies should Ontario pursue to harness the potential of its nuclear sector to meet its future energy needs?\n\nNuclear is powerful and clean, but non-renewable and not a sustainable energy source.\u00a0 Ontario\u2019s projected expenditures on refurbishing units in both nuclear plants, Darlington and Bruce, needs to consider from a life cycle approach.\u00a0 Ontario needs research funding to find solutions for nuclear product waste, be it renewable\/reusable waste, or a significant reduction in waste. This search should not be in perpetuity, but given a realistic finite timeframe, to find a solution to its waste issue.\n\nWhat factors should Ontario focus on as it pursues opportunities for electricity trade agreements with nearby provinces and states?\n\nOntario needs an energy policy, not electricity policy.\u00a0 Consideration on solving the electric issues may be alternative fuels\/energy types.\u00a0 Reduce the myopia electricity and look outside of electricity to solve some of the issues.\n\nSeveral key elements for focus on agreements with nearby provinces and states are:\n\n1.Renewable energy as primary focus\n\n2.Reliability or supportive energy both from a cost and reliability perspective\n\n3.Distance, closer to Ontario is preferable\n\n4.A buy\/sell arrangement where routing excess from Ontario through other provinces within favourable terms.\n\n5.A detailed energy policy\n\nRegional Planning\n\nIn areas expected to undergo a transformation from rural to suburban, through intense development, how could the province help to ensure that corridor lands are reserved\/set-aside before development occurs to minimize the potential costs and inconvenience of acquiring and clearing developed lands in the future?\n\nCommunity energy plans for individual towns and cities should be the primary identification of utility corridors.\u00a0 Towns and cities have regular utility coordination meetings; therefore, the utilities should communicate and discuss necessary requirements.\u00a0 The community energy plan should inform the municipalities 5-year plan that is filed with the Ontario government for approval. Ontario can now review the adjacent municipality plans to ensure a complete coordinated effort for the utilities.\n\nIn the regional planning, consideration should be given to divide the Northwest Ontario region into two regions.\u00a0 The new region is the \u201cThunder Bay\u201d region, comprising of the Thunder Bay District and carrying an estimated 145,000 population.\u00a0 The \u201cNorthwest Ontario\u201d region would consist of the remaining Kenora District, and Rainy River District \u2014 estimated at 79,000 population.\u00a0 A similar division exists between the Sudbury\/Algoma and North\/East of Sudbury regions.\n\nBy implement this approach greater data accuracy for the new Northwest Ontario region\u2019s status and interests, providing Ontario opportunity to foresee, prevent, and solve issues.\u00a0 Many of the communities in the new Northwest Ontario region would be indigenous, rural, remote and non-urban communities.\u00a0 The magnitude of including urban areas such as Thunder Bay obscures the potential options, considerations and approaches to consider for the non-urban areas.\n\nIndigenous Energy Policy\n\nWhat are the best tools to support Indigenous community engagement and leadership in Ontario\u2019s energy sector?\n\nEnsure indigenous communities have the capacity to participate in the energy sector.\u00a0 Providing resources for all levels of indigenous communities to approach for consultation.\u00a0 Providing the communities opportunity to operate electric distribution systems within their communities, if they wish, or to create their own distribution and generation companies to serve their communities.\n\nConsideration for treating indigenous and non-indigenous communities as a municipality may be beneficial in advancing community engagement.\u00a0 Similar treatment will support the communities to set structures and take benefits from the energy sector as would any municipality.\u00a0 Access to knowledge through a central certification program for indigenous communities for selecting service providers may also benefit.\n\nSupply Mix\n\nTo meet a higher demand, what mix of new electricity resources would best balance the principles of cost-effectiveness, reliability, clean energy, community engagement, and an emphasis on Conservation First?\n\nMicrogrid, microgeneration, and net zero communities would benefit as these principles are highly adaptable.\u00a0 These solutions would work in high growth urban areas where energy could be a challenge to serve the residents.\u00a0 Battery technologies are beneficial; however, the hazardous wastes and life cycle of the battery will create a non-renewable energy grid.\u00a0 Higher focus on biomass in regions where a remote communities or small rural communities can create jobs and energy would be a benefit both environmentally and economically.\n\nAdjusting the supply mix to increase biomass and biogas energy generation will reduce the ecological footprint for the long term.\u00a0 Biofuel based energy generators can be used as both baseload and mid-merit generation.\n\nThe renewable, expandable, and sustainable aspects will provide economic benefits for the communities of northern Ontario, and sustainability for economic development.\n\nWhat policies will Ontario need to adapt to a transformation in the fuels sector?\n\nOntario needs to increase renewable and sustainable fuels with a reasonable cost considered approach.\u00a0 This approach should not disadvantage industry, residents, and the environment. Implementation of a set determined evolution should be clearly set for the long term to provide clear direct to the market.\u00a0 A reasonable increase in sustainable and renewable fuels should reflect in the Ontario fuel sector.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206960]\n",

        "comment":"December 15, 2016\n\nMs. Andrea Pastori\n\nCabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator\n\nMinistry of Energy\n\nStrategic, Network and Agency Policy Division\n\nStrategic Policy and Analytics Branch\n\n77 Grenville Street, 6th Floor\n\nToronto Ontario\n\nM7A 2C1\n\nRe: EBR Registry Number 012-8840\n\nDear Ms. Pastori:\n\nOn behalf of our 42,000 small- and medium-sized member businesses in Ontario representing approximately 500,000 employees, we welcome the opportunity to comment on the government\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan.\n\nAs the province\u2019s economic engine, small- and medium-sized businesses account for 98 per cent of all Canadian businesses and employ 87.3 per cent of Ontarians.\n\nElectricity rates are a key component to keeping Ontario\u2019s businesses competitive in a global economy. High hydro costs mean small businesses have fewer resources to create jobs, invest in their businesses, and contribute to the economic growth of the province. According to CFIB\u2019s Business Barometer\u00ae, energy costs have been a top cost constraint for Ontario\u2019s small businesses over the past three years. If costs continue to increase without additional and more significant and impactful relief measures, Ontario\u2019s hiring, business investments and economic health will suffer.\n\nEliminate Time-of-Use Pricing for Small Business\n\nOntario\u2019s small business owners have been overwhelmingly unable to adjust their consumption habits based on time-of-day usage since the Smart Meter program was introduced. Small business owners are dependent on the habits of their clientele and their regular hours to survive \u2013 a pizza maker cannot be expected to fire up the ovens at 3:00 a.m. when customers come in at noon. Because of this dependency, time-of-use pricing is viewed as a tax on business hours.\n\nWe recommend the elimination of time-of-use rates for small businesses and the implementation of a tiered-rate system where the first 3,000 kWh are billed at a lower rate.\n\nAccelerate the Elimination of the Debt Retirement Charge from Commercial Bills\n\nThe Ontario government eliminated the Debt Retirement Charge from residential bills effective January 1, 2016; however, the charge remains on small business bills and isn\u2019t due to be removed until March 31, 2018. In 2011, the Auditor General noted that the Debt Retirement Charge was intended to pay off $7.8 billion in debt. In 2013, the Auditor General reported that $10.6 billion in Debt Retirement Charge fees had been collected.\n\nThe Debt Retirement Charge accounts for approximately 2-5 per cent of a small business hydro bill.\n\nWe recommend that the government accelerate the removal of the Debt Retirement Charge to no later than April 1, 2017 (i.e., at least one year sooner than planned).\n\nDevelop a Clear Plan to Eliminate the Global Adjustment Fee\n\nThe Global Adjustment fee was introduced to cover the difference in the cost of the government\u2019s contractually agreed pricing with Ontario\u2019s energy producers, and the market price of electricity. The purpose of the fee is virtually unknown among small businesses, hidden in the time-of-use rates on the majority of small business bills\n\nPer the Auditor General\u2019s 2015 report, Ontarians have paid $37 billion towards the Global Adjustment since 2006, and stand to pay another $133 billion by 2032. It accounts for up to 77 per cent of hydro usage fees on consumers\u2019 bills.\n\nThe Global Adjustment should not be accepted as a long-term or permanent fixture in Ontario\u2019s energy system. As such, we recommend that the government develop, and make public, a plan to eliminate the Global Adjustment fee from consumer bills at the earliest possible date, and regularly report on its progress towards eliminating this fee.\n\nWe believe that the government can accomplish this through a variety of measures, including: \u2022Placing a moratorium on all new energy contracts until additional supply, if any, is needed; \u2022Allowing current contracts that are well above market value to expire without renewal; \u2022Reviewing conservation programs paid with Global Adjustment fees to determine efficiencies; and \u2022Instituting a new competitive process for energy generation contracts that focuses on procuring the lowest possible energy prices for Ontarians.\n\nWe commend the government for taking the first steps in this process by suspending the next phase of renewable energy contracts, which would have generated 1,000 megawatts of energy that the province does not need. We recommend that the government reassess all planned new energy generation that has yet to be undertaken to determine whether the energy is needed, in an effort to keep system costs down.\n\nWe further recommend that the government begin the process of creating a clear plan to eliminate the Global Adjustment fee by increasing billing transparency and including the Global Adjustment fee on all bills, including Regulated Price Plan (RPP) or \u201ctime-of-use\u201d billing.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to comment on the government\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJulie Kwiecinski\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ryan Mallough\n\nDirector of Provincial Affairs, OntarioPolicy Analyst, Ontario\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206961]\n",

It is time for us to step back and take a good hard look at what we are doing and why our government continues to support the Nuclear industry. It is past time to look into providing an alternative energy that will give us safe and earth-friendly electricity at a more reasonable cost.

The first is in innovative micro-grids and household or business solar installations. I believe that if infrastructure is available, many citizens and businesses will take advantage of the savings that solar energy, and to a lesser extent, wind energy, will have to offer. More than the standard \"roads, bridges and sewers\", flexible grids are the infrastructure that the provincial government should prioritize. Along the same vein of setting up a public framework, inside of which citizens take individual action, I would like to say that a carbon fee and dividend system would be superior to the cap and trade approach to pricing carbon. The audit system and constant legislative tinkering that cap and trade requires will be a burden on the system which will negate public support. I realize that \"this train may have left the station\", but I have strong reservations about cap and trade, and I support the simplicity and transparency of a carbon fee and dividend system.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to submit my thoughts. There is no more important issue in the world at this point than the creation of\u00a0 sustainable societies, and energy is the biggest part of that. Jim O'Reilly\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206963]\n",

        "comment":"*** AN EASIER-TO-READ PDF VERSION OF THESE COMMENTS, INCLUDING FIGURES, WILL BE SUBMITTED TO LTEP@ONTARIO.CA ***\n\nSubmission to Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Energy\n\nLong-Term Energy Plan Consultations\n\nCentre for Urban Energy at Ryerson University \u2013 December 2016\n\n1Strategy for Long-Term Energy Plan\n\nThe goal of the Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP) should be to deliver sustainable energy \u2013 both electricity and natural gas \u2013 at minimal cost.\u00a0 To reach this goal, the Ministry of Energy is advised to strategically act to yield pronounced results in the short, medium, and long terms.\n\nIn the short term, costs can be contained for generation procured through market-based processes. The IESO-run energy market and planning capacity market can ensure that competitive energy rates are secured for consumers.\u00a0 This addresses the variable costs.\n\nIn the medium term, we should optimize the use of existing assets to drive down unit costs.\u00a0 This addresses the fixed costs.\u00a0 Please see section on Conservation and Energy Efficiency.\n\nIn the long term, we should accelerate the innovation process by investing in research and development (R&D) to create new low-carbon technologies that cost less and perform better than the status quo.\u00a0 Please see section on Innovation and Economic Growth.\n\nFurther, the Ministry of Energy is advised to place a greater emphasis on natural gas in the LTEP. Ontario\u2019s gas demand is the equivalent of more than 80 GW, whereas electricity is around 25 GW. Natural gas is also a much larger source of greenhouse gas emissions than electricity.\u00a0 Ontario leadership around natural gas can give it a first-mover advantage in climate change.\n\nDetails are offered below according to the sections outlined in the LTEP Discussion Guide.\n\n2Key Recommendations\n\n4Distribution and Grid Modernization\n\n4.1Update Ontario\u2019s regulatory model to: adopt new technologies; encourage utility planning with new technologies; encourage cooperation among utilities; and allow utilities to assume greater risk.\n\n5Microgrids\n\n5.1Remove regulatory barriers and promote a business model for collaborative microgrid projects.\n\n6Transmission: Electricity transmission; Pipelines\n\n6.1Bring together experts in industry and academia to assess and implement emerging technologies\n\nin Ontario\u2019s transmission system.\n\n7Storage\n\n7.1Allow utilities to fund research projects in energy storage.\n\n7.2Revise the price structure for small energy storage systems to better reflect costs and benefits.\n\n7.3Update market structure to allow energy storage to participate.\n\n8Innovation and Economic Growth\n\n8.1Issue a directive to the Ontario Energy Board to allow utilities to spend a percentage of their revenue on R&D.\u00a0 (For comparison, utilities in Brazil are required to spend 0.2 per cent of the revenue on R&D by their regulator.)\n\n8.2Provide public funding for R&D to create low-carbon technologies that cost less and perform better than the status quo\n\n9Conservation and Energy Efficiency\n\n9.1Use a combination of disincentives for consumption during very narrow peak periods and incentives for consumption during off-peak periods. This has the effect of flattening the demand curve.\n\n9.2Streamline audits for electricity, gas, and water conservation and focus on reducing\n\nconsumption during peak periods.\n\n9.3Remove regulatory barriers to conservation by: measuring and rewarding high utilization rates and penalizing low utilization rates; ensuring cost savings due to conservation are passed on to consumers; enhancing existing peak conservation programs to include benefits of reduced and deferred infrastructure; and planning for peak reduced demand.\n\n9.4Evaluate existing programs according to their ability to reduce the peak, rather than\n\nvolumetric consumption, and prioritize programs by their performance at peak reduction.\u00a0 Also, the most elastic (price-sensitive) consumers should be targeted.\u00a0 This would typically mean that programs are directed at industrial customers rather than residential.\n\n10Supply Mix\n\n10.1Promote a fleet of generation supply options instead of targeting just one.\n\n3About the Centre for Urban Energy at Ryerson University\n\nThe Centre for Urban Energy (CUE) at Ryerson University is an academic-industry partnership that finds sustainable solutions for urban energy challenges.\u00a0 The ideas presented in this submission are collected from our experts\u2019 cutting-edge research.\u00a0 Our intent is to offer non-partisan, evidence-based advice to the Ministry of Energy so that Ontarians can have affordable, reliable, and clean energy.\n\n4Distribution and Grid Modernization\n\nWhat are the significant challenges facing utilities and what can the government do to meet them? What are the most important benefits of a modern grid? Increased reliability? Greater information on your energy usage?\n\nWhat additional policies should the government consider to expand access to natural gas?\n\nA key obstacle to distribution grid modernization in Ontario is the existing regulatory model. Utilities in the province are still spending tens of millions of dollars refurbishing and upgrading distribution systems using traditional technologies and methods in the face of growing disruptive developments and uncertainty. With advancements in technology and business opportunities, cost-effective solutions to distribution system problems could be explored outside of utilities, such as by engaging customers and\/or third party aggregators.\u00a0 A forward-looking regulatory model for utilities needs to incorporate the following:\n\n\u2022Targeting and utilization of new technologies such as distributed energy resources (DERs) for the benefit of ratepayers in the province.\n\n\u2022Encouraging utilities to develop well-integrated and comprehensive distribution plans including DERs and customer.\n\n\u2022Encouraging utilities with incentives to go beyond their own boundaries to share with and benefit from the resources of other regional utilities.\n\n\u2022Allowing utilities to develop plans that take into consideration increased uncertainty and risk.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTION\n\n4.1Update Ontario\u2019s regulatory model to: adopt new technologies; encourage utility planning with new technologies; encourage cooperation among utilities; and allow utilities to assume greater risk.\n\n5Microgrids\n\nWhat are the best uses of microgrids in Ontario?\n\nAre there any barriers preventing the use of microgrids?\n\nMicrogrids improve supply reliability and help to increase the renewable energy penetration without adding an extra burden on utility grids. All these benefits are quantifiable but do not generate revenue to the microgrid developer, consumers or the utility. Therefore, microgrids should be collaborative projects. It is suggested to remove existing barriers for such collaborations and promote a business model for collaborative microgrids.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTION\n\n5.1Remove regulatory barriers and promote a business model for collaborative microgrid projects.\n\n6Transmission: Electricity transmission; Pipelines\n\nHow can Ontario continue to strengthen reliability of the transmission system in all regions of the province?\n\nA well-planned approach involving industry and academia experts is required to assess and implement emerging technologies in Ontario\u2019s transmission system and to take us to truly sustainable future. With the rising integration of renewable resources, such as wind and solar, there is the growing concern of maximum utilization of these resources (by not spilling wind or solar), grid reliability and grid balancing.\u00a0 In the same context, the need to increase power transfer capability over certain transmission lines also becomes critical. Furthermore, bringing large amounts of hydropower from Ontario\u2019s north to load centres in the GTA could also be an option for consideration, should there be load growth triggered by transportation sector (and\/or buildings\/residential sector). The past decade has seen the development and successful pilot testing of a number of new\/emerging technologies to address the needs and concerns just noted.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTION\n\n6.1Bring together experts in industry and academia to assess and implement emerging technologies\n\nin Ontario\u2019s transmission system.\n\n7Storage\n\nWould you be willing to participate in a program where your utility could use your home storage device from time to time to operate a more reliable electricity distribution system?\n\nWhat role do you foresee for natural gas to supplement and complement the province\u2019s existing electricity storage options?\n\nHow can Ontario further support innovative energy storage technologies that leverage our existing natural gas infrastructure assets and take advantage of our clean electricity system?\n\nEven without incentives, future generation capacity additions will be from intermittent resources. Large generation plants such as wind farms and small renewable energy systems such as rooftop solar PV will contribute to this intermittent electricity supply profile. Improving the operation flexibility in the grid is becoming very important in both transmission and distribution levels. Therefore, energy storage systems have a promising future as technologies which can improve grid flexibility.\n\nWhat can we do to bring energy storage without proposing another scheme of incentives? We need to mature energy storage technologies faster than their natural pace. Our recommendations are:\n\n1)Research - Manufacturers, utilities, and academic institutions are willing to collaborate on research projects. Manufacturers and academics should be encouraged to test their products and ideas within safe operation limits of the grid. Utilities should be allowed and encouraged to fund important research projects.\u00a0 Today, this funding is in jeopardy because of the regulator\u2019s approval process.\n\n2)Price Structure - Small energy storage systems will be mostly connected to the distribution\n\nlevel and will be embedded generators or loads. However, collectively, they can help to minimize the load fluctuations seen by gas plants. The current price structure does not support these small energy storage systems and does not reflect the overall benefit of them. Therefore, it is suggested to revise the price structure based on the correct costs and benefits.\n\n3)Enabling Energy Storage Market Integration - Energy storage has a unique set of characteristics. They are energy-limited dispatchable technologies. Therefore, energy storage market integration is difficult with existing market structure. Energy storage should be considered for the proposed Ontario capacity market development.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTIONS\n\n7.1Allow utilities to fund research projects in energy storage.\n\n7.2Revise the price structure for small energy storage systems to better reflect costs and benefits.\n\n7.3Update market structure to allow energy storage to participate.\n\n8Innovation and Economic Growth\n\nWhich innovations offer the greatest benefit to your community and the energy system as a whole? How should the public and private sectors cooperate to encourage innovation in the energy section? What actions could the government take to support the adoption of alternative fuels?\n\nThe ultimate goal is to develop low-carbon technologies that cost less and perform better than the status quo.\u00a0 This will have the dual effect of lowering greenhouse gas emissions and lowering energy bills, all the while maintaining performance expectations and minimizing government intervention.\u00a0 More on this idea can be found in a piece written by CUE IESO distinguished research fellow Jessie Ma, which was published in Policy Options: http:\/\/policyoptions.irpp.org\/magazines\/november-2016\/trumps-win-doesnt-have-to-be-catastrophic-for -the-climate\/\n\nThe provincial government could take action to accelerate the innovation process towards these low-carbon, mass-market technologies.\u00a0 In particular, investments in R&D by Ontario\u2019s utilities fall far below comparable jurisdictions due to regulatory barriers.\u00a0 This timidity in funding cedes any first-mover advantage that Ontario could have to others.\n\nFigure 1 shows the number of Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Industrial Research Chairs (IRCs) supported by utilities in Canada.\u00a0 Ontario wires companies support only one!\u00a0 While there could be other R&D funding outside of this, it is a good barometer of the level of support for R&D because creating an IRC is relatively straightforward and automatically comes with significant federal grant funding.\n\nFigure 1 - NSERC chairs supported utilities in Canada\n\nThe electrical utility industry is undergoing a paradigm shift where the fundamental principles on which this industry was created are gradually being challenged.\u00a0 The drivers are many: aging grid infrastructure, policies and initiatives driven by environmental concerns, changing consumer choices, third party engagement, declining revenue, and declining new technology cost, and more.\n\nBusinesses and utilities in electrical power generation, transmission and distribution have an existential interest in R&D, and they need to be R&D champions. Ontario\u2019s low R&D investment level has resulted in a sporadic \u201cshot-gun\u201d approach with lackluster results and rising electricity rates.\u00a0 R&D should instead be channeled to foster innovation and benefit ratepayers in the long-term.\n\nCertain academic institutions of higher learning in the province are well equipped with highly-skilled personnel and state-of-the-art facilities to meet this challenge.\u00a0 The need for industry-driven R&D is therefore more now than it has ever been \u2013 and this need is in many different areas: policy, regulatory, technology, etc.\n\nYet, there is very little R&D being done in Ontario for numerous reasons. Here are some of the barriers:\n\n\u2022There is no mandate for electrical utilities to invest in R&D.\n\n\u2022The current regulatory regime lacks the innovation component, does not require utilities (a) to spend a percentage of their revenue for R&D activities with appropriate checks to make sure benefits are realized or (b)\u00a0 to report and measure utilities on R&D through a KPI metric.\n\noIf the number of NSERC chairs supported by utilities in Canada is taken as a measure, the performance of Ontario\u2019s electrical transmission and distribution utilities would be lagging others.\n\n\u2022There is very limited government funding available for R&D initiatives where academia can help utilities and the ratepayers of this province to thrive.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTIONS\n\n8.1Issue a directive to the Ontario Energy Board to allow utilities to spend a percentage of their revenue on R&D.\u00a0 (For comparison, utilities in Brazil are required to spend 0.2 per cent of the revenue on R&D by their regulator.)\n\n8.2Provide public funding for R&D to create low-carbon technologies that cost less and perform better than the status quo\n\n9Conservation and Energy Efficiency\n\nShould Ontario set provincial conservation targets for other fuel types such as natural gas, oil and propane?\n\nTo meet the province\u2019s climate change objectives, how can existing or new conservation and energy efficiency programs be enhanced in the near and longer term?\n\nConservation should be treated as a means to an end \u2013 not an end in and of itself.\u00a0 We don\u2019t conserve simply for the sake of conserving; we conserve to reach other objectives.\u00a0 Therefore, we should be selective and careful in when we employ conservation, and ensure that conservation is the best option available to achieve our objectives.\n\nIf we use conservation as a tool to maximize societal benefit (see Figure 2), conservation targeted at the most elastic (price-sensitive) consumers during narrowly-defined peak periods can be used to maximize utilization of fixed assets, thereby lowering unit costs of energy and deferring capital investments.\u00a0 (This can apply equally to electricity and gas infrastructure.)\u00a0 This approach would reduce the overall capacity requirements of the system, and these savings would be realized among all users.\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Model of underlying system philosophy for electricity, gas, and water services\n\nFurther, opportunities for integration of conservation are during coincident peak times: namely, during summer for water and electricity, and during winter for gas and electricity.\n\nThrough maximizing asset utilization, multiple benefits can be achieved:\n\n\u2022Unit prices could be lowered for all consumers in a sustainable manner by reimagining our cost structure.\n\n\u2022System expansions could be deferred.\n\n\u2022Additional capacity could be freed up for new uses, such as electric vehicles on the electricity system.\n\n\u2022It adds a measure of control and certainty for including conservation and demand management in utility planning, so that costly and unnecessary overbuilding is less likely to happen in the first place.\n\n\u2022It also builds in some flexibility into the system as future supply and demand situations are highly uncertain.\n\nThis concept is used in the three \u201cboxes\u201d: Creating the Future; Managing the Present; and Selectively Forgetting the Past.\n\n\u2022In Creating the Future, a combination of disincentives for consumption during very narrow peak periods and incentives for consumption during off-peak periods has the effect of flattening the demand curve.\u00a0 This improves utilization and lowers unit costs for all consumers.\n\n\u2022In Managing the Present, conservation programs directed at large consumers of electricity, gas, and water could benefit from streamlining.\u00a0 In particular, audits of these facilities could be conducted for all three services simultaneously and administrative requirements to access incentives could be funneled together.\u00a0 Also, the structural incentives and disincentives for utilities to pursue conservation in this context should be revisited.\n\n\u2022In Selectively Forgetting the Past, utilities are advised to evaluate their existing programs according to their ability to reduce the peak, rather than volumetric consumption, and to prioritize programs by their performance at peak reduction.\u00a0 Also, the most elastic (price-sensitive) consumers should be targeted.\u00a0 This would typically mean that programs are directed at industrial customers rather than residential.\n\nThis conservation model is further described in a white paper entitled, \u201cUsing Conservation to Maximize Societal Benefit: A Refinement of the Past-Present-Future Conservation Model,\u201d by Jessie Ma and Bala Venkatesh.\n\nHow can we continue to inform and engage energy consumers?\n\nThe greatest value from conservation is derived from the most elastic (price-sensitive) consumers, and these are typically industrial consumers.\u00a0 Therefore, information and engagement efforts should be directed at them.\u00a0 These can be done in the form of customized energy audits that recommend specific conservation activities, or in generic marketing efforts for this consumer segment that sets out a high-level business case for conservation.\u00a0 Price signals can also be used to engage industrial consumers.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTIONS\n\n9.1Use a combination of disincentives for consumption during very narrow peak periods and incentives for consumption during off-peak periods has the effect of flattening the demand curve. 9.2Streamline audits for electricity, gas, and water conservation and focus on reducing\n\nconsumption during peak periods.\n\n9.3Remove regulatory barriers to conservation by: measuring and rewarding high utilization rates and penalizing low utilization rates; ensuring cost savings due to conservation are passed on to consumers; enhancing existing peak conservation programs to include benefits of reduced and deferred infrastructure; and planning for peak reduced demand.\n\n9.4Evaluate existing programs according to their ability to reduce the peak, rather than\n\nvolumetric consumption, and prioritize programs by their performance at peak reduction.\u00a0 Also, the most elastic (price-sensitive) consumers should be targeted.\u00a0 This would typically mean that programs are directed at industrial customers rather than residential.\n\n10Supply Mix\n\nTo meet a higher demand, what mix of new electricity resources would best balance the principles of cost-effectiveness, reliability, clean energy, community engagement, and an emphasis on Conservation First?\n\nWhat policies will Ontario need to adapt to a transformation in the fuels sector?\n\nThe cost of renewable energy incentives has increased considerably. Furthermore, high growth of intermittent renewable generation requires more dispatchable resources. Even without incentives, the percentage of intermittent generation is high in the overall electricity supply mix. Is there another method to bring back the balance and flexibility to the supply mix?\n\nPromoting one technology or another take the supply mix away from its natural techno-economic equilibrium. Policies of promoting a fleet of technologies are more attractive instead of targeting one generation technology. One good example is a combined policy to promote intermittent generation sources and energy storage.\n\nSuch a policy will allow the keep the supply mix in the correct equilibrium and will improve the utilization of existing gas plants.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTION\n\n10.1Promote a fleet of generation supply options instead of targeting just one.\n\n11Contact\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nJessie Ma\n\nIESO Distinguished Research Fellow\n\nCentre for Urban Energy at Ryerson University\n\nTel: 416-979-5000 x2977\n\nEmail: jessie.ma@ryerson.ca\n\nLocation:CUE-104, 147 Dalhousie Street, Toronto, ON M5B 2R2\n\nMailing Address: 350 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206966]\n",

        "comment":"December 15, 2016\n\nRe: Support communities to go 100% renewable\n\nDear Minister,\n\nI believe that Ontario must aim to be 100% powered by Renewable Energy by 2050.\n\nWhile this may seem like a long time from now. I believe that we must act now and set goals, actions and timelines to achieve such a transition in our Long Term Energy Plan.\n\nOver 9,000 signatures have been obtained to move towards 100% renewables and it continues to grow more and more with each passing day. While this may not seem like a large number, we need to seize this opportunity to further promote the transition to 100% renewable energy.\n\nCommunity-based renewables also provides a new dynamic for Ontario, allowing our fellow Ontarians to benefit from newly developed community-based renewable energy developments. This will push the community to become more involved and dedicated to this goal.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to consider and review public input into Ontario\u2019s next Long Term Energy Plan.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206964]\n",

        "comment":"Hon. Glenn Thibeault\n\nMinister Of Energy\n\n4th Floor, Hearst Block\n\n900 Bay St.\n\nToronto, Ontario\n\nM7A 2E1\n\nThe Canadian Union Of Skilled Workers (CUSW) would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister Of Energy for welcoming a submission as a stakeholder, on behalf of our members in the process of Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan Review to ensure Ontario has a clean, reliable and affordable supply of electricity across the province now and in the future.\n\nThe Canadian Union Of Skilled Workers (CUSW) was formed in 1999 with a vision of forming a truly democratic union in which all members play an active role. Today the CUSW has evolved into a modern union that is leading the way in an era of social and economic change, while ensuring the ability to respond to the ever changing work modus across Canada. In Ontario, the CUSW has approximately 2500 members creating a very large footprint in the power generation, transmission and distribution industry. CUSW is a multi-skilled union which strongly believes that \u201cpartnering\u201d with employers is the best approach to improve opportunities for those companies and their employees. CUSW supplies skilled workers to owners such as OPG, Bruce Power, Hydro One, Mississaugi Power Trust as well as contractors such as AREVA, EMC Canada, Valard Construction, Transelec Common, Surespan Power, Langley Utilities and includes a host of many other smaller sub-contractors.\n\nThe Canadian Union Of Skilled Workers (CUSW) has in the past, and will continue to support the Ontario Governments review of the Ontario Long Term Energy Plan. We believe that the comprehensive province wide consultation and engagement sessions that include stakeholders, Indigenous Communities and all interested individuals from the general public are key in the development of a plan to maintain a reliable supply of clean, affordable electricity in the province. In the development of the 2013 Long Term Energy Plan the Ontario Government spent a tremendous amount of time and money to identify a flexible energy mix to respond to the ever changing priorities of Ontarian\u2019s. The Canadian Union Of Skilled Workers believe that plan, relying on a diverse number of sources such as Nuclear, Hydro Electric, Wind, Bioenergy, Solar, and Gas provides Ontarian\u2019s with that secure and reliable supply of electricity moving forward.\n\nOne of the greatest concerns for members of the CUSW and their families, along with the strong majority of Ontarian\u2019s has always been the ever increasing cost of electricity. With a predicted energy service increase of 0.3% per year over the next 20 years. Nuclear provides low cost generation (per megawatt) which we feel is proactive in the attempt to assist Ontarian\u2019s in achieving overall lower hydro bills each month. The Canadian Union Of Skilled Workers feels that the current Long Term Energy Plan has taken a very reasonable approach to controlling electricity costs for Ontarian\u2019s, and we support the government in staying on that course of action with those recommendations. The Ontario Governments plan of having a diverse mix of energy resources available to ensure Ontarian\u2019s continue to have clean, reliable and affordable electricity is a solid foundation for the Long Term Energy Plan moving forward.\n\nAnother very important aspect to the success of the Long Term Energy Plan is the implementation of Conservation initiatives and practices. Energy conservation initiatives must be cost effective while at the same time balancing both consumer benefits as well as system benefits. Conservation programs have the ability to draw attention to, and motivate consumers where there are opportunities to save money and help the environment. A common example that comes to mind is consumers trying to keep their electricity bills as low as possible. Using less overall power, making a shift in the times of day that they are using power, and investing in more energy efficient products can substantiate savings for consumers in Ontario if they understand the clear benefits in the short and long term. The CUSW believes all of this can be achieved through a number of different means. Energy efficiency by using the means of the energy efficient technology that is available to us today. Consumer behavioural changes by increasing awareness and encouraging different behaviour through social benchmarking to reduce energy use. Managing demand is another key by means of shifting consumption away from peak times and using \u201ctime of use\u201d pricing methods with smart metres and programs such as Peaksaver Plus. Finally, by reducing the load on the grid by enabling consumers to improve the efficiency of their individual energy systems by having the ability to recover waste heat or by generating electricity to meet their own specific needs.\n\nThe CUSW believes that the overall effectiveness of the Long Term Energy Plan does not only hinge on the details of how the plan is put forth to Ontarian\u2019s, but also in the language of the plan. The Canadian Union Of Skilled Workers are very passionate about this aspect and feel that any further revisions or alterations to the Long Term Energy Plan include a \u201cSocial Contract\u201d obligation in its terms to ensure the inclusiveness of women, minorities, First Nations and individuals with physical\n\ndisabilities to the rights of equal fair wages and benefit plans. The Canadian Union Of Skilled Workers stands up front in fully supporting these values being incorporated into the approval of any future IESO contracts. Developing an energy plan to ensure that \u201cfuture\u201d energy needs of the province are met, must also include the workforce of the energy sector which brings to the forefront the importance of apprenticeship opportunities. The Canadian Union Of Skilled Workers believes that a larger focus on apprenticeship opportunities \u201cnow\u201d, ensures no shortages of highly skilled workers available to the energy sector in the future.\n\nAs stakeholder in the energy industry in Ontario, the CUSW looks forward to further partnering opportunities with the Minister of Energy to ensure the successful implementation of the provinces Long Term Energy Plan.\n\nJohn Wabb\n\nVice President\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206968]\n",

        "comment":"Dear Madams and Sirs:\n\nI really don't know where to begin as I have so many poignant feelings about the destructive climactic burden that we have placed upon our planet.. But I also do not wish to sound like a fanatic who does not care about all the efforts that the government of Ontario has already made. I want to be proud of my home province and my country in leading the world towards a more sustainable future for our children.\n\nIn the open discussions held here in Windsor with government officials I discussed my disappointment with the ongoing pursuit of nuclear energy and the potential for destruction that it poses. They reminded me of the large number of jobs that would be lost were we to just shut them all down - a valuable remark. But when the farm tractor was first invented (along with millions of other progressive inventions in mankind's history), those who tended the fields feared for their livelihood and rightly so. This is not therefore a new concern but an ongoing historically speaking, issue that has and can be addressed by simultaneously creating new green energy jobs while phasing out the planet-sapping old technologies. And I am not suggesting that this is not a part of your plan but rather letting you know how strongly I feel about this. We do not want an 'obituary' of the Ontario government to say that they had the opportunity to take a stand, and failed to follow through.\n\nAnd of course given that I care for our home planet so dearly, further concerns of mine include conservation, offering Ontarians ways to take advantage of the declining costs of renewables, putting more dollars into finding ways to effectively store energy from solar and wind. And at the risk of sounding egocentric, although there are large numbers of people who may not fill out this survery, large numbers of my acquaintances feel exactly the same way I do.\n\nThanking you for giving me this venue to express my opinions,\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrenda Bender\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206972]\n",

        "comment":"(1)\u00a0 Ontario should stop providing excessive support to wind and solar electricity generators.\u00a0 We should let the existing facility continue to operate but they should compete with other electricity sources on a level playing field.\n\n(2)\u00a0 Ontario should increase reliance on hydro and nuclear electricity.\n\n(2a)\u00a0 As there are not many suitable sites left in Ontario to develop new hydroelectric power, importing as much hydro electricity as possible from Quebec or from other nearby provinces is a sensible strategy.\u00a0 In order to minimize line loss, consider high voltage DC transmission lines. (2b)\u00a0 Refurbish or upgrade capacity of existing nuclear power plants and also start planning to build new power reactors.\n\n(3)\u00a0 There is a widespread belief that nuclear is only for base-load electricity and other power sources are needed to meet the peak demand.\u00a0 This is misguided.\u00a0 A more sensible strategy is to build up the nuclear fleet to meet peak demand, and find ways to use excess power during off peak periods.\n\n(4)\u00a0 CANDU reactors have served Ontario well for last 60 years.\u00a0 However, they are too big and the capital cost of building them is very high.\u00a0 A number of Canadian companies are in the process of designing smaller reactors.\u00a0 Ontario should take part in this R&D by forming private-public joint ventures.\n\nA word of caution: internationally, Canada is committed since year 2000 to develop a new reactor design known as super-critical-water reactor.\u00a0 SCW Reactor is technically very challenging and in my opinion very likely to fail.\u00a0 Even if such a reactor is successfully built, it will encounter serious material corrosion problems in operation.\u00a0 Ontario should stay away from SCW Reactors.\n\n(5)\u00a0 Building up nuclear generating capacity to meet peak demand will take at least a few decades. Therefore, how we shall use the off-peak excess electricity will depend on which technology has matured for widespread deployment by then.\n\nBelow I describe several scenarios, starting with the one for which all required technologies already exist today.\n\nScenario 1:\u00a0 Convert excess electricity to hydrogen via electrolysis, and sell the hydrogen gas to natural gas providers.\u00a0 This will not make economic sense if the market price of natural gas is low and no penalty for emitting CO2 when the gas is burned.\u00a0 However, under a cap-and-trade system, natural gas providers can earn emission credits by distributing hydrogen instead of natural gas. Note that they do not need to build new pipelines: the existing network of pipelines can carry hydrogen and natural gas as a mixture to the end users.\u00a0 Hence, this strategy is very easy to implement, the only requirement being the cost to CO2 emission be high enough to offset the cost of electrolysis.\u00a0 (Oxygen gas, which is a by-product, can also be marketed but it will be an icing on the cake).\n\nScenario 2:\u00a0 If the battery technology has developed to the extent that plug-in electric vehicles are reality, excess electricity, mostly at night, can be used to charge the cars.\u00a0 Today\u2019s lithium batteries are impressive but they remain expensive, limited in range (i.e. the distance a battery powered car can travel on one charge is much less than what we are used to with today\u2019s cars), and have a rather short lifetime.\u00a0 I give this scenario a low chance of success because we need a breakthrough in battery technology.\n\nScenario 3:\u00a0 Hydrogen produced by electrolysis can be used as transportation fuel, replacing hydrocarbon fuels (gasoline and diesel).\u00a0 Here also we need a breakthrough, either in onboard storage so that enough hydrogen can be carried to give a range comparable to a gasoline car, or in fuel-cell technology that will give higher mileage from less amount of fuel.\u00a0 I know a lot of research being carried out on hydrogen storage and to a lesser extent on fuel cells.\u00a0 They are both technically challenging, and I give this scenario equally low chance of success as for scenario 2.\n\nScenario 4:\u00a0 Hydrogen from electrolysis can be further converted to ammonia, which can be liquefied and used as a carbon-free transportation fuel.\u00a0 This scenario, like scenario 1, can be implemented right away since all required technologies exist today.\u00a0 Indeed, liquid ammonia was used as fuel in Europe to run buses during the WWII.\n\nRegardless of which scenario plays out in the future, it is clear that we need CO2-free primary energy source.\u00a0 For that, nuclear and hydro (when possible) are the best.\u00a0 Wind and solar are CO2-free; however, they are far more expensive.\u00a0 Also, note that the goal of this proposal is to completely eliminate CO2 emissions by having enough excess electricity for plug-in vehicles, or for synthesising carbon-free fuels.\u00a0 We need copious amount of electricity and the only way to achieve this is by nuclear.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206973]\n",

        "comment":"First, I would like to recommend that for the next public consultation on the Long Term Energy Plan, you host more of a \"public meeting\" style. I think a short presentation should be made. There should be a question and answer period.\n\nAnother option would be to give a short presentation and then continue the rest of the evening as the \"drop in\" style Q&A like you did during these most current public consultations. The reason I suggest a presentation is because it is impossible to consult the public on something they have no knowledge of. Most ordinary citizens are not politically involved. Most ordinary citizens don't have time between their 2 or 3 part time, low paying, precarious jobs to study up on the Long Term Energy Plan. Most ordinary citizens don't even have the time to read your 50 something page \"conversation guide\". Most Ordinary citizens aren't even aware of the Long Term Energy Plan, or it's significance, therefore making it impossible to \"consult\" them as your government has claimed to do.\n\nEducation needs to happen. People need to understand what they're being consulted on before offering valuable recommendations.\n\nNow, moving along to the Long Term Energy Plan:\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, I am not an energy expert. I do know one thing though - the energy crisis in Ontario is crippling. Our province is currently on a one way train to decimation. I'm sure there are many contributing factors.\n\nThe largest concern I have is with the privatization of Hydro One. Despite mass opposition and warnings from the government's very own non-partisan public watchdogs, the government still pushes ahead with this privatization scheme. A privatization scheme which is quite obviously a thinly veiled attempt to line their buddy's pockets and gain a few extra bucks to balance the budget just in time for the next election. This Government is selfishly making poor choices that are affecting every single person in the province. Have you heard the saying \"heat or eat?\" - it's a reality! The Ontario Energy Board reports that 60,000 customers had their hydro services cut over the past year due to non-payment.\n\nSo what does this have to do with privatization? There is a direct correlation between the deregulation of (formerly) Ontario Hydro and increased prices. For a century Ontario enjoyed reliable hydro at 4-5 cents per kilowatt hour. These steady hydro rates survived World War 2 and the Great Depression. Now isn't that something - hydro at a fair price that everyone can afford. Fast forward to the 2000's when Ontario Hydro was deregulated and all of a sudden rates skyrocketed! I have seen articles which indicate rates have increased as much as 300%. That is outrageous!\n\nThe exact same thing will happen with the so called \"broadening of ownership\" of Hydro One. Private investors will make millions off the backs of hard working Ontarians. Not to mention the loss of revenue for the government.\n\nSo my recommendation is simple: stop the sale of Hydro One!\n\nAnother thing you may consider is this: If green energy is so important (which I believe it is) - we're being told \"it's worth the cost\" ... then why on Earth are we producing more green energy than required and selling at at a loss to other jurisdictions?!? If Ontario can pay the hefty price to produce this precious green energy, then those who use it in other jurisdictions can pay the same! At least then we wouldn't be at a financial loss.\n\nOh and another novel idea: stop producing excessive energy we don't need. I mean, that would require the government to abandon their corrupt ways and stop signing contracts with their infrastructure pals, but hey, it's worth a try!\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206976]\n",

Meeting Ontario's electricity, heating and transportation energy needs with sustainable renewable energy is achievable. The Ontario Government needs to remove barriers to the fast adoption of renewable energy and also enhance efforts to increase energy efficiency and conservation. One of the biggest barriers to Ontario achieving 100% renewable energy is the government's very costly commitment to nuclear energy.\u00a0 In order to protect our environment and reduce our energy costs, it is critical that the province's energy plan include decommissioning our nuclear power stations starting with the Pickering station when its licence expires in 2018. Our nuclear power plants are old and dangerous and they produce long-lived radioactive waste. At a time when other countries are decommissioning their nuclear reactors and rapidly transitioning to renewable energy, billions are being spent to keep Ontario's aging nuclear reactors operating. The costs of renewable energy and smart grid technologies are declining rapidly while the real costs of dangerous nuclear energy production are rising.\n\nOntario has shown leadership by getting rid of coal and it is now time for Ontario to show leadership on transitioning to renewable energy.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206977]\n",

        "comment":"On behalf of the Town of Caledon, I would like to present our submission as part of Ontario's Long-term Energy Plan Review.\n\nThe Town's submission is organized around eight themes and includes comments made by staff for consideration by the Province as the 2017 Long-term Energy Plan is developed . The comments include recommendations that we hope will help to set the direction for Ontario's energy future for the next 20 years. The Town of Caledon has taken a progressive approach to environmental leadership, and we would encourage the Ministry to consider the expertise of our staff to help improve this important Plan.\n\nAt the regular meeting of Council held on November 29, 2016, Council adopted a resolution regarding the 2017 Ontario Long Term Energy Plan Discussion Guide: Town Comments. The resolution reads as follows:\n\nThat Staff Report 2016-151 regarding the 2017 Ontario Long Term Energy Plan Discussion Guide: Town Comments, be received; and\n\nThat Schedule A of Staff Report 2016-151 be forwarded to the Cabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator at the Ministry of Energy as the Town's comments regarding the 2017 Ontario Long Term Energy Plan Discussion Guide.\n\nThe Town would also like to note that it is supportive of the Region of Peel\u2019s comments with respect to the Long Term Energy Plan Discussion Guide.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter and we look forward to the release of the revised Plan in 2017.\n\nDistribution and Grid Modernization\n\nWhat are the significant challenges facing utilities and what can government do to meet them? \u2022Pressure to meet conservation targets: There are significant opportunities for partnerships with municipalities and LDC\u2019s to better target conservation programs through targeting hot spots and trend opportunities presented in energy and building age mapping (community energy planning). \u2022Preparing for climate change resiliency: adaptation and resiliency of the energy system under extreme weather events must be part of the consideration of modernizing the grid to withstand and limit power outages. There will be opportunities to partner with municipalities who are working on studies to understand for the future impacts of a changing climate.\n\n\u2022Modernizing the grid and distribution system to accommodate for additional demand due to the electrification of the economy may be expensive. This must be done in a financially responsible manner and examine opportunities to leverage funding from the cap and trade markets to offset these investment costs and protect those vulnerable to price increases including families and businesses.\n\n\u2022Invest in the appropriate electricity service infrastructure to allow more rural and remote customers to participate in decentralized energy systems. For example, many rural residents have not been able to participate in existing Provincial renewable energy programs due to the lack of access to a three phase power distribution network.\n\nWhat additional policies should the government consider to expand access to natural gas?\n\n\u2022The Town is very supportive of the programs focused on expanding natural gas to rural communities.\u00a0 Not having access to cheaper fuels for heating and agricultural purposes (i.e. crop drying, and greenhouse heating costs) does place significant cost pressures on local businesses and negatively impacts local economic activity.\n\n\u2022The Town encourages engagement between local municipalities and the Province in allocating the funding and construction of natural gas lines ensuring that environmental regulations are upheld and public safety guidelines are met.\n\n\u2022An opportunity may include the coordination of permitting and siting processes for the building of underground infrastructure (i.e. roads and sewers) to expand natural gas pipelines offsetting the capital construction costs.\n\nMicro Grids\n\nWhat are the best uses of micro grids in Ontario?\n\n\u2022The Town and its residents have experienced significant challenges due power outages resulting from extreme weather events. Micro Grids can be used as a climate change adaptation tool to ensure core functionality during extreme weather events. It will be important to coordinate with municipalities to identify priority areas to serve as emergency centres during these events. \u2022There is also opportunity to combine storage with local energy generation and consumption. For example, the technology exists allowing for buildings to act as producers, storage and consumers of electricity. LDC\u2019s should be encouraged to partner with municipalities and developers to construct and pilot buildings and communities to perform these functions to contribute to both resiliency and a decentralized energy system.\n\nAre there barriers preventing the use of micro grids?\n\n\u2022Establishing and communicating the business model beyond traditional means may be challenging. It will be important to establish clear benefits, and incorporate the full cost of system outages (i.e. avoided economic loss due to power outages during ice storms).\n\n\u2022Developing partnerships across jurisdictions that are multi stakeholder in nature (i.e. developers, business owners, and municipalities) will be difficult. Establishing clear benefits and investment opportunities (i.e. to serve local functions of energy storage and generation) will be important.\n\nGeneral Comments-decentralized heating\n\n\u2022Encourage partnerships with municipalities who have undertaken energy mapping exercises, to partner with neighbouring jurisdictions and utilities to identify district energy opportunities in high density and demand development areas.\n\nTransmission\n\nHow can Ontario continue to strengthen reliability of the transmission system of the Province? \u2022As part of transmission investments, the Town encourages consultation with local municipalities and businesses to understand power quality concerns such as brownouts to inform future investment. This has been a challenge faced in our community that negatively impacts the local economy, for example due to challenges in productivity in manufacturing processes and\/or equipment failures.\n\nIs the current user pay model and effective way to meet Ontario\u2019s needs? Does it appropriately balance the goals of economic development and protecting tax payers?\n\n\u2022The user pay model in principle is effective however can be improved. It should be encouraged that when planning and constructing new industrial subdivisions for example, utilities should work with developers, community and municipalities to understand all future uses and needs for the subdivision to ensure adequate capacity of the connected system and to avoid unnecessary costs to increase the system capacity in the future.\n\nInnovation and Economic Development\n\nWhich innovations offer the greatest benefit to your community and the energy system as a whole? \u2022Innovations in lowering greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector will be of significant interest. Transportation is the greatest contributor to local greenhouse gas emissions. These innovations will include investments into a fuels transition in the community (i.e electric vehicles), creative and cost effective delivery of public transportation in rural communities (i.e. investments in public and demand based transportation to and from major transportation hubs) and investment in electric and natural gas fueled municipal and larger industrial fleet. \u2022Innovation in creating a decentralized energy system in rural communities using locally available resource opportunities. There is an abundance of energy in agricultural operations that is underutilized. The LTEP should consider policy options focused on enabling more agricultural communities to significantly contribute to Ontario\u2019s energy future, for example through forming co-ops to operate independently or in partnership with organic waste management practices to produce renewable natural gas for local natural gas utilities. In order for this to be successful, investments, as announced by the Province in delivering natural gas to rural communities will be crucial. These two investments have the potential to unlock significant economic benefits. \u2022Expanding the net metering program and couple this with widespread local storage opportunities in advance of the building code achieving net zero communities.\n\n\u2022Encourage innovative partnerships between utilities, local businesses and municipalities to identify opportunities for net metering programs and other decentralized energy generation to offset future requirements for additional electrical infrastructure, while allowing operations to become self-sufficient controlling both consumption and generator borne costs\n\n.\n\nHow should the public and private sectors cooperate to encourage innovation in the energy section? \u2022Investigate the potential for public and private partnerships. This model has proven to be successful in other infrastructure investments, leveraging both private and public sector funds. \u2022It will be important to focus investments generated by the Cap and Trade program into the low carbon economy transition to foster the development of low carbon technology solutions that municipalities, residents, businesses and industry can cost effectively implement. In addition, by funding and focusing the investments from the Cap and Trade program will be important in controlling future cost increases associated with the potential electrification of the economy.\n\nWhat actions could the government take to support the adoption of alternative fuels?\n\n\u2022The Province should consider making more incentives opportunities and tax breaks for Municipal and other large fleet operators to support the transition to low emitting large fleet. \u2022Invest in engine technology that would allow for increased percentages of biodiesel mixture. \u2022Mandate standards for the mixing of biodiesel. If biodiesel isn\u2019t blended appropriately, there can be significant challenges for the engine to operate safely and efficiently.\n\nConservation and Energy Efficiency\n\nTo meet the Province\u2019s climate change objectives, how can existing or new conservation and energy efficiency programs be enhanced in the near and longer term?\n\n\u2022Strongly encourage the addition of electrically heated homes to the home energy audit and retrofit program. Despite electricity being a \u2018cleaner\u2019 fuel, it is recognized that in order to encourage an electrification of the economy as highlighted in the OPO\u2019s scenario C and D, new generation will be required to accommodate growth. Therefore, investments should be made in areas where appropriate to conserve first, before investing in new generation, which includes opportunities in electrically heated homes.\n\n\u2022Develop funding opportunities to encourage municipalities with community energy plans in partnership with utilities to develop tailored energy conservation programs and renewable energy opportunities (i.e. solar hot water heating) for residents, business and industry. This partnership will be particularly important for buildings (beyond residential) that don\u2019t have a specific utility designated for heating.\n\n\u2022Facilitate improved data sharing agreements allowing municipalities to undertake energy mapping of more sectors to identify additional local conservation measures.\n\n\u2022Place a true conservation first framework on all energy consumed in the Province. The majority of household energy consumed in the Province is natural gas. Natural gas is a significant greenhouse gas contributor, and holds significant opportunities for conservation; however retrofits currently lack a business case. Natural Gas programs and incentives should be increased to improve the business case to encourage conservation in all sectors.\n\nHow can we continue to inform and engage energy consumers?\n\n\u2022Expand and promote the green button initiative to residential and business customers. Look for opportunities to centralize natural gas data into the green button to allow consumers to have access to energy data in a single interface. This may also generate opportunities in the technology and the application development sector to create tools to develop quick business cases for conservation and fuel switching.\n\n\u2022Municipalities with energy maps should partner with local distribution companies to discuss energy use in target communities and promote and tailor energy conservation programs.\n\nClean Energy Supply\n\nWhat role should renewable energy generation play in the modernization and transformation of Ontario\u2019s electricity system?\n\n\u2022The development of renewable energy to serve as distributed and local energy systems, coupled with storage technologies hold the potential to prepare communities for climate resiliency and energy independence. This will be significant when communities can remain \u2018online\u2019 through increasing numbers of extreme weather events.\n\n\u2022Local and renewable energy generation (through biogas, solar etc.) keeps energy dollars within the local economy and community instead of crossing borders into other jurisdictions.\n\n\u2022Allow for more municipal and private contributors to participate in energy market agreements (i.e. through the net metering program) and produce power to the grid and receive credits based on time-of-use pricing.\n\n\u2022Renewable energy should not be limited to just electricity generation. There is significant opportunity within agricultural and rural communities to contribute to this low carbon economy transition in the form of renewable natural gas. Providing the infrastructure to these communities (through natural gas expansion) will be important to allow for connection and contribution.\n\nWhat factors should Ontario focus on as it pursues opportunities for electricity trade agreements with nearby Provinces and states?\n\n\u2022As done with the agreement with Quebec, electricity trade agreements should be done with jurisdictions with similar climate and greenhouse gas reduction goals (i.e. both Provinces have either signed, or intend to enter into the Western Climate Initiative) ensuring that the generation side is low GHG emissions and with patterns that are complementary to one another (Ontario is summer peaking and Quebec is winter peaking).\n\nRegional Planning\n\nIn areas expected to undergo a transformation from rural to suburban through intense development, how could the province help to ensure that corridor lands are reserved\/set aside before development occurs to minimize the potential costs and inconvenience of acquiring and clearing developed lands in the future?\n\n\u2022Caledon is subject to significant growth, which will require investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure in order to meet that demand. Town staffs are supportive of the Regional Planning process and are currently working with utilities in the planning process to expand electricity infrastructure into high growth areas. It will be important to continue working with municipalities to identify reserved corridor lands as growth is allocated to understand future needs.\n\n\u2022In addition, there are synergies in municipal energy mapping and energy forecasting studies that display the future impact of growth on local energy systems that can contribute to this work.\n\nGeneral Comments\n\n\u2022The LTEP should also encourage an integrative planning process that incorporates energy planning, where appropriate, for decentralized energy systems to suit most\/all of the needs of new communities, cost effectively. This should also be undertaken with a lens of climate resilience and net zero design principles as the Ontario Building Code transitions to net zero. This in turn could be beneficial in avoiding costs associated with large transmission construction, where appropriate. This will be particularly important as Southern Ontario\u2019s population grows by almost 50% over the period of the 2017 LTEP.\n\nSupply Mix\n\nTo meet a higher demand, what mix of new electricity resources would best balance the principles of cost effectiveness, reliability, clean energy, community engagement and an emphasis on conservation first?\n\n\u2022As mentioned in the LTEP document, the Province should continue to invest in its Conservation First policy and extend this to the natural gas demand side management framework. There continues to be significant opportunity for natural gas conservation but currently lacks a business case in some projects.\n\n\u2022The price of the technology to support renewable energy (i.e. solar) has dropped significantly. Trends like this should continue to play a large role in the procurement of future energy generation sources.\n\n\u2022Support the widespread adoption of the net metering program in the existing built environment and in new developments. This will allow more buildings to become energy generators at the TOU market cost of electricity versus the contracted cost.\n\n\u2022Apply a life cycle costing method in the procurement of\u00a0 future energy generators that incorporates the long term maintenance and operating costs, as well potential \u2018do nothing\u2019 or avoided costs resulting from climate change impacts.\n\n\u2022The income generated from the Cap and Trade program should be invested in incentivizing the creation of local, decentralized renewable energy sources and fund pilot communities.\n\nWhat policies will Ontario need to adapt to transformation in the fuels sector?\n\n\u2022Allow for municipalities to have more of a role in the siting of renewable energy infrastructure for decentralized energy systems to ensure the siting is in line with Official Plans and designated future development areas.\n\n\u2022Allow municipalities to enforce green development standards\n\n\u2022Update the Ontario Building Code to reflect the LTEP, Climate Change Action Plan and pending Growth Plan mandates.\n\n\u2022Enforce community energy planning and local energy targets. Encourage more integration between LDC\u2019s and municipalities in determining the future demand of pending development and assess how these needs can be met through decentralized energy systems.\n\n\u2022Provide investments for fuel switching to make conversions to electricity based heating an affordable solution. This could be combined with programs such as net metering to offset costs, allowing homes and businesses to rely on self-generated energy during more expensive peak times. In addition, significant attention must be paid to the future resiliency of these systems (i.e. combination with storage technology), as electricity has arguably been more sensitive to extreme weather events.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206982]\n",

What we need is an altruistic government, the aim of which is to make life liveable for everybody both now and in the future, not just for those in power and their friends at present: as appears to be the way of this government.\n\nTwo cases that are out of whack at present are this government's allowing a private company of a foreign power to take our water practically free, and to sell it back to us in plastic bottles, that cause pollution.\u00a0 The other is their refusal to clean up Grassy Narrows for our First Nations people - which is our government's responsibility - but which smacks to me of racism on their part!\n\n[Original Comment ID: 206984]\n",

You knew the people didn't want coal, that it was dirty and polluting and creating green house gases. Thank you for getting rid of it. But coal was the low hanging fruit towards our green energy future, and now the hard work begins. Do you want a legacy of lazy politically motivated decisions, which is more nuclear and toxic to future generations? Or do you want a legacy of smart brave green decisions. Don't be cowards. Educate the people. Use nuclear as a way to cover the gaps until wind and solar are up and running. This will create JOBS.

Canada has all the ressources for this challenging task.\n\nIt is time for Ontario to join the global movement toward 100 % renewable energy:\n\nMore than 1,000 cities around the world, including Vancouver and Oxford County in Ontario,\n\nhave already committed to transition their communities to 100% renewable energy by 2050.\n\nWe want the Ontario government\u2019s next energy plan to ensure citizens and communities are empowered to make the shift to 100% renewables.\n\nMeeting Ontario\u2019s electricity, heating, and transportation energy needs with sustainable renewable energy is achievable. We currently produce more than a quarter of our electricity with renewable sources like water, wind, solar and biogas, and with costs falling and technologies improving we can quickly add more.\n\nA 100% renewable future will eliminate the damage being done by our current dirty energy\n\nsystem. Ontario\u2019s fossil plants contribute to climate change and air and water pollution at a time when the province is committed to reducing carbon pollution and showing leadership on climate change. Our nuclear plants produce long-lived radioactive waste and put our communities and\n\nthe Great Lakes \u2013 the source of drinking water for tens of millions of people - at risk of a nuclear\n\naccident. Nuclear is expensive and dangerous \u2013 which is why plans for nuclear power are being mothballed around the globe.\n\nThe Ontario government needs to remove barriers to the fast adoption of renewable energy\n\nwhile also helping us make the best use of this clean green energy, through enhanced efforts to increase efficiency, conservation, storage, district heating and electric mobility.\n\nPUTTING CONSERVATION FIRST - Efficiency and conservation are the cheapest source of\n\nenergy and have the lowest impact on the environment. They also help to ensure the green\n\nenergy we produce goes further. According to government studies, we have the technical\n\npotential to cut our electricity demand by half before 2040.\n\nSwitching to 100% renewables means:\n\nEMPOWERING ONTARIANS \u2013 A switch to renewable energy will also mean a switch to\n\na more decentralized energy system where everyone from citizens, co-ops and schools to municipalities, small businesses and Indigenous communities can become energy producers.\n\nA more localized system, with opportunities for community-ownership and participation, will\n\nalso increase public support for renewables, and provide more jobs \u2014 and more importantly, local jobs in communities across Ontario.\n\nBUILDING RESILIENT COMMUNITIES - Climate scientists predict increasingly erratic weather\n\nin the coming decades \u2013 everything from ice storms and flooding to severe heat. We need\n\nto strengthen our local power production and distribution systems and rely less on a small\n\nhandful of giant power plants in order to reliably keep the lights on. To do that, we need to give communities the tools they need to go 100% renewable.\n\nSEIZING OPPORTUNITIES - The cost of renewable energy and smart grid technologies\n\nis declining rapidly. Ontario\u2019s energy plan needs to ensure we are ready to take advantage\n\nof innovation in the clean energy sector to lower our energy bills, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen system resilience and increase the number of Ontario citizens, businesses and communities who benefit from generating zero emissions energy.\n\nKEEPING THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY RESPONSIBLE FOR RISKS AND COSTS \u2013 The biggest\n\nbarrier to making the switch to 100% renewable energy is the government\u2019s plan to spend billions to keep Ontario\u2019s aging nuclear reactors operating. To ensure Ontario can make the switch to safer 100% renewables and take advantage of innovation in the clean-tech sector, we\n\nneed to replace reactors with renewable energy. To do that, we need a full and fair comparison\n\nof the total costs of nuclear with alternatives and an opportunity for the public to have a say about which approach they prefer.\n\nLESS POLLUTION: Communities fought big gas plants for good reason \u2013 they pollute. We need cleaner air in our communities, and renewable power can provide it.\n\nCUTTING CARBON: Ontario has shown leadership by getting rid of coal \u2013 and we\u2019re all better off because of it. Now - as the province gets serious about climate change - is no time to turn back, and increase our reliance on natural gas instead. Gas is better than coal, but no matter\n\nhow you slice it, gas is a fossil fuel and it contributes to climate change. Renewables don\u2019t.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207018]\n",

I am disappointed to see the proposal to pull back from a plan to move to 100% renewable energy.\n\nI am concerned that climate change remains the biggest challenge for civilization, and bold leadership is needed to deal with the challenge. We need the price system to encourage people and companies to reduce energy use and to make renewable energy more economically viable compared with carbon-producing or radioactive-waste-producing energy forms.\n\nWe also need a smart grid with time-of-day sensitivity that encourages small-scale local energy production and storage. With decentralized storage, people could charge up during low energy-demand periods and sell back into the grid during high energy-demand periods, thus evening out demand peaks and reducing the requirement for peak generation capacity.\n\nGovernment leadership is needed to shape the energy marketplace to align economic incentives with societal needs. I urge you to continue to be bold and innovative.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207022]\n",

        "comment":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAs the government of Ontario seeks input in the development of the province\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP), Nest Labs is pleased to participate and provide recommendations for improvement specifically targeted at energy efficiency and conservation and customer engagement.\u00a0 Nest is also encouraged to note the linking of the LTEP to the Ontario Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP).\u00a0 Due to Ontario\u2019s energy mix, it is critical that both objectives are addressed simultaneously and seamlessly.\n\nIt is timely for the Province to consider \u201cSmart Thermostat\u201d technology for the home. \u201cSmart Thermostats\u201d are one example of home technology that provides both energy savings and carbon reduction potential. Thermostat technology has greatly evolved over the last few years and can be part of the solution to help Ontario meet its energy reduction and climate change goals, while at the same time reducing consumers\u2019 bills.\n\nAs a leader in this segment, the Nest Learning Thermostat not only delivers on its customer promise of smoothly regulating temperatures while adapting to the needs of each house, but provides real, proven savings in both gas for heating and electricity for cooling.\u00a0 The Nest Learning Thermostat has proven that it delivers positive results in energy savings (10-12% heating savings, and about 15% cooling savings [1]) and CO2 reductions (0.5 tonnes per thermostat installed [2]) Therefore, Smart Thermostats represent an important, tangible opportunity for the Ontario government as it seeks to deal with climate change at the residential level.\n\nAs part of the LTEP and CCAP implementation strategy, Nest recommends:\n\n1.A province wide \u201cOne Million Thermostat Initiative\u201d providing rebates to consumers who install Smart Thermostats, building on the success of the Demand Side Management and Conservation Demand Management programs.\n\n2.Make sure that residential customers can participate in the demand response markets of the Ontario ISO using Smart Thermostats.\n\n3.Amend the Ontario Building Code to require the installation of Smart Thermostats in all new residential construction.\n\nMore detailed description of these recommendations is provided below.\n\nQuestions about these comments can be directed to:\n\nUtilia Amaral\n\nConsultant (Regulatory Affairs, Canada)\n\nNest Labs\n\n416 802 8041uamaral@nestlabs.com\n\nOVERVIEW OF NEST LABS\n\nNest Labs is focused on creating the \u201cthoughtful home\u201d that takes care of the people inside it and the world around it. By making simple, delightful objects from home products (i.e. the thermostat, smoke alarm), Nest offers customers intuitive hardware, software and services that save energy and keep their home comfortable and safe. After starting with a handful of employees in May of 2010, the company has since grown to over 1,000 employees and has an international product footprint. Today, Nest products are sold in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and are installed in more than 120 countries.\n\nSince introducing the original Learning Thermostat in 2011, Nest has been uncompromisingly focused on creating a user experience that delivers customer satisfaction. The Nest Learning Thermostat is a highly popular \u201cSmart Thermostat,\u201d based largely on its award-winning design, ease of operation, and overall attention to the customer experience. It is a Smart Thermostat equipped with sensors, Wi-Fi capability, and processors, to help customers consume less energy: it learns their preferences, adjusts the temperature when the house is empty, and automatically lowers air conditioner runtime when humidity conditions permit, helping people lower their energy use without sacrificing comfort.\u00a0 Nest is designed to enable \u201cDo It Yourself\u201d installation, and to date approximately 90% of Nest Learning Thermostat customers have done the installation themselves, most in under 30 minutes. [3]\n\nIndependent energy savings studies show Nest Learning Thermostat saves about 10%-12% of heating usage and about 15% of cooling usage in homes with central air conditioning. In Ontario, for example, this equates to 345 m3 of natural gas heating savings and 293 kWh electric savings, or approximately 0.5 tonnes of CO2 per thermostat per year. Nationally, Nest anticipates an approximate reduction of 0.5 tonnes of CO2 per thermostat installed.\n\nIn addition to reaching energy efficiency and CO2 reduction targets, the Nest thermostat is a successful platform for utilities to address load management needs. Since 2012, these energy programs have helped our gas and electric utility partners achieve their conservation targets, shift electricity load and attract customers in highly engaged energy conversation.\n\nDelivering on its vision for the \u201cthoughtful or connected home\u201d, Nest launched the \u201cWorks with Nest\u201d (WWN) platform in 2014. It offers customers a rapidly expanding ecosystem of products that work thoughtfully together in the home. Examples include LED lighting, appliances, plug load controls, load control switches applicable to water heating, and electric vehicle chargers. The WWN platform has been open for less than one year and, already, 1-in-8 Nest customers have a device paired to their thermostat via WWN and over 15,000 developers registered.\u00a0 WWN can use the Nest thermostat as a gateway to communicate load control signals to a wide range of compatible devices, including pool pump controllers, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, lighting, appliances, and ceiling fans.\n\nRESIDENTIAL THERMOSTAT OPTIONS ARE RAPIDLY EVOLVING\n\nTraditional manual thermostats allow the occupants of a home to simply turn the heating or cooling up or down.\u00a0 The result is that many residences \u201cset it and forget it\u201d, resulting in unnecessary heating and cooling, and correspondingly higher energy bills.\n\nTraditional programmable thermostats (PTs) allow customers to set up a pre-programmed schedule for raising or lowering the temperature in the home.\u00a0 This enables occupants to ensure that the heating or cooling is not on high when they are away at work, for example.\n\nWhile the ability to pre-program thermostats can be a convenience feature and save energy for some households, there are challenges and difficulties with programmable thermostats. \u00a0 For many people, they are not intuitive and hard to program; therefore, some people never establish a correct schedule.\u00a0 In that case, they may be used like non-programmable manual thermostats with people turning them up or down ad hoc.\u00a0 Even if PTs are programmed initially, they are often overridden or placed on \u201chold\u201d at some point in the future and then not reprogrammed.\u00a0 This override could happen for any number of reasons; a house full of guests, unusual weather, daylight savings time, change in season, etc., and may erode the energy savings of programmable thermostats.\u00a0 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) originally had an ENERGY STAR specification for PTs but suspended it in 2009 as a result of continuing questions concerning the actual energy savings and environmental benefits achieved by PTs in the real world. [4]\n\nA new category of thermostats, of which Nest is one player, known as \u201cSmart Thermostats\u201d, have a number of advantages over traditional programmable thermostats when it comes to energy efficiency assurance and persistence, demand response capabilities and ease of use. Smart Thermostats can learn a household\u2019s habits and preferences and create a customized schedule without programming. Through motion sensors and\/or geofencing technology, Smart Thermostats can recognize when occupants have left the home and automatically adjust temperature settings. They can also connect to the Internet, enabling them to receive software updates, be controlled remotely by the user, and receive signals from a utility, energy aggregator or other home energy management system.\n\nBENEFITS OF A SMART THERMOSTAT IN ONTARIO\n\nThere are many benefits to the creation of a Smart Thermostat province-wide program in Ontario namely:\n\n1.Proven energy savings for consumers. Third party studies of the Nest thermostat have found\n\n10-12% heating savings, and about 15% cooling savings [5]\n\n2.Average CO2 reductions of 0.5 tonnes per thermostat installed\n\n3.Positive customer engagement\/experience [8]\n\n4.Potential for additional energy efficiency savings (Seasonal Savings) and the ability to offer demand response (Rush Hour Rewards)\n\n1.\u00a0 Proven Energy Savings\n\nThere have been a number of studies of the Nest Learning Thermostat energy savings based on comparisons of utility bills from before and after installation. Three studies relevant to Ontario were independently funded, designed and evaluated by utilities in Oregon and Indiana.\u00a0 The energy savings results of the studies were similar -- showing Nest Learning Thermostat savings equal to about 10%-12% of heating usage and electric savings equal to about 15% of cooling usage in homes with central air conditioning. Furthermore, the Oregon study noted that the majority of participants reported feeling more comfortable after the Nest Learning Thermostat was installed and all studies found high levels of customer satisfaction.\n\nAlthough the average savings were similar across the three studies, it is important to note that thermostat savings in any given home can vary from these averages, due to differences in occupancy patterns, housing characteristics, heating and cooling equipment, and climate.\n\n2.\u00a0 Estimated Energy Savings and GhG Reduction Calculations: The Case in Ontario\n\nThe Nest learning thermostat can provide energy savings and help in GhG reductions across Ontario with 0.5 tonnes GhG per thermostat. In this section, it will be illustrated how Nest estimated energy savings calculations and GhG reductions, provide a case study for Ontario. Ontario is deploying energy efficiency and load management strategies and Smart Thermostat technology, such as the Nest Learning Thermostat, can play a role.\n\nOntario\u2019s Case Study:\n\nNest estimated the energy savings from thermostat installations in Ontario based on heating and cooling savings from the US studies applied to the heating and cooling energy use of current Nest customers in Ontario. Savings values consistent with the aforementioned studies (11% of heating and 15% of cooling) are used.\n\nHeating and cooling system energy-use were calculated based on the average actual hours of heating and cooling system run-time during 2015, multiplied by the estimated energy input rates of the heating and cooling systems.\u00a0 In 2015, Nest customers in Ontario used an average of 918 hours of heating and 556 hours of cooling (for the 91% of thermostats that controlled a central air conditioner).\u00a0 Nest employed an HVAC system sizing estimation algorithm based on climate data and other factors to estimate an average 99 kbtu\/hr input rate for gas heating systems and 2.66 kW input for central air conditioners.\u00a0 It was also estimated the electricity use of the gas heating systems (air handler fan plus other fans, pumps, etc.) at 0.77 kW. (Please see Table 1: Energy and CO2 Emissions Reductions per Thermostat for a complete summary.)\n\nTable 1: Energy and CO2 Emission Reductions per Thermostat in Ontario\n\nOntario \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Natural Gas m3\/yr \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Electricity kWh\/yr\n\n% of Homes\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 UsageSavings \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 UsageSavings\n\nHeating \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 99% \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2831 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 350 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 706\u00a0 \u00a0 84\n\nCooling \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 91%\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1,314 \u00a0 232\n\nTotal Energy\n\nper thermostat \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2794 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 345 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 293\n\nTotal CO2 tonnes\n\navoided\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0.52\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0.01\n\n&#9679;The table treats all home heating as natural gas, ignoring the fact that a small fraction use of other fuels -- 1.3% fuel oil, 2.9% propane, and 3% heat pumps (primarily dual fuel). &#9679;Fuel oil and propane emit more CO2 per unit of energy than natural gas (propane 19% greater and fuel oil is 38% greater), making the values in the table more conservative.\n\n&#9679;CO2 emission reductions were calculated based on standard CO2 emission factors for natural gas and an estimated 0.029 kg\/kWh for electricity (based on the low carbon emissions of the Ontario power grid).\n\n3. Positive Customer Engagement and Experience\n\nNest places customer engagement, satisfaction and data privacy at the center of its business strategy. Nest recognizes that a positive consumer engagement and experience is critical to the success of an energy management program.\u00a0 In an effort to ensure maximum positive outcomes for the customer and the utility or government agency, Nest offers several mechanisms to reach the customer.\u00a0 From personalized customer portals to mobile apps, and \u201cquick tips\u201d through e-mail, Nest provides a variety of tools to encourage customer interaction.\n\nFurthermore, when Nest partners with utilities or government agencies, co-branding and integrated marketing strategies can be developed.\u00a0 Utilities and government agencies can leverage Nest\u2019s marketing ability through a Nest website, use of Nest creative templates, brand training and so on. Using integrated marketing strategies can raise consumer awareness and improve the success rate of an energy management program.\n\n4. Potential for Additional Energy Efficiency and Demand Management\n\nThe savings described above are based on savings from Nests as installed.\u00a0 However, Smart Thermostats, due to the fact that they can communicate via the internet, have the potential to provide additional ongoing benefits to Ontario.\u00a0 Smart Thermostats are an enabling technology, especially under circumstances where initiatives such demand response and time of use strategies have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.\n\nBelow is a description of some additional programs offered by Nest when sponsored by a utility or a grid operator or government (Ministry of Energy).\n\nSeasonal Savings\n\nNest Seasonal Savings is an HVAC tune-up program that can be offered twice a year, at the change of seasons from heating to cooling and cooling to heating. Seasonal Savings boosts the efficiency of a customer\u2019s device without sacrificing comfort or requiring daily behavioral changes. Seasonal Savings is only offered to customers in geographies where a utility or government sponsors the program.\u00a0 Customer participation is always optional.\u00a0 Typically, the customer is offered the opportunity to participate without any incentive except the opportunity to reduce their energy usage and therefore their energy bills.\n\nHow does Seasonal Savings work?\n\nTwice annually, prior to the cooling or heating season, Nest sends eligible customers the Seasonal Savings algorithm.\u00a0 Opting into the program, by simply clicking \u201cContinue\u201d, begins a two- to three-week process of micro-adjustments to their temperature set point.\u00a0 While customers always maintain control of their schedule and set points, the changes are so small and gradual that most customers do not even notice an impact on their comfort.\n\nOn average, this saves an additional 3~5% of heating and AC load, 0.1 kW peak reduction.\n\nFurthermore, 89% of customers report being just as comfortable as before the adjustments.\n\nSeasonal Savings is currently implemented by a number of Nest gas and electric utility partners. In addition, the Department of Energy Resources for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (analogous to the Ministry of Energy in Ontario) purchased Seasonal Savings for all Nest customers beginning in the winter of 2014-2015 as part of an effort to curb natural gas consumption during a time of critical shortage. [8] This program was deemed a success, with an average of ~4% heating load reduction during the very difficult winter of 2015. Massachusetts felt the program was such a success that it repeated it in the Summer of 2015 and has purchased it again for the 2016 winter. Ontario, or other provinces relying on gas, could do a similar program with the savings primarily coming from reduced natural gas usage for heating.\u00a0 The more thermostats that are installed, the bigger the benefit of such a program.\n\nDemand Response (Rush Hour Rewards)\n\nNest wants to change the way people think about demand response, which has not traditionally been customer-friendly and broadly adopted in the residential space.\u00a0 Nest\u2019s Rush Hour Rewards is a mass-market demand response offering for customers with air-conditioning that offers utilities and grid operators a way to reduce peak loads during the summer. Rush Hour Rewards is only offered to customers in locations where a utility or government sponsors the program, and while customer participation is always optional, Nest has seen high levels of customer participation and satisfaction.\n\nHow does Rush Hour Rewards work?\n\nNest sends eligible customers invitations to participate in Rush Hour Rewards along with an offer of a financial incentive.\u00a0 Once customers opt-in, the sponsor of the program is able to deploy events to their thermostat on peak days.\u00a0 When the sponsor calls an event, Nest sends a signal to participating customers\u2019 thermostats.\u00a0 The thermostats employ an algorithm customized to each home that combines pre-cooling, temperature drift and air conditioner cycling in order to reduce load.\n\nThe net result is that Nest saves between 0.8-1.3kW per thermostat, and reduces air-conditioning usage by over 50% during the peak period.\u00a0 At the end of the event, the thermostat goes back to its regular set points and schedule.\n\nRush Hour Rewards would be beneficial to Ontario because demand response can reduce peak demand on the electric system.\u00a0 While this saves only a small amount of kWh, it substantially reduces the system or local peak, thereby reducing the need to run the gas-fired peaker plant used during these times.\u00a0 Leveraging Rush Hour Rewards will disproportionately reduce CO2 gases compared to carbon content of the average generation mix.\u00a0 In addition, reducing peak demand can also reduce the need for infrastructure upgrades which can save Ontarians money as well.\n\nTime of Use (Time of Savings)\n\nThe vast majority of Ontario electricity users pay time-of-use prices, which offer differing prices during various hours of the day and times of the year.\u00a0 Further, the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) is contemplating critical peak pricing and has investigated dynamic pricing, which would introduce additional complexity into rates that many consumers already do not fully understand Nest\u2019s Time of Savings program can help - it understands the price of energy for customers on Time of Use rate plans and will automatically adjust the thermostat\u2019s schedule and set points to help these customers use less electricity when energy prices are most expensive.\n\nTime of Savings can also be developed further to support future varying price rates, thereby furthering the OEB objectives and assisting consumers with managing these complex pricing systems.\n\nEVOLVING BUILDING CODES\n\nAcross North America, a variety of regulatory and policy bodies are in the process of defining \u201cSmart Thermostats\u201d as a category. From EPA\u2019s Energy Star program to state utility commission Technical Reference Manuals (Illinois, Pennsylvania, California, Texas), and including California\u2019s Title 24 Building Code, there is great interest in defining this new technology so that it may be included in a variety of efficiency programs.\u00a0 A definition of \u201cSmart Thermostats\u201d that has been proposed in several proceedings is:\n\nSmart Thermostat: A device that controls heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment to regulate the temperature of the room or space in which it is installed, and has the ability to communicate with sources external to the HVAC system. For connection, the device may rely on a home area network (e.g. Wi-Fi) and an internet connection that is independent of the Smart Thermostat. A Smart Thermostat has the functionality to make automatic adjustment decisions regarding heating and cooling, using the following functions:\n\nA.Two-way communication between the thermostat and a utility, energy aggregator, or other home energy management service.\n\nB.Automatic variations to that schedule driven by local sensors and software algorithms, and\/or through connectivity to an internet software service. Data triggers to automatic schedule changes might include, for example: occupancy\/activity detection, expected arrival and departure of conditioned spaces, historical and population energy usage trends, weather data and forecasts.\n\nThis class of products and services are relatively new, diverse, and rapidly changing. Generally, the savings expected for this measure are not yet established at the level of individual features, but rather at the system level and how it performs overall. This measure treats heating and cooling savings independently. Note that it is a very active area of ongoing study to better map features to savings value, and establish standards of performance measurement based on field data so that a standard of efficiency can be developed. That work is not yet complete but does inform the treatment of some aspects of this characterization and recommendations. Energy savings are applicable at the household level; all thermostats controlling household heat and cooling should be Smart Thermostats. Multiple Smart Thermostats per home do not accrue additional savings beyond that associated with the generally higher baseline HVAC energy consumption often found in such homes.\n\nAdding a \u201cSmart Thermostat\u201d definition and require \u201cSmart Thermostats\u201d as a minimum standard in new homes in the Ontario Building Code would help fast track the deployment of these devices to help contribute to carbon reduction targets and assist in achieving household energy efficiency.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nSmart Thermostat technology has evolved to a point where it can help governments achieve CO2 emissions reductions and energy management (energy efficiency and demand response).\u00a0 Nest has outlined how the Learning Thermostat, out of the box, can help achieve Ontario\u2019s dual objectives. To that end, there are logical next steps that could be taken in order to facilitate more substantial deployment of this technology.\u00a0 They include:\n\nConsumer Incentives: A \u201cOne Million Smart Thermostat\u201d Campaign\n\nWhile the government of Ontario has made great strides in the areas of energy conservation, the goals outlined in the CCAP and recent statements made by the Minister of Energy at the Empire Club (November 28, 2016) will necessitate acceleration of the work already underway.\u00a0 The Demand Side Management and Conservation Demand Management are a foundation on which to continue progress made.\n\nHowever, from a Nest perspective, given the geography, population distribution and the composition of the electricity sector, penetration in markets outside of the major centres is currently difficult.\n\nThe most effective way\u00a0 to accelerate the deployment of Smart Thermostats is via the development of rebate programs.\u00a0 Nest recommends that the Ontario government adopt a province-wide rebate program that is centrally administered in order to reach all the citizens no matter what fuels they use or what utility territory they are in.\n\nAs a case study, we recommend that the government review and replicate the ComED \u201cOne Million Smart Thermostat\u201d campaign implemented in Chicago. With a customer base of about three million electric consumers, ComED initiated the campaign in October 2015. \u00a0 A $100 US rebate on a Smart Thermostat for electric savings was initially offered.\u00a0 Since launch, an additional $50 from gas companies and $40 demand response incentives have come online for a total potential customer savings of $190 per thermostat.\n\nNest, along with other technology providers, consumers and environmental groups and utilities, came together to make the campaign a success.\u00a0 Nest, other technology providers and the utilities worked together on an elaborate multi-level communications\/marketing campaign that included social\/viral\/digital marketing, earned media, one of Nest\u2019s largest retail activation plans, TV, YouTube and Hulu ads, radio spots in the Chicago area.\u00a0 Co-branding and cross-branding was a central feature of this highly co-ordinated marketing campaign.\n\nGetting a million Smart Thermostats on people\u2019s walls will have immediate benefits in reducing gas use, electric use and customer bills.\u00a0 However, once they are on the walls there are additional benefits that can be gained for the electric system such as demand response described below.\n\nImplementing a Residential Demand Response Program\n\nDemand Response is a cost effective, clean, reliable and flexible resource for electricity systems that can help the government meet its CCAP goals and assist the system operator in meeting its reliability goals. DR is a proven resource that is part of supply mixes throughout the world providing:\n\nWhile Industrial Commercial Demand Response capacity auctions have occurred in the province, the residential demand response market remains untapped resource.\u00a0 Nest recommends that the province continue to develop a policy regime to encourage and build capacity around a residential demand response program.\n\nAmending the Ontario Building Code\n\nThe Ontario Building Code is currently silent on the \u201cSmart Thermostat\u201d.\u00a0 To accelerate the adoption of the Smart Thermostats, and the benefits they confer, it is recommended that the Ontario Building Code include a definition of \u201cSmart Thermostat\u201d and require that they be installed in all new homes and major renovations.\u00a0 This simple policy will make sure that energy conservation is \u201cbuilt-in\u201d to new homes and provide a further platform for demand response to help manage the electric grid.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOntario\u2019s goals pertaining to energy conservation and climate change are ambitious, but achievable. The government is on the right path as it begins to link the LTEP and CCAP.\u00a0 It is important to leverage existing DSM and CDM programs (while not duplicating efforts) and enhance their effectiveness through a province-wide centrally co-ordinated rebate and marketing campaign.\n\nIn addition, amendments to the Ontario Building Code will ensure that new construction will be equipped with the latest technology to conserve energy and ensure climate change goals are being addressed.\n\nNest will continue to develop products and programs that can contribute to the Climate Change Action Plan. \u00a0 For example, The Works with Nest (refer to Overview of Nest Labs) platform, which was recently launched, will continue to evolve and grow thereby ensuring that each Ontarian has the opportunity to have a \u201cthoughtful home\u201d that takes care of the people inside it and the world around it.\n\nNest looks forward to being engaged in the consultations showing its commitment, and providing advice, support, and in-depth data as programs are developed and enforced.\n\n\n\nEndnotes:\n\n________________________________________\n\n[1] Energy Trust of Oregon;\n\nNIPSCO; Vectren;\u00a0 https:\/\/nest.com\/downloads\/press\/documents\/energy-savings-white-paper.pdf\n\n[2] Ibid.\n\n[3] Statistics derived from Nest customer surveys.\n\n[4] See: https:\/\/www.energystar.gov\/index.cfm?c=archives.thermostats_spec\n\n[5] Energy Trust of Oregon;\n\nNIPSCO; Vectren;\u00a0 https:\/\/nest.com\/downloads\/press\/documents\/energy-savings-white-paper.pdf\n\n[6] Ibid.\n\n[7] http:\/\/www.datascienceforsustainability.org\/past-talks\/measuring-energy-savings-and-other-data-anal ysis-challenges-at-nest-slides, see pages 40-53\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207021]\n",

        "comment":"It is really was past time that the Government of the Province of Ontario and Ontario Power Generation got behind renewable energy, solar, wind, geo-thermal, small scale hydro-electric and other forms of renewable energy too numerous to mention here, and reduce and then eliminate electricity generated from dangerous and polluting sources, like nuclear energy, and climate change causing and polluting fossil fuel generation. The former is also an outdated, expensive (contrary to what they would have us believe) type of generation that belongs left in the 20th century and the latter is one that should have been left behind in the 19th century. In case I need to remind you, it is now the 21st century. And much more attention should be paid to energy efficiency and conservation, way more than has ever been paid attention to it in Ontario.\n\nAny subsidies, tax breaks or financial incentives that the nuclear and fossil fuel industries get should be cancelled immediately, for if that happened, you would see how fast those industries collapsed. Even if you only gave half of those financial incentives to the renewable energy industry, all of our long term electricity needs would be met quickly, cost effectively and in a clean, non-polluting manner. A win-win scenario if ever there was one. And no one would miss the old, polluting industries they would replace. And you know this!\n\nOntario needs an energy plan for the 21st century. Other jurisdictions are in the process of making this a reality, so using the excuse that it is not practical or feasible is now just a lie. All one has to do is look at what is happening in Germany and other European countries to see what has already been accomplished. For goodness sake, even somewhere like American Samoa has switched completely to 100% renewable energy recently!\n\nSo it is time that the Province of Ontario developed and implemented an Energy Plan that completely embraces energy conservation, energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy electricity generation and the creation of more local power generation. Abandon the dependency of mega-projects and stop rewarding polluting forms of electricity generation and those that profit from it, they are a limited few, and give the citizens and taxpayers of this province a fair deal with their electricity rates, which will be easily achievable by abandoning things like nuclear power and all of the costs, hidden and otherwise, that it generates (that are never included in the ever-ballooning price tags of nuclear power plants construction when they are proposed to be built).\n\nIf the Government of Ontario and Ontario Power Generation had been honest and not kept hidden the fact that keeping the Pickering Nuclear station operating would cause a surplus of electricity generation (something OPG and the province knew as long ago as 2011) and that keeping it open would make the renewable energy projects on the boards that were recently cancelled unnecessary, Pickering could have been closed years ago and quickly and easily replaced by those renewable energy projects. In fact, replacing Pickering, Darlington and the Bruce nuclear power plants could be quickly and easily accomplished with a couple of years, if there was just the political will to get enthusiastically behind energy conservation, energy efficiency and renewable energy generation. It is happening elsewhere, it needs to start happening here now!\n\nStop rewarding a limited few, and provide a fair, and clean, deal for most of the citizens of this province!\n\nKevin Gamble\n\nEast York, Ontario\n\n(P.S. I do not like having a nuclear disaster waiting to happen in my back yard, and that is exactly what could happen at any moment.)\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207029]\n",

Varentec empowers utilities with the hardware and software needed to increase customer satisfaction, grid efficiency, manage peak demand, reduce consumer energy consumption and effectively integrate renewable energy resources. Deployed on the consumer-side of the grid, Varentec\u2019s ENGO dynamic VAR devices autonomously sense and regulate voltages by injecting dynamically reactive power at the Grid Edge. Coupled with Varentec\u2019s proprietary GEMS\u2122 software platform, utilities of all sizes gain unparalleled, real-time control, monitoring and visibility into power and energy usage and grid operation across the electrical distribution system.\n\nAs an innovator in voltage optimization technology, Varentec can provide a valuable perspective to the LTEP process. Given our experience in early deployments in the United States and Canada, we believe that there is strong potential for voltage optimization technology to directly benefit the ratepayers of Ontario and support policy objectives established in the province.\n\nTo provide a sense of scale and context, Varentec has conducted a preliminary assessment that concluded that deployment of advanced voltage optimization could deliver 1.8 TWh annually of energy savings and 1.6% reduction of total Ontario net electricity demand. As outlined in the attached briefing document, with the right regulatory framework, advanced voltage optimization (\u201cgrid-edge CVR\u201d) can deliver a strong IRR for utilities (10%-15%), an LCOE at or below conventional CDM programs, and a lower customer bill (2%-3% net bill reduction).\n\nHowever, these potential benefits are limited by:\n\n(1)definition of Conservation and Demand Management (CDM) programs, and\n\n(2)lack of financial mechanisms to address the impacts of lost revenue opportunities for distributors.\n\nSpecifically, it is our observation that there is no current mechanism for system-wide efficiency upgrades (such as voltage optimization) to be included in CDM programs and targets. Further, even if an LDC were to invest in these new technologies, the LDC would realize lost revenues due to the lower energy sales measured as a result of lower voltage levels. The result is for Ontario electricity customers is that they do not benefit from improved electrical service that meets Ontario\u2019s conservation goals.\n\nIn many jurisdictions in the United States, specific provisions have been established to include similar \u201cgrid-side\u201d efficiency investments to qualify toward policy mandates. Similarly, many jurisdictions have established lost revenue recovery and other financial mechanisms to encourage and support utility investments in advanced technologies with proven efficiency benefits.\n\nWe believe that similar mechanisms can provide substantial and measurable benefits for Ontario\u2019s electricity system and clean energy goals.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn consideration of the benefits available to Ontario from advanced voltage optimization, Varentec offers the following recommendations with regard to the Long-Term Energy Plan:\n\n1.Voltage optimization should be incorporated into the Long-Term Energy Plan.\n\nAs the Minister notes in the opening message of the Discussion Guide, Planning Ontario\u2019s Energy Future, the most pressing question is, \u201cAre we well-positioned for the future?\u201d In order to take full advantage of advanced technologies and distributed clean energy technologies, voltage optimization must be included in the planning and strategic objectives. Incorporating voltage technologies requires upgrades to the distribution system that can provide (1) overall system efficiencies through reduced energy consumption, and (2) integration of intermittent and distributed energy technologies. Voltage optimization offers both immediate benefits (e.g., energy efficiency) and long-term capability improvements (e.g., distributed energy integration). The need for these capabilities is further highlighted in the Discussion Guide, which notes, \u201cInnovation and changes in customer behaviour are encouraging the spread of new energy technologies\u201d such as energy storage, smart homes, microgrids, distributed energy resources and electric vehicles. The Discussion Manual concludes, \u201cThese changes all require a modern distribution system.\u201d We agree and further submit that a \u201cmodern distribution system\u201d is one that includes advanced voltage management capabilities.\n\n2.Investments by LDC\u2019s that result in energy savings should be qualified as Conservation and Demand Management (CDM) Programs.\n\nCurrently, it is our understanding that only investment and technologies deployed \u201cbehind customers\u2019 meters\u201d can be considered as CDM Programs. This limited definition excludes opportunities for substantial, measurable energy savings that can occur through system-wide upgrades. These benefits should not be ignored simply because they occur on the \u201cgrid-side\u201d of the customers\u2019 meters. The Long-Term Energy Plan should include and encourage energy efficiency savings through all available means, which is consistent with the \u201cConservation First\u201d principles established by the province. The most immediate and obvious remedy includes changing the definition of \u201cConservation and Demand Management.\u201d We recommend that the Ministry initiate the process to revise the code immediately and, to the extent allowed by their authority, establish interim guidance that qualifies these investments by LDC\u2019s.\n\n3.Mechanisms to address financial impacts of lower energy sales should be established to support investments by LDC\u2019s.\n\nAs we have noted, jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere have established mechanisms to address the financial impacts of lost revenue associated with energy efficiency programs. Such a mechanism will support the deployment of advanced voltage technologies by LDC\u2019s within Ontario. The existing Lost Revenue Adjustment Mechanism provides a vehicle to support investments by distribution companies within the province to deploy advance voltage technologies. We recommend the Ministry initiate and support the process that would qualify investments in these technologies to be supported by the existing lost revenue adjustment mechanisms.\n\nVarentec appreciates the opportunity to provide these comments on the Long-Term Energy Plan and the potential benefits available from advanced voltage management technologies. We respectfully submit that there are opportunities to take immediate action that will support accelerated deployment of these critical functions and capabilities. Ontario will benefit from immediate energy efficiency savings and enhanced capabilities to support distributed energy that are consistent with policy objectives established by the province.\n\nWe look forward to opportunities to further contribute to this important discussion.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207033]\n",

The expense to change over is great as we taxpayers feel it already but we have to look at the big picture.\n\nPlease use the revenue from the carbon tax; even allocating some of it to this, will go a long way in getting down to our share of the climate agreement.\n\nWe see the difference in getting rid of our coal-fired plants as there are no smog days as of late.\n\nHave you thought of turning off unnecessary street lighting (timers)? What about mandating the use of LED street lights. Some regions have been leaders in this regard. If this was mandated perhaps it would happen sooner. Maybe the lights left on in the high-rise towers of big cities could be mandated off during late hours (Toronto could use the fine money ;))?\n\nIt costs less to turn off the lights and conserve than it does to change the way we produce electricity.\n\nThanks very much,\n\nMR.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207041]\n",

        "comment":"Governments are elected to do what is both necessary and possible, not what is expedient. It is necessary and feasible to plan for, and achieve, 100% renewable energy for urban, rural and remote communities. I want to see this Ministry offer multiple energy solutions (which may include nuclear in the short term) in order to test, and ultimately champion (in the appropriate situations), energy-producing methodologies including wind, solar, biogas, geothermal and the like. If renewable energy solutions are presented in cookie-cutter, ready-made packages for communities to try, then (i) the learning curve can be reduced for later adopters, (ii) information about successes and failures can be shared, and changes made, and (iii) the necessary move toward 100% renewable energy in Ontario can be started.\n\nLocal initiatives work best. And when they succeed, many others follow - there is nothing like \"word of mouth\", as advertisers well know. \"Buy in\" is crucial to success and it is easier to obtain in small populations. Germany, for eg., has a large concentration of wind farm local-community co-ops because people will stomach looking at the turbine-filled landscape when they are \"their own\". People in Brooklyn and Australia are putting solar panels on roofs and selling their excess energy to non-solar neighbours through bit-chain technologies. Government can and must be a facilitator of local initiatives, including energy co-ops, both through funding and through offering strong technical support and advice, and having a dedicated research facility that supports both policy and technical practices. The latter is crucial because even with all the will in the world, innovators within communities cannot do it by themselves. A funding mechanism is also important, and the use of ordinary or municipal-type bonds must be looked at by securities, tax and energy regulators to remove any unnecessary barriers.\n\nWhen people are enjoying renewable energy personally, they will want their commercial environment to do the same. Some businesses already understand the importance of this issue. They may be slow to adopt, however, until there is more community, client, and peer-to-peer pressure than there is currently.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207025]\n",

Nuclear is not an environmentally friendly option and given the number of reactor construction projects worldwide that are taking longer than expected and are over budget by billions it is proven to be economically unfeasible.\n\nWith advancements in solar and battery technology in just the last few years alone a fully renewable energy future is a real possibility. Why is Ontario not requiring new homes and buildings be built with solar panels on the roof? We need better incentives and subsidies for home owners to install solar without the risk of their property tax rates going up as result.\n\nWe can have micro turbines on our highway lamp posts to power them from passing cars. Turbines in the middle of rotating doors in buildings, solar panels on every roof. There are endless sources of truly renewable and truly clean sources of power that would repay the cost of installation many times over.\n\nBetter conservation is also needed. How many office buildings in downtown Toronto alone are completely deserted after working hours but have all their lights on? It's easy to have timers and motion detectors shut lights off when there is no one around.\n\nIt is time we start really changing our view of electricity and heat production as there are more and better options that are not being talked about.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207043]\n",

Not focus on political expediency or profit for corporate interests - of the nuclear or oil or fracking industries. These are destroying our health and our environment. Fossil fuels are contributing to global warming, nor can we continue to generate deadly nuclear waste - which has no solution. Burying toxic radioactive waste beside Lake Huron or anywhere - is short-sighted and will irreversibly contaminate our earth and water. Nuclear power plants are an accident waiting to happen, which threaten life beyond our imagining. They are too dangerous for humanity - witness the ongoing devastation from Chernobyl and Fukishima.\n\nMake renewables mandatory and affordable. I live in a nuclear town, use nuclear electricity and heat my house with oil and drive a gasoline powered car. I would love to change - but cannot afford to. Yet government subsidizes nuclear and oil to the billions of dollars.\n\nInvest in new energy - wind trees (in France), wave power, solar voltaic panels, insulation for old houses, new housing codes, solar powered cars (there has been a solo airplane flight around the world, and a wind and solar powered ship cross the oceans.)\n\nWe, the people, are demanding change. From Standing Rock, to the Kinder Morgan pipeline,\u00a0 and everywhere - people have a new vision for the present and future - of safe and renewable energy, so that we can live in harmony with our planet and leave a future for our children. Yet government is the dinosaur that refuses to change, and refuses to take responsibility for the damage we are doing.\n\nBe courageous and bold in vision. Embrace the truth, rather than the lies presented by the energy industries. Lead us forward into the future that must be.\n\nI think of how, in my parents' generation, the whole economy shifted and focused overnight on the war effort. So too, we can change, and with all our efforts together, create a sustainable energy life-style. All things are possible. Embrace renewable energy for us all - now.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207046]\n",

Some or most of the waste heat could be used for microgrid heating for homes and industry.\u00a0 For example Bruce Nuclear used to sell waste low grade steam to greenhouses that were encouraged to build around the nuclear site.\n\nSolar PV is about 13.5% efficient at trapping the sun's energy with current commercial technology and degrades by 1% per year, yet solar water heating is about 73% efficient for a 20 year lifecycle.\u00a0 Dr, David Suzuki says adding solar water heating to a home is the #1 thing a homeowner can do to decrease their environmental footprint.\u00a0 That focus can significantly reduce the electrical and fossil fuel demand, making a better environmental choice.\n\nElectricity is the most expensive and perishable energy source (used or lost each 1\/60th of a second), and is 3 to 4 times more expensive that the fuel used to create it.\u00a0 Electrical use must be minimized, yet Ontario (and most other jurisdictions) have had programs to maximize electrical usage.\u00a0 Wrong-headed meddling by the government, likely due to undue influence by Special Interest Groups who benefitted from these dysfunctional policies.\u00a0 This must stop immediately!\n\nAbout 5% of all hydro-electric sites in N. America are currently tapped to produce electricity. Most of these untapped sites are still available as hydro-electric sources, but are micro-hydro sites that do not require a dam construction (a dam having significant environmental consequences), and are for example run-of-river and similar environmentally sustainable uses of hydro-electricity. Mega-project dam sites have a huge financial and environmental cost, far more expensive on both of these costs than micro hydro.\u00a0 They can be tapped by encouraging locals to develop and operate them.\u00a0 They are not economically nor logistically feasible for a huge bureaucracy like a provincial government, OPG, or Hydro 1 to do it.\n\nOntario is currently selling excess power to many other jurisdictions at a loss, due to prior mismanagement & poor planning.\u00a0 Do not bother claiming that the 2007 to 2016+ recession and the resulting excess electrical capacity could not be foreseen, as recessions have occurred ever 4, 7 or 10 years throughout my life and for hundreds of years before I was born, and major crashes or epoch endings occurred every 75 to 150 years.\u00a0 Ontario Hydro made the same mistake when they started on nuclear power, forecasting huge increases in demand, year after year, likely due to the self-serving benefits that are derived therefrom.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the Ontario taxpayer is forced to pick up the debt charges from this misguided overbuilding.\n\nOPG and Hydro 1 and all those riding their coattails are run like a country club with huge fringe benefits, and have grown into a huge bureaucracy that is self-serving those on the inside at the expense of taxpayers.\u00a0 The Ontario government has failed to rein in this runaway monster they created, or at least continue to allow it to run amok with few effective controls.\u00a0 Somebody has to set these organizations back onto an even keel, and do it soon.\u00a0 For example, executive salaries should be no more than 60 times the lowest salary within that organization (current CEO base of $750,000 and topping out at $4 million with bonuses is ridiculous).\u00a0 Announce the policy today, it takes effect in 1 year from now, then slowly trends to a lower & lower ratio over time as improvements are made.\u00a0 In the future, all executive bonuses are tied to: \u00a0 a) $\/kW-hr production costs and power quality(OPG); \u00a0 b) $\/kW-hr transmission & all other charges (Hydro 1); \u00a0 c) # Customers * (seconds duration)^2 weighting of all outages for number customers & duration (Hydro 1), d) overall reliability (OPG & Hydro 1); e) man-hrs per kW-hr produced; f) Executive salary ratio reductions; and g) Customer satisfaction to survey questions chosens by customers.\u00a0 The bloated bureaucracy must be trimmed to the essential personnel.\n\nWhen you consider all of the charges on the electricity bill (ie. total bill divided by kW-hrs consumed to give $\/kW-hr), Ontario has one of the highest cost electricity in N. America.\u00a0 People are now forced to freeze or starve to death because they can't afford to buy both electricity and food, they are forced to choose one or the others.\n\nAll of the nuclear plants have failed to live up to their technical lifecycle promises, mainly due to incompetency, lack of process control during plant operation, mistakes, and lack of accountability.\u00a0 Now they want a premium price sweetheart deal to produce nuclear power so they can afford to refurbish they plants they prematurely destroyed.\u00a0 If this is allowed, they will only repeat the same mistakes again, destroying the refurbished plants prematurely again, at a lifecycle cost that Ontario taxpayers cannot afford.\n\nOntario Hydro and OPG have been on a debt binge for the last 30+ years.\u00a0 Now that interest rates are rising again, that debt bubble will blow up in the face of all taxpayers, totally unaffordable and un-sustainable.\n\nOntario is on the same public debt glidepath as Greece, but Ontario is just 20 years or so behind the Greeks.\u00a0 Witness the current selling off of Greek assets (eg. sewer, water, airports, waterfront, grid, power generation, etc.) just like the Ontario government is doing for Ontario Hydro.\u00a0 Unfortunately Hydro 1, OPG, et al. are the same or worse than Ontario.\u00a0 Today, global financial vultures are circling Greece and scooping up the best parts, to enslave the Greek people for centuries to come with their rent seeking.\u00a0 Soon those same or similar financial vultures will be circling Ontario.\u00a0 Can this government not see where this is all going?\n\nDistrict heating systems can run at 90%+ efficiency vs. 30% for OGP.\u00a0 Why will the government not force these needed efficiencies into to current system.\n\nMunicipal landfills generate GHG for 100+ years after they close, and potentially pollute the groundwater.\u00a0 Blue box sorting and recycling is ultra expensive and marginally efficient and barely viable financially.\u00a0 As an alternative, municipal waste anaerobic digestion can produce captured methane for district heating and microgrid systems, the recyclables are squeaky clean and easily sorted out of the resulting compost, then and waste streamed and recycled, and the compost can go on to make high purity foodgrade topsoil; all at a cost far less than the current systems.\u00a0 Most agricultural lands in N. America started out as 28% organic, but are mostly less than 3% today, and all that carbon is in the atmosphere as CO2, and the soils are depleted so that crops require chemical fertilizer & ag. chemicals\u00a0 to grow, and those fertilizers\/chemicals are primarily sourced from oil & natural gas.\u00a0 World-wide crop lands are transitioning to desserts, making it more & more difficult and expensive to grow food.\u00a0 If the world-wide soils were rebuilt to 28% organic, atmospheric CO2 would drop to similar concentrations that existed before the Industrial Revolution. The world's leading expert on how to make all this work as an environmentally sound profit centre is Dr. Bill Jewell at Cornell University.\u00a0 Your tiny paragraphs on biomass do dis-service as a superficial coverage of this important topic. If Ontario moved to province-wide biomass, ON ag would be aided and we would have an environmentally sustainable & affordable electricity and heat system.\n\nFull heat recovery cogen CHP or CCHP can be 80% to 90% cycle efficiency, vs. OPG's current 30%\n\nLifecycle all-in cost for hydo-electric is approximately $0.03 per kW-hr, wind at $0.10, PV solar to grid at $0.50,and if we included ALL of the true costs in nuclear, we would be shocked at how expensive it would be.\u00a0 These should be strongly considered when designing our electricity future.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207048]\n",

        "comment":"So, let's say there's a state-of-the-art spaceship, so advanced in technology that it's actually sentient. And every single bit of life on earth is on that spaceship. We're all organized biologically & socially exactly as we were before we embarked, so life aboard is a familiar experience. We're hurtling through our solar system at an inconceivably high speed, heading toward a distant location as yet unknown.\n\nAll should be well, right? Except that some human members of the crew, actually led by the captains, are dismantling the life support system, consistently, concertedly & seemingly unconcernedly. Passengers of all species are growing anxious. Attempts are made to stop the destruction, to no avail. There appears to be no way to stop the destroyers from this suicidal endeavour. Yet, if the behaviour isn't stopped; if the life-support system isn't mended; many (& eventually all) lives will be lost. Any astronaut will tell you this. Yet all attempts to stop the destroyers have failed.\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nWHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO?\n\nWhat WILL you do?\n\nAnd if you don't do it, what part of \"life-support system\" don't you understand?\n\nBut fear not! Perhaps you'll be spared the stressors of leading the way. Remember the part of this story about the spaceship's sentience? If we don't stop the destruction ourselves, Earth will probably take care of this problem for us. But Earth's an immense life-system. So, it's likely that Earth's intervention will be in proportion to Earth's size. Really big stuff will happen. And it won't be pretty. It won't be gentle. And it won't be kind. This is the future you buy us, should you choose to leave\u00a0 undone those hard tasks you have the opportunity & the power to accomplish right now, before it's completely too late.\n\nDo it (so long as every bit of the process is earth-friendly). I know your part of the Spaceship is actually only a wee bit of the whole ship.\u00a0 But you have a chance to set a standard for other provinces: a precedent, if you will. Wouldn't you love to hear, \"As Ontario goes, so goes the country\"? Assuming the processes are all earth-friendly, dare to set the precedent & let it sweep Canada like a beneficial contagion.\n\nDo it, & it's likely that we'll all be the better for it. We'll have to co-operate with each other. Perhaps we'll even grow closer. And all of us working together on this great task, might even feel better about ourselves, our lives, our choices, our behaviour, our species & our future. For, if the processes are earth-friendly, \"renewable\" is one of the great changes we humans must make, if our beautiful, brilliant life-support system is to remain functional.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207052]\n",

On the other hand, renewable energy can develop within the local community,\u00a0 by the local community and provide local development and jobs, without the risks of nuclear power and the side effects of fossil fuels.\u00a0 Other communities - national, regional and local - have committed to 100% renewable energy by 2050 or earlier and are encouraging innovation.\u00a0 The government of Ontario can encourage innovation in many ways:\u00a0 housing standards, public transportation, urban development and protection of green spaces, sharing economy, and in many other ways.\u00a0 Individuals and groups can only do so much, but with the assistance of a provincial commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2050, and the assistance that comes along with it, will empower citizens to achieve the achievable.\n\nWe need to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050, we can and we owe to the coming generations of all living organisms.\u00a0 There is no reason and no forgiveness for not doing so.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207064]\n",

        "comment":"After the Gandalf' group manipulated the populace through survey to sell off Hydro One, energy in Ontario should be free for everyone.\nBuy an MIT or Stanford patent or two for clean exponential small scale energy production, create a public crown corporation to quickly and freely send it out to all Ontarians.\nI find it completely ridiculous that in 2016 people are still on a metered usage grid when there is infinite energy all around us that\njust needs to be tapped into. The planet creates an infinite energy source for itself and us. Nicolas Tesla had many patents that Ontario could use to make his vision of free energy for everyone. He created a vision of free energy in the 1890's. The joke is that science has been manipulated into a laymen's idea of profitable patentable business expenditure for the governmental corporation of the day to exponentially steal from everyone on the 'grid'.\nPoliticians are not scientists and most scientists have been poorly taught that the world and universe's nature isn't electrical and virtually infinite of possibilities. What of the governments promise to have all buildings creating and generating solar energy by 2010. No where near that goal because of poor local manufacturing and relying on multinational corporations to deliver a product instead of creating products locally.\nThere is no reason other than the state of our current mercenary economy why these problems still exist. Fix the Bank of Canada back the way it was to allow interest free loans to the Federal, Provincial, Municipal Governments (including personal). Only after Glass Senegal is repealed and the banks are no longer able to gamble the peoples money on the stock market creating money from nothing into debts & dues in the negatives to private corporations.\nNationalize corporate energy producers that continually pollute and destroy Ontario\u2019s environmental standards daily. Selling off of national infrastructure and energy interests to the highest bidder is collusion with businesses like BlackRock while our own leaders are playing sycophant to Wall St. and international manipulators like Larry Fink.\nShame on the world for not calling governments out on these kinds of things sooner. Shame on everyone playing ignorant like it is a wilful state of mind instead of the one we've all programmed ourselves and each other into. The public trust has been eliminated into a big governmental collusion with corporations and individuals running the Milgram and worse experiments on the populace.\nI have had enough of the way things are and so should you. This is not a future in which anyone should have to live when there is a serious lack of transparency from all levels to obfuscate the truth about these heinous collisional situations and more. It is illegal for government employees to meet with financiers like this. Yet no one goes to jail because we think what they do is OK because the 'news'\u00a0 (or propaganda as I call) it manipulate us into thinking this behaviour is acceptable. We even teach that this is OK in our schools.\nThere is an infinite and perpetual way to solve clean energy for not just Ontario but the world as well. Act and think local & global. With so many ways to solve the problems yet we define the solutions in terms of monetary solutions instead of practical locally resourced ones. The patent situation must be changed. However, the way it is could be used to Ontario's advantage quickly and efficiently. The 36 Billion in Hydro over charging must be answered for and this could be one way to do so.\nThe hydro meters themselves could be turned into point to point energy production sources utilizing the same ground sourced Tesla principles of energy. We are emitting such high frequency energy sources simple very tiny devices could be utilized to take advantage of these limitless power sources.\nYet we continually choose not to from a place of ignorance. Prove me wrong and take an alternate path to the one Ontario is on. Please we beg you. Turn energy into infrastructure like it was meant to be instead of another monetary metered crime.\n[Original Comment ID: 206155]\n",

        "comment":"Comments For The Ministry of Energy LTEP\u00a0 2017 Public Consultation Process\n\nOn November 29, 2016 I attended a Ministry of Energy (MOE) Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP) Public Consultation in the Best Western Plus Stone Ridge in London.\n\nI had a list of questions and also suggestions & recommendations for consideration to input into the updated LTEP in 2017.\n\nAll MOE staff were very focused on the task at hand and willingly accepted feedback. It was refreshing to find that the MOE staff were willing to listen to the citizens of Ontario about realistic and pragmatic approaches to energy planning policy as opposed to the current ideologically driven approaches to energy planning policy.\n\nHere is a summary of my comments and recommendations:\n\n1)The use of SMR\u2019s (Small Modular Reactors) must be accelerated. They will be especially useful in Northern Ontario ( & Northern Canada) as a means to displace use of diesel fuel to make electricity. Note that some models can produce electricity and steam. For remote communities of all types, modular water treatment plants could be installed in parallel with an SMR to improve supply of reliable electricity and safe drinking water.\n\n2)Additional uses of SMR\u2019s would be for supply of electricity to the Ring of Fire and also district heating systems. These district heating systems would be equivalent to co-generation plants on line now. The use of district heating systems was recommended in Reference A:\n\n# 30 \u2013 \u201cThe Committee recommends that district heating should be considered as an energy-conserving technology for new subdivisions, communities and industrial parks.\u201d\n\n3)An \u201cenergy centre\u201d electrical rate should be established for deployment around large electrical generating facilities. This would be applicable at night\u00a0 to make use of surplus electrical supply. Business & industry could use this option at night over a longer term to double shift some forms of commercial & industrial production.\n\n4) The role of alternate fuels such as ethanol, methanol & hydrogen must be re-examined again to tabulate lessons learned from recent experience . Note these three recommendations from Reference A:\n\n# 14 \u2013 Ethanol should be used as a gasoline extender only and not as a substitute transportation fuel in pure form, except perhaps on farms.\u201d\n\n# 17 \u2013 The Committee recommends that the construction of a hybrid natural gas\/biomass methanol plant be encouraged to demonstrate this technology of methanol production as soon as possible.\u201d # 18 \u2013 Since hybrid natural gas\/biomass methanol plants are a transitional step in establishing a fuel methanol industry, the Committee further recommends that such plants be converted where feasible to operation using biomass alone or biomass spiked with electrolytic hydrogen.\u201d\n\n# 38 \u2013 \u201cThe Committee recommends that an energy system based upon hydrogen and electricity as the principal energy currencies be adopted as a long-term policy objective.\u201d\n\n# 39 \u2013 \u201cThe Committee believes that hydrogen will be an important element of Canada\u2019s future energy system and recommends that we now begin to develop the technology and infrastructure for hydrogen production, distribution and use.\u201d\n\n5)The current \u201cInnovation Corridor\u201d concept between Kitchener\/Waterloo\/Cambridge\u00a0 and Toronto to improve rail and road transport should be supported. Once that concept is successful it should be replicated between Toronto and\u00a0 Oshawa. A unique solution to reduce traffic congestion on\u00a0 of Highway 401 would be to electrify the rail system between Windsor, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec. This would allow more shipment of freight via \u201cpiggyback\u201d using more shipping containers on rail cars. This option should be considered for the \u201cInnovation Corridor\u201d\u00a0 concept.\n\n6)There is a compressed air plant still in use (as far as I know) near Cobalt, Ontario that has been used to supply compressed air to the mines in the area. This technology should be looked at again to evaluate its potential. Falling water down a vertical rock shaft tunnel pressurizes air in a chamber and is piped away.\n\n7)The planned refurbishments of six Bruce Power reactors (BNGS-A Units 3 and 4 and BNGS-B Units 5 to 8) as well as the four OPG DNGS\u00a0 reactors (Units 1 to 4) must be completed for Ontario to reach its climate change reduction targets and also for the Ontario economy\u00a0 to be competitive in the North American and international markets.\n\n8)The new Generation 3 & Generation 4 nuclear reactor designs should be investigated in the longer term to be ready to replace the current fleet at the Bruce site and Darlington. This should include the future use of Canadian designed\u00a0 large power reactors and also international fast reactors. What replacement electrical capacity will be used when PNGS is closed in 2014 ?\n\n9)Consideration should be given to study the possible recycling of irradiated Candu fuel on an ongoing basis. The NWMO maintains a briefing file on this subject.\n\n10)Natural gas is a relatively clean burning fuel but when combusted, it makes approx.. 50 % of\n\nthe CO2 as a coal plant.\u00a0 The actual numbers of CO2 emission by energy source for natural gas and coal respectively are 469 and 1,001 grams CO2 equivalent \/kWh (Reference C).\n\n11)Continued use of natural gas presents a challenge for the development of new innovative technology to use CO2 from commercial and industrial sources (e.g. petrochemical plants etc.). The CO2 is used as a feedstock into a choice of several chemical processes that converts the CO2 into other useful chemicals.\n\n12)Parts of South-Western and Eastern Ontario do not have natural gas. Several municipalities and agricultural organizations are trying to have natural gas service\u00a0 provided to those areas. Is there technology that can remove CO2 on a small scale (e.. residential\u00a0 or small commercial use?). This could apply to current gas supplied home and businesses as well.\n\n13)Ground source heat pumps must\u00a0 be integrated into the residential and commercial market. 14)Transmission system upgrades to support the Ring of Fire are needed in the medium to longer term.\n\n15)How will existing smart meters be used to\u00a0 resolve the issue of high electrical rates in\n\nOntario ? The GEA (Green Energy Act) needs updating or major revision\u00a0 to make our electrical rates affordable and competitive again.\n\n16)Finally, Hydro One should be kept in public ownership. Remember Sir Adam Beck.\n\nReferences:\n\nA)Energy Alternatives \u2013 A Report By The Special Committee On Alternative Energy And Oil Substitution to the Parliament of Canada.1980-1981.\n\nB)Ontario Hydro \u201cProviding The Balance of Power: Environmental Analysis and Demand\/Supply Plan Report\n\nC)Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change \u2013 Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation , Geneva 2011.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207071]\n",

        "comment":"I have been involved in renewable energy debates with people who believe that the only alternatives are fossil fuels and nuclear. However, my research into Europe's renewable energy programme has shown that both solar and wind are a viable third alternative.\n\nWhilst the project hasn't been perfect, Germany, as a case study, has successfully demonstrated that solar and wind power can be an energy backbone whilst enjoying the same access to sunlight as Alaska. Germany has driven its per-capita carbon footprint down to a fraction of North America's. Its GDP growth has been just as good, if not better than, North America's and it enjoys one of the highest living standards in the world. My research has revealed that Germany has shut down all of its nuclear reactors permanently and, whilst coal power continues to make up about 40% of its energy output, this percentage continues to decline each year as renewable energy takes over and power suppliers divest in their fossil assets.\n\nIt seems, then, that arguments that renewable energy is completely infeasible are driven either by nuclear or fossil fuel advocates rather than the reality. I admit that my background is neither in science nor engineering, but in business. My sources include The Economist, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, all of which say that the future is in renewable energy. Ontario can either ride this curve and benefit from the changing world or we can be left behind.\n\nI have also read in The Economist their reports on how economically infeasible nuclear power is, which I understand the province is investing in heavily. Without substantial subsidies and preferential regulatory treatment, nuclear power cannot exist. The Economist, and similar publications, make no such argument about renewable energy. Whilst it's true that most national renewable initiatives have come with special taxes to subsidise the industry, my reading suggests that these investments are necessary to subsidise the initial capital development. Once the panels and turbines are in place, these electrical systems become economically self-sustaining.\n\nAccordingly, I would like to see Ontario seize this opportunity to join the international community in developing and advancing renewable energy. Like in Germany, where this project has taken decades, a similar transition in Ontario will take years. The question is not if we transition to safe and sustaniable energy but when. It seems that the sooner we start working towards a sustainable power infrastructure, the better.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207073]\n",

        "comment":"Nuclear power has been consistently uneconomical, unreliable and unsafe, and there are still no safe disposal options for spent fuel.\u00a0 It was a disastrously expensive mistake. We can't afford to throw good money after bad.\u00a0 Let's move Ontario toward a safe renewable future. But this time let's be smarter about how we do it. Let's think about environmentally and socially appropriate installations with community support. Just think of all the flat roofs in this province that could have solar panels on them! It's just a matter of making renewables attractive for owners and communities.\n\nFor the immediate future, and as we add renewable capacity,\u00a0 it only makes good economic and environmental sense to buy hydroelectric power from Quebec, and put in the infrastructure to carry it. We need to put in a network for distributed generation, in any case. So let's be smart and do these things together.\n\nBut the main thing we need\u00a0 to do is to conserve energy. It's seven times more expensive to build new power supplies than to conserve the ones we have. So we need stricter building codes as well as programs that help building owners tighten up their buildings and insulate them better. \u00a0 As an example of the kinds of programs that will truly reduce energy usage: Windows leak a phenomenal amount of energy from almost every building in this province. There are wonderful programs being done in other jurisdictions to reduce energy loss from windows. Ontario could take a leadership role in stimulating small businesses to produce and install window insulation. Imagine the jobs that could result from this kind of leadership, and the happy homeowners whose energy bills go down because they are using less.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.\n\nUltimately, it is a choice, because there will never be enough resources to do both: Continue down the expensive and dangerous nuclear path, or put public funds into a safe, reliable energy future of conservation and renewables.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207075]\n",

We need to take action now.\n\nI would like to see a plan for replacing nuclear energy. It is far too risky a source of energy and I am completely uncomfortable with this as a source of energy.

The Region of Peel recognizes the importance of having a Provincial Long Term Energy Plan that has a balance of social, economic, and environmental sustainability. It is from this perspective that the Region has provided the following feedback.\n\nElectricity Rates\n\n\u2022The Region of Peel recognizes the important role that a \u2018cleaner\u2019 electricity grid plays in combatting climate change, we ask that Province pursues this important goal while making cost effective decision for electricity supply, whether it be through the importation of hydro power or creating a more competitive process for awarding generation contracts.\n\nPromotion of Municipal Renewable Natural Gas Projects\n\n\u2022As the Province\u2019s electricity grid produces less greenhouse gas emissions more attention should be given to natural gas and fleet fuel. To help reduce the impact of these fuel sources the Province should work closely with municipalities to create programs, policies, and regulations that will promote and allow for the recovery of renewable natural gas from municipal wastewaster and waste processes. This should include ensuring adequate access to the natural gas infrastructure and cost certainty for market transformation.\n\nOpportunities for Innovation\n\n\u2022District energy is an energy solution that has received international acceptance, however, Ontario has been a laggard in this area. The Region would like to see the Province take a progressive stance on the enablement of district energy solutions. As one of the larger consumers of energy in the Province how will municipal participation in innovate projects, such as district energy, be promoted and incentivized?\n\nExpansion of Natural Gas Infrastructure\n\n\u2022In Northern Peel many residents and businesses do not have access to natural gas and are forced to rely on more expensive sources of energy (often dirtier (i.e.oil)) to heat their homes. Will the Long-Term Energy Plan support the expansion of this infrastructure?\n\nCollection of Municipal Energy Consumption Data\n\n\u2022Significant resources have been invested by municipalities to ensure that we meet the energy consumption reporting requirements of Ontario Regulation 397\/11.\u00a0 How is the Province using this information to promote conservation among municipalities?\n\nEnergy Project Municipal Consultation\n\n\u2022Municipal consultation for provincial energy projects has been limited in the past. It is important that municipalities are engaged from the start. What form will municipal consultation take for future energy pipeline and generation projects?\n\nElectric Vehicle Infrastructure\n\n\u2022To reduce greenhouse gas emission the Province is providing incentives for electric vehicles. What role does the Province believe municipalities will have in supporting electric vehicle infrastructure\/charging station? (planning, by-laws, provision of charging stations).\n\nEncouraging Conservation in Established Communities\n\n\u2022The Region of Peel is built out in many areas, therefore, energy reductions must occur within our existing building stock. Does the Province envision a role for municipalities to encourage conservation in built neighbourhoods? If so, how?\n\nDecentralized Generation\n\n\u2022The Province recognizes that decentralizing electricity generation creates a more secure grid, keeps money in the local economy, and reduces losses during transmission, yet in Peel we are often limited by capacity constraints. Will the LTEP address capacity constraints so decentralized energy solutions, like district energy, are feasible in urban areas?\n\nPutting Conservation First\n\n\u2022Cost effectiveness cannot be overlooked when implementing GHG reducing initiatives, and energy efficiency is the most cost effective measure for reducing GHG emissions. Is the Province planning to put greater weight on efficiency and conservation techniques, as opposed to the funding of new infrastructure?\n\nMunicipal Regulative Power\n\n\u2022Allowing municipalities to go above and beyond province wide regulations, such as being able to make OBC suggested standards into mandatory building requirements, can help to accelerate energy conservation and climate change action. How will the Province support municipalities should they choose to go beyond the Ontario Building Code?\n\nFuel Switching\n\n\u2022The best scenario for Ontario to achieve its GHG targets requires massive switching from fossil fuels to electricity. How is the Province planning on supplying affordable clean electricity in this future scenario?\n\nDomestic Production\n\n\u2022The Province imports $11 billion in fossil fuels annually. How will the Province balance energy rates while limiting the importation and supporting domestic energy production in order to maintain a strong provincial economy?\n\nContingency Planning\n\n\u2022A large percent of Ontario\u2019s electricity comes from nuclear power, and risks to the nuclear electricity supply, including delays in refurbishment of Bruce and Darlington as well as license extension issues for the Pickering plant, could have significant impacts such as temporary increased use of fossil fuels. How are these risks being accounted for in the Long Term Energy Plan?\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207070]\n",

Consumers need to have affordable energy conservation options, including building standards, public transit availability, low-energy appliances and tools. One hundred percent renewable energy could provide energy security at an affordable price. Consumers need the option of small, local or individual energy production rather than mega-projects. Nuclear energy is not an option for energy security. The cost is enormous, nuclear projects are not independently reviewed and the costs of nuclear accidents is not taken into account. If we are to mitigate climate change and continue to live on this planet, there are no options other than conservation and 100% renewables immediately.\n[Original Comment ID: 206166]\n",

        "comment":"Discussion on Alternative Energies and Recycling of Carbon Dioxide:\nThe Three-Legged Farm Frame Work\nTraditional Role of Farmer\nThe farmer is seen as the grower of food by working the land, putting out their seed and harvesting the crops. Some of the crops are used to feed life stock for providing meat and dairy products. The farmer, as part of this model, \u201cgrows\u201d energy for human consumption.\nEach of these crops takes CO2 out of the air and binds it in the plants grown.\nSecondary Role\nA second \u201cleg\u201d for the farmer to stand on is the growth of crops for feedstock for industrial use such as production of ethanol, biodiesel, feedstock for chemical industry and bio-digesters. This becomes a secondary market and provides additional income for the farmer. The data in Canada and the United States do indicate that the ethanol and biodiesel industries have grown significantly and provide substantial markets for the agricultural industry. The issue of use of farmland for growth of secondary energy crops can be addressed through cultivation of secondary farm land and crop management. It will address the issue of food vs. fuel debate. It is, within this frame work, a non-issue.\nAgain, these crops take significant amounts of CO2 out of the atmosphere and bind it in biomass. Tertiary Role\nThe third \u201cleg\u201d of the farmer is captured under \u201csustainability\u201d, which includes: -Advanced farm practices, minimum tillage, crop rotation, minimization of use of fertilizer; -Introduction and extensive use of cover crops in the fall for the purpose of land cover, reducing soil erosion, and reduced run-off. Furthermore, these crops also take a substantial amount of CO2 out of the atmosphere, which is sequestered into the ground during spring plowing. The soil is ready for the next crop. The carbon dioxide in the ground is increased (as demonstrated by farmers in the Midwestern United States). This is beneficial for reducing the demand for fertilizer. -Reduced use of fertilizer and reduced run-off keep lakes cleaner (e.g. algae growth in Lake\nErie).\n-There is new research under way studying the interaction of bacteria in the ground, known as \u201cbiome\u201d, with seeds, germination and support of crop growth. Sustainability means working with nature, looking at the soil and land as a resource that has to be nurtured.\nWithin this frame work the farmer through working the land becomes an integral part of the carbon cycle. This provides opportunities to develop second or third-grade agricultural land for growing energy crops diversifying feedstock for ethanol away from corn, and developing fast growing fiber plants for biomass feedstock \u2013 all with the intent to remove as much carbon dioxide from the air as a fast growing plant can do given the growing season in Ontario. Given the introduction of a carbon tax some of that revenue would be well invested in supporting cover crops and their immense benefits to carbon sequestration and maintenance of the soil as a vital resource.\nTelling the Story\nEach of the three \u201clegs\u201d identified provide, by themselves, areas of research and development, which are supported by government and university research. But it is this framework, that can be used to \u201ctell the story\u201d to Ontarians, and Canadians as to the role of the Farmer and the benefits of a healthy agricultural industry environmentally and economically. I can envision pamphlets generated that show the carbon cycle in cartoon form, simple to understand, and the benefits for the farmers in their language \u2013 talking to them and not lecturing. I can envision picture books for children, explaining the basic chemistry of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, using cartoon characters, and get academics involved in putting together that story.\n[Original Comment ID: 206167]\n\n",

We also need to help industries who are using fossil fuels and nuclear power to switch over to renewable energies. Governments can do this by providing financial incentives for industies to switch over and higher taxation for industries that continue to use dirty and dangerous energies such as coal, oil and nuclear power and stiffer penlties for polluters. Eventually in order to safe our planet governments, I believe regretfully, must place a total ban on the use of these outmoded industries. We must allow a period of transition in which industries and consumers are given help to make the change but a line must be drawn at some point, hopefully not too far in the future, where we have to say enough.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207080]\n",

The electricity produced by small hydro is unreliable because it peaks during the high flows of spring when power is in low demand, and produces at its lowest during the hot summer months when consumption and demand are highest.\u00a0 During the low flow season of summer or during drought conditions many true run of river, and even some peaking facilities, especially on smaller rivers, cannot operate efficiently, and have to be shut down.\n\nThe ORO report greenwashes hydroelectric by saying that \u201cwaterpower could be a significant source of non-carbon emitting energy and would provide opportunities to partner with First Nation and Metis communities\u201d.\u00a0 This statement is simply not true.\n\nEfficient waterpower generation usually utilizes reservoirs and peaking operating strategies and, even so, still may not be able to produce power during the low flow summer and winter months.\n\nThere are no lack of studies reporting that flooding landscapes to create reservoirs causes flooded vegetation and soils to decompose, and for sediment to accumulate behind the dam, resulting in net emissions of the GHGs, carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane into the atmosphere for decades and possibly for its life following flooding.,\n\nScientists have known for many years that reservoirs are producing far more greenhouse gases than was previously thought, with most of those emissions taking the form of methane.\u00a0 In fact, a recent Washington State University study, just published in the journal BioScience, compiled and analyzed findings, dating back to 2000, of more than 100 studies of emissions from more than 250 reservoirs around the world. They also took into account a factor some previous studies of reservoir emissions had overlooked: bubbles.\n\nSome greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, readily dissolve in water and then diffuse into the atmosphere in a fairly uniform way. Methane, in contrast, often surfaces in sporadic bubbles. This has made it challenging to get a clear picture of how much of the warming gas\u2014which is 34 times more powerful than carbon dioxide\u2014is rising off of a reservoir.\n\nBubble-tracking sonar has shown that reservoirs contribute about 25% more methane than previously thought.\u00a0 The study reports that reservoirs contribute 1.3% of the world\u2019s annual human-caused greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 as much as the entire nation of Canada.\u00a0 It is time our governments recognize this before continuing down the path of increasing the number of hydroelectric reservoirs.\n\nThese results are leading to calls for reservoir emissions to be included in calculations made by countries and organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change when gauging greenhouse gas\u00a0emissions.\u00a0 The emissions, including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, come from decomposing plant material under the water, and methane is produced by microbes devouring rotting material, such as algae, in sediment that builds up behind dams. The emissions are then boosted by nutrients that come from human activities such as agriculture, wastewater or septic\u00a0systems. Natural lakes produce less greenhouse gases as there is not so much rotting material beneath the water and because reservoirs have more fluctuations in water levels than natural lakes \u2014 something which enhances methane\u00a0production.\u00a0 Reservoir methane production is comparable to rice paddies or biomass burning, both of which are included in emission estimates of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading international authority on the subject.\n\nA 2013 study by Edgar G. Hertwich of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology found that carbon dioxide emissions from hydropower, per unit of electricity delivered, were 10 per cent higher than emissions from natural gas-fired\u00a0plants.\u00a0 The researchers acknowledge that reservoirs provide important services like electrical power, flood control, navigation and water. But reservoirs have also altered the dynamics of river ecosystems, impacting fish and other life forms. Only lately have researchers started to look at reservoirs\u2019 impact on greenhouse gases.\u00a0 While reservoirs are often thought of as \u2018green\u2019 or carbon neutral sources of energy, a growing body of work has documented their role as greenhouse gas sources.\n\nIn fact, Keywan\u00a0Riahi, Director of the Energy Program at the International\u00a0Institute for Applied Systems Analysis says, \u201cpower plants are not only causing climate change, but they might also be affected in major ways by climate\u201d.\n\nThe collateral environmental damage caused by dams and waterpower facilities has been well documented for decades, including the loss or serious decline in migratory fish species (waterpower facilities are key factors in the listing of some iconic fish species as species at risk in Ontario and elsewhere); declining biodiversity,,,,, impaired water quality (including elevation of mercury concentrations in fish tissue); and are key threats to imperiled aquatic species.,\u00a0 Significant ecological damage from waterpower has been ongoing for many decades in Ontario,, and in other locations throughout the world.\u00a0 In the past, attempts to effectively mitigate many of these impacts have been sporadic to non-existent in Ontario.\n\nEven today, a basic mitigation technique such as the installation of fish ladders at waterpower installations is rarely a requirement.\u00a0 Despite known impacts on several migratory fish species in Ontario, only a few (2-3) fish ladders have been installed on the approximately 200 existing waterpower facilities in the province.\n\n\u201cThe accumulated effects of multiple small-scale waterpower operations could amount to similar overall environmental degradation per unit of electricity generated as is caused by larger projects.\"\u00a0 In fact the cumulative impacts of many small projects can be even larger, depending on the circumstance.,\n\nIn summary, hydroelectric, whether large or small, can have significant negative environmental effects on food security, and instead of mitigating GHG emissions, hydroelectric reservoirs are actually fuelling climate change.\u00a0 Therefore, there should be no additional hydroelectric included in Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan.\n\n2.Ensure new and existing energy projects do not have negative impacts on our air, land, water or ecosystems\n\nThe Green Energy Act and Green Economy Act offer peak demand incentives and disincentives, to produce more power during peak demand hours.\u00a0 This encourages harmful daily peaking operating strategies at hydroelectric facilities, using reservoirs and seasonal water level operating bands to peak on a daily basis. The strategy is to hold back water during off-peak hours, in order to produce more power during peak demand hours, which earns a higher price and profit.\n\nThe Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) also offers an Industrial Conservation Initiative incentive for hydroelectric operators to reduce electricity consumption during peak hours. If a corporation can conserve or produce some of its own power, it will offset grid power costs.\n\nOn the surface this sounds good; however, there are unintended consequences that can have serious negative impacts on the environment. For instance, a large mining company generates power for their operation at three hydroelectric facilities on a local river in order to offset their consumption of power from the provincial grid. The corporation informed ORA that it saves millions of dollars annually by producing more of their own power on very hot days when peak demand is greater. In order to achieve these savings, the company can and does use its seasonal water management operating bands to peak its facilities on demand.\u00a0 This allows them, at will, to fluctuate water levels at what was a run of river operation, with reports of fluctuations of up to 3 to 4 feet in a day \u2013 all without the benefit of an environmental assessment to determine the impacts.\n\nThese extreme and intermittent fluctuations in water levels and flow velocity create havoc on the riverine ecosystem when shoreline residents lose their docks, eggs from nesting loons are washed away, and water quality is degraded.\u00a0 These are only the visible and obvious impacts \u2013 no one knows what the long-term impacts will be on the fishery, endangered species, and the riverine ecosystem.\n\nCurrently there is no regulatory requirement to undertake an environmental assessment to gauge the impacts and\/or trade-offs that these water management changes will have on the riverine ecosystem, or any meaningful attempt to mitigate the impacts.\u00a0 Approval under the Waterpower Class Environmental Assessment is only required when physical changes to a facility would result in an increase in Installed Capacity of 25% or more.\n\nAlso in this vein, another generating station in Ontario stands accused of damaging a Provincially Significant Wetland, as a result of using seasonal operating bands on a daily basis to maximize power generation.\u00a0 There are very likely many other facilities that have also changed their operating strategies to take advantage of peak demand incentives.\n\nUndoubtedly there has been untold damage resulting from the GEA - legislation purporting to protect our environment.\u00a0 It is no wonder that the public has lost confidence and there is so much local resistance to these \u201crenewable energy\u201d projects.\n\nThe system is broken and must be reformed if we are to protect and conserve our freshwater ecosystems.\n\n3.Reduce demand for power through energy efficiency and conservation.\n\nThe CCAP mentions several programs geared towards conservation of energy consumption.\u00a0 ORA is in agreement with most conservation initiatives, as long as they are carried out in an environmentally and socio-economically sustainable way to protect our air, land, water and ecosystems.\n\n4.Invest in emerging conservation, power storage, and generation technologies.\n\nViable alternatives to new waterpower do exist, and are often more sustainable and less costly environmentally and economically.\u00a0 The most obvious is to improve the efficiency and sustainability of existing power facilities, reduce the demand for power by decreasing energy consumption and increasing conservation, retrofitting power plants with more efficient eco-friendly technologies, and reducing losses through power transmission lines.\u00a0 There are also a number of renewable options that can be considered, such as solar, wind, geothermal and biomass.\u00a0 Of course it is important that individual projects be assessed to ensure they are environmentally and socio-economically sustainable.\n\nThere are also several emerging technologies, such as those related to battery and balloon storage, thorium-based nuclear Molten Salt Reactors, and the recycling and reprocessing of used nuclear fuel, which will need to be evaluated in the future.\n\n5.Reduce power losses through transmission lines\n\nElectricity losses occur at each stage of the power distribution process, beginning with the step-up transformers that connect power plants to the transmission system, and ending with the customer wiring beyond the meter.\u00a0 The figure below shows a diagram of these system components. These electricity losses are often referred to as \u201cline losses\u201d, even though the losses associated with the conductor lines themselves represent only one type of electricity loss that occurs during the process of transmitting and distributing electricity.\u00a0 System average line losses are in the range of 6 to 10% on most utility grids, but increase exponentially as power lines become heavily loaded.\u00a0 Avoiding a small amount of electricity demand in the highest peak hours can reduce line losses by as much as 20 percent.\u00a0 At such levels, disproportionately more generation resources need to be operated to deliver the same amount of electricity to end-users.\n\nEach stage identified in the diagram below is subject to losses, and therefore provides opportunity for efficiency improvements.\u00a0 The cumulative benefits can be very significant.\u00a0 This is because a 1 kW load reduction at the customer\u2019s end translates into more than a one-kW load reduction \u2013 sometimes very much more \u2013 moving upstream to the distribution, transmission and generation levels because of losses compounding along the way.\n\nORA submits that a focus on reducing line losses in the electrical transmission and distribution system could enhance electrical efficiency and make a significant reduction generation-related emissions.\n\n6.Encourage generation of power through harnessing in-pipe water systems, sewers and irrigation systems.\n\nIn addition to solar and wind generation, nowadays in-pipe water to wire power systems are becoming particularly interesting for the integration of renewable resources at urban and building scale because of the potential to harness clean energy from excess head pressure in urban and domestic water pipelines.\u00a0 The ability to operate across a wide range of head and flow conditions, these particular micro hydro power systems can be deployed in municipalities, energy-intensive industries and agricultural irrigation districts providing a consistent amount of clean and continuous energy without the typical intermittency of wind, solar and hydroelectric, and at the same time helping in pipelines management and maintenance.\n\nIt would be preferable to offer incentives to industry to produce power from existing pipe infrastructure where there are so many benefits, with very few impacts.\n\n7.Review electricity pricing with the goal of reducing prices paid to power operators.\n\nThe prices paid for waterpower are now higher than that paid for the same capacity of solar generation.\n\nThe IESO has increased the price paid to waterpower operators under Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) from 14.8 cents\/kWh in 2013, to 24.1 cents\/kWh in 2017.\u00a0 This has resulted in an increase in waterpower applications under 500 kWh.\u00a0 It is not surprising that there is such a gold rush mentality with the generous increase in prices paid for these intermittent and unreliable hydroelectric facilities.\n\nThese tiny projects will receive 40 year FIT Contracts, and in a warming world, these types of projects are ill-advised when extreme weather could impair riverine health and\/or result in dam failure.\u00a0 For instance, in 2015, 18 dams were breached in one flood event in South Carolina. During the low flow season of summer or during drought conditions many true run of river, and even some peaking facilities, especially on smaller rivers, cannot operate and have to be shut down due to low flows.\n\nThese small waterpower projects would not contribute in any meaningful way to the power grid, but instead represent 40 years of death by a thousand cuts to many Ontario rivers. \u00a0 Even true run of river dams fragment habitat, chop up fish, and impede flow and vital nutrients to the downstream. As stated above, there should be no new waterpower procurement.\n\nFor all existing generation, ORA suggests a competitive power procurement mechanism, that would apply to all generators, including Ontario Power Generation and FIT contracted generation.\u00a0 This measure would greatly reduce the cost of power to the ratepayer.\n\n8.Ensure our electricity supply is environmentally and socially sustainable and affordable.\n\nA rapidly changing climate may not support the hydro facilities we already have, let alone support the notion that more hydroelectric dams and reservoirs are a good idea.\n\nAccording to a new NASA and National Science Foundation funded study of more than half of the world\u2019s freshwater supply, climate change is rapidly warming lakes around the world, threatening freshwater supplies and ecosystems. The rate of warming is faster than either the ocean or the atmosphere, with even greater warming in northern Canada. \u00a0 As warming rates increase over the next century, algal blooms, which can rob water of oxygen, are projected to increase 20 percent in lakes, and emissions of methane will increase by 4 percent over the next decade.\u00a0 Additionally, new studies are reporting on the increased evaporation rates from reservoirs, and there are increasing reports from around the globe of rivers and lakes drying up.\n\nIn fact, the World Economic Forum in its \"Global Risks 2015\" report lists \"water crises\" as its number one global risk in terms of impact \u2013 beating out the rapid spread of infectious disease, weapons of mass destruction, and failure of climate-change adaptation.\n\nNew reservoir flooding also accelerates the bioaccumulation of methylmercury in fish, seals, etc., and can put food security at risk for communities relying on fish and other aquatic life as a main staple in their diet.\u00a0 These effects can persist for 20 to 30 years or more. ,\n\nIn addition, hydroelectric projects often overestimate economic benefits, and underestimate their far-reaching effects on biodiversity and critically important fisheries.\u00a0 Current site-specific assessments largely ignore cumulative impacts on hydrology and ecosystem services, in favour of profits, and to the detriment of the environment and citizens.\n\nHydroelectric isn\u2019t the answer to our climate change dilemma \u2013 it is the absolute wrong prescription for a warming climate with increasing intensity of droughts and flooding. \u00a0Protecting our freshwater must be recognized as an issue of national security \u2013 it is essential to our own, and our children\u2019s survival on this planet.\n\n9.Ensure meaningful consultation with the public and First Nation communities, including the possibility of a no outcome.\n\nMeaningful public consultation must be an essential requirement in the power procurement process. This would provide an opportunity for healthy discussion and input from the public and Indigenous communities before an application goes to Council for endorsement, or a contract offered.\u00a0 As it is now, once an electricity project receives a power procurement contract and progresses through the Environmental Assessment process, there is no possibility of a \u201cno\u201d outcome.\u00a0 This is unacceptable. It is crucial that a community has meaningful say in whether a project goes ahead in their community.\n\nFuture growth of waterpower must reflect the need for an evolution of perspectives that respect existing ecosystems, cultures, and human and democratic rights.\n\nIt is essential that we secure an environmentally and socially sustainable freshwater future for our children and grandchildren, so let's ensure that any actions taken today to address climate change or power shortages are methodically researched and carefully considered to understand what the trade-offs will be.\n\nThank you for this opportunity to comment!\n\nRespectfully,\n\nLinda Heron\n\nChair, Ontario Rivers Alliance\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207081]\n",

        "comment":"Introduction\n\nClean Energy Canada is a pleased to submit comments on \u201cPlanning Ontario\u2019s Energy Future: A Discussion Guide to Start the Conversation\u201d to Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Energy as part of the province\u2019s next long-term energy plan (LTEP).\u00a0 This submission reflects our preliminary comments, and we look forward to working with the Ministry of Energy throughout the entire planning process. Ontario begins the LTEP process from a position of strength. Having completed the single-largest climate change initiative in North America by eliminating coal-fired electricity generation in 2014, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Ontario\u2019s electricity sector have fallen by 80 per cent since 2005. Ontario also enjoys an energy supply mix from a variety of sources, with about 32 per cent of that mix being supplied from clean, renewable energy resources including hydro, solar, wind and biomass. The 2017 LTEP is a road map that will set the direction for the province\u2019s energy future for the next 20 years, a period of time in which production and use of zero-carbon electricity will increase.\n\nIn June, 2016, the province released its Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), outlining the approach Ontario will take to reduce GHG emissions. Reflecting an international movement to limit global warming to 2 degrees, Ontario\u2019s plan includes the launch of a cap and trade system to price carbon in 2017, and policies and programs to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in transportation and buildings. Climate change gives us the impetus to look at the whole of Ontario\u2019s energy system and find ways in which we can reduce our fossil fuel use.\n\nHow can we do this?\n\nOntario is becoming less emissions intensive, even with an increase in economic activity. This decoupling of emissions and economic growth reflects a global trend which in 2014, saw, for the first time in 40 years, a halt in the increase of greenhouse-gas emissions without help from an economic downturn. However, this does not mean Ontario gets to rest on its laurels. Even with improvements in the province\u2019s emission intensity, emissions will continue to grow in the absence of policy action. Those policy actions, as dictated in the CCAP, will result in increased electrification: fuel-switching from fossil fuels to clean power to fuel our cars, trucks, and trains, heat our homes, offices, and drive our industries.\n\nThis shift from fossil fuels to clean electricity is needed in Ontario, but it will also occure throughout the rest of Canada and around the world. While not a one-size-fits-all solution, electrification will be a big part of the international effort to live up to climate commitments such as the Paris Agreement (2030) and G7commitment to decarbonization by 2100. As a result, the global market for clean electricity technologies is growing quickly. So is demand for the technologies and services that underpin electric transportation, buildings, industrial processes and smart grids \u2013 many of which Ontario has expertise in because of policies supporting renewable energy, storage, and the installation of smart meters.\u00a0 These new technologies can help to optimize Ontario\u2019s energy system, and support the transition to clean power in a cost-effective way that meets the needs of Ontarians.\n\nEffective energy system planning in Ontario requires a forward-thinking approach. The 2017 LTEP must be the roadmap for Ontario\u2019s continued transition to affordable, reliable clean power sources. One that provides value for money to Ontarians, and leverages the significant opportunity of new, competitive, low-carbon technologies.\n\nPOLICY SOLUTIONS\n\nElectrification: Ontario\u2019s Clean Power Future\n\nOntario enjoys a relatively emissions free electricity grid, with only a little over 7% of power generation contributing to the province\u2019s GHG profile. Ontario has recently attracted more than half of the annual investment flowing into clean energy across Canada, and this growing proportion of clean electricity now presents Ontario with a comparative advantage when it comes to fuel-switching to electricity, and thereby reducing GHG emissions from sectors and uses currently reliant upon fossil fuels.\n\nThe 2017 LTEP is an opportunity to continue the transition to powering Ontario with clean energy sources. To do that effectively, the province should utilize this process to inform Ontario\u2019s plan for how our transportation systems, buildings, and electricity sector will continue to transition towards increased electrification, and to identify opportunities for Ontarians in that transition. To do this, Ontario should consider the following objectives for inclusion in the 2017 LTEP:\n\n\u2022Sector-by-sector electrification goals and energy pathways for end use sectors (transportation, buildings, industry, etc.) for the short, medium, and long term.\n\n\u2022Assessments, including cost-benefit analysis, of the grid modernization that will be needed to support electrification and plans to achieve those improvements, recognizing the advantage and economic value of the potential electricity storage capacity of hydro reservoirs as well as smaller-scale storage and distributed generation.\n\noInvestments in \u201csmart\u201d grids and micro-grids will allow for more efficient use of electricity and greater integration of decentralized power while maintaining reliability, resilience\u2014especially in the face of a changing climate\u2014 and affordability for consumers.\n\n\u2022Targeted approaches for electrification in remote, rural and Indigenous communities, which also represent prototype solutions, including microgrids, for a world marketplace.\n\nIn Ontario, the governing energy board, agencies, and utility commissions can be perceived as presenting a structural barrier to electrification, and this issue should be addressed in the 2017 LTEP. As an example, some utilities are mandated, or interpret their mandate, to choose \u201cleast cost\u201d electricity generation, rather than \u201clowest emission,\u201d \u201cmost resilient,\u201d or \u201cbest life-cycle return.\u201d Restrictive utility mandates can inhibit investments in new clean power to enable more electrification; to plan for increased demand as the transition to electrification takes hold; to conduct pilot programs; to support R&D efforts; to value energy efficiency and conservation; to invest in smart grid technology; and to change rate structures where necessary to support electrification activities.\n\nTherefore, utility mandates may need to be updated for the 21st century, now that electrification and low-carbon electricity are important policy goals. Updated acts and regulations could allow for R&D support, pilot projects, innovation, growing clean power capacity, and new rate structures \u2013 specifically ones that support DSM approaches to power management - while assuring affordability and economic competitiveness.\n\nFinally, Ontario could offer its expertise in electrification more broadly to the rest of the country. As more and more renewable electricity generation comes online, Canada\u2019s electricity transmission and distribution system operators will face new challenges. Through the coal phase-out and increased reliance on renewable power, Ontario has already worked hard to develop and implement solutions, which could be shared.\n\nOntario\u2019s Clean Energy Technology Advantage\n\nAccording to the\u00a02015 Canadian Clean Technology Industry Report, 35 per cent of cleantech companies in Canada are located in Ontario, which has grown particularly strong in the area of clean energy technologies. The decision to phase out coal-fired power generation, followed in 2009 by passage of the Green Energy and Green Economy Act, sent strong signals to the market and sparked a new era of energy innovation in the province. The province was the first jurisdiction in North America to put a smart meter in every home and small business, and was the first in Canada to open access to smart meter data as part of the White House-inspired \u201cGreen Button\u201d initiative. Armed with this standardized data, software developers are creating \u201capps\u201d that help consumers and businesses use energy more strategically and efficiently. Today, there are more than 260 companies in Ontario working to develop and commercialize technologies that can clean up electricity, make the grid smarter, reduce the carbon footprint of buildings, and drive emissions out of transportation. These companies will be essential in supporting Ontario\u2019s transition to clean power through reliable, price competitive technologies.\n\nTechnology Opportunity: Energy Storage\n\nEnergy storage is a clear example of Ontario\u2019s leadership in clean energy technology. To date, the province\u2019s Independent Electricity System Operator has procured 56 megawatts of grid-connected energy storage, representing more than 6 per cent of all projects installed globally to date (Germany, by comparison, had 67 megawatts installed by the end of 2015). It\u2019s an impressive feat for a jurisdiction accounting for just 0.6 per cent of worldwide electrical generating capacity. Leading companies include Temporal Power (flywheels), Hydrostor (underwater compressed air storage), Electrovaya (lithium-ion batteries), Hydrogenics (hydrogen) and Opus One Solutions (integration\/management). One newcomer to watch is e-Zn, which has developed a zinc-metal energy storage system with potential to dramatically reduce the cost of off-grid and grid-connected energy storage.\n\nEnergy storage has a unique value proposition in that it can play multiple roles in supporting Ontario\u2019s electricity grid, from supporting behind the meter solutions (batteries) to distribution support (flywheels), to bulk system storage (pumped system hydro). While assessing the falling costs of energy storage technology can be complex (as it pertains to assessing the economics of single use cases versus multiple use cases), both the Rocky Mountain Institute and Lazard\u2019s \u2013 a financial advisory firm \u2013 predict significant cost declines in energy storage technologies over the next 5 years.\n\nTechnology Opportunity: Microgrids\n\nAs global energy systems shift towards decentralization, consumers are seeking heightened engagement with providers, and the cost of advanced energy technologies is continuing to fall. As these trends become more pronounced, microgrids have potential to offer benefits to utilities, communities, and industrial customers including enhanced resiliency, provision of grid ancillary services, optimization of assets, customer self-sufficiency, options for more distributed operations, avoided cost opportunities and reduced carbon emissions through integration of renewables.\n\nThe global microgrid market is rapidly expanding. As of November 2016, there were approximately 1,681 microgrid projects in 122 countries with 16,552 MW in capacity. Navigant Research concludes that that the global vendor revenue for microgrids may be as much as\u00a0$20 billion annually by 2020. This represents potentially significant opportunities for investment in and export of Ontario energy innovation in this space, given our expertise in energy storage, smart grid, and behind the meter data technologies.\n\nBoth technology examples bring benefits to Ontario\u2019s energy grid as part of an overall shift to clean power. However, barriers including the current regulatory and legislative framework, the rules and policies affecting Ontario\u2019s local distribution companies and a lack of customer understanding threaten the deployment of these technologies. It is therefore essential that the 2017 LTEP address the structural market barriers in Ontario\u2019s energy system that are hindering the adoption of cost competitive, grid effective, low carbon technologies.\n\nA Leader Within Canada\n\nOntario announced a landmark deal with Quebec in October of this year to transfer power between the two jurisdictions. The amount of hydroelectric power that will flow from Quebec to Ontario each year is enough to power a city with nearly a quarter million people. And because this clean electricity will be replacing natural-gas-fired power, it will cut one million tonnes of GHG emissions.\n\nBy avoiding an unnecessary overbuild of power generation to meet peak demand, this kind of optimization can also help reduce costs. The Ontario and Quebec agreement will see the provinces swap 500 megawatts of power annually, taking advantage of differences in seasonal demand.\u00a0It\u2019s a precedent that can\u2014and should\u2014be built upon to a much larger scale within Canada.\n\nBoth Alberta and Saskatchewan have set laudable targets for increasing the share of renewable power on their grids over the coming decades, they\u2019re still burning fossil fuels for power. But they both neighbour provinces\u2014B.C. and Manitoba\u2014that generate ample hydropower. Through greater integration of their grids, these provinces could cut more carbon pollution faster and gain access to lower-cost electricity. As mentioned in the above, Ontario has an opportunity to share experiences and learnings from both a broader shift to electrification and the shared power agreement with its provincial counterparts.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s\u00a0fall economic update\u00a0reiterated that interprovincial power lines could be a strategic opportunity for federal green infrastructure investment. A\u00a0recent\u00a0poll conducted by Nanos Research and commissioned by Clean Energy Canada found that\u00a082% of respondents said the federal government should help provinces use more clean power.\u00a0Ontario should work with the federal government to secure funding in its interest to support the flow of clean power sources to support peaking and storage on Ontario\u2019s grid.\n\nTHE WAY FORWARD\n\nIn their 2016 World Outlook Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts the future of energy: \u201ccheaper coal and cheaper gas will not derail the transformation and decarbonisation of the world\u2019s power systems. By 2040, zero-emission energy sources will make up 60% of installed capacity. Wind and solar will account for 64% of the 8.6TW of new power generating capacity added worldwide over the next 25 years, and for almost 60% of the $11.4 trillion invested.\u201d Ontario\u2019s LTEP therefore is an important opportunity to plan, not just for the next 10 years, but to set the path for the next 30 years. It is with that view that we offer the following recommendations:\n\n1.Ontario\u2019s 2017 Long-Term Energy Plan serves as a road map for the provinces clean energy future. Considering the increased demand created by the implementation of the CCAP, new power will be supplied by clean resources. This holistic plan will look at decarbonisation across Ontario\u2019s entire energy system including electricity, heating and cooling, transportation, and opportunities to improve energy efficiency.\n\n2.As part of its road map to a clean energy future, Ontario will look to incorporate competitive clean energy technologies. Cost effective and efficient, there are opportunities for innovation and exports in storage, microgrids, and other clean technologies that can bring economic benefit to Ontario in addition to grid efficiencies. This means modernizing Ontario\u2019s energy market system, and reducing barriers that hinder adoption of new technologies.\n\n3.Ontario should continue to play a leadership role within the federation, supporting a\n\nCanada-wide adoption of a strategy to encourage fuel-switching to clean power, and working with the federal government to secure green infrastructure investment that benefits Ontario\u2019s energy system and ultimately, Ontarians.\n\nOntario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan is an opportunity to set outcomes that will realize the broader goals for the province\u2019s future \u2013 reducing GHG\u2019s and growing a prosperous low carbon economy. Energy is vital to that conversation; it is the sector where any climate plan is realized.\n\nWe look forward to working with the Ontario Government, and the Ministry of Energy to help inform the 2017 LTEP.\n\nCONTACT\n\nSarah Petrevan\n\nSenior Policy Advisor\n\nsarah@cleanenergycanada.org\n\n647-999-2992\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207084]\n",

        "comment":"Given the complexity of what is being considered in the province\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan, I have broken down my submission into several categories based on topic.\n\n1) Continued reliance on nuclear energy generation as a significant portion of Ontario's electricity mix:\n\nWhile nuclear energy offers many advantages over fossil fuel generation, continued safe operation of Ontario\u2019s aging nuclear reactors is a primary concern for all Ontarians. OPG has had a particularly poor record when it comes to safety at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. Most recently OPG was heavily fined for violating its licensing requirements. Extending the life of PNGS to 2024 as currently recommended in the long term energy plan represents an unnecessary risk, especially given that the province could easily replace the retired capacity with an equivalent amount of renewable energy coupled with energy storage and inexpensive imports of hydro electricity from Quebec.\n\nFurthermore, the recent rate application by OPG to the Ontario Energy Board to increase the cost of nuclear power by more than double is an indication of the increasing liability of continued operation of Ontario\u2019s aging nuclear fleet. The requested price for nuclear energy will be more than twice the cost of new wind power projects based on the winning bids from the LRP. The province\u2019s reliance on nuclear energy is now a threat to the affordability of electricity, which has been repeatedly identified as a primary concern to ratepayers.\n\n2) Suspending the second round of the Large Renewable Procurement and the Energy from Waste Standard Offer Program:\n\nThe decision to cancel the second round of renewable energy procurement amounting to over 1,000 MW of renewable energy at such a late stage was an enormous mistake, as this has directly resulted in undue hardship to local renewable energy equipment manufacturers and developers. It also sends a message of instability to the market and makes for an uncertain investment climate for companies that provide much needed well paying manufacturing and technology based jobs to the province\u2019s economy. The decision to cancel the LRP runs directly counter to the goal of pursuing a continued reduction in the carbon intensity of the electricity grid.\n\n3) Residential price mitigation:\n\nSubsidies for electricity consumption in the form of rebates such as the \u201cOntario Clean Energy Benefit\u201d, \u201cOntario Electricity Support Program\u201d and the \u201cRural and Remote Electricity Protection\u201d run directly counter to the Ministry of Energy\u2019s own energy conservation goals. Such rebates granted directly on electricity bills are a disincentive to conserve electricity. While support should be provided to low-income households to assist with the living costs, mechanisms such as robust funding programs for increasing household energy efficiency through retrofits would result in both conservation of energy and reduced energy bills. According to NRCan, in 2011 approximately 38% of single-family dwellings in Ontario relied on electricity for space heating and 42% of single-family dwellings relied on electricity for hot water production. Given that hot water use and space-heating make up 85% of the total energy use in a single-family dwelling, focusing on increasing the energy efficiency of these homes would provide a significant benefit for a large proportion of Ontario\u2019s households. Such energy efficiency programs would also reduce the financial burden on all Ontarians, given that according to the Financial Accountability Office of Ontario, the aforementioned rebate programs are funded via charges to all ratepayers. Should additional financial assistance be required, it would be better accomplished through an income tax rebate, as at least then it would not financially reward wasteful energy consumption.\n\n4) Home energy audits and retrofit programs offered through Enbridge and Union Gas:\n\nWhile these programs offer a sizeable benefit for home owners using natural gas for heating and hot water production, rural and low income households that use electricity for space heating and hot water and could benefit the most form energy efficiency upgrades are excluded. Given that over 1\/3 of all households in Ontario rely on electricity for space heating and nearly 50% rely on electricity for hot water heating, a significant proportion of the population receives no benefit from these programs. While carbon emissions savings associated with efficiency upgrades in homes using natural gas may appear to be greater than those for electricity, the age of the building and the existing level of efficiency play very large roles in determining the effectiveness of efficiency upgrades. Adding insulation to a 100 year old house with no insulation would result in a much greater reduction in energy use and green house gas emissions than the same amount of insulation added to a 10 year old house that is already insulated to code minimum levels.\n\n5) Grid integration of electric vehicles and energy storage systems:\n\nLooking to the next decade, electric vehicle uptake is certain to increase along side peak shifting energy storage systems, offering synergies between dispatchable demand and renewable energy generation. Another example would be hydronic heating or cooling systems that rely on water storage tanks that can be dispatched to generate and store thermal energy for heating or cooling during periods of high wind or solar production for use during peak periods, thereby alleviating strain on the electricity grid and helping to increase penetration of renewable energy on the grid.\u00a0 The University of Guelph has a great example of a thermal energy storage system that can store up to 5 MW worth of energy for cooling buildings on campus. Another current example is a net zero energy home on the Bruce Peninsula that uses hydronic heating, relying on hot water heated from off-peak electricity that is then stored in insulated tanks for use during on-peak times. Other examples could include energy storage using electrolysis to produce hydrogen, which can then be stored for conversion back to electricity or as a transportation fuel. A framework needs to be developed to investigate the opportunities that exist from using both currently available and nascent technologies that can be integrated into a smart grid network that is able to facilitate both the addition of more renewable energy to the grid and a flattening of peak demand curves to help reduce the strain. While the 50 MW pilot program for energy storage was a good start, a large concerted push needs to be made to support and rapidly roll out grid energy storage systems to assist in rapid de-carbonization of the electricity grid and transportation network. Not only will this mitigate climate change, it will also help develop a new green technology sector and if planned properly, would facilitate further grid stabilization and resilience.\n\nTo help inform decisions related to development of energy storage, renewable energy and electric vehicles, the Ministry should look to some of the research done by other jurisdictions such as the United States Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). Over the last decade, NREL has undertaken extensive work in this field, including the modelling of entire grids using super computers to determine what effect the level of wind energy penetration and electric vehicle uptake has on grid operation. Publications from these studies are currently available from NREL (http:\/\/www.nrel.gov\/transportation\/project_ev_grid_integration.html), though given the US president elect\u2019s stance on climate change, they may only be accessible for a limited period of time...\n\n6) Expansion of natural gas to rural communities:\n\nThe current goal of the province is to rapidly reduce carbon emissions, however the proposal to increase access to natural gas for use as a heating fuel via expansion of the natural gas pipeline network to rural communities is directly counter to this goal and should not be allowed to occur. A significant proportion of natural gas produced in North America is through the use of hydraulic fracturing which has been shown to have many detrimental effects on communities and ecosystems, including multiple earthquakes that damage buildings, groundwater contamination, ecosystem fragmentation, and proliferation of wastewater ponds to store spent fracking fluid. Therefore, the province should not only cease the expansion of the natural gas network, but also follow the lead of New Brunswick and Quebec in putting moratorium on all hydraulic fracturing well development. For rural communities, redirecting the $230 million currently earmarked for expanding natural gas service and instead investing it in energy efficiency retrofits for homes, farms and businesses, and promoting the use of advanced technologies such as heat pumps for use in drying facilities would both help to increase local jobs in the technology and building sectors and help to reduce carbon emissions. This would be a far better option than spending $230 million in subsidizing fossil fuel use and aiding development of a destructive industry! In fact, even doing nothing at all or just handing rural homeowners and businesses the cash would be a better option than subsidizing natural gas use.\n\n7) Net Zero Energy Communities:\n\nThe province via the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and through the Climate Change Action Plan has announced that all new homes will be net zero energy by 2030. Efforts to develop net zero communities should be harmonized between the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and the Ministry of Energy to avoid unintentional difficulties for the development of such communities. The Ministry of Energy must mandate that grid operators and local distribution companies plan for and accept such developments. Hydro One seems to currently have an arbitrary cap on the amount of distributed generation that they accept on their network. A first step toward reducing barriers for net zero community development would be for the Ministry of Energy to require a third party evaluation of the actual capacity for distributed generation on the grids of companies such as Hydro One. Grid utilities need to be carefully and closely regulated to ensure the goals of carbon emission reductions are not compromised, otherwise Ontario runs the risk of utilities engaging in anti-competitive behaviour such as recently seen in Nevada.\n\n8) Expansion of electricity grid to northern communities:\n\nRather than spending billions of dollars building inefficient long distance electrical transmission lines through the boreal forest and destroying habitat in the process, the money would be better spent on developing localized grids powered by local energy sources that would support local jobs and independence for northern communities. These communities could also double as test beds and living labs for new technologies for management of micro grids and integration of renewable energy and storage.\n\n9) Oil Pipelines \u2013 Energy East:\n\nThe Energy East pipeline should not be allowed to proceed, since repurposing an old natural gas pipeline for transport of diluted bitumen is a risky venture.\u00a0 Improved access to markets would result in further expansion of oil sands, which would quickly negate Ontario\u2019s emission reduction efforts. Given the poor safety records of TransCanada and other pipeline companies in the past, allowing Energy East to proceed would greatly increase the risk of a significant oil spill event in the province. Furthermore, according to a 2015 article in the Ottawa Citizen, the Ontario Energy Board has identified that allowing this conversion would increase winter natural gas prices in the province by 12%. The meager short-term employment opportunities that this pipeline project would provide are just not worth the high risk to drinking water of communities and to sensitive ecosystems.\n\n10) References:\n\nPNGS Regulatory Action 2016: http:\/\/www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca\/eng\/pdfs\/Regulatory_Action\/2016\/20160112-AMP-Ontario-Power-Generatio n-eng.pdf\n\nNRCan 2011. \u201cComprehensive Energy Use Database\u201d, Tables 28, 29 & 35. http:\/\/oee.nrcan.gc.ca\/corporate\/statistics\/neud\/dpa\/showTable.cfm?type=CP&sector=res&juris=ca&rn=2 8&page=0\n\nFinancial Accountability Office of Ontario, 2016. \u201cHome Energy Spending in Ontario: Regional and Income Distribution Perspectives\u201d\n\nhttp:\/\/www.fao-on.org\/en\/Blog\/Publications\/hespending\n\nOttawa Citizen, D.

Alongside the Province\u2019s 1,400 housing providers and 47 Service Managers, we have worked to improve the energy efficiency and sustainability of Ontario\u2019s housing stock.\n\nEnergy is typically the largest operational cost for social housing operators. As such, the future LTEP will have a significant impact on our sector and our ability to meet our community goals. As you work on refining the LTEP, we invite you to consider the impacts and opportunities in social housing.\u00a0 We believe it is critical to develop stronger conservation programs and appropriate infrastructure. For the housing sector to increase its contribution to a conservation-driven LTEP, we recommend:\n\nStronger Conservation Demand Management and Demand Side Management (CDM\/DSM) Programs\n\n\u2022Expand and improve CDM\/DSM programs for social and affordable housing including solutions to address consumption and utility access issues in northern and rural communities.\n\n\u2022Set provincial targets for DSM programs to maximize conservation potential.\n\n\u2022Integrate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in CDM\/DSM program evaluation to improve the alignment of the LTEP with Ontario\u2019s climate change initiatives.\n\nPursuing Innovation and Data Driven Conservation Opportunities\n\n\u2022Encourage the use of new energy-efficient technologies by providing incentives in existing and future funding and financing programs for development, redevelopment and capital repair. \u2022Leverage HSC\u2019s reach and established energy and asset management expertise to support and inform initiatives that promote conservation in this sector.\n\nCreating Appropriate Infrastructure and Clear Pricing Signals\n\n\u2022Account for Ontario\u2019s conservation potential when planning and developing the provincial supply, transmission and distribution infrastructure. An infrastructure that is too large will be extremely costly over the long-term. These costs would result in greater regulated charges and would negatively impact housing providers in the form of higher overall utility costs.\n\n\u2022Develop open, transparent energy markets where the price signals will reward efficiency gains and incent housing providers to conserve and take action to mitigate costs. Such price signals need to be easy to understand and clearly separated on customers\u2019 utility bills.\n\n\u2022Account for the total lifecycle costs and emissions of energy sources including conservation in planning. The assessment of cost effectiveness should factor in the social, economic, and environmental costs of options from the beginning to end of their lifecycle.\n\nWe would be pleased to meet with you to provide further information.\u00a0 Please contact me at (416) 594-9325 ext. 252 or hwong@hscorp.ca, or Myfanwy Parry, Manager of Energy Services, at ext. 308 or mparry@hscorp.ca, to discuss this submission.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHowie Wong\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nHousing Services Corporation\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207088]\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister,\n\nI am writing today on behalf of TREC Renewable Energy Co-op and the Federation of Community Power Co-operatives. Renewable Energy Co-operatives (RE Co-ops) have allowed everyday people in Ontario\u00a0to directly benefit from\u00a0community ownership of energy projects, participate in co-op decision making, and learn about the\u00a0positive environmental impacts of renewable energy and energy conservation.\n\nIn just 5 years, Ontario RE Co-ops have grown to 8,000 members and invested over $85M in local Community Power projects. That figure is expected to triple in the next 18 months.\n\nFor more benefits, see our Power of Community report: trec.on.ca\/report\/the-power-of-community\/\n\nOur members have invested thousands of hours of their time and put their RRSP savings to work into real projects to affect climate change. They are community activists and are very supportive of the government\u2019s initiatives on Climate Change.\n\nWe operate under the 7 guiding principles of co-operatives, to build an enduring democratic civil society. Please accept this as our contribution to the 2017 Long Term Energy Plan. We wish for a positive and collaborative outcome to solving together the challenges ahead.\n\nWe believe that Ontario MUST transition to 100% Renewable Energy by 2050:\n\nTo meet that goal, we need to recruit every citizen, business, organization, public institution and local community to work collaboratively toward that common objective. We need an Energy Transition Plan that lays out the What & When across all sectors:\n\n\u2022Buildings\n\n\u2022Transport\n\n\u2022Electricity\n\n\u2022Agriculture\n\n\u2022Waste Management\n\nWe think the Long Term Energy Plan should be the comprehensive blueprint for that transition.\n\nWe can mobilize Community Capital to invest in local Energy Projects:\n\nRapid technology developments in Distributed Energy Resources are reshaping the energy landscape everywhere. Thousands of smaller local generation projects of today are displacing the massive centralized bulk energy system generators of yesterday. This opens the door to local ownership of those projects \u2013 and our members are ready to take up the challenge.\n\nWhether those investments are in Conservation, Generation, Fuel Switching or Storage, the motivation is the same \u2013 invest in local projects, under local control, which creates local jobs and retains profits in the community.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan should facilitate the mobilization of that willing capital.\n\nWe think Partnerships with local Municipal Governments are the key to rapid adoption:\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the key to each economic stimulus program (whether Federal or Provincial) has been \u2018shovel-ready\u2019 projects that are sponsored and\/or endorsed by local Municipal Councils. But Energy Projects are different \u2013 they are not familiar and well understood projects like roads, bridges, sewers and water treatment facilities. There is a clear need for capacity building at the local level \u2013 and our members can help.\n\nEach of the RE Co-ops across the Province has learned how to tap into the expertise and skills of their membership. We draw upon willing capable volunteers to identify promising projects, to mobilize community capital, to marshal technical resources. We have proven our capabilities to develop, construct and maintain successful projects. We know how to work cooperatively and collaboratively. We make good partners.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan should foster partnerships between Municipalities and RE Co-ops to co-invest in local energy projects of all types.\n\nWe are convinced that this transition must put Conservation first:\n\nTo fight climate change and reduce our environmental footprint, Ontario\u2019s next energy plan must make conservation and efficiency the first priority for all energy decisions. This principle has to apply to our buildings, institutions, industries and transportation systems.\n\nThe \u201cAchievable Potential Study\u201d submitted to the IESO in June 2016, showed we have the potential to cost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30% by 2035.\u00a0I think the government should pursue and promote all cost-effective conservation measures.\n\nWe have asked for the Renewable Energy Co-operative definition to be changed from \u201celectricity\u201d to \u201cenergy\u201d. Our established RE Co-ops are a natural fit to provide community based financing of energy efficiency retrofits, district heating and conservation.\n\nWe want to see local communities take control of their energy futures:\n\nWe believe the Long Term Energy Plan must open the door to Community Power. The Ontario Energy Board will unleash massive new private investments through a simple regulatory change to mandate Virtual Net-metering across the Province. Existing RE Co-ops will be able to scale up by an order of magnitude if allowed to supply our local Municipalities under long-term Power Purchase Agreements. And there will be a surge in new start-up RE Co-ops everywhere but especially in the smaller rural townships.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan needs to consider the scale and scope of the impending surge in local energy autonomy. This momentum, spurred by outspoken leaders such as Oxford County and County of Brant, cannot be stopped. If ignored, the outdated centralized system will face escalating stranded assets and an enraged public for decades.\n\nWe ask that the government wean Ontario off of nuclear over the next 15-20 years:\n\nThe world is embracing Distributed Energy Resources, in contrast with the centralized model of the 1960s. The good news is that good jobs will migrate to the local communities alongside the adoption of local energy projects.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan is the ideal place to build a compelling foundation for that transition a.From 2016 supply mix to 100% RE mix\n\nb.From Centralized Grid systems to fully distributed microgrid systems\n\nc.From external energy dependencies to resilient communities\n\nd.From monopoly supply chains to local jobs and local ownership\n\nWe cannot allow the current system to collapse \u2013 but we need the majority of our efforts and investments to be put into the new systems.\n\nWe are committed to help change the tone of the public discourse around the energy file:\n\nThe public has to be involved \u2013 not in \u2018conversations\u2019 but in actions, projects, investments, innovations, outcomes. There is a groundswell of public support as evidenced by the surge in RE Co-ops across the Province, in terms of memberships and dollars invested.

        "comment":"December 15, 2016\n\nOntario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan \u2013 Formal Submission\n\nTim Clutterbuck, Chair of EDAP of Region of Niagara\n\nRepresenting:\u00a0 Industrial Power Users of Niagara,\n\nNiagara Region Economic Development Advisory Panel.\n\nAffiliate Organization: Concerned Manufacturers of Ontario\n\nOccupation:\u00a0 President of ASW Steel Inc.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nEscalating energy costs are impacting the competitiveness of manufacturing in Ontario. Electricity incentive programs in neighboring jurisdictions (NY, MI, PA, OH) use low cost power as a tool for economic development and job retention. This strategy is supported by low cost electricity exports from Ontario power sources. IESO incentive programs are best suited to manufacturers with significant load shedding flexibility and do not in any way protect jobs within facilities experiencing high load factors. This leaves certain large employers in highly competitive sectors (i.e. automotive, microbial and other continuous operations) with no domestic alternatives for competitively priced power. For others, the current programs such as ICI (Industrial Conservation Initiative), IEI (Industrial Electricity Incentive), Industrial Accelerator Program (IAP) and Demand Response (DR) have onerous rules and restrictions that hinder most companies from fully utilizing their intended benefits.\n\nThe competitive landscape has been further impacted by Cap and Trade and the Climate Change Action Plan which will add cost and complexity with reduced transparency and little or no recourse to mitigating strategies.\n\nThese initiatives appear to place the various impacted Ontario Ministries such as the Ministry of Economic Development and Growth, Ministry of Energy and Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change at odds with each other. Creating an environment that is fertile for maintaining and growing industry is clearly more difficult in an environment that piles on regulatory requirements and costs for power and emissions reduction. The Ministries do not appear to have a uniform, holistic plan to provide affordable power to Ontario residents that retains and attracts industry while adequately addressing environmental concerns. The current Climate Change Action plan falls short in this regard. It may be possible to address the funding of Green House Gas (GHG) emission reduction initiatives by reducing the ongoing cost of electricity to those prepared to participate.\n\nIn this submission recommendations will be made that speak to improvements in each of the existing programs as well as a strategy that rewards willing Climate Change participants with immediately reduced power costs.\n\nCost Competitiveness\n\nOntario manufacturers competing with US companies are at a considerable cost disadvantage with respect to electricity. Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and Michigan offer discounts in the range of 15-30% on electricity rates to industry that are already lower than Ontario. In addition, Ontario exports electricity to US states at a discount over what manufacturers pay in Ontario thus subsidizing US manufacturers while penalizing Ontario residents and businesses.\n\nCurrent Programs\n\nThe current programs offered through the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) to reduce electricity costs for manufacturers, reduce consumption and demand were and are welcome by the manufacturing community. The main programs are summarized below:\n\nIEI\n\nIEI was a program intended to increase the base electrical load in Ontario while providing lower costs to new companies or those expanding. The program was initially offered in December 2012, offered again in 2013 (stream 2) and 2014 (Stream 3). It was undersubscribed and not well publicized. The companies that did sign up were new entities or had previously closed and recognized the opportunity to restart with substantially lower electricity costs. IEI was not offered to existing companies as a tool to allow them to be more competitive and retain Ontario jobs. IEI stream 3 did not have a requirement for employment in the contract. Participants were only required to add facilities to participate in the program and not actually hire additional staff. IEI contracts run for a maximum of 10 years resulting in the current contracted companies being faced with a return to high electricity costs at some point within the next 10 years. The IEI program is not currently available to industry.\n\nThe contracts were 82 pages long with detailed energy consumption data required for submission and complex calculations needed to determine the net energy cost to a participant. The level of detail may have dissuaded potential participants from signing up.\n\nICI\n\nICI is available to all Class A companies in Ontario. The intent of ICI is to reduce the global adjustment component of the monthly electricity bill if the company shuts down for the 5 highest electricity demand hours in Ontario. The 5 peaks usually happen during periods of hot weather in the Greater Toronto Area. In order to hit all of the 5 peaks and maximize the savings it is necessary to curtail production 15-20 times in the summer months, often with less than 1-2 days advance notice. In order to minimize the risk of missing a peak, a company would have to shut down more than 15 days per year and as long as 6 hours per peak occurrence. IESO website data has been less than reliable for use as a prediction tool on peak days. On some days the predicted peak is changed 3-4 times throughout the day and the timing can shift by hours from the IESO prediction. The IESO website data has also been unavailable during peak demand days.\n\nLarge industrial users that are unable to shed load by curtailing production can only make use of this program have the option of behind the meter generation can reduce peak demand. This option requires significant capital investment.\n\nThe hourly peaks are difficult to predict as the IESO estimates are rarely correct. The ICI program itself causes the peak to be more of a plateau over several hours throughout a peak day. The result is that a facility must remain down longer to hit the hourly peak to keep their electricity costs at a reduced rate.\n\nFurther complicating the ICI program is the requirement to use AQEW data to determine the actual peak and timing thereof. This data is available 20 business days after the peak event. The AQEW has shifted the daily peak hour which can negate the effort by a company to reduce load. This impacts the participant as it requires the participant to shut down for additional time to compensate for the potential peak shift caused by the AQEW.\n\nEligibility in the ICI program will be expanded to include companies with peak loads as low as 1MW. This will allow smaller firms to participate and potentially lower their electricity costs. A new company willing to start in Ontario will not have this program available to them initially as it requires a history of electrical consumption to determine eligibility.\n\nIAP\n\nIAP is a program that includes various incentive programs that can provide limited funding for energy managers and various energy efficiency projects such as lighting upgrades, air compressors, HVAC replacements, variable speed drives, etc.\n\nIAP is a valuable program to companies that cannot otherwise utilize the IEI or ICI programs and as a result pay high electricity prices. This aids those in that category in getting energy projects funded with attractive paybacks. Companies that take full advantage of ICI and IEI have extended paybacks on energy projects due to lower electricity costs\/kwh and the project incentives offered only improve the payback slightly. Further the incentives usually come well after the work is completed restricting cash flow as the incentive is processed.\n\nIAP incentives are analyzed and audited using a third party energy consultant firm headquartered in the US.\n\nThe savings calculations usually require fairly rigid criteria to meet and often requiring third party consultants and metered data at extra cost to calculate the savings. Options for incentives can follow different paths (prescriptive, engineered or custom) each with its own set of rules.\n\nThe IAP program has the ability to further add to the Ontario economy. If this program was fully utilized Ontario companies supplying goods and services related to the energy efficiency projects would gain this additional business. IAP also helps in reducing carbon emissions by reducing ongoing energy consumption.\n\nDR\n\nDR is a program that pays major electricity customers to reduce load on days of extremely high demand in Ontario. Similar programs are available in other jurisdictions. It does not lower energy rates but does provide a revenue stream for companies with the ability to curtail production during peak demand. A participating company is paid for the ability to reduce electricity load but may or may not be required to actually reduce load on the grid unless required. The curtailment expected for a DR participant would be <20 hours per year. The participating company is paid regardless of whether a curtailment is required or not.\n\nDemand Charges\n\nElectrical demand charges are billed each month as a line item termed the Network Service Charge (NSC). This charge is based on the peak demand a company uses in that billing month. The value is determined as the greatest of 85% of the peak demand between 7 am and 7pm Monday to Friday or 100% of the coincident demand during the Ontario Peak Demand Hour for the month. With the institution of residential time of use charges and ICI, the peak demand hour is being pushed later in the day and can occur after 7 pm. This causes extra costs to be foisted on companies that are otherwise managing their NSC by running afternoon shifts or delaying production starts to avoid the NSC premium.\n\nNatural Gas\n\nThe natural gas industry in Ontario when compared to the electrical industry is managed in a far more transparent and efficient manner. Billing is straightforward and the costs are Ontario Energy Board (OEB) published and approved rates. Pricing is fairly predictable as the rates are approved quarterly by the OEB. Industrial customers are given a menu of various contract options based on their consumption pattern that can provide the best rate based on a customer\u2019s daily demand, curtailment capability and right rate.\n\nNatural gas rates have generally been comparable with neighboring jurisdictions, however the addition of Cap and Trade surcharges will increase the cost of Natural Gas and reduce the competitiveness of manufacturing in Ontario.\n\nNatural gas savings incentive programs are far less onerous in terms of applying for and receiving compensation for projects. In the case of Enbridge, all of the paperwork, energy calculations, site inspections are handled by the area representative for energy efficiency. Incentives are quickly received upon completion of the projects.\n\nCap and Trade\n\nCap and trade was started in 2016 and was quickly put into motion. Registration to be a cap and trade market participant is an onerous process requiring excessive business and personal information be supplied by those involved. In most cases 3rd party specialists were needed to calculate current carbon emission levels and assist in the registration process at added cost. Much of this registration work was done without information regarding program costs that would have aided companies that were voluntary participants to make an informed decision on participating.\n\nCap and Trade legislation is leading to an overall increase in the cost of doing business in Ontario. The initial increase to natural gas rates for companies not registered as large emitters is over 17%. As the cost of cap and trade is seen by most as a tax \u2013 Natural gas will now be taxed at a rate of over 30% when Cap and Trade and HST is combined. The Natural Gas surcharge will also impact electricity prices as 5-10% of Ontario electricity is produced from Natural Gas. This additional charge will likely be included in the global adjustment.\n\nAdditional costs due to cap and trade may have the unintentional consequence of increasing worldwide carbon emissions by forcing manufacturing to jurisdictions that do not regulate carbon emissions.\n\nClimate Change Action Plan\n\nThe current climate change action plan has over 70 actions listed. It is expected that this plan will form the basis of the Long Term Energy Plan. Only one action item timed to start in 2018 pledges to help industry transition to low carbon technologies.\n\nRecommendations\n\n1.Offer an alternative program similar to IEI for companies willing remain or expand in Ontario. Key elements of the program should include:\n\na.Multiple streams \u2013 retention, expansion, new \u2013 each requiring different criteria such as employment, load retention, capital investment, etc.\n\nb.Identify that a solid and reliable base demand is good for electricity generators as well as the overall consumer base and use this program to provide GA rebate coverage for up to 50% of a company\u2019s base load.\u00a0 \u201cContract Volume\u201d allowances at elevated \u201cContract Demand Factors\u201d can be directly tied to a requirement for reduced GHG emissions as well as employment retention.\u00a0 These reductions can come from any energy source (Natural Gas, Fuel Oil, Gasoline, Electricity, etc.). Such a program is then consistent with MOECC and MEDG initiatives.\u00a0 This program should be geared for companies incapable of economically shedding load and thus making all existing programs unsuitable.\u00a0 The resultant electricity rate should be competitive with surrounding jurisdictions (NY, PA, OH, WI, MI, MB, QC).\u00a0 Specific examples are available upon request;\n\nc.Availability of the program to existing businesses with a goal of retaining employment;\n\nd.Provide relative price stability for the participant over a 10 year span;\n\ne.Reduce contract complexity and eliminate economic burden of Letters of Credit;\n\nf.Rebate calculations made straightforward \u2013 or offer a flat rate;\n\ng.Extend current stream 3 contracts for 5 additional years;\n\n2.Restructure the ICI program. Key changes should include:\n\na.Allow participants a \u201cmulligan\u201d \u2013 for example 5 of the 7 highest peaks to determine PDF In lieu of meeting the 5 peaks;\n\nb.Remove the AQEW from determining the 5 peaks \u2013 or provide real time AQEW updating on IESO\u2019s website;\n\nc.Require the IESO to estimate a specific peak range on the peak days instead of the peak hour\n\nonly allowing participating companies to better plan their shutdowns to reduce negative impacts to their business while still reducing Ontario load during peak demand;\n\nd.Require the IESO to better predict the peak and not penalize the customer if the IESO did not accurately predict the timing. For example if the peak is estimated from 2-4 pm and it comes in at 1 or at 5. The customer should have its PDF based on the IESO predicted timing. Third parties currently offer a service that better predicts peaks than IESO with performance guarantees, however IESO should be able to provide this service as part of their mandate to all industry in Ontario. e.IESO must ensure reliability and accuracy for their online data. This is a key tool used by all ICI participants to determine when to curtail production and if it is not reliable and accurate can have a significant impact on a company by either causing it to miss a peak or curtail production unnecessarily thus incurring considerable additional costs.\n\n3.Rework the IAP. Key changes should include:\n\na.Fast track release of incentives. Smaller companies have less tolerance for an impact to cash flow and are reluctant to enter into incentive programs where the payment is a long time coming; b.Offer no interest loans for energy projects;\n\nc.Offer better incentives for companies fully embracing ICI and IEI so that the simple paybacks\n\nare more attractive to business. Incentives should support a simple payback of 2 years;\n\nd.Simplify the energy savings calculations and reduce the incentive path options;\n\ne.Reduce the overall complexity in getting incentive programs started, approved and paid out. 4.Demand Charges:\n\na.Remove the NSC based on the Coincident Ontario Peak hour and leave it at 85% of the peak between 7am and 7pm. If necessary change or extend the peak hours to accommodate the shift in the timing of the peak to later in the day;\n\nb.Allow a best of \u201cmulligan\u201d provision for the NSC (for example: average of the highest 5 of 7 peaks for the month). This will allow participating companies some leeway in disrupting their production while trying to minimize their peak demands.\n\n5.Natural Gas:\n\na.Natural gas should remain as a viable energy option. The natural gas Industry\u2019s price transparency and customer service should serve as an example for the Ontario electrical industry as a whole.\n\n6.Cap and Trade:\n\na.Transparency is required on Cap and Trade costs on Natural Gas and electricity rates;\n\nb.Commit to reduce the impact of Cap and Trade on the Industrial base in Ontario;\n\nc.Ensure that businesses do not just vacate Ontario to other jurisdictions where regulations allow carbon emissions. This will lead to carbon emission reductions in Ontario but will only transfer the problem elsewhere. It will also result in a higher burden for remaining businesses to support the natural gas and electrical infrastructure.\n\n7.Climate Change Action Plan:\n\na.Increase actions under the plan for Industry as a whole. Consult industry representatives for assistance;\n\nb.Tie GHG reductions to energy programs at reduced rates such as an IEI replacement.\n\nConclusions\n\n1.Retention of long standing businesses in Ontario that do not have the ability to curtail production need to be addressed in future IESO programs.\n\n2.Job retention needs to be included as an important criteria for economic development as it relates to energy rates unlike other jurisdictions in North America.\n\n3.Ontario Ministries must effectively collaborate to provide a comprehensive, uniform plan to address the high Ontario energy cost and environmental concerns while providing a competitive economic environment for existing industry and future investment in Ontario.\n\n4.Existing programs (IEI, ICI and IAP) need modification to widen participation to allow\n\nbusinesses access to competitive power rates and provide the ability to reduce consumption to small, mid and large industries in Ontario with a focus on retaining existing and attracting new businesses.\n\n5.GHG reduction goals should be included in future IESO programs as a condition of participation. 6.Natural Gas must remain an energy option for industry in the future. Its costs must be managed\n\nso that existing manufacturing facilities remain viable and future investment is encouraged in Ontario.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nTim Clutterbuck\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207093]\n",

        "comment":"We are pleased to have received and reviewed the Ontario Planning Outlook from the IESO and the Technical Fuels Report prepared by Navigant Consulting. We are also pleased to have received and reviewed the Consultation Discussion Guide.\u00a0 Collectively, these documents represent a positive step toward a viable long term energy planning process.\n\nWe are in agreement with the 2016 amendments to the Electricity Act, 1998, as amended in 2016, that require the following changes:\n\n\u2022The Ministry of Energy must consider the IESO report.\n\n\u2022There must be a public consultation, conducted through the Environmental Registry.\n\n\u2022The Plan must consider all energy sources, not just electricity.\n\nWe are troubled by the following:\n\n\u2022In spite of the IESO and the OEB having significant experience in managing the supply and conservation of electricity, and the responsibility to promote a viable, sustainable and efficient energy sector that serves the public interest and assists consumers to obtain reliable energy services that are cost effective, respectively, both of these organizations have been overtaken in managing their roles in the recent past by the Ministry of Energy.\n\n\u2022There is a lack of transparency regarding the rationale for final decisions to be made in the LTEP.\n\n\u2022LTEP has previously adhered to a thirty-six month period between the 2010 version and the 2013 version, but for the 2017 version the interval will be forty-two months, this when the need would seem to be for a shorter, not a longer, interval.\n\n\u2022The consideration of Conservation First in the Discussion Guide is not positioned as a primary resource or activity, in spite of its descriptor. The focus on reducing energy use is critical for existing buildings, and the current effort in CDM and DSM by the electricity and natural gas distributors must be accelerated, rather than play a lessor role in the LTEP.\n\nThe Climate Change Action Plan targets for GHG reductions of 15% by 2020, 37% by 2030, and 80% by 2050 are aggressive and can only be met by aggressive actions. To do this, they need to be considered in all aspects of the LTEP. This is especially important when it is realized that LTEP will now address over 70% of current Ontario GHG emissions, and the many changes to the current sources and uses of fuels and electricity that are proposed, including:\n\n\u2022Electrification of space heating, transportation, and industrial energy use. \u2022Alternative fuels in place of petroleum and natural gas.\n\n\u2022Conservation of natural gas.\n\nIn Ontario, space and water heating represent approximately 60% of the total energy use in the buildings sectors. These uses are primarily served by relatively inexpensive natural gas. Electrification of these end uses will bring significant additional demands on the electricity system and will also burden building and home owners with higher utility bills unless major investments in energy efficiency are made to off-set this increase.\u00a0 Energy efficient design of new buildings and the energy conservation retrofit of existing buildings will help to reduce these operating cost increases, but only when significant investments in capital projects are made by their owners. For these reasons, ensuring that financing is available for energy retrofit of existing homes and buildings will be a key factor.\n\nWe suggest that Local Improvement Charges offered through municipalities would be an ideal option that would extend the payback periods so that energy costs savings equal, or exceed the annual repayments. Property loans would be off balance sheet to the owners and the municipality would have all the powers to enforce repayment granted by the Municipal Act for the collection of property taxes.\n\nBuilding owners are very sensitive to the cost of energy to heat, cool, and otherwise power their buildings. Any actions that can be taken to slow the annual cost increase of electricity, or even reverse it, would be of great value to the buildings sector.\n\nAs the Building Code moves towards net zero homes and buildings, the most likely source of renewable electricity will be building-mounted and\/or building integrated solar PV, with some electricity from off-site renewable sources offered by a vendor.\u00a0 Combining solar PV with site electricity storage will require net metering for the sale and\/or purchase of electricity to the local distribution company (LDC). While this has significant potential for reducing the overall load on the local or regional electricity system, the recompense for the sale must be sufficient to justify building owners and operators making the investment in larger and more extensive solar PV systems, and the associated storage. \u00a0 Like the energy efficiency issue, the appropriate price signals, including potential incentives must be in place to induce the desired investment from the buildings sectors.\n\nFinally, we note that the move to electrification is driven by the notion that our electricity generation is \u201cgreen\u201d.\u00a0 It is the case that the current mix of generation assets represent low carbon sources, however a significant dependence on nuclear assets is also troubling.\u00a0 Nuclear based generation has cost and reliability implications and potentially significant long term environmental and economic repercussions related to the disposal of nuclear waste.\u00a0 Our preference would see a significant reduction in dependence on nuclear assets and a corresponding increase in renewable assets.\n\nWe look forward to receiving the completed LTEP report, and would be pleased to provide any further information and\/or guidance if requested.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207095]\n",

        "comment":"I encourage the Minister to initiate changes to the OBC (Ontario Building Code) so that \u2013 starting as soon as possible \u2013 all new detached and semi-detached housing starts MUST have between 1000 W and 2000 W (1 kW to 2 kW) of Solar PV installed on a Net Metered arrangement (or some reasonable % of building area). Further, all building permits should adhere to some expected level of electrical energy efficiency.\n\nConservation First\n\nThere is a conflict of interest with the current Energy Conservation programs being administered by IESO as LDC\u2019s are of the energy delivery mindset that even the CDM reduction target incentives will fail in persuading. As such, decisions made by IESO\/LDC\u2019s lead one to believe real change towards true energy efficiency is stymied in-favour of higher energy options.\n\nTo really drive home the Conservation First message, I encourage the Minister to impose penalties equivalent to the incentives provided by LDC CDM Target and Budget Allocations such that if energy reduction targets are not met verbatim, LDC\u2019s will be fined the equivalent of double the reward. Currently most LDC\u2019s are not focused on energy conservation and the IESO has an inherent build-more mindset based on ever increasing energy demand.\n\nI also encourage the Minister to support development of advance energy processing systems for commercial\/industrial buildings with flat roofs that can easily accommodate roof top solar PV.\n\nAvoid Top Down Centralized Planning\n\nI encourage the Minister to stop using only top down models based on centralized energy and delivery plans with ever increasing base load. The OPO data shows the past decade increased slightly but when exports are considered it decreased. Unfortunately the OPO does not include clear import\/export data therefore a true picture of provincial energy ebb and flow is unknown.\n\nCommunity Power\n\nEncourage Sustainable Development by mandating the IESO and the LDCs to allow Community Power. Communities must be permitted to act independently and develop their own low-carbon energy systems that support their own local economy. The goal should be to move towards regional and community energy self-sufficiency. This can be achieved \u2013 if allowed and encouraged \u2013 and it will serve to benefit the existing infrastructure by reducing line losses; a win-win for all.\n\nAn integrated approach must be permitted such that privately-owned, DG, energy conservation, storage, and community energy self-sufficiency can flourish. These will all be integral to the future distribution and transmission systems therefore steps must be taken now in LTEP 2017 to prepare the grid for islands of power input.\n\nBio Energy is largely ignored in the planning documents yet there is great potential in all parts of Ontario and those communities that already have systems connected need billing adjustments made so they are not treated as consumers. Encourage Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants thereby maximizing efficiency and flexibility.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207096]\n",

Some of our member Unions are directly involved with the electricity system in Ontario whereas others are indirectly involved.\n\nThe CNWC participated in several of the Public Consultations which were held during November 2016. We have reviewed the documentation that has been provided in regards to the LTEP.\n\nUnions that represent workers in the electrical power sector are well positioned to provide advice on the LTEP as their members are the people who operate and maintain the electrical power system from the start to finish. Our comments will be from this perspective.\n\nThe CNWC will comment on the following areas of the LTEP\n\n- Consultations Sessions held in November 2016.\n\n- Ontario\u2019s Energy mix \u2013 Electricity\n\n- Demand Forecast for Electricity\n\n- Electricity pricing\n\n- Distribution and Grid Modernization\n\n- Conservation and Energy Efficiency\n\n- Clean Energy Supply\n\n- Wind Turbines & Solar Panels\n\n- Electricity Storage\n\n- Nuclear Power\n\n- Supply Mix\n\n- CNWC conclusions and recommendations\n\nConsultations Sessions held in November 2016.\n\nThe CNWC participated in several of these sessions along with representatives from our member unions.\n\nOn the positive side these sessions provided for good discussions on energy issues with participants from a variety of sectors including politicians. The format was good with many views being expressed on the topics with some agreement expressed on several issues.\n\nUnfortunately, we suggest, that the system was flawed as on the wrap up sessions the facilitators only reported on issues that lined up with the LTEP discussion document. Issues where the group did not agree or suggested improvements were not reported.\n\nOntario\u2019s Energy mix \u2013 Electricity\n\nThe CNWC agrees that a diverse mix of generation is essential in Ontario. Our conclusions from the 2005 vs 2015 scenario differ from the conclusions drawn in the discussion document.\n\nIn 2005 Ontario had an installed capacity for electrical generation of approximately 31,000 MW. The peak power required in 2007 was approximately 27,200 MW. The TWH hours in 2005 was 156.\n\nLooking at 2015 the installed capacity was 39,000 MW. The peak power requirement in 2015 was approximately 23,000 MW and the power production was 160 TWH. Source: Ontario Planning Outlook, 2016\n\nIn 2016 the installed capacity will exceed 40,000 MW.\n\nThe system is designed to meet the peak demand and naturally not all generation supplies are always available so excess installed capacity is required.\n\nIn 2007 with a peak of 27,200 MW the system had an installed capacity of 31,000 mw or 3800 MW reserve whereas in 2015 with a peak of approximately 22,500 MW the system had 39,000 MW or 17,500 MW in excess capacity. The total annual load demand between 2005 and 2015 were very similar (156 TWH vs 160 TWH)\n\nThe CNWC suggest that with the proper mix of generation such a large amount of excess generation would not be required. Therefore the energy mix is not correct. We further suggest that this very large increase in installed capacity was not necessary and has contributed to the excessively high cost of electricity to the rate payers.\n\nIn regards to emissions we agree that there has been a large reduction since 2005. We contribute this to Nuclear Power\u2019s role in being the major supplier of electricity in Ontario.\n\nThe CNWC suggest that this trend will not continue.\n\nWith the Nuclear Units being shut down for refurbishment (a very good & necessary imitative), an increasing demand, the eventual shut down of the Pickering Nuclear Power Plant, the fluctuations in wind power supply, etc emissions of GHG will drastically increase. The simple reason for this being that there will be an increased in GHG emitting gas fired power generation.\n\nDemand Forecast for Electricity\n\nThe CNWC agrees with outlooks C&D in the demand scenarios.\n\nLooking at the period 2005 \u2013 2015 which resulted in a reduction in peak and only a small increase in overall demand (156 TWH to 160TWH) we suggest that this was due to the following:\n\n-\u00a0 Total load reduction due to the loss of industrial load in 2008 \u2013 2009\n\n-\u00a0 Peak reduction due to successful load shedding and load shifting programs.\n\n-\u00a0 Conservation initiatives\n\nThe CNWC suggest that we will not see additional decreases in the areas above in the next ten years.\n\nElectricity Pricing\n\nHydro costs are very much in the forefront. Workers in the power industry are naturally ratepayers as well. They are feeling the pressures of the high prices as well as pressure from the public as they are the front line electrical workers.\n\nThe CNWC suggest that one of the main drivers on the price of electricity is the Green Energy plan. To have 6000 MW of high cost wind power that has a capacity factor of 20% or less is not acceptable.\n\nThe three prong pricing for electrical rates, we suggest, was introduced to reduce power demand during peak periods. Back in 2007 the system was stretched to meet the peak demand. Moving ahead to 2016 there is now an excess of 17,500 MW of installed capacity above the peak power demand. This amount of installed capacity is planned to increase. Granted all of this capacity is not all available at peak demand periods.\n\nHowever there now is a sufficient amount of reserve power available to meet the daily peak therefore ratepayers need not be penalized for using power during periods of high demand.\n\nDistribution, Grid Modernization, Transmission and Interconnections\n\nIt is very important to have a system that provided stability of supply to industry, businesses, and the public. However, there appears to be more and more outages.\n\nThere is a major increase in back-up generator installations. This is for all ratepayer groups. The emissions from these generators we suggest are not included in the emissions reports for the electrical power industry.\n\nLow maintenance and replacement of the transmission and distribution systems is the biggest factor in outages. Outages are very costly for everyone.\n\nOutages in cottage country in Ontario is an example. Utilities appear to have cut back on the frequency of tree trimming. Walk down a cottage road and one can see many potential outages due to tree branches being too close to the distribution lines.\n\nGrid modernization can improve response time for outages and also provide efficiencies.\n\nMany critics promote using power from other jurisdictions. Energy systems are normally designed for self-sufficiency for the jurisdiction. Tie lines are good for stabilization of the grid, sharing power from time to time, to assist in power shortages, providing a means of selling excess power, etc.\n\nThere are many interconnections within the Ontario Grid. It must be remembered that there are line losses when electricity is transmitted over long distances and large transmission line are very expensive, take a long time to build, and face public opposition. In many cases it is probably cheaper to build new generating facilities than transmitting power long distances.\n\nImports from Quebec are promoted. Interestingly, Ontario exports power to Quebec in the winter months.\n\nConservation and Energy Efficiency\n\nThe CNWC supports conservation measures.\n\nWe believe there have been some good gains to the improvements in the efficiencies of electrical equipment of all types, including commercial and personal item. There will be some but small gains in these area in the future. Electrical items require power to operate and always will so they can only make more efficient use of electricity they cannot eliminate the requirement.\n\nWe suggest that load shifting and shedding techniques have been utilized to the maximum.\n\nWith more and more people moving to Ontario each year the residential load will increase. Add to this the continuing introduction of devices that are powered by electricity. The electrification of the transportation industry will increase the overall demand but may have a minimal effect on peak load.\n\nConservation measures have to be seriously considered but they are not an end all solution.\n\nClean Energy Supply\n\nSome critics believe that the electrical system can be 100% supplied by renewables. This is not possible now or in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe CNWC suggest that the term renewables should be eliminated and replaced with the term Clean Energy. Nuclear Power is a clean energy supply.\n\nStorage\n\nThe CNWC supports the storage option in some scenarios specifically in hydroelectric production. The best example being the OPGs pump storage facility at the Sir Adam Beck Pump Generating Station at Niagara Falls.\n\nIt is suggested that these type of facilities could be powered by Nuclear Energy in the off peak hours.\n\nPump storage generation is dispatchable which is required by the grid.\n\nHydroelectric\n\nThese plants produce nearly no GHG. Some of these plants can follow the load demand similar to gas plants. They naturally operate on water. Water is a variable commodity due to the fact that some years there is more water than other years. These fluctuations will probably increase due to climate change.\n\nWind Power\n\nThe amount of wind power must be capped.\n\nTo have 6000 MW of an intermittent supply that is only available 20% of the time is not practical or cost effective. Wind power is costly 13.3 cents\/kwh compared to Nuclear at 6.8 cents\/kwh (OEB May 2016). There are many reports that calculate wind power as being much more expensive than being reported. Also wind power is available in low demand times.\n\nThere is an excessive and continuing amount of public opposition to wind farms. This was expressed by local politicians at the LTEP Consultations.\n\nWind turbines have a life expectancy of approximately 20 years \u2013 25 years. There are studies now that suggest these turbines may only last for 12 years. Some studies indicate that gear boxes have to be replaced after 10 \u2013 12 years. Are there any guarantees from the Wind Power Suppliers that they will repair\/refurbish wind turbines that fail in 10 \u2013 15 years? Is there a decommissioning plan in place to remove old wind turbines?\n\nThe LTEP is looking ahead for 20 years. It is suggested that many of the current wind turbines will possibly be reaching the end of life status beginning in a few years.\n\nSolar Panels\n\nSolar Panels also need to be revisited. What is their life expectancy? Studies suggest that inverters will require replacement in a 10 \u2013 15 year period. Inverters are costly. Will solar suppliers replace these devices?\n\nThese panels also lose efficiency with age. The Ontario environment, we suggest, is very extreme and may result in a more rapid deterioration of these panels. They contain some heavy chemicals. Is there any decommissioning plans in place? Again their intermittent supply causes issues.\n\nSome wind and solar will benefit the grid but the amounts have to be considered. The intermittent operation requires GHG emitting Gas Power Plants to make up the power short falls. When Gas Power Plants have load swings due to intermittent wind power they do not have an efficient gas burn compared to a steady state condition. This results in an increase in GHG emissions.\n\nWhen looking at electrical generation supplies the economic factors have to be considered. Jobs created are a major factor. When one passes by a wind farm or solar farm how many workers do you see? None or very few.\n\nGas Power Plants\n\nThis form of generation is required due to the fluctuating outputs of Wind and Solar generation. These plants are very good at meeting the changing demand and as back -up for other generator outages.\n\nLooking ahead they will be required more in the future as the load demand increases and especially after Pickering NPP is shut down.\n\nThe cost of power from these plants is high for several reasons. First of all they do not operate all the time. As they back-up wind and solar the true cost is the gas plant costs plus the wind or solar costs. Secondly, we suggest, that gas plant owners have to be guaranteed a certain return on their investment so they will be paid for being on standby.\n\nGas Plants do not require many workers. Their fuel supply is their largest cost. Prices are stable now but have the potential of increasing in the future which will naturally increase the cost of the electricity produced.\n\nA good example of the jobs scenario. A Gas plant, Brighton Beach, Windsor, Ontario, 600 MW. There are approximately 27 workers. A similar size Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), 650 MW, Candu 6, Point LePreau NPP, New Brunswick, 700 plus workers. What will be better for a community a GHG emitting gas plant with 27 jobs or a NPP with no GHG emissions and 700 plus jobs?\n\nNuclear Power\n\nNuclear Power Plants (NPP) currently supply up to 60% of Ontario\u2019s electrical demand. They emits no GHG and have a very high capacity factor. Add to this that the cost of electricity from the NPP is 6.8 cents\/KWH.\n\nIt is very important that the OPG Darlington NPP and the Bruce Power NPP be refurbished. These refurbished NPP will provide stable, reliable, cost-effective and carbon free supply of electricity for the people of Ontario for the next 40 plus years.\n\nThese NPP refurbishments will greatly benefit the Ontario economy. The majority of the components required for the refurbs will be supplied by Ontario Companies. There will be 20,000 plus jobs created by these projects.\n\nIt has to be pointed out that these projects are costly. The Bruce Power Refurb will be financed by the owners of Bruce Power and not Ontario\u2019s ratepayers.\n\nNPP supply base load power. Base load power will, we suggest, increase over the years and therefore so should the supply of Nuclear Power.\n\nCNWC Conclusions\n\nWe suggest that a diverse mix of generation is required but the LTEP discussion document must revisit the proposed mix.\n\nRenewable sources of power are good for the environment. Environmentalist believe that these sources are only solution and can meet the electricity requirements of Ontario. The science does not support this theory and it is not a reality today or in the foreseeable future. There has to be a realistic and economic balance for these types of power supplies. The proposed mix for renewables is not correct in our view.\n\nMore nuclear power is the solution in our view.\n\nCNWC Recommendations\n\n1.The Unions in the Electrical Power Industry in Ontario represent a very high percentage of the workers in the industry. Workers know what works and what does not work in their industry. Union leaders have direct access to these experts.\n\nThe CNWC strongly suggest that a Labour Union advisory committee be established to advise the Minister of Energy on the LTEP for Ontario.\n\n2.The amount of Wind and Solar produced electricity should be capped.\n\n3.Pump storage hydro-electric stations be seriously considered.\n\n4.The refurbishments of Darlington proceed as planned. The refurbishment of the Bruce Power Units proceed as planned.\n\n5.The life extension of Pickering NPP be approved.\n\n6.A new build NPP be approved for the Darlington Site.\n\n7.Bio energy be expanded for power peaking. Existing coal power plants be considered for bio\n\nenergy and gas conversion.\n\nWe are prepared to answer any questions or concerns you may have with our submission.\n\nSubmitted By\n\nDavid Shier\n\nNational Director\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207101]\n",

        "comment":"Andrea Pastori\n\nCabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator\n\nMinistry of Energy\n\nStrategic, Network and Agency Policy Division\n\nStrategic Policy and Analytics Branch\n\n77 Grenville Street, 6th Floor\n\nToronto, Ontario, M7A 2C1\n\nRE: Clean Air Council Submissions on the update to Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan via the Planning Ontario\u2019s Energy Future Discussion Guide and EBR Posting 012-8840.\n\nThe Clean Air Council would like to commend the Province of Ontario for undertaking a consultation process as part of its update to the Long Term Energy Plan as well as for the efforts the Province has undertaken in seeking public feedback as it proceeds in updating various Plans and Acts (Land Use Plan, Municipal and City of Toronto Act, Climate Change Action Plan, etc.). What follows is a summary of feedback received by the Clean Air Council membership as part of a consultation process guided by questions identified in the Planning Ontario\u2019s Energy Future Discussion Guide and facilitated by Clean Air Partnership (secretariat for the Clean Air Council). The Clean Air Council (CAC) is a network of 27 municipalities and health units from across the Greater Toronto, Hamilton, and South-Western Ontario Area. CAC members work collaboratively on the development and implementation of clean air and climate change mitigation and adaptation actions.\u00a0 More information on the Clean Air Council is available here.\n\nThe Clean Air Council would also like to acknowledge and thank the Province of Ontario for: \u2022being the first north American jurisdiction to phase out coal fired electricity generation and the resulting reductions in air pollution and health impacts and costs that phase out has resulted in;\n\n\u2022setting Conservation Demand Management targets for Ontario electric and gas utilities that have been able to increase energy efficiency within Ontario communities;\n\n\u2022passing the Green Energy Act that has enabled Ontario to increase its share of electricity generated via solar, wind and bioenergy from less than 1% in 2006 to 9% in 2015 and the role it has played in building local renewable energy capacity and manufacturing in Ontario;\n\n\u2022supporting municipalities in the development of Community Energy Plans (CEPs);\n\n\u2022passing the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-Carbon Economy Act and the subsequent adoption of the Climate Change Action Plan; and\n\n\u2022Considering all energy sources (and not just electricity) within the update of this LTEP.\n\nIt is well received by Clean Air Council members that efforts are being made to align the upcoming Long Term Energy Plan and Climate Change Action Plan, and to support their respective implementation.\n\nThe need to increase alignment between Community Energy Plans (CEPs) and Provincial Energy Plans and decision making remains a priority for Clean Air Council members. As such CAC members have a strong desire to work in greater partnership with the various ministries (ex. Energy, Environment and Climate Change, Municipal Affairs) and agencies (ex. IESO, Utilities, OEB) to ensure Ontario can take maximum advantage of existing energy investments while also ensuring our participation in the rapidly emerging field of distributed energy. It is by finding the right balance and alignment between our existing energy system and our future energy systems that Ontario can best position itself to meet its economic, environmental and resiliency goals.\n\nFeedback from CAC on Select Discussion Guide Questions\n\nQ 1: How can local energy plans integrate with broader planning? How do we ensure that we better integrate fuels and electricity planning with broader community planning? What critical research areas will help us better understand intra-municipal capacity in CEPs? What do we need to know to understanding how we can improve and increase the capacity within municipalities to enable the implementation of community energy?\n\n\u2022Increase Energy Literacy: Community Energy Planning was referenced within the Climate Action Plan, however in order to better integrate it with the Long Term Energy Plan there is the need to increase energy literacy for municipalities and the public. As such, there is the need to increase understanding of the provincial electrical system and the factors affecting it. There is also the need to consider both electricity and natural gas in a more integrated fashion. Increased municipal leadership in the development of CEPs plays a significant role in increasing that energy literacy, not just at the municipal level but also at the community level. However more effort needs to be made by all levels of government to increase the energy literacy of Ontarians.\n\n\u2022Improve the ability of Municipalities and their Stakeholders to Implement CEPs: While CEPs are challenging to develop, their implementation is an even greater challenge. There are significant regulatory, bureaucratic, institutional and financial barriers associated with advancing community energy projects. Initial barriers identified by municipalities include, but are not limited to: A) The role that utilities can and cannot play in community energy within their regulated utility and the administration associated with setting up an unregulated arm to the utility. B) How community energy projects can be financed: Ontario\u2019s centralized energy system investments can be paid for by the rate base while community energy projects are ineligible to mobilize capital through the same base, thereby placing it at a significant financial disadvantage.\n\n\u2022District energy systems can play a substantially larger role in enabling communities to meet their electricity and thermal needs in a more efficient and cost effective manner. However in order for district energy to generate greenhouse gas reduction and resilience opportunities, the Province must review the business model related to district energy and how it is currently supported or undermined. Possibly the CCAP\u2019s Challenge Fund may be able to help augment the district energy business case and serve as a means to further district energy\u2019s low carbon potential.\n\n\u2022Green Development Standards\/Climate Change by-laws may be able to support community energy implementation but only if municipal authority in this area extends to the building level. The Clean Air Council network commends the Province on recent proposed amendments to the Municipal Act and City of Toronto Act providing greater clarity on the ability of municipalities to enact by-laws to address their environmental priorities and looks forward to working with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs on updates to the Ontario Building Code to bring the Code into alignment with the Province\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan. For example, expanding the net metering program and coupling it with deep energy retrofits (for existing building stock) and higher energy efficiency standards (for new building stock) as well as widespread emerging local storage opportunities at the building and community level will advance efforts towards the achievement of net zero energy\/carbon communities.\n\n\u2022There is the Need to Develop an Energy Transition Road Map and Decision Making Matrix. The province, municipalities and utilities need to work together to develop and navigate a road map for the transition to a more decentralized energy system. Suggestions that CAC members would like to work with provincial and utility partners to develop and test include analysis of the following: 1.Identify potential futures: Accessing ever deeper energy efficiency opportunities (Conservation First principle); business as usual generation (centralized system); decentralized generation (community with or without micro grid); individual generation (not connected up to any other grid simply at the building level) and how these scenarios impact or support each other. 2.Identification of the various pros and cons; costs and benefits associated with each of the scenarios, and development of a decision matrix to compare among them.\n\n3.Review of the various scenarios from a variety of different lenses: provincial system, local\/community system; resilience; climate; economics and economic development; social, short term, longer term, market transformation, etc.\n\nQ # 2: What are the significant challenges facing utilities and what can government do to meet them?\n\n\u2022There are regulatory limitations for utilities to engage in Community Energy Planning based in applying rate-based financing. Some utilities have created subsidiaries to their regulated utility to address this barrier; however financing community energy projects remains challenging. Community energy projects cannot access rate based financing and municipalities have been unable to mandate energy connections to ensure a long-term customer base for community energy projects. To address the regulatory framework in which community energy projects exist, the Province and Municipalities must work together.\n\n\u2022In order to increase alignment between land use planning and energy planning, municipal planners and utility planners should be more proactive in identifying energy demand from new developments. It is important to recognize energy limitations and where community energy may be best able to address local energy demand. Increased communication earlier in the process by the necessary stakeholders may also address the challenges distributed energy projects face when connecting to the existing grid and how targeted conservation and distributed renewables can best reduce need for new transmission and distribution infrastructure. This consideration should also be applied to the IESO\u2019s Regional Energy Planning exercise through incorporation of a lens for decentralized electricity systems as an alternative to, or complement to, future investments in electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure.\n\nQ # 3: What are the most important benefits of a modern grid? Increased reliability? Greater information on your energy usage?\n\n\u2022It is imperative that as investments are undertaken to improve Ontario\u2019s electricity grid that the improvements made are able to serve Ontario well into the future. A modern and \u201csmarter\u201d grid would best position Ontario communities to increase their ability to participate in the rapidly emerging distributed and flexible energy system by enabling buildings and householders to move towards being able to track and understand their energy decisions. Possibly enabling them to switch between different energy uses (electricity, gas, storage, etc) in real-time based on prices or carbon content of the energy source. To leverage such flexibility and control will however, require a smart grid, a smart building and smart appliances as well as increased energy literacy and relationships between consumers, utilities and other decision makers.\u00a0 No matter what our future energy system evolves into, Ontario\u2019s grid needs to be modernized so that it does not become a limiting factor in enabling increased flexibility and ability of new and emerging energy opportunities.\n\n\u2022Regarding energy data, the Ministry of Energy and CAC members need to work together much more in order to improve access to energy use data to help understand how energy is used in Ontario communities. From past experience, municipalities have had to allocate a significant amount of time and staff resources to gathering energy use data for their CEPs. This increased time and staff resources for data collection has reduced the resources available for implementation and is highly inefficient. Improving access to community energy use as well as analysis was identified as part of the province\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan and references to furthering that goal should also be addressed in the upcoming Long Term Energy Plan.\n\nQ # 4: What additional policies should the government consider to expand access to natural gas? What actions could the government take to support the adoption of alternative fuels?\n\n\u2022Prior to expanding the natural gas distribution system it is important to compare scenarios for meeting the energy heating needs via natural gas expansion or through energy efficiency, district energy and\/or heat pump use. Considerations for expansion of natural gas need to be reviewed through various perspectives (economic, greenhouse gas, resilience, new technologies and efficiency opportunities) to understand the various pros and cons of different options. Hence the need yet again for the above mentioned Energy Transition Road Map and Decision Making Matrix.\n\n\u2022In order to address natural gas use within the existing building stock, deep energy efficiency improvements are required over a greater scale. Reducing the thermal requirements of our existing building stock is imperative in building the economic case for fuel switching.\n\n\u2022The Clean Air Council network strongly encourages the Province to bring natural gas CDM targets into alignment with the Climate Change Action Plan greenhouse gas reduction targets.\n\n\u2022It will be important to be able to look at Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and the role that municipal sewage and compost can play in increasing RNG supply. Offsets may also create RNG opportunities. There is a need for the province, utilities and municipalities to work together to further develop the business case for RNG. In addition, the province should set RNG targets.\n\nQ # 5: How can Ontario further support innovative energy storage technologies that leverage our existing natural gas infrastructure assets and take advantage of our clean electricity system? What role do you foresee for natural gas to supplement and complement the province\u2019s existing electricity storage options?\n\n\u2022Storage is integral to managing renewable and distributed energy opportunities. Many more storage projects (both electrical and thermal) need to be undertaken to ensure that all energy stakeholders in Ontario understand how storage can support distributed and renewable energy and associated policy goals. More information is needed on potential safety issues. There is an increased need to ensure that accurate information is shared and communicated. Resilience is another lens that needs to be applied towards storage considerations.\n\n\u2022More research and capacity-building are needed regarding the use of gas as a storage option and in reducing peak electricity needs.\n\nQ # 6: What are the best uses of microgrids in Ontario? Are there any barriers preventing the use of microgrids?\n\n\u2022Micro grids are important in the technological advancement of our communities\u2019 energy systems. A greater understanding of micro grid projects being undertaken is needed to identify the opportunities and challenges of moving away from our traditional grids.\u00a0 The Clean Air Council looks forward to learning more from the IESO and utilities on micro grid projects being tested in Ontario.\n\nQ # 7: Is the current \u201cuser pay\u201d model an effective way to meet Ontario\u2019s needs? Does it appropriately balance the goals of economic development and protecting taxpayers?\n\n\u2022It is important for energy costs to be allocated to energy users as accurately as possible rather than being subsidized through the general tax base.\u00a0 However, it is also important that energy costs are transparent and clearly articulated to Ontarians. To do this, energy literacy needs to be significantly increased; especially as it relates to electricity pricing. It is often misconceived that green energy projects have been the main reason for electricity price increases. Ontarians need to understand that within the 2015 Global Adjustment (GA) calculations while green energy investments did account for approximately 27% of the GA (12% Wind; 13% Solar; and 2% Bioenergy), nuclear refurbishments accounted for 39%; Gas\/Oil for 17%; Hydro for 13% and Conservation for 4% of the GA.\u00a0 In addition, few Ontarians realize that while electricity prices were capped in the early to mid 2000s at 4.3 cents\/kWh the difference between the electricity costs paid by the user and the amount that had to be paid to the generator resulted in about an additional $730 million payment per year from the Ontario tax base .\n\n\u2022Having acknowledged the value and principle of the \u201cuser pay\u201d approach, there is a need to ensure that those most vulnerable to energy price increases are provided with programs and support to address energy poverty. As such, lower income energy efficiency programs need to be scaled up. Toronto\u2019s Tower Renewal program provides an example of a program that could address those most vulnerable to energy costs if it were scaled up.\n\n\u2022Additionally, programs and policies need to be developed to address energy poverty and the challenge of addressing the split incentive problem (where tenants can\u2019t make upgrades to reduce their energy use but landlords have no incentive to invest in energy efficiency as they do not face the financial costs of energy use). For example, increased requirements on the part of landlords to publicly report on energy costs of their rental units may be able to increase the market for energy efficient rental units.\n\nQ # 8: Should Ontario set provincial conservation targets for other fuel types such as natural gas, oil and propane? To meet the province\u2019s climate change objectives, how can existing or new conservation and energy efficiency programs be enhanced in the near and longer term? How can we continue to inform and engage energy consumers?\n\n\u2022Despite Ontario\u2019s low carbon electricity supply, Ontario\u2019s energy sources as a whole are over 80% fossil fuel based and account for over 70% of Ontario\u2019s GHG emissions . In order for Ontario\u2019s LTEP to not conflict with Ontario\u2019s CCAP targets, it will need to provide proportional GHG reductions from fossil fuel energy sources. As such there is a very strong need for:\n\noMuch greater emphasis on natural gas conservation. Ontario spends five times more on electricity conservation than natural gas conservation.\n\noMuch better integration between natural gas and electricity conservation incentives, and now provincial incentives under CCAP.\n\noConservation programs that support deep energy retrofits \u2013 currently, most conservation is shallow, picking low hanging fruit, which can actually impede potential to achieve deep energy retrofit savings over time. Deep retrofits across Ontario\u2019s building stock are required in order to achieve our GHG targets; therefore conservation programs need to encourage and support this level of ambition and thereby build industry capacity to deliver deep retrofits.\n\noIncentives for fuel switching to electricity (heat pumps) for gas heated buildings. Presently there are no incentives and due to the significant price differential between electricity and natural gas costs, absent substantial incentives the electrification required for meeting GHG targets will not occur.\n\noIncreasing transportation options for Ontarians via increased electric vehicle use, transit use, carpooling, etc. Transportation is the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in Ontario and its contribution share increases with each passing year.\n\n\u2022Adopting and advancing policies such as Energy Reporting and Benchmarking and Home Energy Ratings and Disclosure will be critical to increasing energy literacy and informing and engaging energy consumers; but it is also critical that these policies are supported and accompanied by training and education.\n\nThe Clean Air Council would like to thank the Province for considering this input and extends an invitation to the Province and its Ministries to discuss these recommendations in more detail.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207102]\n",

        "comment":"The Paris agreement to stay below 1.5 C rise is only possible by rapidly lowering methane emissions. Natural gas use must be curtailed for avoid upstream fugitive methane. Space heating dominates and, if replaced by heat pumps, would require\u00a0 3 times the current peak with most of the load over a 3 month period. Adding base-load nuclear is of no value. Solar and wind would require enormous energy storage capacity but conceptually feasible, e.g. pumped hydraulic at the Welland Canal with large off-shore wind in Lake Erie (avoid the law suit). But a much smarter strategy is to retrofit first to reduce loads by 90% (already demonstrated feasible and economic) then heated either with geo-source heat pumps or, in favourable locations, district heating using bio-fuel cogeneration.\n\nIESO has not produced viable supply mix and DSM options for analysis. The least cost will be aggressive conservation, demand response, distributed and embedded generation, energy storage both thermal and electrical, small and large, and 100% renewables. This will replace the nuclear refurbishment strategy which directly conflicts with the much cheaper wind and solar base-load supply. Existing CCGT`s will serve as reserve capacity and some ramping capacity fueled by biogas and be integrated with district heating supply.\n\nCurrent GHG accounting methods are entirely wrong for ascribing demand-side reductions. IESO must provide quantitative evaluations for each scenario based on legitimate protocols and factors. It has proven impossible to get anyone at the MOECC to respond to or discuss this most urgent matter. Without credible measurement, the LTEP cannot address climate change policy.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207104]\n",

        "comment":"Achieving Ontario\u2019s Climate Change Goals Through Long-Term Energy Planning\n\nThe province of Ontario has been a national leader in climate action, having achieved an 80% reduction GHG emissions from the electricity sector since 2005, and more than 40 MT of absolute emissions reductions from 2005 to 2014.\u00a0 The Ontario Climate Change Action Plan\u00a0 provides a five-year roadmap to achieve 2020 targeted reductions (15% below 1990 levels) that amount to a further 15.7 MT of emissions reductions between 2014 and 2020.\n\nBeyond 2020, Ontario is committed to more stringent targets through the Climate Change Mitigation and Low Carbon Economy Act, 2016 , and must further align with the new Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change .\u00a0 Measures at least as strong as Ontario\u2019s pledge to reduce emissions to 127.3 MT (37% below 1990 levels) by 2030, and to 36.4 MT (80% below 1990 levels) by 2050, will be required to meet or exceed the Paris Agreement aspiration of holding global temperature rise below 1.5C this century.\u00a0 Many advocate for full decarbonization by 2050 as a more appropriate target to forestall catastrophic warming that exceeds 2C by 2100.\n\nOntario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP) will support the province\u2019s climate targets by guiding the transition off polluting fossil fuels and onto low- and zero-emissions energy sources.\u00a0 Transition Initiative Kenora welcomes this opportunity to provide comment on the proposed LTEP.\n\nOntario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan, 2017\n\nAfter reviewing the IESO Ontario Planning Outlook, Navigant\u2019s Fuels Technical Report and working through the LTEP Discussion Guide, two clear, interrelated themes emerge.\u00a0 First, Ontario needs to take ambitious action to reduce demand for fossil fuels.\u00a0 At the same time, the province needs to adopt policies and plans that support a managed economy-wide transition to electricity.\u00a0 As both reports forecast, achieving ambitious emissions- and energy-reduction goals is well within the province\u2019s reach.\n\nAs a general comment, we recognized that there are potential efficiencies and material savings to be gained through electrification that were not discussed in either of the technical reports commissioned by the Ministry of Energy.\u00a0 A system built upon diverse fuels is inherently inefficient, demanding infrastructure redundancy to meet the specificities of each fuel type.\u00a0 For example, a natural gas heating furnace cannot be adapted to combust liquid heating fuel, just as gasoline and diesel are not interchangeable fuels for internal combustion engines.\u00a0 Electricity, on the other hand, is an end form of energy that can be developed from diverse sources but supplied to the consumer in a single energy form.\u00a0 A system built around electricity as a primary energy commodity will have greater universality and interchangeability, resulting in cost savings and efficiencies across the economy.\n\nOur comments will address Ontario\u2019s opportunities to reduce fuels demands through:\n\n1.Adopting a conservation program for fuels\n\n2.Targeting transportation sector fuels reductions\n\n3.Targeting fuels demands for buildings\n\n4.Investing in alternative fuels\n\n5.Supporting infrastructure planning that aligns with fossil fuels demand reductions\n\nAs Ontario transitions to economy-wide electrification, we draw attention to the following issues: 6.Reducing dependency on nuclear power\n\n7.Investing in bulk transmission infrastructure\n\n8.Enhancing microgrids and capacity for distributed generation\n\nReducing Fuels Demands\n\n1. Adopting a conservation program for fuels\n\nWhile Ontario has long had conservation programs for electricity, to date similar programs do not exist for fuels other than natural gas.\u00a0 A provincial fuel conservation program similar to the Conservation First Framework\u00a0 could deliver energy efficiency improvements by amending building codes and equipment standards to reduce fuels consumption for space and water heating, implementing demand-management and dynamic pricing schemes for transportation fuels, and introducing social benchmarking concepts to consumers to encourage a conservation first mindset.\n\n2. Targeting transportation sector fuels reductions\n\nTransportation represents the largest demand sector for fuels in Ontario.\u00a0 As such, this sector should be Ontario\u2019s primary target for fuel demand reductions.\n\nOntario has established several policies to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).\u00a0 The Electric Vehicle Incentive Program\u00a0 was introduced in 2010 and revised with significant improvements in 2016.\u00a0 The Climate Change Action Plan mandates new homes, workplaces and public buildings to have EV-charging units.\n\nTo further support these incentive programs, the province should develop and market educational consumer resources related to EVs to encourage adoption and to dispel myths that may prohibit consumers embracing EVs.\u00a0 These should include a cost-benefit economic analysis that demonstrates the savings a consumer might expect for EVs as compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Particularly in rural and remote areas where electricity delivery costs are very high, the province and LDCs should work to develop pricing schemes that ensure EV charging is at least as affordable as conventional liquids fuelling.\u00a0 For example, overnight residential charging practices could be encouraged through appropriate time-of-use pricing schedules for EV charging units.\n\nWhile the $20 million Green Building Fund investment into EV charging stations is an important step forward, there are vast regions in the northern and western portions of the province where low- and zero-emissions vehicle infrastructure remains woefully inadequate.\u00a0 Municipalities should be encouraged and supported in investing in EV charging infrastructure.\u00a0 At the same time, provincial incentives to support trades training and private enterprise to support EV maintenance would further stimulate their adoption.\n\nOntario should consider even more ways to support trends toward transportation alternatives that challenge the long-standing norm of private vehicle ownership.\u00a0 Particularly in large urban centres, other transportation options such as public transit, active transportation, car cooperatives and rideshares often make more economic sense for consumers.\u00a0 Incentivizing these transportation options could have enormous impacts on reducing fuels demands in Ontario.\n\nFinally, in line with social trends towards reducing private vehicle ownership, rather than promoting a target 2020 benchmark of 5% of vehicle sales being EVs, framing that benchmark around fleet replacement rather than new vehicle sales could tacitly promote a conservation ethos rather than reinforcing consumptive growth.\u00a0 While the auto manufacturing and sales sector would balk at fuels demand reduction policies that overtly constrain auto sales, encouraging fleet replacement allows auto manufacturers ample opportunities to manufacture and market new vehicles without increasing the absolute number of cars on Ontario\u2019s roads.\n\n3. Targeting fuels demands for buildings\n\nAfter transportation, space and water heating for residential, commercial and industrial buildings is probably the next most obvious target for Ontario to reduce fuels demands.\u00a0 Ontario has devised many policies that will aid in improving building efficiencies, from building code amendments to energy audit policies for home purchases.\n\nIn the past, while fossil energy was cheap and plentiful and its climate impacts unrecognized, the thermal performance of buildings was often not prioritized to the extent that it should have been during new construction or renovation.\u00a0 In the past, added heating costs were an allowable trade-off to build quickly and cheaply.\u00a0 In the case of residential building, it has not been the Canadian norm to consider siting or orientation for passive solar heat gain, for example, and until recently, few homes were built with an aim to minimize emissions or energy demand.\n\nSimilarly, consumers\u2019 home heating choices are typically driven first by availability and convenience, and second by cost.\u00a0 Again, few consumers make heating choices based on emissions or energy intensity of fuels.\n\nFirst, in order to reduce space heating energy demands, buildings must be constructed to superior thermal performance standards.\u00a0 Code amendments should require high minimum standards for thermal insulation in walls, roofs and foundations, stringent air-tightness and air flow management, and siting and building design guidelines to maximize passive solar heat gain in winter and passive cooling (shading, airflow) in summer.\u00a0 Such amendments should apply to new construction as well as retrofitting and renovation.\u00a0 The province should develop policies that support scheduled energy efficiency retrofitting for all buildings in the province to make them code-compliant within a fixed timeframe.\n\nSecond, where possible, buildings should become net-zero emitters and energy users.\u00a0 This could involve making distributed energy generation capability a mandatory feature of all buildings.\u00a0 Such a policy, which could be applied immediately to new construction and phased in as part of scheduled retrofits for existing buildings, has been pioneered in France, where all rooftops must either produce solar photovoltaic energy or feature a rooftop food garden.\u00a0 Energy demand reduction policies could be developed to encourage the installation of rooftop or ground-mounted solar PV, air exchange heat pumps, geothermal systems or other heating and cooling technologies that reduce fossil fuels demands.\u00a0 Each building site presents unique opportunities and limitations with regard to distributed energy generation, which is again a good reason to amend codes and develop guidelines to support optimizing siting and building design for energy efficiency and emissions reductions.\n\nFinally, there are significant research and development opportunities in the alternative energy sector in which Ontario should be investing.\u00a0 One option would be to recycle carbon pricing revenue into enhancing efficiency and deployment of solar PV and solar heating technologies, for example.\n\n4. Investing in alternative fuels\n\nWhile electricity is poised to become the energy standard of the near future, demand for liquid fuels will persist for industrial and manufacturing feedstocks and for meeting the energy needs of remote and off-grid regions.\u00a0 Ontario should be focused on transitioning these processes and applications off of fossil fuels sources and onto renewable and alternative fuels, while at the same time working to optimize the production and manufacturing of these alternative energy sources.\n\nOne valuable source of alternative fuels is biogas or renewable natural gas, including methane tapped from municipal landfills and agricultural waste.\u00a0 Processes to harvest and refine these small, distributed point sources of non-fossil natural gas will have to be optimized to ensure their economic and energy viability.\u00a0 For instance, it probably will not make sense to construct elaborate networks of pipelines to connect widely dispersed and relatively ephemeral sources of renewable natural gas, but it may become more plausible to develop mobile harvesting and refinery technology scaled to suit these applications.\n\nBiofuels and biomass present another potential source of alternative fuels.\u00a0 Here we caution that the production of raw fuels should never compete with foods production nor should it result in the stripping of forests, whose role in providing valuable carbon sinks almost certainly outweighs their commercial biomass value.\u00a0 While such an activity may not be promoted by the province, in practice we have observed local forestry companies clearcutting black spruce forests and chipping whole trees to manufacture hogfuel for nearby industrial plants.\u00a0 We have been told (but have not verified) that one of the purchasers of this virgin hogfuel has been the Atikokan biomass generating station. \u00a0 We would hope this is a practice that is not condoned by the province, and certainly going forward we hope to see very stringent policies to protect forests and agricultural soils from depletion for the sake of generating biomass fuel stocks.\n\n5. Supporting infrastructure planning that aligns with fossil fuels demand reductions\n\nA final element of ensuring Ontario succeeds in vastly reducing its fossil fuels use is to plan for infrastructure that supports its declining demand.\n\nAt present, Ontario\u2019s supply needs are met through the existing pipeline, rail, roads, and marine infrastructure that deliver western Canadian and U.S. fuels to the province.\u00a0 Given that energy demand scenarios that are compliant with climate policy forecast only declines for fuels demand, it follows that no further new infrastructure expansion is necessary.\u00a0 Indeed, pursuing expansion at this time would not only be contrary to aims of constraining demand, but it would lock in costly capital investments that may never achieve financial returns.\u00a0 Ontario\u2019s LTEP should explicitly reject new fossil fuel infrastructure expansion within the province.\n\nTransitioning to Economy-Wide Electrification\n\n6. Reducing dependency on nuclear power\n\nAs the province shifts toward an economy powered by electricity rather than liquid fuels and coal, the mix of electricity supply should be tailored to include only genuinely clean energy sources. Nuclear power is not a clean energy source.\n\nNuclear power is often touted as a zero-emissions energy source, but this, too, is a falsehood. There are significant upstream emissions associated with uranium mining, as well as with the construction and maintenance of costly nuclear power plants.\n\nDownstream, spent uranium fuel rods become some of the most toxic and long-lasting waste products on Earth.\u00a0 Ontario has yet to devise a suitable process for nuclear waste disposal that is guaranteed not to result in catastrophic environmental and human health disasters in the event of containment failure.\u00a0 Few are the communities that would willingly house toxic nuclear waste repositories. Even fewer are the sites that are physically suitable for receiving and storing waste without jeopardizing massive portions of the province while waste is en route from the nuclear facility.\n\nFinally, for the exorbitant cost of refurbishing nuclear plants, Ontario could make far better investments in ensuring the long-term viability and adequacy of renewable energy sources like solar PV, wind, and microhydro.\u00a0 At the same time, the province should be supporting research and development into made-in-Ontario innovations in new and emerging technologies like artificial photosynthesis, water electrolysis hydrogen generation, and even nuclear fusion.\n\n7. Investing in bulk transmission infrastructure\n\nWhile the future of energy in Ontario is undoubtedly electric, the current system of a massive, interconnected intraprovincial grid is unwieldy, inefficient, costly, and inadequate. Functionally, northwestern Ontario is isolated from the rest of the province on a regional grid that lacks robust interties to the south.\u00a0 While this region is, on average, self-sufficient in electricity generation, its ability is limited to dynamically meet demand variability.\n\nInterprovincial and international interties exist, but procurement policies do not necessarily align across jurisdictions to make the purchasing or sale of electricity feasible between Ontario, Manitoba and Minnesota.\u00a0 Ontario has made excellent progress in negotiating electricity trade agreements with Qu\u00e9bec, and similar efforts must be applied to ensure all bordering jurisdictions are able to enjoy dynamic clean electricity sharing opportunities with Ontario.\n\nIESO has established reasonable guidelines for enhancing bulk transmission and electricity distribution in our region.\u00a0 Enhancing regional interties like the East-West Tie Expansion to connect northeastern and northwestern Ontario should be prioritized.\u00a0 Improvements to the regional bulk distribution system should be made with regard to the changing demands on the grid as distributed generation increases and the grid moves toward becoming a reciprocal storage and supply reservoir rather than simply a delivery conduit.\n\n8. Enhancing microgrids and capacity for distributed generation\n\nA robust bulk transmission network is essential for connecting regional microgrids to one another to allow for dynamic demand management across Ontario and neighbouring jurisdictions.\u00a0 However, the future of electricity generation and distribution in Ontario is rapidly shifting away from centralized generation and delivery to the consumer to distributed local generation and a two-way flow of electricity on the grid.\n\nIn this scenario, regional and local microgrids must be designed with capabilities to dynamically balance loads.\u00a0 They must be capable of accepting energy input during peak generation times, for example on bright sunny days for solar PV generation or on windy days for wind power generation. The local grid would need to be able to equalize fluctuating capacity to provide consistent quality power to consumers.\u00a0 Such a system may necessitate having excess capacity dumped from the regional grid onto the bulk transmission system through robust regional tie-in nodes.\u00a0 Conversely, on low generation days, a regional microgrid may need to draw capacity from neighbouring jurisdictions if local storage is inadequate.\n\nOptimizing distributed generation technology and logistics should be a priority for the province. At the same time, the province should also be supporting Ontarians in achieving personal and community energy security by incentivizing renewable generation capacity from the household level through to the local community scale.\u00a0 Distributed generation augments Ontario\u2019s energy security by creating local sources of energy, adding redundancy to the supply so that Ontarians are better protected from system-wide failures.\u00a0 Distributed generation also enables Ontario to phase out reliance on polluting energy forms such as nuclear and natural gas.\u00a0 And finally, distributed generation puts production in the hands of the consumer, helping to make the connections between energy supply and demand more tangible and thus supporting greater energy conservation.\n\nAlthough IESO has remarked that energy decentralization has the potential to erode the revenue necessary to maintain the bulk transmission system and other centralized energy services, there are ways to devise a distributed \/ microgrid system that ensures public support for ongoing maintenance, repair and replacement.\u00a0 The potential benefits of a widely distributed generation system vastly outweigh the potential drawbacks of decentralization.\n\nConclusion\n\nOntario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan 2017 offers tremendous opportunities for the province to enhance its climate change and energy leadership.\u00a0 Already a trailblazer in Canada both in policy and action, Ontario\u2019s actions today will set the province up to be a strong contender in the 21st Century global clean energy economy.\u00a0 The province is well positioned not only to attain its intended 2020, 2030 and 2050 emissions goals, but indeed to exceed them with ambitious policies and action, starting with the 2017 LTEP.\n\nOntario can support a rapid transition to clean, safe, renewable energy sources through research and development to support technological innovation. The province\u2019s demand for all fuels, but especially carbon-intensive fossil fuels, will be vastly diminished through the electrification of our passenger vehicle fleet and switching to electric sources for space and water heating. Infrastructure planning and policy must reflect the province\u2019s commitments to see fossil fuels demands decline, while boosting support for decentralized distributed energy generation throughout the province. \u00a0 Finally, and most crucially, the province must work to ensure that Ontarians have a sophisticated understanding of energy supply and demand and are eager to adopt a culture of conservation first.\n\nWe thank you for this opportunity to provide comment and feedback on the proposed LTEP, and we look forward to working with our fellow Ontarians to make our energy future clean and secure.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207106]\n",

        "comment":"NOTE: I am closely associated with the environmental protection group Algonquin Eco Watch. However, the following comments are my own and do not necessarily represent that organization.\n\nEconomists tell us that we must have a growing economy, but the only way to accomplish that appears to be a constantly growing human population world-wide, which can then become a constantly growing number of \"purchasing units\". But where is the end point?\n\nPogo said \"We have met the enemy and he is us\".\n\nThis is true - as we constantly devour more and more of our natural resources and more and more species disappear, while more and more humans starve.\n\nIs there an end point?\n\nNot unless we impose one.\n\nHow do we limit our numbers, and achieve a stable or growing economy?\n\nChina tried it, but didn't succeed. But if we cannot accomplish that goal, life on earth will soon become a truly living hell.\n\nIronically, as medical science develops ways to keep us alive longer, this simply exacerbates an already declining quality of life on earth.\n\nBut still economists and politicians continue to dance around the \"Elephant in the Room\". A never ending growth among the human population will necessarily demand a corresponding never ending supply of energy to supply the growing economy. A vicious circle!\n\nAnd where will the energy come from, and how \"clean\" will it be?\n\nNUCLEAR: The cleanest and (possibly) the cheapest, but undoubtedly the most dangerous by-products and the most difficult waste to safely store, e.g. Bruce Nuclear.\n\nAlso, nuclear power is not \"storable\".\n\nWATER: The only truly \"storable\" energy, but requires the building of costly dams to create storage reservoirs. Flooding causes the production of dangerous mercury by-products and seasonal intentional water fluctuation wreaks havoc with reptile, amphibian and fish populations*, not to mention the flooding of huge amounts of arable and bush land, much of which was formerly occupied by humans.\n\nWIND: Like nuclear power, wind storage is not \"storable\", but requires huge monetary expenditures, is not reliable, but depends upon variable winds, and incurs significant maintenance of moving parts.\n\nSOLAR: While solar power is \"passive\", having no moving parts, and is storable in batteries, it depends on sunlight for power production and covers large areas of possibly arable land.\n\nSo, it is likely that water-generated energy will be (and already has become in Ontario) the major player in our quest for cheaper electrical energy. This in spite of the irreparable damage that will result to Ontario's flowing waters! The loss to future Ontarians will seem negligible, because they never will have experienced the beauty and bountiful production of living plants and creatures that once we took for granted - What a needless shame! What a waste!\n\n* Literature available upon request.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207110]\n",

        "comment":"I greatly appreciate the opportunity of being able to provide these comments regarding the LTEP 2017. I have been actively engaged in Energy Conservation efforts and the last 10 years (perhaps more) have been filled with smoke and mirrors from the existing energy supply chain whom seem to have only their own vested interest(s) at heart. The Minister has a challenging role ahead but I believe he, and his government, can and will end the charade and hopefully present the big reveal. I implore the Minister to put Ontario back on the global map for all the right reasons\u2026 show us the math\u2026 show us a renewable energy future.\n\nMy recommendations (in no particular order) are:\n\nAuditor General Report 2015\n\nI encourage the Minister to listen to the Auditor General. AR2015 highlights lack of transparency and a lack of alternatives provided by the IESO. Decisions made over the past decade have produced dire consequences for everyone. Generation is primarily responsible for both increased energy costs and excess energy supply, both of which are mostly due to Nuclear power. As such, I implore the minister to revisit the $13 billion Nuclear refurbishment contract signed by the previous Minister and explain - in clear and concise terms \u2013 why we need more expensive and toxic Nuclear power when better alternatives are available.\n\nFIT Contracts\n\nI encourage the Minister to bring back the FIT program and to continue the MicroFIT program regardless of MW contracted. FIT contracts serve well in maintaining fixed, fair and stable energy costs and there needs to be further encouragement for building owners to utilize roof top area for solar PV.\n\nData Acquisition\n\nI encourage the Minister to adopt GB (Green Button). Do not let resistance from utilities slow this process as GB will serve to benefit everyone and therefore needs to come into effect as soon as possible.\n\nData Reporting\n\nI encourage the Minister to issue a directive to the IESO to show real-time POWER and ENERGY data - by \u2018Type\u2019 \u2013 in a clear and concise manner. Currently the IESO skews information in-favour of Power which causes many to believe Renewable Energy efforts are responsible for the high cost of Energy. But the IESO is slow, lethargic, and hides the truth. The IESO is no more \u201cindependent\u201d than the former OPA so let\u2019s stop pretending. The Minister must direct the IESO to report both potential and actual contributions to the supply mix, not just the potential to supply the mix, in a clear and concise manner. Showing energy by \u2018type\u2019 will help citizens understand where the energy comes from. I encourage the Minister to reject the IESO OPO Outlook scenarios A thru D as inadequate. All four are \u201ctop-down\u201d models based on centralized power generation, with little to no respect for grid migration.\n\nParticipation Fairness\n\nI encourage the Minister to amend Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998 Net Metering Regulation 541\/05:\n\na) credits for energy generated must remain until consumed (similar to Bill 47, the Protecting Rewards Points Act);\n\nb) not biased in-favour of LDC but rather in-favour of eligible generator; c) written in plain English; d) consistent throughout the province.\n\nI encourage the Minister to amend Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998 such that up to 2000 W (2 kW) of solar PV may be installed by any citizen without permission from LDC and\/or IESO. Citizens are now free to install multiple electric water heaters without permission, the same should be true for similar sized energy producing units.\n\nI encourage the Minister to demand all Smart Meters be bidirectional types and suggest that all LDCs be mandated to change - at no charge - any currently installed Smart meter that is not a bidirectional type if requested to do so (currently there are discretionary charges applied by LDC\u2019s which can be excessive and accompanied by too much paper work and too many T&C\u2019s). I encourage the Minister to remove all barriers for small power input systems and design the regulatory process to support and simplify the economic participation of the communities hosting the projects. Doing so will encourage many people to participate a small ways which is a gentle transition on the grid.\n\nI implore the Minister to direct the IESO and LDC\u2019s to accept all products that conform to CSA\/UL safety regulations and meet ESA standards. The IESO and LDC\u2019s are not recognized safety agencies and therefore must not be permitted to override existing measures.\n\nLess is More\n\nI encourage the Minister to accept all BTM (Behind The Meter) activities as every citizens right under the GEA (Green Energy Act) and possibly also under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The IESO and LDCs should not have the right to stop or hinder anyone in the province from doing their part to reduce consumption and\/or self generation of energy.\n\nI encourage the Minister to initiate changes to the OBC (Ontario Building Code) so that \u2013 starting as soon as possible \u2013 all new detached and semi-detached housing starts MUST incorporate between 1000 W and 2000 W (1 kW to 2 kW) of Solar PV in a Net Metered arrangement. Further, all building permits should adhere to some expected level of electrical energy efficiency.\n\nI encourage the Minister to immediately stop any and all salary increases within the \u201celectricity and energy\u201d sectors and to start demanding early retirement. The existing attrition rate seems low as if being employed in this sector is a guaranteed for life job.\n\nI encourage the Minister to consider conclusions made by Mr. Elston\u2019s in his report December 2012, two points stand out: (1) \u201cIt [Ontario\u2019s electricity system] is not suitable, however, for the challenges and the opportunities of the future. This province needs a stronger, more innovative distribution system that can meet the changing needs of the consumer and the province.\u201d and (2) \u201cThe Panel believes most municipalities and LDCs understand the status quo will not serve the citizens of the province well in the decades to come.\u201d\n\nConservation First\n\nThere is a conflict of interest with the existing Energy Conservation programs administered by the IESO and LDC\u2019s. The IESO and LDC\u2019s concoct their own rules to serve their own purposes which leads one to believe real change towards true energy efficiency is stymied in-favour of higher energy options. Clearly the IESO has a vested interest in status quo and therefore the Minister must send a clear directive to the IESO and LDC\u2019s to stand-down and facilitate energy conservation.\n\nThe Minister must direct the IESO and LDC\u2019s to co-operate enthusiastically on all Energy Conservation efforts and Renewable Energy projects especially those that serve to reduce daytime usage of energy.\n\nTo really drive home the Conservation First message, I encourage the Minister to consider imposing penalties equivalent to double the incentives provided by LDC CDM Target and Budget Allocations. In other words, energy reduction efforts reward LDCs at a staggering rate of $0.25\/kWh yet most LDCs struggle to meet their minuscule targets. To encourage meeting\/exceeding targets, there needs to be a deterrent\u2026 a $0.50\/kWh penalty on shortfall. Currently most LDC\u2019s are not focused on real energy conservation efforts and the IESO has an inherent Centralized Power mindset based on ever increasing energy demand.\n\nI encourage the Minister to support development of advance energy processing systems for commercial\/industrial buildings with flat roofs that can easily accommodate roof top solar PV.\n\nCreation of Energy Ombudsman\n\nThere needs to be an impartial body, perhaps the Social Justice Tribunals Ontario (SJTO) could have a ninth adjudicative tribunal assigned for matters relating to Energy. We need somewhere that we can take arguments for\/against a particular process, and address such concerns in a timely fashion. Many existing rules favour the establishment and challenging those rules is difficult if not impossible.\n\nAvoid Top Down Centralized Planning\n\nI encourage the Minister to stop using only top down models based on centralized energy and delivery plans with ever increasing base load. The OPO data shows the past decade increased slightly but when exports are considered demand decreased. Unfortunately the OPO does not include clear data therefore a true picture of provincial energy ebb and flow is not known.\n\nCommunity Power\n\nEncourage Sustainable Development by mandating the IESO and LDCs to allow Community Power. Communities must be permitted to act independently and develop their own low-carbon energy systems that support their own local economy. The goal should be to move towards regional and community energy self-sufficiency. This can be achieved \u2013 if allowed and encouraged \u2013 and it will serve to benefit the existing infrastructure by reducing line losses; a win-win for all.\n\nAn integrated approach must be permitted such that privately-owned DG, energy conservation, storage, and community energy self-sufficiency can flourish. These will all be integral to the future distribution and transmission systems therefore steps must be taken now in LTEP 2017 to prepare the grid for multiple energy inputs.\n\nBio Energy is largely ignored in the planning documents yet there is great potential in all parts of Ontario and those communities that already have systems connected need billing adjustments made so they are not treated as consumers. Encourage Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants thereby maximizing efficiency and flexibility.\n\nOther Efforts\n\nSet aggressive targets for heavy trucking to reduce Fuel consumption and GHG emissions, example: City of Toronto garbage trucks on the 401 (between Toronto and Michigan) have no aerodynamic enhancements and therefore consume more fuel and emit more GHG than needed.\n\nMitigate future stranded assets by cancelling the rebuilding of 50% of the nuclear reactors. Decentralized electricity supply is the future and it works and it is far more cost effective in the long run and best of all, it does NOT produce radioactive waste for future generations.\n\nSupport proponents of alternative energy on an equal basis as the Centralized Power consortium has been supported in the past. Groups such as OSEA (Ontario Sustainable Energy Association) are leading the way in demonstrating alternatives are viable and available and have no harmful side effects. If the rest of the world can do it, Ontario can too and become a leader.\n\nPut more funding into P2G (Power to Gas) energy storage; Ontario has vast caverns for storing NG and we have an abundant supply of night time electrical energy to produce the Hydrogen\u2026 P2G is an excellent win-win solution.\n\nProhibit Power Workers Union and OMERs from holding shares in Bruce Power. This is clearly a conflict of interest as PWU will roadblock any DG\/MG projects to protect their stock options. Allowing ownership in foreign power generation is one thing but local generation is another.\n\nBan advertising claiming Nuclear power is clean. Nuclear power is not clean, it\u2019s deadly and dangerous for generations to come. We are burdening our children\u2019s children with radioactive waste and we need to look no further than the mess at both Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power sites to see how devastating the consequences can be.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207111]\n",

        "comment":"Ontario will eventually have to be 100% renewable in energy supply, by definition, since no unrenewable energy can persist forever.\n\nTherefore, we should plan for that starting now, look at how to either create (and store), or purchase (from other provinces\/states) enough renewable energy to supply all our needs. We should also work much harder to reduce the amount of electricity we need through conservation, through efficiency, and through demand management.\n\nWe must NOT build any new non-renewable energy infrastructure or supply. We must not build any new nuclear power, which is expensive and ties us into long-term fixed-amount centralized supply in contradiction to the evolving world of microgrids, local renewable power production, and reduced need for kw\/h per person or per $GDP. We should not be refurbishing another set of nuclear plants; we should retire them instead, and purchase clean hydro from Quebec or Manitoba to replace their supply.\n\nWe should be very wary of any so-called \"bridge\" measures that involve using more fossil fuels, switching from one fossil fuel to another, \"cleaner\" one, or building new fossil infrastructure which will be stranded as we shift to 100% renewable. Instead, we should build new electricity storage infrastructure to make better use of our excess supply and save it for our own use in times of peak demand.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207114]\n",

        "comment":"Perspective\u2014Rural North-Eastern Ontario:\n\nMy point of view comes from my experience of living in rural north-eastern Ontario, in the Algoma District. Like many Ontario residents, my electricity bill has soared in the past two years. In January and February our bill reaches $850.00 for a 2000 sq. ft. residence heated primarily by electricity which, when we built our home 25 years ago, was a sensible and affordable cost. As we now are retired, this is a stretch on our pensions.\n\nLike other rural residents in Goulais River, we have back-up heat derived from wood. We are reluctant to resort to this method because burning wood may not be, strictly speaking, \u201ccarbon neutral.\u201d Every time that I drive to Sault Ste. Marie, I encounter several heavily laden lumber trucks headed south. From what I witness, the forest industry in Algoma is booming. And herein lies a problem. Much of the logging is done on private land which is not subject to the forestry regulations supposedly enforced on Crown Land. Often there is clear cutting and the remains of the trees are left in a tangled mess.\n\nIf the cost of heating continues to rise and residents in northern Ontario increasingly resort to wood-burning, then the Ministry of Energy in conjunction with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) must require that:\n\n- forestry regulations be enforced on private land as well as Crown Land,\n\n- clear cutting is banned, and\n\n- where clear cutting has occurred, the owners of the land must replant the forest for the next generation.\n\nEnergy derived from wood is only \u201crenewable\u201d if harvested and planted responsibly. \u201cCarbon neutral\u201d presupposes that when tree is cut another will grow naturally or be planted to generate oxygen and so balance the CO2 in the atmosphere. Further, the MNRF must be vigilant in assessing the extent to which the forests are being depleted and regulate the licensing to harvest trees accordingly. This is a primary source of conservation which is critical to sustain life. It must be made clear that using living trees as a\n\nsource of energy to heat homes is as risky as using up all the coal, gas and oil supplies. It is a critical factor in Long-Term Energy Planning. Not because burning wood increases CO2 in the atmosphere, but killing trees impacts the production of oxygen\u2014our life-support.\n\nLiving as we do on the shores of Lake Superior, we are intimately acquainted with the majesty and beauty of the watershed highlands which are the backdrop for this magnificent lake. In the past few years, the Lake Superior Watershed Conservancy has worked diligently to develop a network of smaller communities from Sault Ste. Marie to Thunder Bay to establish a Trans-Canada Trail Ontario (TCTO) recognized water trail which has 17 landing parks for canoeists, kayakers and boaters. (See: http:\/\/www.superiorconservancy.org.) The water trail is a significant piece of eco-tourism economy currently being developed in the Algoma and Thunder Bay Districts.\n\nTo date in Algoma, there are 126 turbines (Prince Wind Farm) plus 11 turbines (Goulais Wind Farm) and 26 turbines (Bow Lake Wind Farm). The combined turbines from Prince and Goulais can be seen from both Lake Superior and the trans-Canada highway. They are an intrusion into the wilderness experience that tourists who camp, hike, bike and boat come for in Algoma. The turbines can be seen for a radius of 90 kms and blink unceasingly through the dark to the detriment of Algoma\u2019s premier tourist attraction \u2013 the night sky.\n\nThe rural residents of Algoma have vigorously opposed the erection of the Goulais and Bow Lake wind installations. They have made submissions to previous comment periods and come forward as appellants, participants and witnesses in the Environmental Review Tribunals related to each of these wind projects. They have voiced their concerns and they have not been heard.\n\nIn southern Ontario, there are some 113 municipalities which have passed the NO resolution to further wind development in their regions. They have been heard: Premier Wynne has curtailed the building of further projects in this area and has admitted publicly her mistake in creating hardships for the rural areas of southern Ontario. But here\u2019s the problem: Goulais River and Montreal River (Bow Lake) are located in unorganized townships. Residents who live here have no \u201cmunicipal voice.\u201d They can only appeal directly to the Government of Ontario and the appropriate Ministries to hear their objections. Organizations such as Save Ontario\u2019s Algoma Region (SOAR) (see: http:\/\/www.savealgoma.org\/) are alive and well. They are not convinced that the current inability of the transmission grid to take more wind\/solar-generated power will prevent the Ontario government from continuing its plan of off-shore and on-shore wind development on the Lake Superior shoreline. This is especially so as the Batchewana First Nation has indicated its potential for further wind development in Algoma. Rural Algoma will continue to resist the development of wind power on and off the shore of Lake Superior.\n\nThere is evidence now that the Government of Ontario via the Ministry of Tourism, Culture a\n\nand Sport did not protect the Group of Seven painting sites which were impacted by the Bow Lake turbines. These painting sites are also a major tourist attraction for artists and art lovers who come from all over the world.\n\nAt a recent Community Liaison meeting (December 6), Capstone Inc. revealed that their 2015 stats show that the threshold of bat mortality has been exceeded at the Goulais Wind Farm. Although mitigations are now in place, residents of Goulais River were assured that no serious\/irreversible environmental harm result from the construction of these 11 turbines.\n\nQuite simply, the Ontario Government did not do its \u201cdue diligence\u201d in researching the bat populations in both Goulais and Bow Lake. Allowing the developers to conduct these investigations was an abdication of the Ontario Government from its responsibility to the fundamental rights of Canadians to enjoy an unspoiled wilderness which characterizes much of Ontario\u2019s northern landscapes.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nIn planning for the future, the Ministry of Energy must:\n\n-\u00a0 Conduct serious and meaningful consultation regarding further renewable energy projects with residents of unorganized rural areas;\n\n-\u00a0 Develop a mechanism to allow rural residents to vote on whether or not they support further development of renewable energy in their areas;\n\n-\u00a0 To accept the vote of the people in decisions regarding renewable energy projects;\n\n-\u00a0 Conduct third-party responsible data regarding the populations of birds, bats and endangered species in rural areas such as Algoma prior to any further wind development;\n\n-\u00a0 Focus on economic development based on conservation of energy;\n\n-\u00a0 Educate the educators as well as the students about the critical need to be frugal, responsible users of energy in a world which is dependent on electricity as a primary need;\n\n-\u00a0 Rethink renewable energy economy as a major means of economic development in Ontario;\n\n-\u00a0 Invest heavily in research to discover new means of generating energy which is affordable and does no harm to the environment and to humans;\n\n-\u00a0 Generate present forms of energy production close to the areas both rural and urban for which it is needed.\n\nGillan Richards\n\nGoulais River\n\nAlgoma District\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207116]\n",

        "comment":"We, the members of CREW (Community Renewable Energy Waterloo) welcome the opportunity to submit our recommendations to the Long Term Energy Plan.\n\nKey recommendations:\n\n1.Any future Long-term Energy Plan should be based on a publicly available, transparent, and full lifetime feasibility and cost analysis of the most sustainable technology and policy options. 2.Define clear, ambitious energy conservation and GHG emission reduction targets in the LTEP for all economic sectors and government agencies in line with Canada\u2019s commitment to the Paris Agreement.\n\n3.Improve stability and predictability of renewable energy procurement programs for all participants.\n\n4.Design the regulatory process to support and simplify the economic participation of the communities hosting the projects.\n\n5.Change building code to include mandatory and ambitious energy efficiency standards for new buildings.\n\nOur Vision\n\nOur vision is of a prosperous Ontario with a thriving sustainable energy sector, good jobs, resilient communities and healthy environments powered, heated, cooled and moved by portfolios of sustainable energy. We are championing the transition to a low-carbon, decentralized, integrated, and inclusive energy system that is built on portfolios of sustainable technologies to meet our heating, cooling, electricity, and transportation needs.\n\nOur main concerns with the current planning approach taken\n\n1.Current approach:\u00a0 Assumes continued centralized energy delivery model\n\nRecommendation: Communities are the key element to the solution.\n\nOur communities hold the keys to the development of a low-carbon energy system that also supports local economic development. Communities should be mandated and supported to develop sustainable community energy plans. The goal should be to move towards regional and community energy self-sufficiency. This can be achieved through microgrids, based on integrated district energy systems, residential solar PV, cogeneration, community-owned bioenergy, geothermal, and water power as well as community wind farms where economically feasible and socially acceptable.\n\n2.Current approach:\u00a0 Top-down, centralized planning process\n\nRecommendation: Taking a bottom-up and integrated approach to energy planning.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s approach seems to be built on the assumption that Ontario will continue to only fill temporary gaps in its supply with distributed generation and that the bulk electricity system will continue to provide baseload electricity to the system. It therefore takes on a top-down planning approach. This justifies the omission of a comprehensive analysis of the actual potential for distributed electrical and thermal renewable energy generation but is contrary to observable trends, globally and also within the province itself.\n\nOnly a comprehensive analysis of the potential for a distributed system (or a bottom-up approach) will allow energy system planners to fully understand the aggregated effects that increasing privately-owned, distributed generation, energy conservation, storage, and community energy self-sufficiency will have on the future distribution and transmission systems.\n\n3.Current approach:\u00a0 Alternative energy sources de-emphasized\n\nRecommendation: Bioenergy \u2013 the untapped asset\n\nBioenergy is largely ignored in all planning documents, yet there is great potential for it across Ontario. Many Bioenergy technologies are very mature and range from landfill- and sewer-gas to anaerobic digestion of agricultural and food waste, to biomass combustion, all of which can be operated as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, thereby providing maximum efficiency and flexibility to meet local peak demands for heat and electricity. Renewable natural gas is the important linkage between the currently separately owned, controlled and operated electrical, thermal, and transportation systems. Bioenergy technologies and process are also crucial to the future of commercial transportation and heavy trucking, one of the greatest sources of Ontario\u2019s GHG emissions.\n\n4.Current approach:\u00a0 communities develop local energy plans in isolation from central planning Recommendation: Encourage integrated community energy planning and avoid the risk of stranded assets and resulting high electricity rates\n\nMany communities are concerned about the high cost of energy, being able to provide their communities with reliable supply of energy, even when faced with extreme weather events, and with providing their citizens with a vital economy, in which to live and to conduct business. And many communities are starting to understand the potential of using the development of local energy assets to meet local demands\u00a0 as an opportunity to meet these concerns head-on. We see more and more communities considering or already developing their own Community Energy Plans, with a growing desire to become energy-independent and the transmission grid becoming a source of back-up support to the local system. If this trend results in the development of energy islands and micro-girds, the need for centralized electricity supply will decrease to a point where extensive, unchecked investments into the continuation with the bulk electricity system will result in stranded assets and high electricity rates.\n\nFurther recommends:\n\n5.International trends and technological breakthroughs are showing us the way.\n\nProgressive jurisdictions around the world are transitioning to more resilient, efficient, and diversified renewable energy-based systems. These systems are built on distributed generation and are moving away from baseload and bulk supply designs to smart, digitalized, and highly adaptable distributed generation infrastructure.\n\n6.We need to understand the alternative.\n\nMuch research and planning has gone into the whether and how to continue with existing assets of the bulk electricity system. While the alternative of a decentralized, modular built-out based on locally-sourced, -owned, and \u2013operated resources has not been studied in-depth and the benefits are not fully understood or appreciated.\n\nIt is important that the future of our energy system is based on evidence. Any analysis of options should take into account the full cost and benefits to all people of Ontario\n\nThe Ontario Sustainable Energy Association has started to work on a Combined Energy Options Ontario project, an early presentation and executive summary was already submitted to the Ministry. CREW recommends that the Minister of Energy support the OSEA CEOO project since it will create a solid basis for future energy planning and decision making.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Klemetsch\n\nInterim President\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207115]\n",

        "comment":"ORTECH Comments on Long-Term Energy Plan\n\nORTECH Consulting Inc. (ORTECH), renewable energy, energy storage, greenhouse gas (GHG) and air emissions consulting, auditing and testing experts, would like to thank the Ministry for the opportunity to provide our view on the Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP) and for providing substantive supporting documentation such as the Ontario Planning Outlook (OPO) to allow us to formulate a meaningful response.\n\nORTECH commend the government as well as their agencies and their partners in industry in pursuing the goal of a supply of energy that is sustainable both environmentally and economically.\u00a0 Energy is fundamental to all forms of activity today and many take for granted its reliability and convenience of access.\u00a0 Energy is the fuel which drives not only our economic activities but also much of what we do in our everyday lives.\u00a0 A LTEP in today\u2019s changing world must be broad and far reaching, and touch on many different areas.\n\nThe breadth of the LTEP is important for Ontario to continue driving down GHG emissions.\u00a0 As clearly identified in the Fuels Technical Report (FTR), the GHG emissions associated with electricity have been falling for some time and are now a very small contributor to Ontario\u2019s total GHG emissions.\u00a0 Electrification of other energy uses such as heating and transportation will allow the use of decarbonized electricity to displace more GHG in these other energy use categories. This represents a new approach to energy planning as previous LTEPs have had a very dominant focus on electricity. Such an approach will require coordinated action from multiple Ministries and agencies.\n\nORTECH comments on the LTEP are structured to follow the Discussion Guide and are provided in the order of the subject areas presented in that document.\n\nDistribution and Grid Modernization\n\nThe global trend towards behind-the-meter generation will have substantial impacts on the utility sector.\u00a0 With the continually falling cost of photovoltaic solar and the steadily increasing retail cost of electricity, the push to self-generation is constantly increasing.\u00a0 ORTECH is encouraged to see that the Ministry is embracing these changes with proposed updates to the net metering regulation such as Single Entity Virtual Net Metering, removal of the 500 kW cap, and explicitly acknowledging the role of energy storage in net metering type applications.\n\nOne concern with distributed generation is the phenomenon referred to as the \u201cUtility Death Spiral\u201d.\u00a0 As rooftop solar reaches grid parity customers begin to switch towards self-generation. This reduces the amount of energy delivered by the local distribution company (LDC) which is at least partially compensated on a per kWh delivered basis. Rates are often increased to make up for lost revenue, however higher rates only serve to further incentivize self-generation, resulting in a feedback loop or Utility Death Spiral.\n\nOne possible way to avoid the Utility Death Spiral is by having the LDCs play a larger role in distributed generation.\u00a0 LDC\u2019s understand their customers and dealing with distributed electrical infrastructure is their core business.\u00a0 They are ideally positioned to facilitate further uptake of distributed generation, increase the penetration rates of clean energy, and alleviate the need to bring power from distant centralized generators to the load centres where it is needed. Powerstream\u2019s award winning Power House pilot program is an example of this and shows how utility-customer partnerships may work in the future.\n\nMicrogrids\n\nMicrogrid solutions are not only for remote communities.\u00a0 Microgrids can operate in parallel with the grid, providing the advantages of resiliency and robust infrastructure.\u00a0 Combining microgrids with district energy or community energy resources can create strong nodes where energy can be supplied even in extreme circumstances. Many applications demand very high reliability of energy supply resulting in mission critical equipment with high costs for low utilization.\u00a0 A microgrid approach to these applications can enable those systems to provide other benefits allowing for better use of existing equipment.\n\nMicrogrids can also be used to provide alternate benefits such as improved power quality, load shifting and peak shaving, amongst others.\u00a0 Using microgrids in this way can provide more reliability than traditional fossil fired back-up generators as microgrid systems will essentially be continuously tested.\n\nEnergy Storage\n\nAchieving Balance stated that the government was to include energy storage technologies in its procurement process starting with 50 MW and assessing engagement on an ongoing basis.\u00a0 This was to include: \u201ccommissioning an independent study to establish the value of energy storage\u2019s many applications throughout the system; examining the opportunities for net metering and conservation policies to support energy storage; and providing opportunities for storage to be included in large renewable procurements.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2016, it appears that energy storage procurement started and ended with 50 MW.\u00a0 The Large Renewable Procurement (LRP) was to have \u201cmechanisms to encourage innovative technologies and approaches, including considering proposals that integrate energy storage with renewable energy generation for upcoming procurement cycles\u201d.\u00a0 While an on-peak\/off-peak pricing mechanism was included in LRP 1, it did little to encourage energy storage integration.\u00a0 The benefit and capability of energy storage to smooth variable generation as well as provide additional reliability was not valued by the LRP 1 RFP.\u00a0 The sole mechanism for incorporating energy storage was for power shifting.\u00a0 However, this one application discounted the benefits provided by energy storage.\u00a0 As an explanation, the LRP 1 RFP determined the \u201ceffective capacity value\u201d of various generation technologies which represented \u201cthe amount of capacity that can be counted on at the time of system peak\u201d.\u00a0 Adding energy storage to a variable generator for the purposes of power shifting would significantly increase this value, but the RFP scoring rubric did not allocate any benefit for this.\n\nORTECH would like to commend the Ministry on moving forward with the first 50 MW of procurement. This program put Ontario at the forefront of the emerging industry of grid scale energy storage and marked the province as a global leader in the space.\u00a0 However, a lack of additional support for energy storage will pose the risk of being surpassed by other jurisdictions.\n\nInnovation and Economic Growth\n\nStart-stop procurements can be quite disruptive to industry.\u00a0 Gearing up for major RFPs followed by long periods of no activity hinders private sector planning and exacerbates the boom-bust cycle. The Feed in Tariff (FIT) program is a good example of how programs can operate more smoothly with similar sized procurements that are repeated over short time frames. However, even with FIT procurement, program windows are announced one at a time resulting in considerable uncertainty as to future market opportunities.\u00a0 Smaller procurements that are repeated more frequently will smooth out the roller-coaster type activity level in the Ontario industry, and greater certainty in future procurements and activity will help the industry develop the right level of capabilities to address needs.\n\nClimate change is a global concern.\u00a0 Clear and effective long term programs will allow Ontario industry to refine the expertise to address these challenges providing a basis to assist other jurisdictions reduce their environmental footprint, and to benefit from these export opportunities. However, a healthy domestic market that supports renewable energy and energy storage industries is required.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that environmental permitting is slowing down the development of projects.\u00a0 This year\u2019s Burden Reduction Act introduces the possibility of streamlining the permitting process.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s not yet clear if this will have appreciable benefit for energy projects.\n\nClean Energy Supply\n\nThe OPO identified potential scenarios where electrical demand is increased.\u00a0 These are related to electrification and a shift away from fossil fuel usage in transportation and heating.\u00a0 It is important that additional electricity generated to meet these needs is clean energy otherwise no GHG benefit would realized from electrification.\u00a0 For example, if higher electrical demand is mostly met by natural gas fired generators, the benefit of displacing natural gas fired heating with electrical heating is diminished.\n\nSince the Green Energy and Economy Act of 2009 came into effect, Ontario has aggressively pursued renewable energy development resulting in substantial amounts of renewable generation capacity being installed. This domestic demand for wind, solar and other forms of renewable generation allowed a strong industry to develop in the province. With advances in generating technologies and a strong local industry that is ready to deliver projects, Ontario is in a position to build wind and solar projects at competitive rates.\n\nThe LRP 1 (in 2015) procured wind energy for a capacity weighted average of $86 per MWh and solar for $157 per MWh.\u00a0 These rates are competitive with other generation technologies, with wind being one of the lowest cost forms of generation in the province and solar rapidly closing the gap.\u00a0 This is supported by the OPO Data Tables which list current technology characteristics and show the range of levelized unit costs of electricity for wind and solar to be cost competitive with all other forms of generation. It should also consider that wind and solar are still experiencing significant cost declines as the technology matures and the industry increases in scale. While Conservation First remains the strongest economic performer in the province, Ontario\u2019s supply of clean energy will be most efficiently procured from wind and solar.\n\nSummary\n\nORTECH recognizes the importance of the LTEP to the Province of Ontario and thanks the Ministry for the opportunity to provide comments.\u00a0 ORTECH comments are summarized in pint form below:\n\n\u2022Have the LDCs play a larger role in distributed generation\n\n\u2022Combine microgrids with district energy or community energy resources\n\n\u2022Assess the full value and expand the support for energy storage to ensure Ontario remains at the forefront of this evolving technology\n\n\u2022Expand clear and consistent procurement programs (e.g. FIT) to ensure market certainty which will lead to the development of the right level of capabilities to address needs\n\n\u2022Further streamline the environmental permitting process\n\n\u2022Wind and solar are becoming increasingly more cost competitive and thus represent an opportunity for expanded development while addressing further reductions GHG emissions from the overall energy supply system\n\nA strong domestic clean energy industry will allow for GHG reductions beyond our borders through clean energy trade.\u00a0 Ontario is already a net exporter of electricity and the jurisdictions where our clean electricity is being sold include regions that still rely heavily on coal-fired power plants. While the GHG emissions associated with the electricity used in province is already very low, additional low carbon electricity still has the potential to reduce GHG emissions on a global scale.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207119]\n",

Over the last 18 months we have seen the emergence of a coordinated international effort to curb global temperature rise, the Paris Accord, which engages both the developed and developing nations in fighting climate change.\u00a0 We have also seen a new federal government committed to reducing carbon emissions, ready to engage with the international community and willing to introduce a flexible framework domestically that respects provincial leadership on climate change in the past decade and accommodates the different paths and carbon reduction instruments adopted by the provinces.\n\nWrapped within these quickly moving currents has been Ontario\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan that has set the carbon reduction targets for the province and the legislation of a cap and trade regime to provide greenhouse gas emitters with the tools to reduce emissions efficiently. LTEP 2017 must now lay the foundation for transforming Ontario\u2019s energy system for a low carbon future while meeting Ontario\u2019s social and economic development goals.\n\nLTEP 2017 should provide a roadmap for reducing the carbon content of the Ontario economy in line with the government\u2019s vision, while keeping Ontario competitive and vibrant so it can continue to nurture, retain and attract talent and grow the economy.\n\nPrevious provincial energy plans were primarily focused on electricity generation, transmission and distribution, and concentrated on transforming power markets.\u00a0 Ensuring reliable power supply to Ontario homes and businesses called for sufficient generation capacity and a robust grid to meet peak demand.\u00a0 Reducing green house gas emissions meant changing the primary energy supply mix of power generation and peak shaving was the key driver for energy efficiency measures.\n\nElectricity, however accounts for only one fifth of the energy used in Ontario.\u00a0 According to the Ontario gas distribution companies, replacing Ontario\u2019s natural gas infrastructure with electricity infrastructure would require adding a stunning 80,000 megawatts of generation capacity, not to mention associated electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure.\n\nDecoupling economic growth from carbon emissions in the future mandates that LTEP 2017 examine all energy consumed in the province and offer a road map that enables Ontario to meet its energy demand with the least carbon emissions while maintaining energy affordability and competitiveness.\u00a0 This adds substantial additional complexity to LTEP 2017. First, because Ontario has no sizeable domestic production of the fuels used in transportation nor of natural gas that provides basic heat to so many of our homes and businesses in addition to fuelling industrial processes essential to our province\u2019s continued prosperity.\n\nFossil fuels, unlike electricity, are imported into the province and Ontario has considerably less control over the supply and price. Second, because most of the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel occurs at the point of use, not production. In the case of natural gas three quarters of the green house gas emissions occur at the point of use while exploration, production, transmission and distribution combined account for only a quarter of the emissions. Third, because the nature of the demand for fossil fuel and the use to which it is put is highly varied; while transportation and space and water heating account for most of the residential and commercial fuel demand, industry uses a range of input fuels for a variety of applications from feedstock, to process fuel, to heat, to back-up fuel.\u00a0 Finally, because LTEP 2017 needs to overcome the arbitrary silos for \u201celectricity\u201d and \u201cfuels\u201d to find a framework that combines the supply side perspective of electricity with the demand side perspective of fuels into a single energy roadmap for Ontario that decouples economic growth from carbon emissions effectively and efficiently.\n\nThe IESO\u2019s report Ontario Planning Outlook, released on September 1, 2016 and the Fuels Sector Working Group report the Fuels Technical Report, released on September 30, 2016, provide useful information and valuable building blocks for the long-term plan. LTEP 2017 must combine the two silo reports into a comprehensive analysis of current energy flows in the province, identifying for all stages of the energy supply and utilization path how Ontario\u2019s mix of primary fuels are converted, and how much energy is lost in conversion, in order to meet the provinces final energy demand.\n\nLTEP needs to offer a road map for transforming the way energy is produced and used to reduce carbon emissions. For example, maximizing the conversion efficiency of primary fuels by supporting technologies that convert fuel to energy closer to demand. The energy roadmap should also reflect the full life cycle carbon impact of energy options (electricity and fuels) while seeking to avoid the stranding of assets already in place. LTEP 2017 should facilitate an economically efficient transition to a lower carbon future and avoid options that require unnecessary massive new infrastructure builds or equally massive stranding of existing assets.\n\nFinally, since the transformation of the energy system will impact all Ontarians and Ontario businesses, public trust in the agencies tasked with overseeing the transformation will be key to the successful implementation of the long-term energy plan.\u00a0 LTEP 2017 should acknowledge and safeguard the independence of the IESO and Ontario Energy Board, to ensure that Ontarians continue to have faith in the regulatory governance and efficient operation of the energy systems.\n\nAbout IGUA\n\nFounded in 1973 the Industrial Gas Users Association (IGUA) represents the interests of large industrial gas users in Ontario and Quebec on natural gas and energy issues. Our membership spans key sectors of Ontario\u2019s economy including mining, steel, pulp and paper, chemicals, refineries and manufacturing. IGUA members operate some of the most energy intensive industrial facilities in Ontario, producing commodities that compete with international suppliers leaving them trade&#8208;exposed.\n\nIndustry accounts for a third of all energy used in Ontario and for about a third of the natural gas use. Energy intensive heavy industries, like IGUA members, use energy to produce bulk materials and products needed to support the life-style choices of the public.\n\nEnergy use by heavy industry is directly tied to output production. The energy objective for this sector of the economy should be to reduce the carbon and energy intensity of output product, not to reduce total energy consumption if it means reducing plant output.\n\nRecommendations\n\n\u2022Differentiate between Decarbonization and De-Industrialization; and Commit to Becoming a World Leader in Low Carbon Heavy Industry\n\nClimate change economists agree that even in a low carbon world where temperature rise has been moderated to below 1.5 degrees and where material intensity has been reduced by half, the world will need more conventional commodities (iron, steel, cement, glass, metals, chemicals and forest products) as well as new low carbon bulk commodities (hydrogen, bio fuels, poly-generation of electricity and chemicals and synthetic hydrocarbon gases and liquids). Therefore the world will have a growing need for decarbonized heavy industry.\u00a0 A copy of the report commissioned by IGUA and authored by Dr. Christopher Bataille titled: The potential to decarbonize Canadian heavy industry: Technological and policy pathways for Canadian energy intense industry to thrive in a low carbon world, and a draft copy of the IGUA summary of Dr. Bataille\u2019s work are attached for reference.\n\nOntario has committed to carbon reduction and set a trajectory for eventual decarbonisation of its economy, but unlike Qu\u00e9bec, it has not made it clear that decarbonisation does not also mean de-industrialization.\n\nIn the absence of a clear signal from the government of Ontario, voices inside and outside of government who equate de-carbonization with de-industrialization dominate the policy discourse and promote a post industrial vision for Ontario that relies solely on service industries for economic prosperity. Existing companies will be hesitant to reinvest in the province and this could lead to a hollowing-out of existing investments.\n\nSimilarly, new companies pondering investment may not see Ontario as a place to invest. Over time Ontario could lose its industrial base to competing jurisdictions, exporting (not reducing) carbon emissions and foregoing the tax revenue and jobs. Ontario also stands to lose vibrancy in the many communities who rely on heavy industry for employment.\n\nLTEP 2017 should build on Ontario\u2019s advantage: a wealth of natural resources, its skilled workforce, its strong education system and competitive corporate tax regime to attract investment from heavy industry to meet its development and economic objectives, including development in the north.\n\nLTEP 2017 needs to state that Ontario\u2019s path to carbon reduction is not de-industrialization, recognize Ontario\u2019s key industry sectors and make development of decarbonized heavy industry a provincial priority.\n\n\u2022Highlight the Need for a Transition Phase for Energy Intensive Trade Exposed Industry to Decarbonize Operations\n\nA key issue for heavy industry is the need for a transition period to decarbonize. The Bataille study identifies that energy efficiency and electrification are necessary but not sufficient for reducing the carbon emissions from heavy industry. This is because many energy-intensive production processes are already near (Best Available Technology) BAT for competitive reasons. For instance, Ontario\u2019s forestry and pulp and paper sectors have reduced reliance on fossil fuel by 75%, using biomass from their own processes instead, in order to reduce operating cost. Similarly, Canada\u2019s petrochemical industry and refineries use natural gas as feedstock when most of the rest of the world uses oil. Ontario\u2019s deep mines have implemented innovations and now extract material at a lower energy and emissions intensity, which has helped them compete with producers in jurisdictions with much lower labour costs.\n\nThe Bataille study also shows that it is theoretically possible to decarbonize Ontario\u2019s heavy industry through a mix of electrification (carbon-free power), substitution of fossil fuel with bio-mass, synthetic hydrocarbons, or hydrogen, wholly new industrial processes and carbon capture, use and storage.\u00a0 However, it also highlights that technological solutions are at various stages of development and not commercially available today.\n\nDr. Bataille also highlights the long-lived and uneven nature of investments in heavy industry and observes that the fundamental transformation needed to decarbonize existing industrial facilities in Ontario may require one to two investment cycles. Industry understands the imperative to, and is prepared to, dedicate resources towards carbon reduction and transition to a decarbonized future.\n\nLTEP should, as a minimum highlight the need for a transition phase for heavy industry to decarbonize beyond 2020 given its lumpy and long investment cycles.\u00a0 LTEP 2017 should include measures that keep energy costs competitive for energy intensive and trade exposed industries during a transition period post 2020.\n\nLTEP 2017 should incorporate a transition phase for heavy industry to decarbonize; and include measures to keep industry competitive during the transition phase.\n\n\u2022Provide an Energy Roadmap that Reflects Energy Infrastructure Investment Efficiency\n\nAction to address climate change and efficient use of installed energy infrastructure assets is not a zero sum game. Today\u2019s natural gas infrastructure can still be useful in a low carbon world, for instance for delivering synthetic or renewable natural gas or in support of distributed generation of electricity closer to demand which would avoid the need for more large central power generation, high spinning reserve requirements and new expensive and difficult to site transmission facilities.\n\nThe report recently released by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario on December 6, 2016 recognizes that pairings of natural gas and electricity related applications can support and complement each other. The Commissioner notes that natural gas can help balance and complement electricity demand in at least three ways:\n\n\u2022By meeting peak critical electricity demand\n\n\u2022By powering end use applications with gas instead of electricity (and vice versa) during periods of peak demand\n\n\u2022By using excess electricity to produce low carbon synthetics (hydrogen and renewable methane) that can be injected back into the gas grid for end use applications.\n\nInefficient use of expensive energy infrastructure drives the cost of delivered energy higher unnecessarily and is detrimental to industrial competitiveness.\n\nLTEP should consider the intersection of gas and electricity markets and adopt a road map that makes the most efficient use of the existing pipes and wires, so we don\u2019t strand assets or trigger new build unnecessarily.\n\n\u2022Differentiate Between Rate Payer and Tax Payer Obligations; Respect the Independence of the Energy Regulator\n\nReducing carbon emissions to meet Ontario\u2019s climate objectives will require the transformation of Ontario\u2019s energy system and internalizing the cost of carbon emission in the price of all fuels including natural gas and electricity for homes, businesses and institutions.\n\nIf LTEP 2017 is to succeed in paving the way for decarbonizing Ontario\u2019s economy with smart energy choices, it needs to be mindful of the impacts of internalizing carbon costs on particularly cost sensitive customers like energy intensive trade exposed industries and low income Canadians.\n\nWe urge the MOE to carefully differentiate between ratepayer obligations to cover the costs of carbon emissions resulting from their energy choices on the one hand, and taxpayer obligations to support initiatives to address social and economic impacts of carbon pricing on the other hand.\n\nApproving energy rates, which efficiently incorporate the cost of carbon, is the responsibility of the Ontario Energy Board. That rate setting responsibility should remain independent of other aspects of government initiatives to address the impacts of carbon pricing.\n\nOver the last several years Canadians have seen first hand what happens when faith in a regulatory body is eroded. The ability of the National Energy Board to fulfill its mandate to review and recommend the approval of large natural gas and oil pipelines has all but frozen as Canadians have questioned the independence of the regulatory body, and its exposure to \u201cspecial interest capture\u201d by any side of the debate. Faith in the regulatory system and a belief that all voices are being heard and considered, with decisions based on facts and sound reasoning rather than perceived political imperatives, are bedrocks of public confidence, and the public acceptability of the ultimate regulatory decisions.\n\nIn particular, the role of the OEB as an \u201ceconomic regulator\u201d, making decisions to address market failures rather than to craft social policy should be acknowledged and protected through the LTEP process. Broader economic and social policy objectives should be managed through the political process and taxpayer funding, rather than through energy rates.\n\nLTEP 2017 should protect the independence of the Ontario Energy Board and safeguard against interference that could undermine the independence, credibility and value of the expert energy regulator, and carefully differentiate between ratepayer and tax payer obligations.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207121]\n",

The truth is 97% of scientists believe that human activity is directly impacting climate change by the use of fossil fuels. It's time for us to stand with the planet, with each other, for us to come together in the name of the future of the earth. Modern society loves putting monetary value on any and all resources, but what about the value of earth? Of water? Of soil? It's time for us to seek new ventures to fill the demands of the growing population without neglecting the demands of the environment. It's time to make the change to renewables. It's time to harness the power of resources we have abundances of, like sunlight, and wind. It's time to reduce our footprint. It's time, Canada.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207123]\n",

The cost of electricity is hurting our bottom line both in our homes and for our businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the current Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP) is not delivering what we need. The status quo is too centralized, top down and expensive.\n\nWe\u2019re faced with an inefficient, outdated system. Ontario is at risk of having expensive stranded assets that costs us billions if the government continues to spend money on large centralized power generation--such as nuclear plants--at a time when technology is changing rapidly. This approach risks leaving us with expensive unusable eyesores even while our bills are skyrocketing.\n\nThe good news is that there are opportunities to chart a new course with the 2017 Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP)\u2014a course that is clean, affordable, transparent, low-carbon and flexible.\n\nMoving away from centralized energy systems not only supports the use of clean, affordable low-carbon energy solutions, it can also revitalize communities and local economies.\n\nThis course will require political leadership, however. The Liberal government will have to say no to powerful interests that want to preserve the broken status quo. They will have to have the courage of making the right choices for the province, instead of the politically motivated choices they have made in the past.\n\nLet\u2019s get this right for our economy and climate, our pocketbooks and communities. The new LTEP needs to:\n\n1. Begin with an independent public review of the full life cycle costs and pollution profile of all sources of electricity generation.\n\nIt makes no sense for Ontario to commit billions to rebuilding nuclear plants, for example, or to commit to long-term guaranteed energy contracts without an independent cost analysis of alternatives. It\u2019s also essential that we understand the impact of each generation source on climate change.\n\nSo far the government has refused to conduct such a public review of costs. But the only way to gain public trust in electricity procurement is to be transparent about the costs and pollution profile of energy sources.\n\n2. Stop the further privatization of Hydro One.\n\nThe Financial Accountability Office has already determined that this is a money loser for Ontario. In addition, a privatized Hydro One could undermine public policy goals such as energy efficiency and conservation -- programs that save money by saving energy. A privately owned Hydro One won\u2019t have any incentive to reduce the amount of electricity flowing through its transmission lines, even though this is likely the best policy option for the people of Ontario.\n\n3. Establish clear, ambitious energy efficiency and conservation targets.\n\nWe can all save money by saving energy in our homes and businesses by using energy more efficiently. Even better, efficiency and conservation will save taxpayers and ratepayers even more money because we won\u2019t have to build as many new sources of power generation.\n\nOntario should develop programs that pay for conservation kilowatts, especially during peak demand. Conservation programs are the lowest cost way to meet Ontario\u2019s energy needs.\n\n4. Develop a transition plan to move to a decentralized, distributed and local energy system. Innovation and disruptive technologies are dramatically changing the way energy is produced, distributed and used. Ontario must be prepared to capitalize on global trends to have digitized, adaptable, distributed, flexible, and decentralized energy systems. Locally-sourced, -owned, and \u2013operated energy infrastructure creates efficiencies and local economic benefits.\n\nThe LTEP should also require and support municipalities to develop community energy plans. And it should stop further consolidation and privatization of Local Distribution Companies in order to support publicly owned, community focused power distribution.\n\n5. Target 100% renewable energy by 2050.\n\nScientists tell us that we must transition to renewables to avoid the worst risks associated with the climate crisis. Ontario should jump on this chance to both meet our climate targets and be a leader in the low carbon global economy.\n\nTo do this, the LTEP needs to be flexible. Technology changes so rapidly these days that the system must be designed to take full advantage of declining prices for new technologies.\n\nThis includes supporting research and development of ways to use Ontario\u2019s sources of bioenergy, especially the use of green natural gas, and energy storage. The LTEP will require an integrated approach to energy planning across all sectors including power, heating, cooling and transportation to maximize efficiency and minimize costs.\n\nThe LTEP should be designed in a way that aligns Ontario\u2019s climate obligations with sustainable energy planning. Combining renewable energy and storage with conservation and efficiency will increase the province\u2019s energy reliability and security while also addressing other important social goals such as affordability, resiliency, job creation, innovation and community benefits.\n\n6. Close the Pickering Nuclear Station in 2018 as scheduled, and re-think current plans to rebuild nuclear plants.\n\nPeople in Ontario cannot afford the 180% price increase that Ontario Power Generation has requested to keep Pickering open and to rebuild Darlington.\n\nSince no nuclear project in Ontario\u2019s history has delivered on time or budget, the contract to rebuild Bruce should require a fixed price and not allow cost overruns to be offloaded on to ratepayers or taxpayers.\n\nIn fact, all nuclear rebuilds should be paused until an independent public review of costs and alternatives is completed. For example, low cost alternatives, such as water power imports from Quebec, should be considered before rebuilding nuclear plants.\n\nAs well, the province should examine whether centralized, inflexible nuclear power is compatible with other policy goals. If we\u2019re going to take advantage of new technologies, nuclear -- which is expensive to build and difficult to take offline once running -- is not a nimble 21st century solution.\n\nConclusion\n\nOntario has a choice to make: will the province double down on outdated expensive technology or chart a new course that takes advantage of new technologies to develop a more flexible, affordable, clean energy future.\n\nThe Green Party believes the costs of a centralized, top down approach to energy planning is unaffordable and unnecessary in the 21st century. We urge the government to make a bold break from the status quo. The 2017 LTEP is the time to do it.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMike Schreiner\n\nCc: Hon.

That figure is expected to triple in the next 18 months.\n\nFor more benefits, see our Power of Community report: trec.on.ca\/report\/the-power-of-community\/\n\nOur members have invested thousands of hours of their time and put their RRSP savings to work into real\n\nprojects to affect climate change. They are community activists and are very supportive of the government\u2019s\n\ninitiatives on Climate Change.\n\nWe operate under the 7 guiding principles of co-operatives, to build an enduring democratic civil society.\n\nPlease accept this as our contribution to the 2017 Long Term Energy Plan. We wish for a positive and\n\ncollaborative outcome to solving together the challenges ahead.\n\nWe believe that Ontario MUST transition to 100% Renewable Energy by 2050.\n\nTo meet that goal, we need to recruit every citizen, business, organization, public institution and local\n\ncommunity to work collaboratively toward that common objective. We need an Energy Transition Plan that lays out the What & When across all sectors:\n\na. Buildings\n\nb. Transport\n\nc. Electricity\n\nd. Agriculture\n\ne. Waste Management\n\nWe think the Long Term Energy Plan should be the comprehensive blueprint for that transition.\n\nWe can mobilize Community Capital to invest in local Energy Projects. Rapid technology developments in Distributed Energy Resources are reshaping the energy landscape everywhere. Thousands of smaller local generation projects of today are displacing the massive centralized bulk energy system generators of yesterday. This opens the door to local ownership of those projects \u2013 and our members are ready to take up the challenge.\n\nWhether those investments are in Conservation, Generation, Fuel Switching or Storage, the motivation\n\nis the same \u2013 invest in local projects, under local control, which create local jobs and retain profits in the\n\ncommunity.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan should facilitate the mobilization of that willing capital.\n\nWe think Partnerships with local Municipal Governments are the key to rapid adoption.\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the key to each economic stimulus program (whether Federal or Provincial) has been \u2018shovel-ready\u2019 projects that are sponsored and\/or endorsed by local Municipal Councils. But Energy Projects are different \u2013 they are not familiar and well understood projects like\n\nroads, bridges, sewers and water treatment facilities. There is a clear need for capacity building at the\n\nlocal level \u2013 and our members can help.\n\nEach of the RE Co-ops across the Province has learned how to tap into the expertise and skills of their\n\nmembership. We draw upon willing capable volunteers to identify promising projects, to mobilize community capital, to marshal technical resources. We have proven our capabilities to develop, construct and maintain successful projects. We know how to work cooperatively and collaboratively. We\n\nmake good partners.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan should foster partnerships between Municipalities and RE Co-ops to coinvest\n\nin local energy projects of all types.\n\nWe are convinced that this transition must put Conservation first.\n\nTo fight climate change and reduce our environmental footprint, Ontario\u2019s next energy plan must make\n\nconservation and efficiency the first priority for all energy decisions. This principle has to apply to our\n\nbuildings, institutions, industries and transportation systems.\n\nThe \u201cAchievable Potential Study\u201d submitted to the IESO in June 2016, showed we have the potential to\n\ncost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30% by 2035. I think the government should pursue and promote all cost-effective conservation measures.\n\nWe have asked for the Renewable Energy Co-operative definition to be changed from \u201celectricity\u201d to \u201cenergy\u201d. Our established RE Co-ops are a natural fit to provide community based financing of energy\n\nefficiency retrofits, district heating and conservation.\n\nWe want to see local communities take control of their energy futures.We believe the Long Term Energy Plan must open the door to Community Power. The Ontario Energy\n\nBoard will unleash massive new private investments through a simple regulatory change to mandate Virtual Net-metering across the Province. Existing RE Co-ops will be able to scale up by an order of\n\nmagnitude if allowed to supply our local Municipalities under long-term Power Purchase Agreements. And there will be a surge in new start-up RE Co-ops everywhere but especially in the smaller rural townships.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan needs to consider the scale and scope of the impending surge in local energy\n\nautonomy. This momentum, spurred by outspoken leaders such as Oxford County and County of Brant, cannot be stopped.

        "comment":"December 15, 2016\n\nAndrea Pastori,\n\nandrea.pastori@ontario.ca\n\nCabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator, Ministry of Energy\n\nThe below comments form the letter mailed to The Honourable Glen Thibeault, and emailed to you on December 15, 2016.\n\nThe Honourable Glenn Thibeault,\n\nOntario Minister of Energy,\n\nHearst Block 4th Floor, 900 Bay St,\n\nToronto, ON\u00a0 M7A 2E1\n\nDear Minister,\n\nRE: Ontario Long Term Energy Plan\n\nThe Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) is the largest voluntary farm organization in Canada, representing over 36,000 Ontario farm family businesses. These farm businesses form the backbone of our rural communities and our robust food system has the potential to drive the Ontario economy forward.\n\nThe agri-food sector is the number one industry in Ontario, generating $34 billion in GDP and employing 740,000 people. The Premier\u2019s challenge - to double our annual growth rate and create 120,000 new jobs by 2020, requires collaboration between government and the agriculture sector and progressive public policy.\u00a0 \u00a0 Ontario\u2019s key priority is growing the economy and creating jobs, and OFA believes addressing farm business and rural needs is vital to achieving a successful Ontario Long Term Energy Plan and expanding our economy.\n\nOntario\u2019s LTEP must bring reliable, clean energy options at competitive costs, by engaging rural and remote communities in the design and delivery of local energy systems.\u00a0 The LTEP must focus on Smart Grid efficiency, Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and micro grid generation, to manage distribution and load use.\n\nConsidering the IESO Ontario Planning Outlook, and Ontario Energy Future Report, we identified five areas for this LTEP submission; system efficiency & Conservation Demand Management, fuel mix, delivery, innovation, and cost.\n\nSystem Efficiency and Conservation & Demand Management (CDM)\n\nOn the supply side, the province should examine capacity flexibility options with our neighbors to reduce IESO\u2019s Reserve Above Requirement margin. For demand, Ontario must focus CDM squarely on peak load reduction instead of broad baseload conservation.\n\nFuel Supply Mix\n\nOntario should explore renewable and conventional natural gas options, beyond use as bulk electricity generation fuels.\u00a0 The province can exploit the efficiency, cost, reliability, and low carbon benefits of natural gas for heat and cogeneration at the customer side of the system.\n\nThis means all relevant Ministries must advance the expansion of natural gas access in rural and remote communities.\u00a0 Ontario should recognize the interplay and leverage the relationship between the Ministries of Energy, Environment & Climate Change, Natural Resources, Infrastructure, and Agriculture & Rural Affairs to reinvest in a rural energy plan and rural natural gas infrastructure.\n\nEnergy Delivery\n\nThe LTEP should advance Distributed Energy Resources and community energy projects by designing regulatory processes to support and simplify the economic participation of communities hosting micro grids, community, and DER generation projects.\u00a0 The LTEP must also invest in remote community energy, aligned with investment in northern infrastructure, agriculture, and natural resources.\n\nThe current impulse is to shore up projected future deficiencies with bulk OPG generation assets. DER and community energy systems provide a genuine opportunity for a shift to Smart Grid technology.\u00a0 While Ontario\u2019s previous attempt at Smart Grid was, to say the least, a financial failure, we still need to direct a concerted effort to bring grid technology to a tolerable level in Ontario.\u00a0 From broadband access, through to Smart Meters to moderate usage and communication with grid system technicians, Ontario needs improvements in all Smart Grid areas.\n\nInnovation\n\nThe simplest innovation for the LTEP to implement is to replace expiring fixed price contract awards with capacity agreements.\u00a0 Most if not all North American jurisdictions use or plan to introduce auctions for generators to bid for capacity.\u00a0 The Ministry and IESO have begun discussing this long-recommended market approach to replace fixed price contract awards.\u00a0 Technology-agnostic competition favours low-cost generation and encourages innovation in green energy. At the very least, this approach promotes competition between green renewable energy technologies.\n\nCollaboration and incentives should also focus on innovative opportunities for DER, micro grids, storage, Smart Grid, net meter systems, and Smart Metering technology.\n\nCost\n\nSavings from capacity auctions will only show meaningful results as existing price contracts are replaced through attrition.\u00a0 Larger commercial and industrial demand response, and conservation programs for high-use residential customers have reduced some user costs. However, many fixed income, smaller commercial, rural and farm business customers are disproportionately burdened with high energy costs.\n\nPast LTEP signals ushered in Large Renewable Procurements, green energy tariffs and conservation programs.\u00a0 The LTEP should send a signal to review electricity service classes.\n\nMost rural residential and farm customers pay unaffordable delivery charges.\u00a0 The annual Global Adjustment increased by $5 billion from 2011 to 2015.\u00a0 Annual Global Adjustment will rise by another $2 billion for 2016.\n\nCost parity between LDC power and off-grid generation will either result in significant customer withdrawal from traditional LDCs, or lead to a combination of utility DER and community grids. The LTEP must promote economic short and long term solutions outside urban centres, adding generation where we need additional rural capacity and leading rural economic development.\n\nNet metering, and improved net metering options must involve simple processes to encourage power consumers to adopt this technology or we risk customers abandoning the bulk energy system.\n\nMinister, Ontario farmers and our rural communities are highly dependent on a reliable and competitive electrical system.\u00a0 Primary agriculture alone accounts for 85,000 Hydro One metered accounts.\u00a0 We believe an opportunity now exists, via a well designed and executed Long Term Energy Plan to enable our farm sector and rural Ontario to rebuild a thriving economy.\n\nBecause of this the OFA is very engaged in the development of the LTEP and look forward to extensive consultations with your and your Ministry to ensure we develop an electricity and energy plan to fully capitalize on rural Ontario\u2019s potential.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKeith Currie President\n\nEncl.\n\nc:\u00a0 Andrea Pastori, andrea.pastori@ontario.ca \u00a0 Cabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator, Ministry of Energy\n\nBackground\n\nSystem Efficiency and Conservation & Demand Management (CDM)\n\nImprove contingency options to reduce Reserve Above Requirement margin\n\nIESO assures supply adequacy by setting a Reserve Above Requirement margin to account for nuclear refurbishment delays or variable generator performance and availability. Managing surplus baseload generation effectively and securing much needed market flexibility are needed to plan for contingencies.\u00a0 More capacity trades with Quebec and improved interties with US markets both will help better manage the excessive amount of Ontario\u2019s Reserve Above Requirement generation.\n\nDesign CDM incentives to reduce on-peak load instead of broad conservation\n\nClass A Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI) accounts for 55% of Ontario\u2019s 1,800 MW demand response capacity, and CDM reduces electricity demand by 13 tWh. However, the bulk of Ontario CDM only addresses the baseload generation.\u00a0 Time-of-use and the problematic Peaksaver PLUS programs accounted for only 12% of 2015 demand response capacity. Ontario must incent innovative peak load reduction. Access to quick response generation, new technology in energy storage, and innovative on-peak demand response will help reduce the magnitude of on-peak variability and improve control of Ontario\u2019s Reserve Above Requirement generation.\n\nFuel Supply Mix\n\nExploit renewable and natural gas efficiency\n\nThe LTEP should expand access to conventional and renewable natural gas. Installed capacity for natural gas generation has a significant place in the electricity system, but the most efficient use of natural gas is at the local level to generate heat, ideally supplemented with power. Cleaner and more reliable that diesel or fuel oil, natural gas brings an uninterrupted fuel option to rural Ontario homes and businesses.\u00a0 Electric vehicles are a clean solution for urban centres right now. Natural gas can provide a clean solution for the rest of Ontario. RNG and piped gas facilities along strategic transport corridors can facilitate retail and commercial natural gas solutions for trucking and commercial fleets.\n\nInvest in natural gas access expansion in rural and remote communities\n\nThe Ministry should encourage the timely review of gas utility expansion proposals before the OEB. The OEB\u2019s Generic Natural Gas Access Review ruled to permit project specific rate guarantees.\u00a0 This will bring some projects to within financial requirement but the OEB ruling put the burden of aid-to-construction costs squarely on the shoulders of rural municipalities. It is vital to recognize that rural municipalities and small communities do not yet have the industrial or commercial tax base to finance connection without meaningful government support.\u00a0 Rural and small municipalities already struggle to raise sufficient funds to maintain their current stock of infrastructure. Strategic government investments in rural infrastructure, beyond the $200 million loan and $30 million grant, and sound policy and program design will facilitate economic growth that benefits all Ontarians.\n\nAdvancing access to pipeline natural gas and RNG does not mean abandoning other fuels from rural Ontario. For communities beyond the reach of current pipeline expansion initiatives, geothermal, propane, combined renewables, CHP, compressed and liquid natural gas delivered to reinjection to local grids, will all provide energy solutions for rural and remote communities.\n\nLeverage Ministry of Energy relationships with key development, agriculture and infrastructure stakeholders to reinvest in a rural energy plan and rural infrastructure\n\nA portion of the proceeds from the sale of Hydro One Networks Inc. (HONI) shares must be invested back to rural Ontario. One half of HONI share value is comprised of distribution assets located throughout rural Ontario.\u00a0 While transmission assets are funded by all Ontarians, small town and rural Ontario customers have borne the financial brunt to build and maintain HONI distribution assets for generations.\u00a0 Directing some of the proceeds from the Hydro One public share offering to a Rural Ontario Natural Gas program, is a sound investment in rural economic development, it is also a calculated use of some of those proceeds to the communities that financed the Hydro One network. The LTEP should include plans for a Rural Ontario Natural Gas program investing up to $75M annually for twenty years to support community aid-to-construction costs.\n\nThis investment in rural infrastructure is essential to growth and adding rural and remote attachments will begin to pay dividends right away.\u00a0 The immediate fuel costs savings in rural agriculture-based communities will be reinvested in rural economies. And, with a healthier agrifood sector base, these reinvestments will further multiply through food processing, transportation, and innovative investment in cleaner power options for rural Ontario.\n\nBusinesses can factor high costs for electricity and trucked fuel into decisions on facility location.\u00a0 However, no business can factor in the cost of service interruption. Businesses must have access to reliably supplied energy options. In every corner of rural and remote Ontario, winter road closures due to poor visibility are common occurrences. With access to an uninterrupted fuel source, the agri-food sector will make investments necessary to expand production in rural Ontario.\n\nOver the mid and long term, these rural investments will reduce constraints on urban infrastructure, including transmission and distribution assets, and extend the life and capacity limit of existing urban infrastructure. Locating newly enabled processing, commercial and manufacturing facilities in rural centres allows people to live closer to work, reduces commutes, enlarges municipal tax base, and enables innovations in rural transportation and local power generation.\u00a0 Ministry direction on rural, resource, infrastructure and environmental factors need to be unified.\n\nEnergy Delivery\n\nAdvance Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and community energy hubs\n\nCapacity and capacity restraints must be addressed as part of mid and long term planning. Vast areas of Ontario with the ability to feed in generation are now prohibited because of our aging and limited transmission capacity. This led to suspending contract renewal negotiations for existing generation while campaigning for new large procurements in other areas. While the Ontario electricity system is in a surplus generation position, the LTEP should plan for DER.\n\nLDCs in and around the GTA project lower demand, even with new construction. Price parity has brought in net metering, and conservation campaigns continue to reduce demand. For LDCs operating outside urban centres, DER can provide a new business line, help address capacity restraints, and encourage new commercial, industrial and residential development.\u00a0 DER strategically sited to surround the larger Greater Golden Horseshoe, where feedstocks are located and generation is needed, will facilitate rural and community development. Decommissioned assets at Nanticoke and Lambton should be part of LTEP plans to use existing infrastructure once load profiles begin to overtake generation. An unbiased technology approach to capacity agreements for recommissioned assets and DER will keep costs aligned with market prices. DER will provide an opportunity for local LDCs to participate in a new system instead of abandoning small rural communities to assume complete departure from the system grid.\n\nSupport communities hosting Industrial, community and DER projects\n\nThe Green Energy Act manages the degree of local government influence in decisions to approve industrial-scaled renewable generation. This ensures local preferences do not undermine green energy procurements. LTEP should plan for the eventuality when load surpasses generation. The next iteration of industrial-scaled renewable procurements should be a combination of DER and community energy hubs.\u00a0 Local government should have a stronger voice to ensure installations are sited at mutually agreeable locations and specifically, not sited on farmed land. As future procurement programs are rolled out, they must be designed to encourage significantly more community ownership options, engagement and collaboration between generators, land owners and local community governments.\n\nThe LTEP should design a regulatory process to assist communities, residents and businesses to adopt net metering and micro grid solutions. Small scale generation and storage systems will enhance the existing power grid and in many cases, provide alternative generation sited where load is located. Community based and community owned storage and generation will contribute to reducing peak demand without constraining urban capacity. This extends the life of existing infrastructure thereby reducing the amount of Global Adjustment all customers pay.\n\nWith access to pipeline natural gas, DERs including combined heat power (CHP), micro-CHP, fuel cells, and reciprocating motors, will compliment hybrid solar and wind power systems, microturbines, rooftop solar PV, small wind power systems, geothermal systems and a combination of these systems to bring generation to rural Ontario loads. For example, CHP with photovoltaic and battery systems can provide full electric power for homes without prohibitive storage expenses. In remote areas, rooftop solar and battery systems can run geothermal pumps in the summer when electricity is more expensive, and LDC power during the winter. \u00a0 \u00a0 Invest in remote community energy, aligned with investment in northern infrastructure\n\nThe Ministry acted on the 2013 LTEP to begin grid-connection for 21 of 25 Hydro One Remote First Nation Communities and help reduce their reliance on local diesel generators. High costs for diesel and air transport, diesel generation impacts on environment and quality of life (noise, exhaust, risk of spill, service outages), have made transmission connection viable. (IESO - Electricity Planning in Northwest Ontario NOMA April 29, 2016)\n\nThese initiatives benefit all Ontarians and we must continue to improve remote capacity\n\nRemaining communities not feasible for grid connection should be candidates for innovative pilots to explore clean local community generation. LTEP should incent these pilots as northern capacity solutions without encouraging specific technology. Additional to electricity, LTEP should incent natural gas connection at key northern transmission pipeline intervals. Reliably supplied natural gas, CHP, biogas and biofuel fed from local forestry by-products, geothermal and other renewables can help maintain and grow indigenous communities.\u00a0 \u00a0 Northern and remote capacity and independence presents a real opportunity to pilot community owned and maintained energy hub systems. Using generated heat to support small local greenhouse development can also provide fresh produce priced well below the cost to fly processed food into these communities.\n\nInnovation\n\nDevelop capacity agreements instead of fuel\/technology specific price contracts\n\nOFA agreed with the decision to suspend LRP and Waste to Fuel programs. As currently designed they hinder the ability for the Ontario market to remain flexible.\u00a0 Moving away from longer term fixed price contracts to market priced capacity agreements will reduce Global Adjustment and will foster innovative, efficient and economic options able to compete for capacity.\n\nOntario is in a surplus electricity supply position for the next six to eight years under all four IESO outlook scenarios. As long-term fixed price contracts for specific types of generation expire, Ontario will begin to cross into an energy deficit around 2023. For now, the surplus brings the opportunity to transition to capacity agreements.\n\nGuaranteed market access will still provide enough assurance to attract new and renegotiated contracts, encourage innovation and stifle existing resources that cannot compete in an open market. The transition from price guarantees to capacity agreements will eventually narrow the gap covered by Global Adjustment.\u00a0 With a smaller per cent of usage costs going to Global Adjustment, customers are re-motivated to innovate and participate in CDM.\n\nExpand inter-jurisdictional Capacity Trade agreements\n\nOntario\u2019s surplus electricity position also provided a good position to enter a Capacity Trade Agreement with Quebec.\u00a0 Swapping high cost capacity during each province\u2019s different peak season is a simple and effective way to address on-peak load issues. As intertie and capacity constraints allow, Ontario should increase capacity trades.\n\nAdvance opportunities for innovative distribution generation, micro grid systems\n\nLTEP should encourage integrated community energy planning and avoid the risk of stranded assets and resulting high electricity rates. High costs, reliability and extreme weather events will continue to drive local communities to explore and develop local energy to meet local demands.\u00a0 As energy hubs and micro-girds become more prevalent, centralized generation and distribution will be regarded as supplementary.\u00a0 The transition risks stranding assets in the bulk system. As\u00a0 with LDCs transitioning to DER, planning should support smaller rural communities to explore modular systems based on locally sourced, owned, and operated resources.\n\nAdvance opportunities for reliability, Smart Grid and Smart Meter technology\n\nRural Ontario shouldered significant costs to establish Ontario\u2019s electricity distribution system. However, all rate payers now need to see mid and long term government commitment to rural system improvements; low voltage issues, brownouts, and uncontrolled electricity are normal occurrences in rural communities that are not considered acceptable in urban areas. The LTEP must enable IESO and LDCs to reduce occurrences with longer term planning solutions and reasonable funding to address rural network safety and reliability issues.\n\nUtilities with multi-transformers and multiple distribution line paths maintain assets on a component basis with little to no service interruption.\u00a0 This efficient and economic process also results in a robust database of component and asset condition and life cycle.\u00a0 Because of the rural, thinly populated nature of rural grids, Hydro One asset management involves frequent scheduled service interruptions to upgrade rural assets at single transformer unit stations with single terminal distribution lines. During Hydro One scheduled service interruptions, this involves replacing as many components as are reasonably recommended, including some components not yet at end of life. This inefficient and costly process could be improved if LTEP signalled that rural utilities adopt longer term strategies for upkeep and new build proposals to consider a smarter grid with improved asset management potential. An additional benefit would be improved safety, quality and reliability to the rural network.\n\nCost, Pricing\n\nReview electricity service classes\n\nRecently, the government announced a lower threshold peak demand for participation in the ICI program. This will allow additional commercial\/industrial electricity customers to become Class A customers and participate in demand response to significantly reduce their peak power requirements and lower their Global Adjustment.\u00a0 Beyond a few additional greenhouses and very large livestock operations able to invest in cogeneration equipment, the lowered threshold does little for the broader farming community.\u00a0 This leaves much of the rural agriculture sector to cope with prohibitively expensive electricity costs.\n\nMany midsized farm operations with a high peak electricity demand could benefit from demand response but only if they curtailed grid demand with cogeneration fuelled with biogas or natural gas. Just as signals from previous LTEP ushered in CDM and green energy programs, this LTEP should signal a review of customer service classes and provide provincial support towards a farm sector electricity class and sector based solutions.\n\nWhereas peak rates, particularly time-of-use rates, are meant to incent CDM behaviour, farms with livestock barns cannot simply curtailing draw during a system peak summer heat wave, or switch to non-peak times to run their operations. Ontario\u2019s high on-peak rates, Global Adjustment, and rural line delivery costs are important factors when considering farm business expansion decisions.\n\nLoad profiles vary greatly by farm size and type. Farm businesses without the flexibility to curtail peak consumption are not appropriate customers for time-of-use billing. And, farms using a continuous baseline energy load can be regarded as an asset for grid management. Operations that adhere to a high degree of CDM, geared to farm type and size, should be eligible for a farm sector electricity rate class, identified by an operator\u2019s Farm Business Registration number. A competitively priced agricultural-specific rate class for all farm types and size, will allow farms to better manage one of their most expensive inputs \u2013 energy costs. The resulting economic payback by sustaining farming in Ontario is immediate and continual.\n\nTable 1 - Hydro One Farm Customers in all Service Types 85,340\n\nFarm Customers by Hydro One Service All Customers\n\nResidential Urban 248\n\nResidential Medium Density 7,155\n\nResidential Low Density 68,260\n\nGeneral Service - Energy 9,557\n\nGeneral Service Demand 120\n\nSub Transmission 12\n\nCost parity, delivery costs, Other jurisdictions & energy self-sufficiency\n\nIn the Ontario market, and as more customers consider energy self-sufficiency, the consequences for the remaining utility customers are enormous. With less loads sharing the burden of financing Global Adjustment, utility charges will become a much larger per cent of total household consumption.\n\nHowever, it is difficult in not impossible to compare Ontario to neighbouring jurisdictions. Fuel mix, geographic influence on technology feasibility, load profile and proximity to urban markets, the position of each jurisdiction along the climate change axis, and the historic appetite towards an open energy market \u2013 these all must be factored to compare jurisdictions. What is clear to see, is that across all of Canada, rural residential utility costs are equal to 29% of shelter costs and 39% of food costs \u2013 electricity is the dominant cost driver.\n\nTable 2 - Utility Costs as per cent of Consumption Costs\n\nConsumption Budget For Utilities All Canada Versus Rural Canada\n\nElectricity \u2013 Fuel - Water\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $2,551 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $3,159\n\nShelter Expenses\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $14,609 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $11,083\n\nEFW as % of Shelter Expenses\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 17% \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 29%\n\nFood Expenses \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $8,109\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $7,999\n\nEFW as a % of Food Expenses\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 31% \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 39%\n\nStatistics Canada Table 203-0025.\n\nRural delivery charges are significantly higher than urban rates. As shown in Table 2, rural customers pay ten per cent more for utilities than for food and shelter. Energy poverty is growing at alarming rates especially in rural Ontario.\u00a0 LTEP should review reasons to maintain such misaligned urban\/rural differences and investigate postage stamp costs for all delivery charges in all Ontario regions.\n\nFor business and industry rates, instead of trying to compare Ontario to competing jurisdictions, with different economies, geographies, populations and energy system assets we can look at rate declines within every jurisdiction separately. Chart 1 shows steep price declines from residential through to industrial rates within each jurisdiction. All but Ontario incent industry with an advantageous electricity rate.\n\nFor a Jurisdictional Rate Comparison \u00a2 per kWh using US EIA and Manitoba Hydro Data, see http:\/\/www.ofa.on.ca\/issues\/submission\/ofa-letter-to-minister-thibeault-regarding-ontario's-long-te rm-energy-plan\n\nA reliable grid and access to safe affordable energy will help sustain and deliver on the Premier\u2019s challenge to expand rural Ontario and the agri-food sector. A LTEP with a cost-effective focus, balanced with a complete fuel mix, reliability, environmental, community and Indigenous engagement, CDM and capacity driven innovation, will benefit all Ontarians.\n\nLTEP has the enviable duty to advance competitive priced energy generation, delivery and consumption to Ontario. Success is measured by more than price. Reliability, flexibility, sustainability and carbon results will also signal the degree we attain our goal. If Ontario has done the heavy lifting in the electricity sector by closing coal fired generation and adding green sustainable generation to the provincial portfolio, LTEP should signal a change in mindset from bulk asset management at prohibitive costs, to a flexible modular system able to compete with neighboring jurisdictions only now beginning to look for clean energy procurem\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207137]\n",

OFVGA would like to thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on the Planning Ontario's Energy Future: A Discussion Guide to Start the Conversation consultation.\n\nLocal food security is important for a sustainable and healthy Ontario. In order to successfully achieve this, farmers need to be able to have access to reliable and affordable electricity and natural gas. OFVGA would like to present the following comments to support Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP):\n\nThe case for a farm and \/ or industrial electricity class\n\nOntario farmers are faced with rising on-farm energy costs. OFVGA asks the province to implement a farm and \/ or industrial class \u2013 an electrical rate comparable to neighboring jurisdictions to maintain the sustainability and competiveness of farming and the availability of local food. OFVGA recognizes that it is difficult to compare Ontario to other areas, as there are numerous factors to take into consideration such as service fees as one example.\n\nMost farmers do not have the flexibility to curtail energy use during peak demand. Therefore, smart meters do not make sense. For example, farmers who have on-farm cold storage units or packing warehouses require 24-hour electrical uses in order to maintain food production capacity. For this reason, a flat rate electricity class would be more appropriate. It is time that a farm and \/ or industrial electrical class be considered to ensure that family farms in Ontario remain viable to produce local food.\n\nSupport for rural infrastructure\n\nOFVGA is supportive of the LTEP\u2019s approach to energy diversity. For example, natural gas offers a more competitive energy option for the horticultural industry and the farming sector as a whole. According to the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, natural gas access to rural Ontario could save farmers and businesses more than $1 billion annually in energy costs. OFVGA looks forward to working with the Ministry of Energy to fully understand the implications of the recent Ontario Energy Board ruling about the aid-in-construction required to bring natural gas to rural Ontario. In addition, by improving natural gas access it opens the door to the implementation of combined heat and power (CHP) for both energy conservation and for dispatchable generation. For example, this type of system would be ideal for greenhouse growers whose energy costs account for one-third of their operating expenses. Lastly, OFVGA asks that the government support initiatives that explore the potential for micro-grids to deliver regional electricity efficiently in both rural and underserviced areas. This transition represents a fundamental shift in the way energy is managed within a community and Ontario\u2019s farmers will require support to make this leap.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe LTEP should take into consideration the unique challenges faced by the horticultural sector and the agricultural industry. In 2013 the Premier Kathleen Wynne challenged the agri-food industry to double its annual growth rate and create 120,000 jobs by the year 2020. We are a long ways off from this target, though we recognize there is room for growth within the fruit and vegetable industry in Ontario. The creation of an energy policy that helps enable farmers to reach this target through reliable, affordable energy will be key.\n\nOntario Fruit and Vegetable Growers\u2019 Association (OFVGA)\n\nThe Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers\u2019 Association (OFVGA) advocates for the\n\nsustainability of fruit, vegetable and greenhouse farmers as a nationally recognized not for-profit association. The edible horticulture sector supports 30,000 farm-based, non- family jobs in Ontario, as well as a further 8,700 jobs specific to horticulture and specialty crops. More than 125 different fruit and vegetable crops are grown in Ontario.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207143]\n",

It is very important that when putting together a long-term energy plan we have to consider putting conservation first. It is known to be the cheapest source of energy and also the lowest impact on the environment.\u00a0 Switching to renewable energy also means a more decentralized energy system. This also means that giving more control to people to produce their own energy.\u00a0 We should also be not dependent on the higher cost of building and maintenance of nuclear energy and be putting the life of\u00a0 Ontarians at risk. And lastly, I believe that switching to renewable means less pollution. This is not only good for the community but also for the environment.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207145]\n",

Over the past century our quality of life has been built essentially on a one-time gift of fossil fuel and energy dense minerals such as uranium.\n\nThese non-renewable sources of energy can be credited with the legacy of enabling the highest quality of living experienced in the human age however, by their very definition, they have a relatively short shelf-life.\n\nThe transition away from non-renewable energy is underway on a global scale. In 2015 and again in 2016, leaders from around the world committed to a significant reduction in carbon emissions and this objective will be met largely by the continued elimination of carbon emitting fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil derivatives. In Ontario, air quality and respiratory health have improved significantly since the elimination of coal power stations. In 2015, Oxford County took the bold step of committing to the development of a new energy paradigm by committing to a net 100% renewable energy (100%RE) municipality by 2050. In 2017, we will continue to assist the Province in their goal of establishing this same transition to a renewable energy future.\n\nOur detailed submission addresses the Ministry of Energy document \u2018Planning Ontario\u2019s Energy Future\u2019, through a narrative that seeks to address questions raised under Section 6 \u2013 Changes on the Horizon.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1.The LTEP must advance the \u201cconservation first\u201d approach to energy management and planning even further with the direct result of substantive energy demand reductions from all energy consumers; 2.The LTEP must focus on advanced grid networks that combine the benefits of renewable energy generation with intelligent network controls that are capable of optimizing energy demand and production through highly reliable networks;\n\n3.The LTEP must lead to significant carbon reduction targets from all energy sources and, in doing so, also addressing full lifecycle issues;\n\n4.The LTEP must recognize the significant role of community and business sector education and engagement will play in the transformational shift away from non-renewable sources of energy;\n\n5.We invite the Province of Ontario to promote and work directly with communities, such as Oxford County, who are committed to the concept of 100% Renewable Energy by 2050.\n\nThank you\n\nWe look forward to ongoing dialogue on this important issue\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207146]\n",

Glenn Thibeault, Minister of Energy:\n\nPlease accept this letter as a formal submission in support of Bruce Power \u2013 and nuclear power \u2013 in the 2016 Long-Term Energy Plan review.\n\nSeven organizations \u2013 the Bruce Power Pensioners Association, Canadian Nuclear Workers\u2019 Council, the Grey Bruce Labour Council, North American Young Generation Nuclear, the Power Workers\u2019 Union, The Society of Energy Professionals, and the Bruce Chapter of Women in Nuclear-Canada \u2013 joined forces in October to launch an online petition to gather support for Bruce Power. The response has been overwhelming, with 6,473 signatures as of Dec. 16. The petition is included with this letter.\n\nWe believe Bruce Power\u2019s role in Ontario electricity sector has never been more important. The company safely provides 30% of Ontario\u2019s electricity at 30% less than the average residential price \u2013 keeping costs low for families and businesses \u2013 while also providing jobs for 4,200 full-time workers, including many of those in our member organizations. Bruce Power\u2019s impact reaches much further than the Lake Huron shoreline though, as its ongoing operations injects over $4 billion directly and indirectly into Ontario\u2019s economy every year, while creating and sustaining 22,000 jobs.\n\nThe economic impact of Bruce Power has increased significantly since the company began its $13 billion life-extension investment on the site in 2016, in the lead-up to its first Major Component Replacement program on Unit 6 in 2020. This private investment program \u2013 outlined in the 2013 LTEP and established through an amended Bruce Power Refurbishment Implementation Agreement in December 2015 \u2013 will have a long-term, positive economic impact on Bruce, Grey and Huron counties, suppliers, local communities and the entire province, now and for future generations.\n\nBruce Power nuclear also helps keep our air clean, generating no carbon emissions from the production of its energy, while it also provided 70% of the electricity the Ministry of Energy needed to shut down its coal-fired facilities. The result has been the elimination of smog days in Ontario, healthier air for our families to breathe, and a head start for the Province as it works to achieve its Climate Change Action Plan goals.\n\nThese reasons are why thousands of people gave Bruce Power their support through our petition. We want Bruce Power to remain an integral part of Ontario\u2019s energy vision, as was outlined in the 2013 LTEP, providing 6,400 Megawatts of carbon-free, low-cost, reliable electricity to a third of the province through 2064.\n\nWe ask the Ministry of Energy to maintain Bruce Power\u2019s role in the LTEP as a provider of 6,400 MW of clean electricity for decades to come.\n\nDoug Mullaly\n\nBruce Power Pensioners Association\n\nDave Shier\n\nCanadian Nuclear\n\nWorkers\u2019 Council\n\nKevin Smith\n\nGrey Bruce Labour Council\n\nLarry Alderdice\n\nPower Workers\u2019 Union\n\nOrie Good\n\nNorth American-Young\n\nGeneration Nuclear\n\nScott Travers\n\nThe Society of Energy Professionals\n\nLee-Anne Edmunds\n\nTracy Primeau\n\nBruce Chapter of\n\nWomen in Nuclear-Bruce Chapter\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207148]\n",

        "comment":"City of Guelph\n\nSubmission to the EBR Registry Posting 012-8840\n\nDecember 16, 2016\n\nThe City of Guelph approved a Community Energy Plan in April 2007. Since renamed the Community Energy Initiative (CEI), the original Plan is in its 10th year of implementation and now counted among over 200 community energy plans in development or implementation across Canada.\n\nThe current goals of the CEI are a 50% per capita reduction in energy use and a 60% per capita reduction in GHG emissions by 2031.\n\nThe activities defined in the CEI focus on four main areas:\n\n1.Energy Efficiency and Conservation\n\n2.Local Generation\n\n3.Local Electrical and Thermal Distribution\n\n4.Urban Planning (that enables items #1 through #3)\n\nThe City has positioned its energy planning as an economic development objective. The Community Energy file is overseen in coordination with Economic Development and Downtown Renewal under the banner of Business Development and Enterprise.\n\nIn mid-2016, Council approved an update to the Community Energy Initiative to reflect a 10-year change in:\n\n1.Market conditions;\n\n2.Technological innovation; and\n\n3.Policy context with the other orders of government.\n\nThis is why we are pleased to have the opportunity to submit our comments to the Province\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan consultations. We thank the Ministry of Energy and its affiliated agencies, the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) and the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) for their support for policies and programs that support the goals of Guelph\u2019s CEI and the growing number of similar initiatives underway in cities and towns across the Province.\n\nThe City encourages the Province\u2019s support for networking organizations such as Quality Urban Energy Systems of Tomorrow (QUEST) \u2013 Ontario Caucus and the Clean Air Council. Like them, we believe that municipalities can play a significant role in helping the Province to achieve its climate change and energy-related objectives.\n\nWith this in mind, we offer the following comments:\n\nLocal Energy Plans and Relations to Provincial Plans\n\n\u2022Increase Energy Literacy: Community Energy Planning was referenced within the Province\u2019s Climate Action Plan; however, in order to better integrate it with the Long Term Energy Plan, there is the need to increase energy literacy for municipalities and the public. As such, there is the need to enhance the understanding of the provincial electrical system and the factors affecting it. There is also the need to consider both electricity and natural gas in a more integrated fashion. Adopting and advancing policies such as Energy Reporting and Benchmarking and Home Energy Ratings and Disclosure will be critical to increasing energy literacy and informing and engaging energy consumers; but it is also critical that these policies are supported and accompanied by training and education.\n\n\u2022Improve the ability of Municipalities and their Stakeholders to Implement CEPs: While CEPs are challenging to develop; their implementation is an even greater challenge. There are significant regulatory, bureaucratic, institutional and financial barriers associated with advancing community energy projects. Specifically, the City of Guelph has developed a program based on the Local Improvement Charge (LIC) mechanism. The program is called the Guelph Energy Efficiency Retrofit Strategy (GEERS). The City encourages the Province\u2019s financial participation and support in LIC-based building retrofit programs through the \u201cGreen Bank\u201d under the auspices of the Climate Change Action Plan.\n\n\u2022District Energy systems can play a substantially larger role in enabling communities to meet their electricity and thermal needs in a more efficient and cost effective manner. However in order for District Energy to generate greenhouse gas reduction and resilience opportunities, the Province is encouraged to consider ways to support the difficult start-up period in developing integrated thermal distribution networks.\n\n\u2022Green Development Standards\/Climate Change by-laws may be able to support community energy implementation, but only if municipal authority in this area extends to the building level. The City of Guelph looks forward to working with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs on updates to the Ontario Building Code to bring the Code into alignment with the Province\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan.\n\nCommunity Energy Plans and Utilities\n\n\u2022There are regulatory limitations for utilities to engage in Community Energy Planning based in applying rate-based financing. Community energy projects cannot access rate-based financing and municipalities are unable to mandate energy connections to ensure a long-term customer base for community energy projects. To address the regulatory framework in which community energy projects exist, the Province and Municipalities must work together.\n\n\u2022In order to increase alignment between land use planning and energy planning, municipal planners and utility planners could be more proactive in identifying energy demand from new developments. It is important to recognize energy limitations and where community energy may be best able to address local energy demand. Increased communication earlier in the process by the necessary stakeholders may also address the challenges distributed energy projects face when connecting to the existing grid and how targeted conservation and distributed renewables can best reduce the need for new transmission and distribution infrastructure. This consideration should also be applied to the IESO\u2019s Regional Energy Planning exercise through incorporation of a lens for decentralized electricity systems as an alternative to, or complement to, future investments in electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure.\n\n\u2022Regarding energy data, the Ministry of Energy, Local Distribution Companies, and municipalities need to work more collaboratively\u00a0 to improve access to energy use data to help understand how energy is used in Ontario communities. From past experience, municipalities have had to allocate a significant amount of time and staff resources to gathering energy use data for their CEPs. This increased time and staff resources for data collection has reduced the resources available for implementation and is highly inefficient. Improving access to community energy use as well as analysis was identified as part of the province\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan and references to furthering that goal should also be addressed in the upcoming Long Term Energy Plan.\n\nNatural Gas\n\n\u2022It will be important to be able to look at Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and the role that municipal sewage, landfill sites, and solid organic waste can play in increasing RNG supply. Offsets may also create RNG opportunities. There is a need for the province, utilities and municipalities to work together to further develop the business case for RNG. In addition, the province should set RNG targets.\n\nMicro-Grids\n\n\u2022Micro grids are important in the technological advancement of our communities\u2019 energy systems. A greater understanding of micro grid projects being undertaken is needed to identify the opportunities and challenges of moving away from our traditional grids.\u00a0 The City of Guelph looks forward to learning more from the IESO and utilities on micro grid projects being tested in Ontario.\n\n\u2022The City also encourages the province to consider supporting LDCs to make the necessary changes to increase grid capacity to integrate higher levels of distributed, renewable generation.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207150]\n",

The EDA is the voice of Ontario\u2019s local electricity distribution sector, which consists of municipally and privately owned local distribution companies (LDCs). The distribution sector employs over 10,000 people directly and makes hundreds of millions annually in direct contributions to municipal and provincial revenues. LDCs deliver electricity to over 5 million residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional customers across Ontario and therefore are the trusted face of the electricity system for customers.\n\nOver the last 10 years, there have been substantial changes to the electricity sector in Ontario. Developments such as the implementation of the Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009, growth of distributed energy, delivery of the Ontario Clean Energy Benefit and phase-out of the Debt Retirement Charge have had significant impact on LDCs and customers\n\nAccording to the Independent Electricity System Operator\u2019s (IESO) Ontario Planning Outlook (OPO), the electricity system is \u201cwell positioned to continue to meet provincial needs \u2026 while adapting to significant change across the sector\u201d. As such, supply is not an immediate concern.\n\nHowever, innovation, increased customer participation and policy decisions continue to modernize the electricity system, moving Ontario away from a system that has been characterized by a one-way flow of electricity. Policies related to the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), such as electrification, will also greatly impact the system. Outlooks C and D in OPO could return Ontario to a \u201cwinter-peaking jurisdiction\u201d. All these changes will deeply affect the distribution of electricity. Consequently, the successful delivery of government policy priorities and innovation will depend inherently on strengthening, modernizing, and empowering Ontario\u2019s distribution sector.\n\nTherefore, the EDA recommends that the 2017 LTEP focus on: (I) Expanding conservation and integrating climate change; (II) Pursuing further efficiencies and savings; (III) Supporting partnerships; and (IV) Driving innovation.\n\n\n\nI.EXPANDING CONSERVATION AND INTEGRATING CLIMATE CHANGE:\n\nIn the 2013 Long-Term Energy Plan, the Government of Ontario adopted a policy to put \u201cConservation First\u201d before building new energy infrastructure, where cost-effective. Prior to that, the Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009 and the 2010 LTEP also pursued energy efficiency programs as a means to encourage Ontarians to conserve their energy usage and avoid building unnecessary expensive infrastructure. Conservation remains the cleanest and most cost-effective energy resource for the province of Ontario. Conservation can also be a means for households and businesses to manage their energy usage.\n\nA significant portion of the reduction in Ontario\u2019s gross demand between 2005 and 2015 has been due to the implementation of conservation programs. Per the Ministry of Energy\u2019s Conservation First vision paper, conservation investments have helped Ontario avoid building new capacity that would have cost almost $4 billion, equivalent to four peaking natural gas generation plants.\n\nLDCs continue to demonstrate leadership and pursue innovation in designing and delivering conservation programs across the province to all customer segments. However, there are opportunities to enhance conservation efforts, supporting the government\u2019s commitment to utilizing conservation as a cost-effective energy resource.\n\nSUCCESS AS CONSERVATION LEADERS\n\nA considerable amount of the conservation success has been the result of the leadership of Ontario\u2019s LDCs in designing and delivering conservation and demand management (CDM) programs to Ontario\u2019s households, businesses, and industries.\n\nDuring the 2011-2014 CDM Framework, LDCs successfully achieved 108% of the province\u2019s 6000 GWh target set by the IESO. Currently, LDCs are nearly one-third of the way through the 2015-2020 Conservation First Framework (CFF), which has a target of 7,000 GWh (or 7 TWh) of persistent energy savings. As of the end of 2015, LDCs achieved 1.1 GWh of verified energy savings, which represents 16% of the province\u2019s target.\n\nLDCs have successfully leveraged their existing customer relationships to deliver the province-wide programs to their customers. In addition to the province-wide programs, LDCs have also designed several local pilots and programs under the current framework that are currently in market or are being approved by the IESO. To date, 8 local programs and 30 LDC pilots have been approved by the IESO under the CFF to be deployed in various LDC territories which furthers a culture of conservation amongst customers.\n\nSeveral LDCs actively participate in the IESO\u2019s conservation working groups, which continue to meet on a regular basis to review progress, recommend program improvements and discuss new program design and delivery.\u00a0 LDCs are committed to conservation and continue to work collaboratively with the IESO and gas utilities to design and deliver conservation programs to foster a culture of conservation in the province.\n\nGiven the success of cost-effective conservation that has deferred or avoided the need for new generation infrastructure in the province, the EDA recommends that the government reaffirm its commitment to putting \u201dConservation First\u201d.\n\nTARGET AND BUDGET PARAMETERS\n\nUnder current and previous frameworks, LDCs were provided with a fixed target and a fixed budget to deliver programs cost-effectively. The current parameters, however, are a disincentive for LDCs to deliver programs that have a higher upfront acquisition cost and are therefore not cost-effective the year of installation but passes the Total Resource Cost (TRC) test over the program savings.\n\nFor example, the residential HVAC rebate program costs more than $0.40 per kWh on a first-year energy savings basis (which aligns with how LDC budgets are allocated), but is cost-effective due to the long useful life of furnaces and air conditioners and therefore the persistence of energy savings.\n\nThe EDA recommends that the current budget structure be reviewed to remove disincentives to delivering programs with high upfront costs. The assigned budgets and targets should also be reviewed periodically and rolled forward as LDCs continue to deliver CDM. This will not only reaffirm the province\u2019s commitment towards conservation as a more cost-effective tool than generation, but also encourage LDCs to further design conservation programs with deeper long-term savings.\n\nREDEFINING CONSERVATION\n\nThere is increasing opportunities for LDCs to be innovative in daily operations, including designing and delivering conservation programs. However, based on the current definition of conservation as set in the Minister of Energy\u2019s 2014 Directive to the Ontario Power Authority (now the IESO), many of these innovative programs are not being attributed towards LDCs\u2019 conservation targets. Such programs include measures LDCs can implement within their own system to reduce consumption or support customers who generate and store their own electricity, thus taking pressure off the grid.\n\nPrograms at the distribution level, such as conservation voltage reduction (CVR) and line loss reduction, can not only reduce peak demand pressures off the grid, but also increase grid reliability and efficiency and improve power quality for the customer. A measure like CVR has proven to save 4-6% of energy usage and could potentially reduce energy consumption in the province to levels equivalent to the LDCs\u2019 annual conservation targets under the CFF. Measures at the distribution level (i.e. in front of the meter not just behind the meter) can also help defer capital investments by LDCs and by the province.\n\nThrough the IESO Conservation Fund and the government\u2019s Smart Grid Fund, several LDCs have developed and delivered unique programs to reduce voltage in the home without impacting the customer\u2019s experience or initiated programs that minimize line losses to reduce distribution losses. However, as mentioned, energy savings from these programs and others are not included in an LDC\u2019s conservation targets since programs that have system benefits are not included in the current definition of conservation that is established in the Minister\u2019s 2014 Directive. Such programs allow LDCs to be more innovative to reduce pressures on their distribution systems, thus improving the quality and reliability of the grid.\n\nTherefore, the EDA recommends that the Minister provide direction to expand the definition of conservation to include programs and measures at the distribution level.\n\nCustomers are looking for innovative ways of combining behind-the-meter renewable energy installations such as rooftop solar installations with conventional conservation measures. However, current restrictions do not allow customers with the choice of going through a micro-generation program or through a conservation program. Therefore, the EDA recommends that the Ministry review the definition of conservation and direct the IESO accordingly to amend their interpretation of what projects should be included in conservation results. Customers should be able to install renewable generation in their homes under a micro-generation program or as part of a conservation retrofit, if the customer is not \u201cdouble dipping\u201d under both programs. This will allow LDCs to implement a combined program in the customer\u2019s home or business and count it towards their conservation targets and the customer will see savings on their electricity bill.\n\nThere is currently a misalignment in how the IESO is expressing conservation targets for the purposes of power system planning versus for contracting with LDCs for CDM delivery. In the current LTEP, the 7 TWh refers to energy saving at the generator level, consistent with all other supply resources within the power system plan. The quarterly Ontario Energy Report reports progress against the 7 TWh target at the generator level.\u00a0 However, the Conservation Division with the IESO is expressing individual LDCs targets for CDM at the end-user level (i.e. excluding avoided transmission and distribution losses).\u00a0 The IESO and Ministry should confirm that LDC targets, as already established, should be taken to be at the generator level.\n\nENHANCING RESIDENTIAL CONSERVATION PROGRAMS\n\nThe energy savings contribution from province-wide residential conservation programs are considerably lower than the business or industrial savings. In the 2011-2014 CDM Framework, residential programs contributed 1,170 GWh of energy savings while the Business programs contributed almost 4 times as much results at almost 4,100 GWh. The province-wide business programs have seen considerable success in terms of uptake and contribution to LDC targets and have also been revised periodically to meet changes in technology and improve customer participation. LDCs would like to see the same level of success for residential programs as households continue to see the largest impact from rising electricity prices. Participation in conservation will provide them with tools to better manage their consumptions.\n\nTo enhance the availability and variety of residential conservation programs, the EDA makes the following recommendations:\n\n\u2022The IESO\u2019s current process for reviewing and approving local programs and pilots takes a considerable amount of time, often leading to loss of momentum and potential savings. For example, Niagara Peninsula Energy\u2019s Energy Concierge Pilot Program, which came into market in 2016, took the 18 months to approve. The IESO\u2019s approval process for local programs and pilots should be further streamlined so LDCs can be out in the market faster to engage customers.\n\n\u2022Some residential program ideas that have been discussed at working groups or developed by LDCs may not get approval from the IESO to move ahead because they don\u2019t meet the current Total Resource Cost (TRC) threshold. The IESO should work with LDCs to review residential programs that may have potential for significant uptake and customer engagement and lower the TRC threshold for such programs as appropriate. This may lead to LDCs launching\/rolling out more social benchmarking initiatives that are not necessarily TRC positive but can drive behavioural changes in customers and encourage them to monitor their consumption and participate in more traditional conservation programs.\n\n\u2022To support increased participation in conservation, the government should dedicate a portion of the cap and trade proceeds to fund for residential programs, including increasing events and communication.\n\nSTRENGTHENING THE FRAMEWORK\n\nAspects of the current regulatory framework create challenges for LDCs to design and deliver conservation. The Minister of Energy\u2019s 2014 Directive that established the 2015-2020 CFF encouraged increased collaboration between LDCs and gas companies to design and deliver electricity conservation and gas demand management programs to customers. The LDC framework is overseen by the IESO while the OEB oversees the DSM framework, making it difficult for LDCs and gas utilities to collaborate as their requirements are different under their frameworks.\n\nThe EDA recommends that during the upcoming Mid-Term Review, the OEB and the IESO should collaborate in finding common elements that will encourage LDCs and the gas companies to collaborate further in the second half of their frameworks.\n\nThe current development and implementation of the Whole Home Pilot Program is being overseen by the IESO and being delivered by the gas utilities, with LDCs getting involved marginally in the marketing of the program. The arrangement for the gas utilities to lead the delivery of this pilot was set up without consultation with the LDCs, even though the pilot includes both gas and electricity savings.\n\nThe EDA encourages government and the IESO to engage LDCs in any future discussions that involve collaboration with gas utilities. Furthermore, the EDA recommends that the IESO be directed to work with LDCs and gas utilities to develop a memorandum of understanding to foster a more streamlined approach to LDC-gas program collaboration which is beneficial to all parties, including the customer.\n\nEXTENDING THE CONSERVATION FIRST FRAMEWORK\n\nIn the Ministry of Energy\u2019s paper, Conservation First: A Renewed Vision for Energy Conservation in Ontario, the government made the commitment that conservation would be a long-term resource that was central to the electricity planning process and that there would be opportunities to find deeper and more sustainable savings to further promote a culture of conservation.\n\nLDCs continue to see considerable interest from large commercial, institutional, and industrial customers in multi-year conservation programs that will yield significant energy savings for the province. However, many of these long-term projects such as combined heat and power generation, construction of new housing subdivisions and large process and systems upgrade projects are multi-year commitments that go beyond the current framework termination date of 2020. As such, LDCs are currently forced to forgo these opportunities to sign up customers as there is no guarantee of a future conservation framework beyond 2020. LDCs are concerned about the loss of valuable energy savings opportunities given this uncertainty.\n\nTo provide certainty for long-term conservation initiatives, the Ministry should extend the 2015-2020 Conservation First Framework immediately. The process for extending the framework should be streamlined to avoid major disruptions to LDCs and to customers. This will provide assurance to both large customers and LDCs that they can commit to large conservation projects and bring in more energy savings for the province.\n\nINTEGRATING THE CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION PLAN\n\nThe Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) will greatly impact LDCs, including the delivery of conservation programs and achievement of targets in the second half of the CFF.\n\nThe government, through the Green Bank, will collect the proceeds from the cap and trade program and provide financing for tools and incentives for residential and business customers to undertake several initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These initiatives include financing the purchase of net zero homes (funding of $180-220 million); installation and retrofits of homes and businesses, including social housing complexes, with clean-energy systems such as advanced insulation and heat pumps (funding: $600-800 million); and free energy audits for pre-sale homes (funding: $200-250 million).\n\nHowever, many of these initiatives are already being implemented under the province-wide programs of the CFF and therefore will be impacted by the CCAP. LDCs are concerned that implementation and funding for these initiatives under the CCAP may lead to increased customer confusion, potential duplication, and program erosion.\n\nThe current conservation framework is recognized and trusted by Ontario consumers. Therefore, the EDA recommends that the province leverage the existing conservation infrastructure to deliver CCAP programs as it will be more cost-effective than building a new governance and program delivery structure.\u00a0 The government should align conservation goals with CCAP objectives to mitigate confusion and ensure conservation targets are not negatively impacted.\n\nThe CCAP\u2019s cap and trade regulation, finalized in May, will have an impact on the 2015-2020 Conservation First results. Under the final regulation, combined heat and power (CHP) generation projects under 10 kt\/year will not be eligible for free allowances and therefore will face increased costs that may discourage customers from participating in CHP projects under the province-wide Process Systems Upgrade (PSU) program. CHP projects are a key component of many LDCs\u2019 CDM plans and those LDCs with smaller sized projects can potentially see lower results and may not meet their six year targets.\n\nThe cap and trade regulation was not considered in the previous Achievable Potential Study. While the IESO will be considering the implications of the regulation in the upcoming Mid-Term Review, the EDA recommends that the Ministry take into consideration the impact of the cap and trade regulation on its long-term projections of conservation savings.\n\nOTHER PRIORITIES\n\nRPP Pilots: The OEB is currently reviewing the current Time-Of-Use (TOU) pricing structure and has given LDCs the opportunity to design and run TOU pilots to explore new pricing structures and non-pricing initiatives that support innovation and empower customers. The EDA recommends that the government recognize the energy savings arising from pricing structures and non-pricing pilots as contributing towards those LDC\u2019s conservation targets and provide appropriate direction to the IESO and the OEB that those results are attributed appropriately.\n\nIndustrial Conservation Initiative: The Ministry of Energy, as part of their on-going strategy to mitigate rising electricity costs, has amended the Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI) to expand the threshold to include all customers above 1 MW of peak demand. While the industry is supportive of the enhancement, there is concern that some large customers who are at the 1 MW threshold will now be discouraged from participating in conservation programs if participation reduces their peak demand to below 1 MW, thus rendering them ineligible for the ICI. The EDA therefore recommends that the LTEP include direction that the ICI regulation be amended to allow customers to opt in to the ICI even if participation in conservation reduces their peak load.\n\nRegional Constraints: The EDA would also like to note that in certain LDCs\u2019 jurisdictions, large industrial conservation projects such as CHPs have been scaled back or postponed because of transmission constraints. The EDA recommends that regional issues, such as economic conditions and transmission constraints, be factored in the LTEP conservation projections.\n\nII.PURSUING FURTHER EFFICIENCIES AND SAVINGS\n\nThe distribution portion of the electricity bill is approximately 20 per cent for the average residential customer bill in Ontario (assuming 750 kWh monthly consumption). It is approximately between 5 and 15 per cent for businesses with over 50 kW of demand.\n\nIn contrast to generation, distribution costs for almost all LDCs (excluding Hydro One) have largely stayed in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Below is an illustrative example from one of our medium-sized members:\n\nMEDIUM-SIZED LDC: TOU RATES VS. CPI ADJUSTED RATES (2006-2015)\n\nAs per the 2013 LTEP, Module 4: Cost of Electricity Service chart from the IESO, forecast increases in distribution costs are largely attributable to forecast household growth.\n\nNonetheless, LDCs continue to take the initiative to pursue operational and administrative efficiencies, such as shared services, that support reliability and avoid costs for ratepayers. For example, one medium-sized LDC partnered with another LDC on a control room, avoiding an investment of almost $1 million and on-going costs of approximately $450,000 annually.\n\nLDCs are supportive of the government\u2019s objective to mitigate rising electricity prices. While the delivery charge represents one-fifth of the average bill, the EDA recognizes that we can all further contribute to cultivating efficiencies that can reduce the impact to ratepayers of increasing electricity and Global Adjustment costs. Specifically, there are four areas in which savings can be achieved, while maintaining reliability and supporting innovation.\n\nREVISING THE RRRP PROGRAM\n\nIn the 2016 Throne Speech, the government announced enhancements to the Rural or Remote Rate Protection (RRRP) program, increasing the amount of assistance eligible rural ratepayers would receive. The total amount of rate protection for eligible consumers would increase from a maximum of $127 million to a maximum of $237 million each year.\n\nThere are approximately 330,000 customers who receive Rural or Remote Rate Protection (RRRP) in four LDC service areas, Hydro One Networks, Hydro One Remote Communities, First Nation LDCs and Algoma Power.\n\nAs per the OEB\u2019s 2016 rate order on RRRP, all customers, including those who are RRRP eligible, are charged a $0.0013 per KWh on their monthly consumption. The collected funds are transferred by all LDCs to the IESO, who transfers it directly to the four LDCs whose customers are eligible for this rate protection. The credit appears directly on those eligible customers\u2019 bills.\n\nIn 2016, the cost of the RRRP will be approximately $175.5 million. The current monthly contribution per household is approximately $0.975 per month ($11.70 per year) towards the RRRP.\n\nThe average monthly RRRP charge for each customer in 2017 would be $0.0021 based on similar demand forecast. With the enhancement announced by the Ministry of Energy, the RRRP charge on the average monthly bill will increase by about $0.60 per month, or over 60 per cent.\n\nUsing Ministry of Energy estimates and adding an approximate $0.60 increase, the monthly RRRP charge in 2017 will be $1.58 per month (or $18.96 per year).\n\nCurrent RRRPEnhanced RRRPDifference:\n\nPer Household$0.975\/month ($11.70\/year)$1.58\/month ($18.96\/year)Over 60 % increase\n\nWhile the EDA recognizes and supports the government\u2019s commitment to assist customers in rural communities, the EDA is concerned that all ratepayers bear the cost of this social policy. Therefore, the EDA recommends that the government fund the RRRP through the tax base. This would bring the RRRP in line with a similar energy program, the Northern Ontario Energy Credit (NOEC) which helps Northern Ontario residents with the higher energy costs. The credit is part of the Ontario Trillium Benefit.\n\nWe believe the government should have a consistent approach to providing electricity relief for customers who face unique regional circumstances. The government should deliver RRRP through the tax base, consistent with the delivery of the Northern Ontario Energy Credit, which would result in savings for the average residential customer of almost $20 per year.\n\nREGULATORY MODERNIZATION AND STREAMLINING\n\nA modern, innovative electricity distribution sector is pivotal to the successful adoption of technology changes and integration of increased distributed energy resources. LDCs are eager serve customers in more innovative ways and pursue new business opportunities. However, the pursuit of innovation and modernization by LDCs has been deterred by compounding regulatory requirements and government policy decisions.\n\nOntario needs a strong, streamlined, modern regulatory framework that can support future changes to the electricity system such as the growth of distributed energy resources, modernization of the grid, electricity storage and emissions reductions.\n\nAs noted in a previous EDA report, The Case for Reform: How Regulatory Streamlining Could Benefit Ontario\u2019s Electricity Consumers, the following Guiding Principles should govern the streamlining of regulatory requirements:\n\n\u2022There is a need to balance costs of regulation with the benefits to customers;\n\n\u2022The amount of regulation and reporting requirements should be proportionate to the policy objective\/outcome;\n\n\u2022More emphasis should be placed on policy outcomes, not process;\n\n\u2022Duplication and overlap of reporting requirements should be eliminated;\n\n\u2022Administrative burden to LDCs should be minimized, streamlined;\n\n\u2022Distributors should be provided flexibility to address their local circumstances; \u2022Distributors should not be involved in addressing social problems;\n\n\u2022Distributors should be allowed to recover their costs to address aging infrastructure in a timely manner;\n\n\u2022Increased certainty and transparency should be provided for cost recovery by distributors; and \u2022Decision-making by regulators needs to be timely.\n\nUnfortunately, the OEB\u2019s current Renewed Regulatory Framework for Electricity (RRFE), does not currently reflect these Guiding Principles. Rather, LDCs have seen a significant increase in the cost and resources associated with regulatory filings.\u00a0 For example:\n\n\u2022A medium-sized LDC spent the equivalence of almost 1,000 business days on its 2016 Cost of Service (COS) rate application.\n\n\u2022For several LDCs, the cost of preparing recent COS rate applications increased over 200% while the costs for a few LDCs increased over 300% because of increased reporting requirements. In one example, an LDC saw the cost of its COS application increase by over 200% even without an OEB oral hearing on the application.\n\n\u2022A medium-sized LDC\u2019s application and interrogatory responses totaled almost 3,500 pages.\n\nBased on a canvass of our members, the EDA found that the cost of recent COS applications had increased significantly compared to previous applications. The below chart illustrates the costs incurred by ten LDCs of varying sizes:\n\nThe COS process has become increasingly onerous. Document requirements such as the Distribution System Plan (DSP) and Lead Lag Study are costly and complex.\u00a0 Given the technical complexity of distribution system planning, customer consultation on technical documents such as the DSP has limited value.\n\nIn addition to rate applications, LDCs are also required to prepare quarterly and annual reports for the OEB under its Reporting & Record Keeping Requirements (RRR). While the OEB has automated some aspects of these reports, the requirements are onerous and repetitive. The cost-benefit of some of these requirements is unclear.\n\nCurrently, the regulator scrutinizes the costs of delivery, but doesn't evaluate or consider the increasing costs to distributors of preparing and defending regulatory submissions.\u00a0 LDCs also incur significant costs satisfying OEB and intervenor requirements to provide hard copies of documents.\u00a0 In this day and age, distribution of documents electronically should be the standard. If hard copies are required, parties should pay for printing themselves, not the ratepayers or LDCs.\n\nTo help distributors be more competitive and pursue innovative opportunities, the government should promptly review regulatory requirements with a view to simplifying the process, modernizing the requirements, making it more customer friendly, and reducing unnecessary costs.\n\nThe EDA recommends:\n\n\u2022Year over year, new requirements have been placed on LDCs resulting in increased costs to consumers. The government should immediately expand the scope of the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Employment's Burden Reduction Strategy to consider the regulatory requirements placed on distributors and provide independent recommendations for streamlining requirements.\u00a0 This review should also be prioritized.\n\n\u2022Regulations should be reviewed and modernized to enable innovation, including the consideration of distributors providing specific services to each other, without the need to get OEB pre-approval.\n\n\u2022While the OEB has made an effort to streamline quarterly and annual reporting requirements, there is more work to be done. OEB should phase-out quarterly RRR filing requirements.\n\n\u2022All regulatory requirements from the OEB should provide a cost-benefit analysis for customers and distributors.\n\n\u2022As part of the OEB\u2019s commitment to facilitate consumer engagement, the filing guidelines should be simplified to make the submissions consumer-friendly.\n\n\u2022In harmony with the government\u2019s Digital Strategy, the regulator should immediately move to eliminate the requirement for LDCs to submit hard copies of applications and reports. This initiative will reduce hundreds of thousands of dollars of printing costs incurred by LDCs.\n\nCOORDINATING BILLING CHANGES\n\nIn the last 10 years, LDCs have made dozens of costly last-minute adjustments to the Customer Information Systems (CIS) to accommodate government policy direction. Bill design revisions are imposed upon LDCs with little or no consideration for the associated costs and interruptions to business processes.\n\nThese changes have included:\n\n\u2022Ontario Clean Energy Benefit (OCEB): LDCs had less than eight weeks to implement the OCEB, which included a separate line, on-bill and envelope messaging, and bill inserts.\n\n\u2022Measurement Canada Compliance: LDCs had to make changes on their bill presentment to meet registered read requirements set by Measurement Canada.\n\n\u2022Line Loss: The government changed the presentation of line loss so it now appears as part of the delivery line vs. being a separate line item.\n\n\u2022Customer Service Rule Changes: LDCs were directed to make necessary CIS changes related to deposits, disconnections and other customer service provisions.\n\n\u2022Ontario Electricity Support Program (OESP): LDCs made CIS changes to accommodate the implementation of the OESP in 2016.\n\n\u2022Monthly Billing: In 2015, OEB mandated that all LDCs transition to monthly billing. \u2022Fixed Delivery Cost: As LDCs move to a fixed charge, CIS changes will be necessary. \u2022Retailer Adjustments: OEB mandated several changes for LDCs to make on their bills to make retailer information more visible for customers.\n\n\u2022Removal of the Debt Retirement Charge (DRC): Despite the removal of the DRC from the bill, LDCs are still required by government to provide a separate line item and an on-bill message reminding customers of the avoided cost.\n\n\u2022HST Rebate: This will appear on bills beginning in 2017. LDCs had less than two months to make the complex CIS changes. LDCs will also incur the cost of ordering new envelopes and printing new bill inserts in response to the government\u2019s requirements. Delivery of this initiative will also require LDCs to inform, identify and enroll applicable commercial and industrial customers.\n\nAlthough LDCs were supportive of most of the policy changes identified above, it must be noted that each change related to customer billing diverts LDC business processes and costs thousands of dollars in changes to billing systems. LDCs incur additional costs related to envelopes, printing, mailing and inserts. LDCs also divert resources to rapidly train customer service and billing representatives to respond to increased customer queries.\n\nPacing the implementation of CIS changes would reduce interruptions and costs. For example, the Ontario Regulatory Policy requires regulations impacting business generally come into effect twice a year. Therefore, the EDA encourages the government to take into consideration the cost and impact of CIS updates when determining timeframes for the implementation of government policy. To minimize cost and business interruptions, the EDA recommends that the Ministry work closely with LDCs to pace the implementation of CIS changes.\n\nPHASING OUT THE SMART METERING CHARGE\n\nCurrently, each customer pays approximately $0.80 per month for Ontario\u2019s \u201cSmart Metering Charge\u201d (SMC) which funds the expenses of the central Meter Data Management and Repository (MDM\/R). According to the IESO, the SMC will have covered all related expenses to the MDM\/R by October 2018. The IESO is currently considering ways to expand the MDM\/R beyond its original functionalities. The OEB recently approved a 5-year extension of the Smart Metering Entity\u2019s (SME) license to allow IESO to identify uses that \u201cunlock further value\u201d in the MDM\/R.\n\nThe EDA is confident that unlocking further value of LDC customer data, while balancing privacy and security, can be done more efficiently, effectively and at a lower cost, if the responsibility were transferred to LDCs. Customers trust LDCs to protect their interests. All LDCs take this responsibility seriously, therefore if the government\u2019s objective is to \u201cunlock further value\u201d by providing access to third parties for analytical and academic purposes, it must be done with LDCs playing a leading role, otherwise the customer trust will not exist.\n\nThe MDM\/R is complex for billing purposes and requires synchronization back to a LDC\u2019s CIS. It also requires duplication\/ transmission of daily residential customer\u2019s interval data to a central repository.\u00a0 LDCs currently bill commercial and industrial customers without use of the MDM\/R and there are no barriers to billing residential customers directly.\n\nLDCs have either an in-house Operational Data Store (ODS) system or rely on a 3rd party ODS providers (such as Savage Data Systems, Utilismart) for operational purposes and that could now be extended for residential billing without a requirement for the MDM\/R.\n\nThe Green Button open standard exchange platform (multi-vendor) can provide province-wide reporting, data aggregation, analytics, scaling for near real time data, and supporting both residential and C&I customers as an alternative to expanding the MDM\/R.\n\nBased on our analysis, the EDA recommends allowing LDCs to perform the same, and additional, functions as the MDM\/R but at lower cost, resulting in savings for customers.\n\nIII.FACILITATING PARTNERSHIPS\n\nIn the 2015 Ontario Budget, the government announced time-limited relief on taxes pertaining to the transfers of electricity assets to promote consolidation in the electricity distribution sector. While these initiatives are helpful, they don\u2019t comprehensively address the various barriers that LDCs face to pursuing private partnerships that support innovation or consolidation.\n\nPARTNERING ON INNOVATION\n\nPrivate partnerships have the potential to spur innovation in the distribution sector and allow an injection of capital while retaining local ownership in LDCs. However, current Transfer Tax rules act as a disincentive to LDCs pursuing innovative private partnerships.\n\nWhen an LDC transfers the business to a partnership and has the investor invest in the partnership directly to fund the capital expenditure, the government continues to collect payment in lieu of taxes (PILs) on the LDC\u2019s share of the business and the investor will pay mainstream income taxes on its share of the business. The regulations should be changed to guarantee this result.\n\nCurrently, it appears that Transfer Tax rules can be applied in this situation, even if the LDCs value of the business is the same both before and after the private investment. The LDC may be subject to Transfer Tax on the same dollar amount twice, once on the initial investment by the investor and again on the ultimate disposal of the interest retained by the LDC.\n\nThe EDA recommends that the Ministry of Finance amend appropriate regulations to make it clear that if an investor invests in a partnership where one or more municipal LDCs are partners that the Transfer Tax rules will only apply if the value of the investment held by the municipal LDC decreases as a result of the investment, thereby losing its municipal exempt status.\n\nTAX CERTAINTY & CLARITY\n\nThe government\u2019s current tax-relief measures are set to expire in two years. Since the measures were announced, only a few mergers and acquisitions have taken place, or serious discussions have occurred.\u00a0 As mergers and acquisitions take time, the three-year window is not conducive to exploring and completing transactions.\n\nThe EDA recommends providing certainty to LDCs by extending the tax-relief measures. This may encourage others to pursue voluntary consolidations.\n\nThere is also a lack of clarity around the treatment of PILs credits following the merger of municipally-owned LDCs. The EDA recommends that the government amend legislation to provide certainty PILs credits can be carried over in the event that the now merged municipally owned entity in a subsequent transaction were to lose its tax exempt status.\n\nThe EDA also recommends that the government address any unintended tax consequences following a merger and\/or acquisition so that the business case for the transaction is not unduly impacted by unforeseen tax consequences.\n\nDespite the temporary reductions and exemptions that reduce the tax cost of consolidation and private partnerships, some transactions continue to result in significant tax exposure. The deemed disposition will generally result in tax on recaptured depreciation, goodwill gains and tax on other potential capital gains (for example if the utility owned real estate). Transactions, even for Municipal Electric Utilities (MEUs) with fewer than 30,000 customers, will be subject tax on recaptured depreciation on the MEU\u2019s depreciable assets. The EDA recommends the government provide time-limited temporary relief of tax on recaptured depreciation.\n\nIV.DRIVING INNOVATION\n\nAs noted in the OPO, innovation, technological advancements, increased customer engagement and policy decisions continue to modernize the electricity system, propelling Ontario towards a system that can facilitate the two-way flow of electricity. In addition, electrification will have significant implications not only for the provincial grid, but for the distribution system.\n\nSUPPORTING NET METERING AND DISTRIBUTED GENERATION\n\nAs Ontario moves towards decentralized delivery of energy, LDCs are ready and excited to take on the important role of balancing customer service, enabling new innovative technologies while continuing to ensure reliability. Distributed energy resources provide opportunities and benefits to the system and customers\n\nFor LDCs to easily enable the adoption of distributed energy resources, the government should immediately address regulatory issues and restrictions, such as allowing third party ownership of net metering projects. The government should also provide certainty regarding funding. Specifically, the OEB should move to immediately complete the distribution rate design for commercial and industrial customers. As Ontario evolves away from a centralized electricity system, regulatory processes and policies also should be decentralized. The government, OEB and the IESO should coordinate with LDCs to streamline the integration of distributed generation in a way that does not compromise reliability or strand assets.\n\nPREPARING FOR ELECTRIFICATION\n\nInfrastructure to support electric vehicles and the proposed increase in electric heating will intrinsically affect LDC operations, assets and reliability. Electrification will require careful planning with LDCs on costs, analyzing loads and upgrading assets while protecting reliability. Therefore, the EDA recommends that LDCs are integrally involved in the implementation of the various electrification initiatives across the province as outlined in the CCAP.\n\nAs noted in the IESO\u2019s OPO \u201celectrification and the growth of distributed energy resources would also drive the need for significant investments at the distribution level.\u201d Such investments should be considered as part of the regional planning process and be pursued after rigorous cost-benefit analysis. However, necessary investments should not be encumbered by onerous regulatory approvals.\n\nLDCs are eager to pursue innovation and modernization of the electricity system in a balanced way that considers the cost and impact on the customer. Appendix 2 provides details on several innovative initiatives by LDCs. These examples demonstrate LDC leadership in designing and delivering innovative programs that benefits its customers. The EDA encourages the government to showcase these initiatives in the 2017 LTEP.\n\nIn addition, the EDA is currently developing a comprehensive paper on the future of the distribution sector. The paper is expected to focus on the innovative opportunities and challenges facing LDCs over the next decade and to identify important changes required to the regulatory and policy environment to ensure that the \u201cLDC of the Future\u201d is well positioned to meet customers evolving needs The EDA will be releasing this paper in early 2017.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nLDCs have a record of delivering innovative programs through conservation and supporting government policy initiatives such as the Green Energy Act. The electricity system is again on the cusp of extensive changes including the decentralization of generation, adaption of innovative technologies, incorporation of climate change objectives and enabling greater customer participation. Ontario\u2019s local distribution companies remain ready to play leading roles in this evolution. LDCs are eager to support innovation, the implementation of climate change initiatives and integration of distributed generation.\n\nThe EDA encourages the government to focus the 2017 LTEP on: (I) Expanding conservation and integrating climate change; (II) Pursuing further efficiencies in the distribution sector; (III) Supporting partnerships; and (IV) Driving innovation. This should include providing certainty on conservation, streamlining and modernizing Ontario\u2019s regulatory system and enabling LDC participation in innovative opportunities.\n\nAPPENDIX 1: SUMMARY OF EDA RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nEXPANDING CONSERVATION AND INTEGRATING CLIMATE CHANGE:\n\n1.Given the success of cost-effective conservation that has deferred or avoided the need for new generation infrastructure in the province, the EDA recommends that the government reaffirm its commitment to putting \u201cConservation First\u201d.\n\n2.The EDA recommends that the current budget structure be reviewed to remove disincentives to delivering programs with high upfront costs. The assigned budgets and targets should also be reviewed periodically and rolled forward as LDCs continue to deliver CDM.\n\n3.Programs at the distribution level, such as conservation voltage reduction (CVR) and line loss reduction, can not only reduce peak demand pressures off the grid, but also increase grid reliability and efficiency and improve power quality for the customer.\u00a0 The EDA recommends that the Minister provide direction to expand the definition of conservation to include programs and measures at the distribution level.\n\n4.Current restrictions do not allow customers with the choice of going through a micro-generation program or through a conservation program. Therefore, the EDA recommends that the Ministry review the definition of conservation and direct the IESO accordingly to amend their interpretation of what projects should be included in conservation results.\n\n5.The IESO and Ministry should confirm that LDC targets, as already established, should be taken\n\nto be at the generator level.\n\n6.To enhance the availability and variety of residential conservation programs, the EDA makes the following recommendations:\n\na.The IESO\u2019s approval process for local programs and pilots should be further streamlined so LDCs can be out in the market faster to engage customers.\n\nb.The IESO should work with LDCs to review residential programs that may have the potential for significant uptake and customer engagement and lower the TRC threshold for such programs as appropriate.\n\nc.The government should dedicate a portion of the cap and trade proceeds to fund for residential programs, including increasing events and communication.\n\n7.During the upcoming Mid-Term Review, the OEB and the IESO should collaborate in finding common elements that will encourage LDCs and the gas companies to collaborate further in the second half of their frameworks.\n\n8.The EDA encourages government and the IESO to engage LDCs in any future discussions that involve collaboration with gas utilities. Furthermore, the EDA recommends that the IESO be directed to work with LDCs and gas utilities to develop a memorandum of understanding to foster a more streamlined approach to LDC-gas program collaboration which is beneficial to all parties, including the customer.\n\n9.To provide certainty for long-term conservation initiatives, the Ministry should extend the 2015-2020 Conservation First Framework immediately. The process for extending the framework should be streamlined to avoid major disruptions to LDCs and to customers.\n\n10.The EDA recommends that the province leverage the existing conservation infrastructure to deliver CCAP programs as it will be more cost-effective than building a new governance and program delivery structure.\u00a0 The government should align conservation goals with CCAP objectives to mitigate confusion and ensure conservation targets are not negatively impacted.\n\n11.The EDA recommends that the Ministry take into consideration the impact of the cap and trade regulation on its long-term projections of conservation savings.\n\n12.The EDA recommends that the government recognize the energy savings arising from pricing structures and non-pricing pilots as contributing towards those LDC\u2019s conservation targets and provide appropriate direction to the IESO and the OEB that those results are attributed appropriately.\n\n13.The ICI regulation should be amended to allow customers to opt in to the ICI even if participation in conservation reduces their peak load.\n\n14.Regional issues, such as economic conditions and transmission constraints, should be factored\n\nin the LTEP conservation projections.\n\nPURSUING FURTHER EFFICIENCIES AND SAVINGS:\n\n15.The government should have a consistent approach to providing electricity relief for customers who face unique regional circumstances. The government should deliver RRRP through the tax base, consistent with the delivery of the Northern Ontario Energy Credit.\n\n16.The government should immediately expand the scope of the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Employment's Burden Reduction Strategy to consider the regulatory requirements placed on distributors and provide independent recommendations for streamlining requirements.\u00a0 This review should also be prioritized.\n\n17.Regulations should be reviewed and modernized to enable innovation, including the consideration of distributors providing specific services to each other, without the need to get OEB pre-approval.\n\n18.While the OEB has made an effort to streamline quarterly and annual reporting requirements, there is more work to be done. OEB should phase-out quarterly RRR filing requirements.\n\n19.All regulatory requirements from the OEB should provide a cost-benefit analysis for customers and distributors.\n\n20.As part of the OEB\u2019s commitment to facilitate consumer engagement, the filing guidelines should be simplified to make the submissions consumer-friendly.\n\n21.In harmony with the government\u2019s Digital Strategy, the regulator should immediately move to eliminate the requirement for LDCs to submit hard copies of applications and reports. This initiative will reduce hundreds of thousands of dollars of printing costs incurred by LDCs.\n\n22.The EDA encourages the government to take into consideration the cost and impact of CIS updates when determining timeframes for the implementation of government policy. To minimize cost and business interruptions, the EDA recommends that the Ministry work closely with LDCs to pace the implementation of CIS changes.\n\n23.The EDA recommends allowing LDCs to perform the same, and additional, functions as the MDM\/R\n\nbut at lower cost, resulting in savings for customers.\n\nFACILITATING PARTNERSHIPS:\n\n24.The Ministry of Finance should amend appropriate regulations to make it clear that if an investor invests in a partnership where one or more municipal LDCs are partners that the Transfer Tax will only apply if the value of the investment held by the municipal LDC decreases as a result of the investment, thereby losing its municipal exempt status.\n\n25.EDA recommends providing certainty to LDCs by extending the tax-relief measures.\n\n26.The government should amend legislation to provide certainty PILs credits can be carried over. The EDA also recommends that the government address any unintended tax consequences following a merger and\/or acquisition.\n\n27.The EDA recommends the government provide time-limited relief of tax on recaptured\n\ndepreciation.\n\nDRIVING INNOVATION:\n\n28.The government, OEB and the IESO should coordinate with LDCs to streamline the integration of distributed generation in a way that does not compromise reliability or strand assets.\n\n29.Electrification will require careful planning with LDCs on costs, analyzing loads and upgrading assets while protecting reliability. Therefore, the EDA recommends that LDCs are integrally involved in the implementation of the various electrification initiatives across the province as outlined in the CCAP.\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 2: DELIVERING INNOVATION \u2013 LDC EXPERIENCES\n\nLDCs are actively engaged in supporting and pursuing innovative opportunities in Ontario. The following examples have been provided by LDCs.\n\nA.TRANSFORMING INTO \u201cUTILITY 2.0\u201d \u2013 OSHAWA PUC\n\nOshawa PUC, a mid-sized utility serving 55,000 customers, recognizes the need to change the way it does business to address increasing customer expectations and electricity costs, frequent severe weather events, and aging infrastructure. It must also do so while being lean and nimble.\n\nThe utility is making significant headway in its efforts to become the community\u2019s \u201cUtility 2.0\u201d by concurrently improving its analytical capabilities and developing new energy efficiency programs and distributed energy resources. The utility has already integrated multiple systems and leveraged new technology to pinpoint outages more effectively and restore power faster, even without a 24\/7 control room.\n\nWith new systems in place, Oshawa PUC is also leveraging the power of smart meter data to understand their customers\u2019 energy usage patterns and tailoring their energy efficiency programs to meet individual customer needs. For example, the utility\u2019s Bidgely HomeBeat App, which identifies and tracks the major appliances in the home, is providing customers with personalized tips for saving energy and money. Preliminary results of the program show increased customer satisfaction and engagement with the utility, as well as positive behavioural changes and energy habits. Through its efforts 24 per cent of customers have signed up for e-billing, changing the customer experience and interaction with Oshawa PUC\n\nOshawa PUC has also established innovative partnerships with Japanese company Tabuchi Electric and Panasonic Eco Solutions to launch one of the largest microgrid projects in Canada. Thirty homes will be equipped with solar panels and batteries free of charge, and switched to net metering contracts. The utility aims to demonstrate how an efficient solar energy management system enhances reliability through the creation of connected, self-sufficient and energy-secure communities that provide back-up power supply and shift demand from on-peak to off-peak periods.\n\nFor Oshawa PUC, the way of the future lies in behind-the-meter generation and energy storage.\u00a0 All these efforts are building an interconnected system with many moving parts that create two-way power flows \u2013 a departure from the traditional LDC business model that can improve system operations and deliver on customer expectations.\n\nB.DOING BUSINESS BETTER \u2013 NIAGARA PENINSULA ENERGY INC.\n\nFor Niagara Peninsula Energy Inc. (NPEI), innovation is about doing business better. The utility has the third largest service territory and the second highest number of agricultural electricity customers in the province, as well as a large group of commercial customers in the centre of Niagara Falls. Like other utilities in Ontario, NPEI is also contending with different preferences in customer service among its diverse customer base. While younger generations want information readily available online or through their mobile app, other customers who are not as comfortable using technology, or who live in areas with a low rate of broadband, want to deal with their utility on the phone or in-person. Quite evidently, flexibility in customer service models is a necessity for NPEI.\n\nNPEI\u2019s innovative efforts have focused on offering specialized services that meet their customers\u2019 needs. As a first step, the utility undertook a market segmentation study to understand these very different customer segments. The study uncovered multiple barriers faced by the hospitality sector in accessing conservation incentives. This led to NPEI launching an 18-month conservation pilot program known as the Energy Concierge for Hotels and Motels, which runs until January 2017. This program focuses on space heating and cooling \u2013 a major priority identified by hotels and motels \u2013 and offers customers a three-year energy management plan complete with technical assistance and financial incentives for certain types of upgrades to significantly boost energy efficiency.\n\nAgricultural customers also benefit from having access to specialized incentives to address their energy needs.\u00a0 NPEI offers these customers access to audit funding, retrofits, small business lighting and high-performance.\u00a0 In addition, NPEI is collaborating with Hydro One, subject to approval from the Independent Electricity System Operator, to launch in the spring of 2017 a joint High Efficiency Agricultural Pumping Program. This program is being designed to increase the uptake of high performance, smarter, pumping systems by local farmers through financial incentives for these pump sets, as well as education about the equipment in order to influence the stocking practices of this equipment by suppliers and contractors.\n\nNPEI has also undertaken various system upgrades to ensure the utility operates as efficiently as possible. The utility is one of the few in the province to have its geographic information system integrated with other operating systems, creating a powerful business intelligence tool that not only enables quick power restoration, but also effective infrastructure upgrades and planning.\n\nEfficiency is key. As a mid-sized utility, NPEI has to consider resource implications when developing new programs or procuring services. One solution to broaden its purchase power is to pursue cooperative business models, which it is doing through its membership in the GridSmartCity Cooperative.\n\nFor Brian Wilkie, President and CEO of NPEI, establishing and maintaining a high-caliber team is also critical to achieving excellence and driving innovation. It is the people behind the programs, services and campaigns that contribute to NPEI\u2019s positive reputation within its community and in the industry.\n\nC.A NEXT GENERATION UTILITY \u2013 POWERSTREAM\n\nPowerStream is transforming from a local distribution company into an integrated, innovative, energy solutions provider that plans, designs and implements on and off-grid energy services. PowerStream\u2019s new business strategy is driven by the need to respond to the challenges imposed by rising electricity bills, increasing carbon dioxide emissions, frequent weather disturbances, grid congestion, new technologies and integration of renewable electricity generation. PowerStream\u2019s existing work on residential solar-storage technology, EV integration, pricing models and utility-scaled microgrids are helping the utility build smart communities, supported by a strong, flexible grid and customized energy services and programs for consumers. This work has earned PowerStream a place among the top 10 Smart Grid Solution Providers by Energy Insights Online.\n\nPOWER.HOUSE\n\nPOWER.HOUSE is a state-of-the art technology that collects solar energy through solar panels and converts it into electricity, and then sends that energy to a battery backup, the customer\u2019s home, or the grid, depending on what\u2019s best for the customer. The program offers customers a no-worry system as PowerStream controls the entire process through a software management system. POWER.HOUSE provides customers with many other benefits, including immediate backup in case of an outage, savings on the electricity bill and the ability to earn bill credit for exporting excess electricity back to the grid.\u00a0 Units are installed \u201cbehind-the-meter\u201d (i.e.\u00a0 directly in on a customer\u2019s home), however they are owned and operated by the utility.\u00a0 This ownership structure allows the utility to aggregate the resources into a \u201cVirtual Power Plant\u201d (VPP), providing operators with the capability to deliver grid-scale energy services using a collection of residential-scale assets.\n\nPowerStream recently received an Innovation Award from Energy Storage North America in the category of Distributed Storage for the project \u2013 a clear sign that programs such as POWER.HOUSE offer added value to consumers and can be replicated by distributors elsewhere. The project also earned a CanSIA Game Changer award.\n\nOther utilities have expressed interest in testing this technology, evidenced by Thunder Bay Hydro signing a partnership agreement with PowerStream to introduce the technology to Thunder Bay customers.\n\nEV Integration\n\nPowerStream identified electric vehicles as a major opportunity for sustainable mobility in late 2010 and purchased the first two Nissan LEAF electric vehicles ever delivered in Canada. It was the first in North America to demonstrate a vehicle to grid technology, which is connected to its head office microgrid. The utility continues to lead the charge for better and wider access to charging infrastructure, with DC fast chargers at its head office and in Markham. PowerStream\u2019s continued leadership in promoting electric vehicles earned it the Canadian Electricity Association\u2019s inaugural Tom Mitchell Electric Vehicle Leadership Award in 2016.\n\nAdvantage Power Pricing\n\nThe first of its kind in Canada, PowerStream\u2019s Advantage Power Pricing is a technology enabled, voluntary dynamic pricing pilot program for residential customers in which the daily on-peak price varies in response to overall provincial demand for electricity.\n\nParticipating customers pay a low price for off-peak electricity use (5.9 cents per kilowatt-hour), while peak use, from 3:00 to 9:00 p.m. on weekdays, consists of three variable rates set at low, medium and high. These daily prices are sent to customers the day before to help them schedule their electricity consumption. Participating customers are mailed a monthly report summarizing their energy consumption and costs, and have the option to be equipped with an intelligent thermostat and a ZigBee-enabled smart meter that can automatically adjust their heating and cooling in response to the peak price. Customers pay the lower of the Advantage Power Pricing rate or the regular Time-of-Use rate, and so at the end of every six months of the pilot, customers whose participation resulted in cost savings receive a cheque in the mail (to a maximum of $500).\n\nThe program has shown some very good results. A recent survey showed that 83 per cent of participants felt that the program helped them to develop lasting energy-saving behaviours and habits at home, and 87 per cent said they would likely recommend it to friends.\n\nThis unique approach to delivering added value to consumers and applicability to the sector earned PowerStream an EDA Innovation Excellence Award in 2016.\n\nKEPCO Microgrid and MiDAS\n\nIn partnership with the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), PowerStream officially launched a utility-scale microgrid which has the capacity to provide several hours of backup power supply to 400 customers in Penetanguishene. At the heart of this cutting-edge solution is the Microgrid Distributed Energy Resource Automation System (MiDAS), an advanced microgrid controller that can operate autonomously and optimize the way in which power is delivered. In addition to providing backup power supply, it reinforces the existing grid by increasing resiliency and operational efficiency in a safe, secure way. MiDAS can also facilitate the use of renewable power sources to provide a lower carbon footprint and ultimately a cleaner environment.\n\nD.ENWIN'S LEADING EDGE UAV TECHNOLOGY WILL BENEFIT CUSTOMERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS\n\nWindsor will be among the first cities in Ontario to benefit from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), better known as drones, which are increasingly employed in the maintenance of hard-to-access infrastructure, across North America.\n\nWhile many local electricity utilities are exploring the potential for this equipment in assessing and maintaining electrical infrastructure, ENWIN Utilities Ltd. has received a standing Special Flight Operations Certificate (SFOC) from Transport Canada, and is now fully licensed to employ the technology for infrastructure assessment and inspection.\n\nThe utility can now begin to use the small flying machines routinely, to check transformers, powerlines and other infrastructure necessary to maintain the safety and reliability of the local distribution system.\n\nIf the power does go out, the utility can use the unassuming mini-copters to locate and assess\n\nthe cause, without the time and expense of sending out a crew and a truck. This will also improve response times, and help avoid potential emergency situations.\n\nLonger-term benefits could include the early detection of potential electrical fires. Poor connections get hot, and drones equipped with infrared cameras are able to detect them and\n\nflag them for repair. Helga Reidel, CEO of ENWIN Utilities, anticipates that this could also benefit the City\u2019s Emergency Management team.\n\nE.SMARTMAP \u2013 COLLUS POWERSTREAM\u2019S SWISS ARMY KNIFE FOR ACCESS TO DATA\n\nWith the implementation of Smart Meters, there is an overabundance of data that can help drive decisions, but this data can also be the cause of frustration. By providing the data in a useable format, a model of the distribution network can be created to allow for a view into real time operations. SmartMAP provides Collus PowerStream with the data needed to better serve its customers.\n\nSmartMAP is a new innovative software solution that has improved outage restoration and operational efficiency, decreased system expansion costs, reduced theft of power, energy savings, and improved customer service for Collus PowerStream. SmartMAP has been designed for the utility with end-use electricity customers as a number one priority. This comprehensive solution gives Collus PowerStream useful insight into the state of their system, and extends this information into an outage management system, customer energy reports, web portals, asset management tools and engineering analysis giving utilities the power to effectively perform all of their tasks in one application.\n\nFor Collus PowerStream the direction was clear\u2014become a 21st Century Utility. By acquiring this innovative technology, the utility has been able to:\n\n\u2022Leverage technology to make better, more informed decisions\n\n\u2022Eliminate waste\n\n\u2022Drive value to the rate payer\n\n\u2022Prevent failures\n\n\u2022Minimize reactive work and become proactive\n\n\u2022Improve service reliability and quality\n\n\u2022Extend life of its assets\n\n\u2022Respond to an outage from the software, not from customer call\n\nF.GRID-EDGE CONTROLS: A CANADIAN FIRST\n\nThis story was originally published in the EDA\u2019s 2015 fall issue of \u201cThe Distributor\u201d magazine.\n\nBy Matthew Meloche, P.Eng., M.A.Sc., System Planning Engineer, Entegrus Powerlines Inc.\n\nTrevor Grant, M. Eng., Project Manager, Smart Grid Fund Project, Consultant, Varentec Inc.\n\nOntario\u2019s electrical grid is at a historic turning point, as renewable energy and grid modernization gain traction. Under these new conditions, some utilities find themselves struggling because traditional grid management tools are unable to control voltages adequately within this new framework. Now a new technology, the first of its kind in Canada \u2013 introduced as a pilot project \u2013 has been successfully installed to help improve voltage stability, customer satisfaction and energy savings on the electrical grid. Underway at Entegrus in Erieau, a picturesque community on the shore of Lake Erie, the pilot is showing that innovative controls, placed at the grid edge, can overcome these limitations. Many factors are contributing to the changing grid conditions and the need for new tools. One key factor is Ontario\u2019s significant commitment to the integration of PV solar and wind distributed generation (DG) systems. The increase in DG is producing two-way power flows along with new power quality issues, such as voltage and load dynamics.\n\nDrawbacks among traditional control tools in the presence of DG\n\nSeveral tools located on the medium voltage side of the distribution grid have traditionally been relied on by LDCs for voltage control. Among these tools are load tap changers \u2013 at both high and lower power utility sub-stations, which adjust the voltage delivered from these sub-stations. Other tools include line voltage regulators that adjust voltages to compensate for line droop, and capacitor banks. All of these tools are still used to provide basic voltage control, but through modernization efforts, they are being integrated with more complex controls to automate voltage management. Helpful as these tools are, their distance from the grid edge \u2013 where residential customers are connected \u2013 makes them unable to adequately control lower system voltages. They also do not act fast enough to respond to and regulate dynamic voltage variations because of their location far from the grid edge as well as equipment reliability constraints that limit the number of control operations per day.\n\nThe case for better voltage control in Erieau\n\nErieau, a community of about 420 people served by Entegrus, presents nearly perfect conditions for a community that will benefit the most from grid-edge voltage control technology because of its distance from the transformer station and the presence of renewable generation. Erieau would experience voltage variations when customers connected between its location and the main power source at the transformer station varied their loads. Similarly, voltage variations also occurred when the power being injected into the grid from secondary power sources such as renewable generators would vary. During the summer in Erieau, it was traditionally challenging to maintain Canadian Standards Association voltage standards during both peak and light load conditions. The presence of wind DG further complicated the situation. Customers were experiencing significant voltage fluctuations throughout the day as feeder conditions changed. Entegrus regularly received concerns about dimming lights and commercial customers complained of premature equipment failures. Since Hydro One owns many of the transformer stations in the province where voltage adjustments are made, Entegrus has had to rely on Hydro One to make voltage adjustments. Given the changing feeder operating conditions, this manual voltage control by Hydro One made it difficult to provide consistent and timely adjustments to maintain steady voltage levels.\n\nPilot testing grid-edge control technologies\n\nEntegrus was introduced to and embraced an opportunity to evaluate an innovative grid-edge management technology, offered by VarentecTM, called the Varentec Grid Edge Management SystemTM (GEMSTM) platform. The Erieau feeder was an ideal candidate to evaluate the GEMSTM system because of the distance from the distribution and transformer stations, and the presence of DG systems. Entegrus is the first to deploy this technology in Canada through a demonstration project sponsored by Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Energy and funded in part through its Smart Grid Fund initiative, Hydro One, and the technology company. Pilot testing is ongoing on the Erieau feeder, as well as in two other utilities in Ontario.\n\nThe GEMSTM system deploys multiple, fast-acting and autonomously controlled voltage regulators, called Edge of Network Grid Optimization\u2122 or ENGO\u2122 devices. These devices are installed in parallel with the output windings of distribution transformers along a feeder (these distribution transformers convert the high voltages supplied by the substation to the low voltage levels used by customers). The aggregate impact of the multiple devices flattens the voltage profile along the entire feeder, enabling utilities to provide voltage support, improved power quality, enhanced integration of wind and PV solar, and integrated voltage control.\n\nAnother potential benefit of the GEMSTM system is providing utility-side demand management through conservation voltage reduction. This system would enable utilities to realize as much as five per cent energy savings on a feeder, which could ultimately offer them a utility-controlled mechanism for significantly accelerating the time frame for meeting conservation targets.\n\nThe Entegrus deployment and early results\n\nFor the Erieau pilot, Entegrus deployed 35 ENGO-V10 devices. Installation was accomplished in under two weeks and the system was commissioned and operational in one day. The early results are very encouraging. In addition to improved voltage conditions, Entegrus has already observed a reduction of customer concerns in Erieau and attributes this improvement to the GEMSTM platform. Based on these early results, Entegrus has several other feeders under consideration for deployment of this technology. The Smart Grid Fund Project that is sponsoring the Entegrus pilot will run through the first quarter of 2016, and results will be reported to the LDC community.\n\nG.PROVING THAT INNOVATION CONTRIBUTES TO BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE\n\nThis story was originally published in the EDA\u2019s 2015 fall issue of \u201cThe Distributor\u201d magazine.\n\nHorizon Utilities Corporation believes that effective communication with customers is the first step in building relationships. Continuously improving engagement to ensure a genuine focus on its customers is part of the Horizon Utilities culture. But in order to be truly innovative, the utility is adopting creative methods to be an industry leader in customer service.\n\nHorizon Utilities recently launched Take Charge\u00b7Save Energy\u00b7Earn Rewards, an online conservation and demand management (CDM) pilot program that rewards residential customers with Air Miles\u00ae reward miles for reducing their household energy use.\n\nThe online pilot program, funded by the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) and Simple Energy, will wrap up this October. The program has already demonstrated how a virtual engagement platform can help customers manage their own electricity costs and support Horizon Utilities\u2019 overall CDM targets.\n\nThis innovative program combines behavioural science and technology as a way to engage customers around energy conservation while providing them with tools to manage their own electricity costs.\n\nCustomers enrolled in the program receive a personalized weekly energy insight email to help them better understand their household energy consumption and provide customized insights based on smart meter data and usage comparisons to similar households. Participants are incentivised with Air Miles\u00ae reward miles when they complete energy-saving tips and record other actions on their customer dashboard.\n\nThe project dovetails another recent award-winning customer engagement campaign \u2013 Just Ask Us. Horizon Utilities received the Gold MARCOM award for its customer engagement initiative designed to encourage customers to be proactive in energy conservation. Horizon Utilities\u2019 customers were encouraged to call on their energy savings experts to help find solutions to reduce energy use and save money.\n\nSimilar to the online pilot project currently underway, the Just Ask Us campaign focused on personal interaction with in-house conservation experts. As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, conservation experts continue to work with residential and business customers to deliver value to customers.\n\nInnovation often requires the use of proven methods while employing new technologies and techniques. This is why Horizon Utilities continues to expand its focus on self-serve 24\/7 options that offer customers convenience at the click of a button through online channels.\n\nCustomers are realizing the benefits of information at their fingertips through smartphones, tablets and computers. Horizon Utilities offers its customers online or in-person options to view transactions and account balances, manage their accounts and even view daily usage. With an emphasis on 24\/7 service \u2013 Horizon Utilities has ensured customers can be hands on in their own energy saving efforts.\n\nHorizon Utilities has increased its focus on the use of electronic communications vehicles such as social media to ensure broader reach for its customers. While these communications mediums are great for providing information and updates during power outages, they also provide additional tools for promoting new CDM initiatives beyond a website presence.\n\nHorizon Utilities believes that innovation in all aspects of its business is contributing to greater value and customer satisfaction. This was evident according to the results of the 2015 UtilityPULSE Electrical Utility Customer Satisfaction Survey where Horizon Utilities received a 92 per cent overall customer satisfaction rating, well above the Ontario average of 86 per cent.\n\nIn fact, the annual customer satisfaction survey indicated Horizon Utilities\u2019 commitment and innovative approach to customer service is paying off with an increase of five per cent from 2014.\n\nDiligent research and communication have provided a greater understanding of where customers turn to for information. Horizon Utilities is continuously looking at new ways of embedding innovation into all aspects of customer service to ensure recent satisfaction success continues to improve.\n\nH.HYDRO OTTAWA \u2013 BUILDING NORTH AMERICA\u2019S FIRST-EVER DISTRICT UTILITY\n\nImagine living in a brand new, green, and technologically-advanced community \u2013 one where sustainability is seamlessly integrated into your way of life. Your home is an ultra modern condominium overlooking the picturesque Ottawa River, with electric vehicle charging stations in the garage, a net Zero-Carbon heating and cooling system, and real-time home energy monitoring through a mobile app.\n\nWhile developments around the world can boast some of these characteristics, Ottawa\u2019s Zibi community will be the first to bring these features and more together in one place. And a new business model \u2013 a district utility \u2013 will serve as the hub for operating, managing, monitoring and reporting on the sustainability of the community's energy system.\n\nHydro Ottawa is partnering with the Windmill Development Group, Dream Unlimited and the MaRS Advanced Energy Centre to make this vision a reality. The ultimate goal is to ensure Zibi becomes a One Planet Community \u2013 the first of its kind in Canada, and only the tenth such community worldwide. To be certified to the \u201cOne Planet Standard\u201d, Zibi must achieve zero-carbon, zero-waste, and eight other principles within its lifetime\u00a0 \u2013 all of which will ultimately make sustainable living easy and affordable for everyone in the community.\n\nThe partners have worked together on this project since late 2014, making important progress in refining the vision for Zibi's energy systems and developing strategic plans. On May 2015, the Advanced Energy Centre, in partnership with Hydro Ottawa, convened a group of urban planners, entrepreneurs, investors, industry leaders, as well as policy and regulatory experts for an intensive planning session, called a design charrette.\n\nAfter defining the ideal human experience, the group brainstormed new solutions at the distribution edge that could enable a net-zero carbon energy system at Zibi. The group focused on ideas for new utility business models and methods for achieving sustainability targets. For example, the district utility could offer a community aggregated demand response. It could also share the community's progress on sustainability, energy demand and other measures through visualization tools, such as an electronic community billboard.\n\nAnother idea is the Digital Sustainability Concierge, which would provide residents and businesses with access to data on the community\u2019s energy usage, including consumption data for each suite or business. It would allow customers to easily compare their energy usage with others within the community. The Concierge could also issue rewards and incentives, push carbon intensity or pricing notifications to customers, and enable them to remotely control their smart energy devices. In addition, it could use the One Planet Community framework to give personalized targets to customers based on the framework's principles as well as ways to better manage their energy usage and save money.\n\nFollowing the design charrette, the Zibi project leaders defined high-priority utility business opportunities. These include the district's heating and cooling system, its electrical distribution, billing services, lighting, green generation, the energy \"Internet of Things\" infrastructure, the customer experience, and telecom services.\n\nThen in late April 2016, representatives from Hydro Ottawa, Windmill Developments, and the MaRS Advanced Energy Centre participated in the Electricity Innovation Lab (eLab) Accelerator event hosted by the Rocky Mountain Institute. This invitation-only, four-day working meeting brought together teams from across North American that are working on high impact and innovative projects in electricity distribution.\n\nThrough structured sessions designed to accelerate progress, the Zibi project team worked on the business model for the district utility including its asset ownership, rate structures, investment strategy, and operations plan. It explored options for what a new district utility for the Zibi community could look like, narrowing these down to two potential ownership structures. The first was a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d model where Hydro Ottawa would only participate in the community\u2019s electrical distribution. The second was a \u201cNew Co\u201d model where a joint venture between Hydro Ottawa and Windmill Developments would act as the community\u2019s complete energy provider.\n\nAt the eLab Accelerator event, the Zibi team also detailed the timeline for achieving the key energy-related milestones in the community over the next few years, especially those that must be in place for early 2018 when Zibi will be ready to welcome its first residents. Much of the discussion focused on Zibi's heating and cooling system, which is the linchpin in the district's energy system. There's an opportunity to develop a eco-friendly system reusing heated process water from a nearby paper mill, instead of typical forms of energy such as electricity or gas. That would go a long way in ensuring that Zibi is carbon neutral.\n\nNow, the project team is refining its strategic plans and working with stakeholders to more clearly model how Hydro Ottawa or the New Co would operate. This work will inform the project team's recommendations, which will then be presented to the internal stakeholders of each of the partner organizations for approval.\n\nLocated in the heart of our Nation\u2019s capital, Zibi is an ambitious development project that presents an unprecedented opportunity for Hydro Ottawa and its partners to explore ground-breaking technologies, tools and services that will engage customers, reduce carbon emissions and enhance the efficient use of resources.\n\nBryce Conrad, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hydro Ottawa, believes that:\u00a0 \u201cThis partnership is a natural fit for Hydro Ottawa as we continue to drive for performance excellence, while furthering our goal to be Canada\u2019s leading electricity company of tomorrow.\u201d\n\nI.BUILDING A RESILIENT ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WITH MICROGRIDS AND INNOVATIONS IN ENERGY USE: VERIDIAN CONNECTIONS\n\nVeridian Connections (\u201cVeridian\u201d), a utility showing great interest in deploying new technologies and service models that provide increased value to their customers, is part of a ground-breaking, multi-phased microgrid pilot project which leverages the latest technology, including the Tesla Powerwall battery. The pilot project integrates multiple sources of residential clean energy, while maximizing load efficiencies, energy utilization levels and provides backup power in case of grid outages \u2013 helping to create a resilient grid.\n\nCanada\u2019s first two Tesla Powerwalls were installed at Veridian\u2019s corporate headquarters in Ajax in June 2016 for phase one of the pilot project. The units are located in the lobby, offering visitors and customers an opportunity to learn about the capabilities and benefits of battery storage systems. The second phase of the project involves the addition of a solar powered carport canopy with electric vehicle charging stations at the company\u2019s corporate headquarters. The final phase will see the deployment of two potential residential microgrids involving two homebuilders \u2013 managed and operated by Veridian\u2019s 24\/7 System Control Centre, and controlled by Opus One\u2019s GridOS\u00ae Microgrid Energy Management System. The pilot project supports electric vehicle technology, and greatly benefits the environment \u2013 lowering air pollution, reducing GHG emissions and climate change.\n\nVeridian\u2019s microgrid is adding flexibility by allowing more distributed generation to come on line \u2013 providing customers more choices. Perhaps more importantly, Veridian is providing more resiliency to its grid. Greater risks of extreme weather events from climate change can increase power vulnerability, as seen with Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the ice storm in 2013, and flash flooding in Greater Toronto in 2013. Several utilities, in addition to Veridian, are starting to see microgrids as a solution for mitigating customer impacts of power outages during extreme weather events.\n\nAs the province moves to net zero homes by 2030 and many more electric vehicles, Veridian and its partners are leading the work to try and optimize the home environment and functionality for customers while optimizing the electricity grid of the future. The optimal sizing and location of components and new technologies will provide a greater likelihood of meeting GHG reduction targets, reducing customer costs and increasing the overall quality of service.\n\nVeridian President and CEO Michael Angemeer says, \u201cOur goal is to demonstrate and evaluate the benefits of microgrids, battery storage, renewable energy and electric vehicles for our residential customers, and make progress towards net-zero carbon emission homes and eventually virtual power plants \u2013 providing direct benefits and expanded services to our customers.\u201d He added \u201cIt is important to test out flexible systems in the home or business and connections to our 24\/7 System Control Centre from a technical and customer interface perspective to allow the optimal sharing of benefits between the customer and the utility.\u201d\n\nVeridian Connections will continue to conduct pilot programs, sharing its learnings and best practices with the industry and customers.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207151]\n",

        "comment":"Re. Ontario Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP) review\n\nToronto's urban energy needs are rapidly changing mainly due to three drivers: intensification growth, resilience, and climate change.\n\nGROWTH\n\nToronto continues to experience significant intensification growth, driven by targets in the 2006 Provincial Smart Growth Act, echoed in our Official Plan. Increases in electrical peak demand are expected to continue in Toronto, particularly in the downtown core from new buildings, along the avenues for electric transit, and from displacement of fossil fuels to achieve climate change goals.\n\nAs indicated in our input to the 2013 Long Term Energy Plan - LTEP (see letter attached), we continue to be concerned that the traditional approach of exclusively large electricity infrastructure planning has a lead time that is well beyond the critical growth period for Toronto.\n\nThe next LTEP is well positioned to advance a whole 'energy' strategy (not just electricity), provide a policy framework, and play a coordinating role, including Ministry of Energy and Climate Change, Minister of Municipal Affairs, on urban energy issues and ensure energy does not become a limiting factor for smart growth, prosperity, and addressing climate change.\n\nRESILIENCE\n\nThe 2013 summer flood and winter ice storm exposed significant electricity vulnerabilities in the City of Toronto. In addition, the trend towards urban vertical growth (multi-residential buildings), significantly increases the vulnerability of residents during these multi-day, area-wide power outage occurrences.\n\nThe City of Toronto has published a voluntary guideline for minimum back-up power in multi-residential buildings (www.toronto.ca\/communityenergy)\n\nThere is significant work to do on a provincial energy resilience strategy as part of the LTEP, to signal changes to the Building Code, including back-up power standards in the event of multi-day, area-wide power outages.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nApproximately 80 per cent of Toronto's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are from natural gas use in buildings and fossil fuel use in vehicles. Ontario's climate change action plan and Toronto's climate action plan focus on reducing use of fossil fuels, which in turn puts significant pressure on electricity for heating buildings and electric transit\/vehicles.\n\nMoreover, as Toronto continues to develop net-zero Community Energy Plans, including the Port Lands and other growth areas, demand for natural gas distribution networks will be greatly diminished in these areas potentially affecting the business model\/franchise of OEB regulated utilities.\n\nThe new LTEP needs to be in alignment with Ontario's Climate Action Plan and cap & trade.\u00a0 Energy demand projections and targets are needed to match GHG emission targets at the provincial and regional level.\n\nENERGY PLANNING: Regional and Municipal\n\nToronto staff are engaged in the Independent Electricity System Operator's (IESO) Central Toronto Regional Plan Local Advisory Committee. As requested by the IESO, City staff made a presentation on City of Toronto priorities.\n\nPlease click on the slide to see the presentation or use the link below. https:\/\/prezi.com\/7gakl0tfvy7z\/2016-06-01-energy-crunch-in-the-city-city-of-toronto-ieso-local-advi sory-committee-meeting-2\/\n\nIn January 2017, the City if Toronto will launch Toronto's Energy Future, an energy plan sponsored by the Ministry of Energy's Municipal Energy Plan program. Toronto's Energy Future plan will be aligned with Toronto's Climate Change Action Plan (www.toronto.ca\/transformTO)\n\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe next LTEP is well positioned to advance a whole 'energy' strategy, not just electricity, for the expected shift from fossil fuels to electricity in cities, including repositioning the Ontario Energy Board as an enabler of change.\n\nThere is an opportunity to expand the scope of the next LTEP to specifically address urban energy issues to ensure comprehensive energy planning enables smart growth, prosperity, and climate change action plans.\n\nPlease contact Jim Baxter, Director Environment and Energy Division, if necessary, to further discuss the scope of the new LTEP at 416.338.1295 or jbaxter2@toronto.ca.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJosie Scioli\n\nChief Corporate Officer\n\nCity of Toronto\n\ncc.

I believe that it's important strategically for Ontario to maintain its nuclear and hydro baseload with RE + hydro Qu\u00e9bec imports for peaking backed by natural gas. This provides low carbon, low cost, reliable electricity for Ontario's businesses and residents and will provide stability for investment. In order to electrify transportation and space heating more capacity will be required. Even though we have a capacity glut currently if you do the math to move to a low carbon economy we will require more capacity in the 2020's. To meet this I propose to build two new CANDU units at Darlington to replace the lost capacity from the Pickering decommissioning.\n\nThanks,\n\nCraig Hotrum.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207156]\n",

        "comment":"Given that in the Minister's message, he indicates that we \"have a robust supply of all forms of energy for at least the next 10 years.... a clean and diverse electricity supply mix... vision and direction on future clean prosperity\", I would like to offer my observations and suggestions, below.\n\n- remove wind energy from Ontario's portfolio, and cancel the wind portion of the LRP1s - even without this additional 299.5MW of proposed wind energy, we have 878.2MW of green energy \"comitted and contracted\" that we have not started to pay for on our electricity bills, yet - 565MW of which is wind generation.\u00a0 The \"hidden costs\" of wind energy are extreme: from the contracted price paid, indexed to cost of living over 20years, provincial subsidies, generation out of sinc with need, curtailment costs when the grid is full, additional natural gas costs associated because when the wind doesn't blow, natural gas frequently provides back-up (and so it \"idles\" in the background), and the costs associated with curtailing water-based hydro, which is also \"green\", available year-round, readily available in Ontario and much less expensive.\n\nIndustrial Wind Turbines bring many associated \"evils\" to the rural communities in which they are located, not the least of which are: problems with \"noise\", light-flicker, property devaluation in close proximity, negative effects on wells, etc. The by-products of producing the \"rare-earth magnets\" (200-250 kg \/MW), essential to the turbine, leave dangerous, acidic, toxic slag heaps behind in the communities in which they are manufactured - far from Ontario, because of the lax environmental laws in the countries that produce the rare earth magnets.\u00a0 They are not as \"green\" as most people think.\n\nIf \"Industrial Wind Turbines\" are a good idea 550m from the center of my home in rural-residential Ontario, they are a good idea for the parks in Toronto - some of which are 600acres plus (Hyde Park).\u00a0 There won't be nearly as much \"line-lost\" electricity if wind turbines are placed closer to where the electricity is actually needed.\u00a0 (They are not a good idea there either, but maybe placing a few \"groupings\" would have those who are die-hard fans, convinced that there are some significant drawbacks.)\n\nTake a look at some of the other new \"green technologies\", coming onto the market e.g. Invelox, as possible applications for 10-20 years in the future, when the existing wind turbines are no longer functioning, if you want people to support the concept.\u00a0 They could be located closer to where electricity is needed, and will more closely resemble some existing city \"towers\".\n\nWind and solar are not \"made in Ontario solutions\".\u00a0 The wind resource is simply not available (except on the great lakes and far north) and our northern location makes solar production less viable.\n\n- Invest in Research & Storage Options - we don't need more generation, we simply need to be able to store what is being produced, rather than giving it away to our friends in the northern states at bargain-basement prices.\u00a0 If you look across the border, you will easily locate some of our \"missing\" Ontario manufacturing and agricultural businesses.\u00a0 Why would they pay Ontario prices when they can move across the water and pay a fraction of the cost.\n\n- Repeal the Green Energy and Economy Act, 2009\u00a0 - It has a \"dictatorial effect\", with no significant increase in available \"Green Energy\" (we are curtailing water-based hydro to add it), and it has had a detrimental effect on the economy in Ontario, as fewer and fewer businesses can afford to remain in Ontario, because of the high cost of electricity, the fees hidden in the Global Adjustment portion of our bills, etc.\u00a0 Give Municipalities a say again in the decisions we elect them to oversee.\u00a0 Municipal input is essential in a democracy.\u00a0 Community engagement, from our rural perspective, was only a consideration if\/when we agreed with proponents who shoved their projects onto our communities - if we disagreed, our \"community input\" was ignored!\u00a0 Less than 4% of a community should not override the wishes of the elected officials or the other 96%.\n\n- remove solar-powered energy from provincial funding process- if I want to use solar-powered electricity, allow me to pay for my own project and reap the rewards on my own property (no connection to the grid).\u00a0 With the advancements in new \"battery\/ storage\" options, many of us in rural and remote locations might choose an option like Invelox or Solar Panels with storage capacity, over the cost of electricity we now pay.\u00a0 This might also cut back on the need for new lines to deliver electricity to rural and remote areas.\u00a0 The cost of electricity for \"residential, low density\" customers is prohibitive.\u00a0 We need other viable options, not more electricity.\n\n- continue the emphasis on conservation and demand-management before building new generation as one of the top principles.\n\n- existing water-generated hydro should form the base of our \"green energy\" investment.\u00a0 Continue involvement with clean electricity trading with other provinces\n\n- Invest in research with respect to Nuclear power generation and new ways of re-using\/recycling by-products\n\n- provide advice, comparitive product assessments and rebates towards home energy efficiency retrofits.\u00a0 Many of us in older homes would love to have the most current information on what to do first, as we are able to save money to put towards retrofitting our homes - the goal being \"net zero\" buildings.\u00a0 Offer incentives for new builds, especially with respect to insulation and window options, to access greater energy efficiency.\u00a0 The announced investment of $100 million as part of the Climate Change Strategy to enhance existing home energy audits and retrofit programs is not enough, when we consider that only 100MW of wind will generate $22,800,000 annually in income for a foreign-owned wind company such as EDP.\u00a0 In less than 5 years, their profit could cover the entire $100 million investment - Ontario's investment of $100 million in retrofits is not much by comparison.\n\n- combine microgrids and invest in new storage options, especially for rural and remote communities\n\n- require early notification and consultation with First Nations communities, prior to introducing \"forced\" solutions\n\nThank you for seeking input.\n\nMargaret Benke\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207157]\n",

        "comment":"Submissions to the Ontario LTEP Review 2016\n\nDecember 16, 2016\n\nThe Canadian Energy Efficiency Alliance (CEEA) welcomes this opportunity to submit its recommendations to Ontario Ministry of Energy as part of the review of its Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP). CEEA is the independent advocate for energy efficiency in Canada. We work with governments and stakeholders to ensure energy efficiency is a priority for all sectors of the economy. The organization was founded 21 years ago in Ontario and over half of our members are either located in or do business in Ontario.\n\nSince the last public consultations on Ontario\u2019s long-term energy plan there has been considerable change in the policy context for the province as your discussion paper notes.\u00a0 Climate change mitigation has become a major focus for our country and the province. The province has also focused considerable attention on policies, programs, codes and standards that put \u201cconservation first,\u201d a focus that CEEA and its members fully support.\n\nIn its recently released report, titled World Energy Outlook Special Report Energy and Climate Change, the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that improved energy efficiency is needed for fully half of the world\u2019s climate commitment. That is three times what all forms of renewable energy combined will contribute. The Agency has identified energy efficiency as both cost effective and a huge opportunity that is being underutilized within any current climate framework. Energy efficiency\/energy conservation must be viewed through the lens of energy productivity or using energy to do more with less: cutting energy waste, lowering expenditures, lowering emissions.\u00a0 It works for consumers and it works for businesses.\n\nRecommendations\n\nWe note that the majority of Ontario\u2019s conservation programs have been launched but it is still early to comment on their effectiveness. At the same time, significant consultations have taken place on how Ontario\u2019s climate framework might work.\n\nBased on CEEA\u2019s knowledge in the efficiency\/conservation area plus our involvement with climate policy provincially, federally and internationally our recommendations are:\n\n\u2022Continue to ensure Conservation First remains a fundamental goal of the LTEP and educate Ontarians on the meaning and importance of conservation and energy efficiency including economic, environmental, comfort and health benefits.\n\n\u2022Conservation and climate programs should have a single access point for Ontarians reducing confusion and increasing the likelihood of action.\u00a0 With the recent announcement of Ontario\u2019s Climate Change Framework, there is considerable confusion in the marketplace among individual Ontarians and businesses.\u00a0 There needs to be a better integration with utilities, service organizations, the labelling program for homes at point of sale and other carbon reducing initiatives. CEEA has participated in a number of consultations on programs such as the proposed Green Bank.\u00a0 We left concerned that this undertaking could add a burden to consumers leading to underutilization. \u201cEase of access\u201d is paramount for successful adoption.\n\n\u2022Put citizens\/customers first:\n\noConsumers expect that conservation measures will save them money. Customer benefits needs to\n\ncarry as much \u2018weight\u2019 as system benefits. For example, because some proposed programs may be designed to target energy savings in winter, system benefits are ascribed to summer peak, therefore winter programs do not have the same value in terms of benefits even though customer may want and need them.\n\noThe Global Adjustment undermines conservation efforts because the costs of conservation are all\n\nin one year; costs must be matched to the benefits. The equipment costs incented in conservation programs have a life span of 6 to 15 years but Ontario charges all the costs to one year thereby creating a burden for Global adjustment. We need to match the costs to the period of benefits savings. This was realized in the 2013\/2014 Conservation First White Paper but still has not been addressed.\n\n\u2022Competitiveness is critical for Ontario. Businesses need to stay competitive to keep plants open in Ontario, and keep jobs here. Conservation is needed to reduce payback for business customers for needed capital efficiency projects. There appears to be an assumption that Ontario\u2019s grid is clean, and therefore, conservation programs for electricity are not needed. This ignores the business customer reality that electricity is a major cost input to their businesses and they need help bring those costs down.\n\n\u2022Financing. Third party financing solutions are being restricted in the conservation market in Ontario. There should be assignability of rebates and incentives as well as a distinction that the owner of the conservation assets and those who are benefitting from the energy savings should be allowed to enter into private financing arrangements.\n\n\u2022Ensure the CDM\/DSM frameworks have screening that is both comprehensive and subject to Conservation First targets.\n\n\u2022Deep energy retrofits should be enabled through the LTEP driven through existing and new programs (such as HER&D).\n\n\u2022Future conservation and climate mitigation programs will need to be aligned with generation programs (renewables). This is occurring already in the US where it is becoming evident that the traditional separate silos are no longer viable. This is a solution-based response that Ontarians are looking for; with the introduction of net metering in the province, this approach needs to be revisited.\n\n\u2022No new agencies are needed. Ontario already has agencies, like the IESO and the natural gas utilities dedicated to developing both consumer and commercial programs. They have invested in extensive research on consumer engagement, both residential and commercial. Ontarians depend on local utilities as the source of such programs. Some changes are already underway such as establishing province-wide programs in concert with the natural gas utilities IESO based on a recent directive to the IESO. Rather than creating yet another organization and causing further confusion, increased inter-organizational turf wars and undermining shared goals of energy conservation and climate mitigation, it makes more sense to re-examine the existing organization(s) and re-focusing their mandates considering today\u2019s reality.\n\nIn conclusion, CEEA supports ensuring that:\n\n\u2022Climate change and energy conservation efforts work together because as the IEA points out they depend on each other.\n\n\u2022The support of Ontarians, and to ensure long-term success, we ask that consideration be given to organizational simplicity and citizen needs must be considered a priority.\n\n\u2022Competitiveness of Ontario businesses must be part of the mix.\n\n\u2022Solution based efforts are supported that could combine energy efficiency and renewable energy. Certain types of renewables are not allowed to be counted as \u201cconservation\u201d.

        "comment":"&#61656;Energy Innovation and Micro-grids:\u00a0 The communities within Treaty #3 Territory can be considered remote because of the energy costs.\u00a0 First Nations could benefit from micro-grid project(s) to reduce delivery charges and the potential economic opportunities to sell it back to the grid.\u00a0 Micro-grid can also be considered a \u201cclean\u201d technology that could reduce negative environmental impacts in the future.\u00a0 However, the barriers First Nations face in considering micro-grids are the financial risks, the capacity to maintain the micro-grid and the source and type of the energy that is required to sustain it.\n\n&#61656;Renewable Electricity:\u00a0 renewable energy generation should be a priority with respect to climate change mitigation.\u00a0 There is a greater need for First Nations to be involved in renewable energy projects and also as a form of mitigation with respect to climate change due to the limited amount of waste that is generated and minimal impact to environment.\u00a0 Renewable electricity and energy opportunities also have an economic development component that could benefit First Nations. The barrier to renewable electricity (and energy) would be the reliability of the source of the supply \u2013 weather is a main source and is unpredictable.\n\n&#61656;Fuels:\u00a0 to support the adoption of alternative fuels, Ontario can prioritize renewable energy by developing a strategic plan to minimize the use of fossil fuels, particularly diesel. Treaty #3 Territory communities do not rely on diesel; however, a majority of First Nation communities in Northern Ontario are diesel dependent.\u00a0 Access to renewable energy projects and\/or the main grid could reduce the use of fuel, but may increase the use of another resource that also carries negative environmental impacts, therefore, conservation targets should be the main consideration with respect to supporting the goal of renewable energy.\n\n&#61656;Conservation:\u00a0 the priorities for conservation should include the development of a First Nation energy conservation initiative that includes improved infrastructure, such as windows and adequate insulation.\u00a0 It is known that First Nation infrastructure, such as housing, has negative implications with respect to energy conservation.\u00a0 The idea of retrofitting appears to be the adequate response in theory, but as a result, it does little to assist in conservation.\u00a0 In addition, there is concern that upon completion of retrofitting, conservation is not contributing to lower energy (service delivery) costs.\n\n&#61656;Energy costs:\u00a0 overall, the majority of concerns are directly related to the current service delivery charges to First Nation communities.\u00a0 The service delivery charges are abhorrently high and as a result, First Nation families are choosing between providing food for their families or maintaining electricity for their household.\u00a0 As mentioned previously, inadequate infrastructure contributes to the already high costs of energy and its service delivery.\u00a0 Further, the Ontario Energy Board electricity support program is insufficient to reasonably reduce energy costs.\u00a0 For example, a $55 reduction to a $675 energy bill does not assist in making energy affordable for that particular month, or thereafter.\u00a0 There is also a lack of alternative energy within First Nations. Currently, First Nations do not have access to the natural gas pipeline and having access could potentially reduce energy costs.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207164]\n",

        "comment":"Andrea Pastori\n\nCabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator\n\nMinistry of Energy\n\nStrategic, Network and Agency Policy Division\n\nStrategic Policy and Analytics Branch\n\n77 Grenville Street, 6th Floor\n\nToronto Ontario\n\nM7A 2C1\n\nSubmitted via EBR\/ltep@ontario.ca\n\nDear Ms. Pastori,\n\nAs the President and CEO of PowerStream and the President and CEO Designate of \u201cMergeCo\u201d I am pleased to provide the following comments on the development of the 2017 Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP).\n\nThe comments, predicated on the vital relationship that exists with our customers, are three-fold: 1.LTEP 2017 should set out clear strategies for achieving policy alignment in the areas of energy and climate change.\n\n2.LTEP 2017 should direct that the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) convene a generic proceeding to examine the future of the electricity grid and how innovation can be funded.\n\n3.LTEP 2017 should clearly commit to the optimization of existing electricity sector resources and infrastructure as part of any new policy implementation plans.\n\nCreation of MergeCo\n\nThe four high-performing and progressive utilities that will form MergeCo, with 950,000 customers, are coming together in order to bring more value to customers and shareholders. Our scale and depth will provide us with a platform to deliver better performance and a progressive business, and be able to provide technologically-advanced energy products and services to energy consumers.\n\nAs provincial energy and environmental policies continue to evolve, we see the potential for significant alignment between MergeCo and the government of Ontario to enhance the reliable and affordable delivery of energy via an innovative and consumer-centric approach.\n\nCustomer-focused approaches will continue to be central to the business of MergeCo. As we come together to form our new company, MergeCo will keep our customers\u2019 trust by delivering value and acting as a key advisor on energy solutions.\n\nThe following recommendations are based on what we understand will help build an energy policy framework that can best meet customer needs and preferences.\n\nRecommendation One:\u00a0 LTEP 2017 should set out clear strategies for achieving policy alignment in the areas of energy and climate change\n\na.LTEP should signal the creation of a government\u00a0 (cross-Ministry) led industry working group to determine the policy and regulatory support required to ensure the grid is prepared to respond and accommodate the various demand scenarios in the most cost effective and efficient way.\n\nBackground\n\nThe economic, social and political landscapes have changed considerably since the release of the 2013 LTEP. Governments at all levels have developed, or are developing climate change strategies to address rising GHG levels. There is growing consensus around the need for a pan-Canadian energy strategy, and the electricity sector itself continues to undergo rapid transformation.\n\nWe recognize and support the government\u2019s efforts to take a more integrated approach in this LTEP (for example, producing the Fuels Technical Report), but encourage the full accounting of the policy and financial implications of other concurrent government initiatives, particularly those entailed in the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP).\n\nRecent energy and climate change policy announcements from both levels of government have led to some confusion for industry as to how the various initiatives will flow together.\n\nSome of the policy areas that could benefit from clarity in LTEP 2017 include:\n\n\u2022Details on how the Green Bank programs will be integrated with the CDM framework now and beyond the expiry of the current programs (this will be critical in avoiding customer confusion).\n\n\u2022Conflicting drivers\/policies for fuel switching of residential heating. Switching from gas to electric heating would support GHG reductions and climate change policy, but it would increase customers total energy bills and could undermine current bill mitigation efforts.\n\n\u2022An approach to integrating federal government initiatives to enhance energy efficiency with existing provincial efforts and;\n\n\u2022Increased EV adoption and anticipated impacts on the distribution grid.\n\nRecommendation Two: LTEP 2017 should include a direction that the OEB convene a generic proceeding to examine the future of the electricity grid and how innovation can be funded.\n\nBackground\n\nFor the past 10 years PowerStream has been committed to advancing a smart grid agenda and transitioning to become an integrated energy services provider. This has resulted in several unique pilot programs (Time of Use optionality through dynamic pricing models, expansion of EV technology and infrastructure, microgrids, residential solar-storage etc.) that have yielded sector-wide benefits in terms of results, research and data. We believe that our emphasis on testing and deploying innovative technologies is aligned with government direction and customer expectations.\n\nUnfortunately, efforts to increase adoption of these technologies are often caught in a structural gap between policy priorities and regulator imperatives to keep rates low. This is exacerbated by the fact that even in cases of more wide-scale adoption of innovative technology, virtually all associated investment costs (and risks) are placed on local ratepayers. A sector-wide approach, developed by the OEB would allow for a more sustainable form of funding energy innovation and would result in a more equitable distribution of the financial burden over the entire rate-base.\n\nThe OEB has successfully used generic proceedings to review important issues and provide guidance in the form of a decision. The most recent example was the proceeding on Natural Gas Expansion. Earlier this year the OEB heard evidence from 28 interested parties, including customer groups, environmental organizations, municipalities, First Nations, industry associations and utility companies. The OEB accepted written submissions until July 11, 2016 and received comments from 24 participants.\u00a0 We understand that parties were satisfied with the process and the result.\n\nClearly, the industry is at a critical juncture. Distributed energy resources and emerging technologies are changing how the electricity gird is utilized. Climate change initiatives have aggressive targets and will require quick action.\u00a0 There is a need to identify and apply innovative ideas and technology.\u00a0 At the same time, however, the grid must remain reliable. Finally, concern over electricity prices continues to escalate, compounded by the fact our industry finds itself in a highly politicized environment.\n\nThe complex and interdependent topics are well suited to the subjects of a generic hearing.\n\n\n\nRecommendation Three: LTEP 2017 should clearly commit to the optimization of existing electricity sector resources and infrastructure as part of any new policy implementation plans\n\nBackground\n\nOver the past few years, PowerStream has worked relentlessly to ensure that innovation and a customer focus are central to its utility business.\u00a0 In addition to our long-established commitment to emerging technologies and operational excellence on the grid side of the meter, we have grown our human resources and infrastructure to design and deliver customer-facing programs at a mass adoption scale. While these programs to date have been primarily focused on electricity conservation and demand management, the skills (e.g. marketing, program design) and the infrastructure (contractor networks, program application processes, rebate fulfillment etc.) are easily transferrable to other products and programs that could support LTEP objectives, such as EV adoption, fuel switching, and transportation demand management. Leveraging these existing resources and infrastructure would not only be cost-effective, but would be customer centric as it would allow for the delivery of more integrated solutions based on the individual customer\u2019s needs. LTEP 2017 should seize the opportunity to leverage and optimize those resources and infrastructure. We offer the following examples where additional opportunity exists:\n\n\u2022Expand the definition of conservation to include efficiency upgrades on the grid side of the meter (e.g. Conservation Voltage Reduction) as well as more behind-the-meter solutions which reduce electricity demand from the grid (e.g. renewables, storage).\n\n\u2022Leverage MergeCo\u2019s CDM program design and delivery infrastructure for the design and delivery of GHG-reduction programs to customers, including energy efficiency, fuel switching and distributed clean energy resources.\n\n\u2022While the ICI Demand Response program exists, the \u201cresidential\u201d DR resources remain untapped. Enhancing the current DR process by facilitating residential DR participation will ensure continued benefits to the energy system and to the customer and;\n\n\u2022Provide a clear pathway to leverage the successful inclusion of aggregated, clean energy resources including renewable generation, battery storage and microgrids in the PowerStream and MergeCo portfolio for which an enhanced net-metering regime will be critical.\n\nConclusion\n\nMergeCo plans to be Canada\u2019s leading integrated and innovative energy solutions provider.\u00a0 With a customer-focused approach, we are keen to provide the technology-advanced energy products and services that our customers demand.\u00a0 Our results in piloting and delivering integrated energy services to date demonstrate that we are in a position to deliver on the government\u2019s objectives related to energy management and climate change. We look forward to continuing to work with government to close the gap between the government\u2019s vision for the sector and cost and regulatory constraints through a transition period.\n\nOnce again, thank you for providing this opportunity to provide feedback as you develop LTEP 2017.\n\nShould you wish to discuss this issue further,\u00a0 please contact me via the e-mail address or phone numbers listed above\/below or Director of External Affairs, Tamar Heisler at tamar.heisler@powerstream.ca; 416-258-4538.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrian Bentz\n\nPresident and CEO, PowerStream\n\nPresident and CEO Designate, MergeCo\n\ncc.MergeCo CEO Council:\n\nPeter Gregg, Enersource\n\nMax Cananzi, Horizon Utilities\n\nPaul Tremblay, Hydro One Brampton\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207165]\n",

We want Ontario to remove barriers and to help citizens and communities become energy self-sufficient.\n\n\u2022Keep the FIT program for current community-owned renewable projects.\n\n\u2022Create a new FIT for community-held wind and geothermal (ground source heat-exchange) projects. \u2022Provide loan guarantees for renewable energy co-ops and other community power organizations.\n\nThe LTEP needs to use regulations and incentives to improve conservation and energy efficiency across all energy sectors, such as incentives for home energy retrofits and low carbon transportation.\n\nIn closing, we would like to say thank Ontario for pricing carbon!\u00a0 This is a huge step forward. We hope the price will be increased sufficiently rapidly to quickly tip the economic scales away from fossil fuels, and quickly lower Ontario\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\nThank you for pricing carbon, and thank you for considering our input into Ontario\u2019s LTEP.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207169]\n",

Determine the true cost of energy, including extended costs, and facilitate and pay for a shift towards the least cost alternative with the smallest environmental footprint.\u00a0 If it is cheaper to retrofit homes and businesses rather than rebuild nuclear reactors, then that is what the Province of ONtario should commit to.

        "comment":"Dear Minister of Energy,\n\nPlease appreciate my comments, even though they come from Calgary, Ab. I do believe they are important because we are all in this together.\u00a0 The progress that your province makes is an important model for other provinces, in addition to the significance it contributes to taking responsibility to limit climate change.\n\nI can understand that it is very difficult to bring change to existing utility arrangements and also existing utility relationships with the government of Ontario.\n\nGiven the economic challenges that Canada faces, much of it due to the uncertainty of traditional uses of energy and world turbulence that impacts the pricing of our resource exports, it is imperative that new projects be analysed with \u00a0 inscrutable standards for economic values. Therefore, any work that is done and any investment made on existing nuclear power, should be first independently and publicly reviewed and compared to renewable energy alternatives.\n\nI am personally very much in favour of replacing nuclear energy with renewable energy. The country of Germany has managed to avoid nuclear energy, and they have much less in terms of renewable energy and access to alternatives, than we have.\u00a0 I have seen how its citizens cooperate in many small ways to ensure that the capacity demand for electricity does not creep into a level that would warrant new nuclear energy.\n\nIn terms of the future, it is imperative that waste and structure of the nuclear plants be handled in a manner that most preserves the environment for future Canadians.\n\nThe second major point I'd like to make is that leadership at the provincial level is needed to support community based initiatives.\u00a0 By doing so, you would be enabling the flexibility of local levels to respond in simpler and more cost effective ways of providing renewable energy. When a person considers the success of Drake Landing in Okotoks (https:\/\/www.dlsc.ca\/)\u00a0 one can see how simple an energy system can be, and likewise, how threatening this can appear to the much more complex and embedded systems that are now in place.\u00a0 However, it is wise to realize that the benefits of improved delivery of energy will be realized by very person in Ontario by way of long term and declining utility costs. It will also improve health outcomes, and decrease provincial healthcare spending.\n\nThe community level of delivery is one with out advocate. Individuals will advocate for rebates because they offer an immediately visible benefit.\u00a0 Large suppliers will advocate for province-level investment because it is most familiar to them and centralizes power to their benefit. At the community level, however, there are few advocates to empower the simple and effective change that can enable them to be efficiently and effectively responsive to the demands for converting to renewable energy sources.\n\nI have two last comments to make. 1) I recently found out that Calgary's LRT is powered 100% by wind energy. Investing further in the TTC through wind-powered rail is the type of infrastructure that offers employability and future benefit to all.\u00a0 2) I would very much like to see funds set aside for those individual families who live at the poverty line and become precarious during utility provision transitions. There were examples of families on the news when Hydro One became public. It was devasting to witness.\u00a0 It would cost very little for the province to set aside funds to assist in such situations.\n\nThank you for your work and dedication at this critical time. May you keep ordinary people and the environment foremost in your mind as you work with existing utility relationships and bring in new arrangements.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary Anne Schleinich\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207171]\n",

Please restore Ontario Northland rail service and expand it.*\u00a0 And please *do everything possible to expedite rail service on the Kitchener line.*\n\nELECTRICITY SUPPLY MIX \u2013 GREATLY INCREASE RENEWABLE\n\nThe decision to back out of contracts for renewable energy was short-sighted.\u00a0 Please revisit these contracts and ask whether the subsidies could be reduced or eliminated, now that costs are rapidly falling.\n\nWhat Ontario REALLY needs to do is *invest in large-scale renewable energy as a public corporation, as we did a hundred years ago with Niagara.*\u00a0 Costs are now becoming manageable to buy in and operate such facilities in the public interest.\n\nDalton McGuinty should not have backed down on off-shore wind.\u00a0 *Please recommit to off-shore wind*, with the lessons learned about obtaining buy-in and participation from affected communities. Please make it easier for small producers to provide their own on-site generation and\/or be paid for feeding into the grid.\u00a0 This is the appropriate role for the private sector, NOT the ownership of megaprojects.\n\nEncourage local co-ops, First Nations, and municipalities to generate renewable power for local use, including micro hydro.\n\nI was pleased to hear that Ontario is entering into agreements with Quebec and Manitoba to purchase hydro power from them.\n\nGiven all of these real and potential opportunities to increase the renewable supply share, Ontario should *set a target for 100% Renewable.*\n\nELECTRICITY SUPPLY MIX \u2013 PHASE OUT NUCLEAR\n\nThe Ministry discussion guide states that Ontario plans to rely on nuclear power for the foreseeable future for baseload capacity.\u00a0 Sinking billions more into Darlington and Bruce, and squeezing more years out of Pickering, seems like *a huge waste of money*.\u00a0 Not to speak of the proximity to population centres and the still unknown cost of future disposal of radioactive waste. *We must stop refurbishing Darlington*, and *set a target for getting out of nuclear power*.\n\nA combination of local renewable generation, rapidly improving storage technology, and an overall shifting toward conservation and publicly owned large-scale renewable would make possible an increasing share of baseload capacity being reliably borne by renewable sources.\u00a0 Phasing out nuclear is doable.\n\nPUBLIC OWNERSHIP IS KEY \u2013 START BY BUYING BACK HYDRO ONE\n\nNote that leasing out Bruce Power - so that a foreign company could reap profits from operating it while leaving the cost of decommissioning the plant and disposing of the waste to the public - was a bad deal for hydro consumers and the public purse.\n\nAs for Hydro One, taxpayers are losing hundreds of millions in revenue *in perpetuity* by selling it.\u00a0 We also lose influence and control, since there\u2019s nothing to stop the shares from being sold and resold and eventually amalgamated by a many-steps-removed foreign investor.\u00a0 Seriously what could Ontario do to stop that from happening?\n\nOntario is going to need a set of policies to facilitate: transmission of power from Quebec and Manitoba, transmission to First Nations and remote communities, transmission to the Ring of Fire, \u201cnet metering\u201d with small producers, and possibly the cession of more control over local generation.\u00a0 ALL of these policies are likely to be resisted by private owners.\u00a0 Note as well, that many Local Distributing Companies are in danger of being bought up by Hydro One, resulting in massive loss of municipal control as Hydro One passes to private owners.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine anything much more short-sighted than losing the ownership of our electricity grid.\u00a0 It\u2019s costly to the treasury, and forecloses on the policy options we will need to prepare for the future.\n\n*Ontario must reverse course right now, stop any more IPOs of shares in Hydro One, and diligently buy back what has been sold.*\n\nTHOSE RISING COSTS \u2013 GREEN ENERGY IS NOT THE CAUSE\n\nOntarians would be willing to pay if we were building public assets for the future, in which we could all take pride and hope.\n\nWe are not willing to pay for subsidies to large players in a market that\u2019s already shifting toward renewables in terms of costs and profitability.\u00a0 We are not willing to pay for keeping Pickering alive while selling surplus power at a loss.\u00a0 We are not willing to pay for refurbishing Darlington when cheaper alternatives exist.\u00a0 We are not willing to pay for the loss of public revenue that was ours from Hydro One, and for the exorbitant salaries of consultants and managers to handle the privatization.\u00a0 We are not willing to risk also losing our LDCs and municipal control over them.\n\nCONCLUSION \u2013 REDUCING COSTS AND RAISING THE FUNDS\n\nTransitioning to 21st century energy will take investment, in renewable projects, transit, EV charging networks, and more.\u00a0 The cost of doing this can be *reduced* by committing to phase out nuclear, by recommitting to public power and getting rid of corporate subsidies, and by buying INTO renewables now that the cost is falling.\n\nBut the public will still have to raise funds, perhaps through a mix of a *modest* increase in rates (not like the ones we\u2019ve seen \u2013 many of these need to be investigated and rolled back), combined with a modest increase in income taxes (people might have more trust if the levy were earmarked), the promotion of Green Bonds, and the facilitation of hundreds of local co-ops.\u00a0 There are solutions, lots of them, if public trust is regained.\n\nI hope to have shown here some ways that the general public and government can happily work together to build a 21st century long-term energy plan for Ontario.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207172]\n",

It will also improve health outcomes, and decrease provincial healthcare spending.\n\nThe community level of delivery is one with out advocate. Individuals will advocate for rebates because they offer an immediately visible benefit.\u00a0 Large suppliers will advocate for province-level investment because it is most familiar to them and centralizes power to their benefit. At the community level, however, there are few advocates to empower the simple and effective change that can enable them to be efficiently and effectively responsive to the demands for converting to renewable energy sources.\n\nI have two last comments to make. 1) I recently found out that Calgary's LRT is powered 100% by wind energy. Investing further in the TTC through wind-powered rail is the type of infrastructure that offers employability and future benefit to all.\u00a0 2) I would very much like to see funds set aside for those individual families who live at the poverty line and become precarious during utility provision transitions. There were examples of families on the news when Hydro One became public. It was devasting to witness.\u00a0 It would cost very little for the province to set aside funds to assist in such situations.\n\nThank you for your work and dedication at this critical time. May you keep ordinary people and the environment foremost in your mind as you work with existing utility relationships and bring in new arrangements.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary Anne Schleinich\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207173]\n",

        "comment":"I'm writing to ask that you concentrate the efforts of the Long Term Energy Plan on conservation and on renewable energy sources. The time for fossil fuel extraction has come to an end, and we do have other alternatives. Water, sun and wind are both widely available in Ontario - sun and wind more than ever as a result of global warming trends.\n\nMy Masters fieldwork put me into direct contact with the problems inherent in nuclear energy. This is not a viable energy option. Perhaps thorium may prove to be a relatively safe option for energy. Uranium is not.\u00a0 Please close Pickering nuclear plant by 2020, as intended. There have always been accidents at the plant, many not reported, with radioactive substances released into Lake Ontario. As it gets older, the dangers increase. I am aware also that the plant sits on a fault. It was not built to withstand a serious or perhaps even moderate earthquake.\n\nRegarding transportation and heating, I am in agreement with using electricity to replace fossil fuels, but want to see conservation and renewables used to address for any increased electricity demand.\n\nThis is the time for courageous actions!\u00a0 Do not tie yourselves to decisions made in the past, that may have been based on lack of knowledge or lack of vision. Please be an example to others. Thank you for thinking not only about today but about the decades and the generations ahead, as you plan policy for a healthy Ontario.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207174]\n",

Thank you for taking our comments into consideration.\n\nOutline:\n\n1.Introduction & OSEA\u2019s Vision for Ontario\n\n2.Supporting the Vision of the Ontario Government\n\n3.The Reality of Energy Development Worldwide\n\n4.Concerns about the Current Approach to Long-term Energy Planning in Ontario\n\n5.Call for an Analysis of Alternative Options\n\n6.Innovation and Economic Growth\n\n7.Clean ENERGY Supply\n\n8.Regional Planning\n\n9.Conclusion\n\n\n\n1.Introduction & OSEA\u2019s Vision for Ontario\n\nOSEA champions a prosperous Ontario with resilient communities, good jobs, and healthy environments that is built on portfolios of sustainable energy solutions for power, heat, cooling, and transportation.\n\nIt is OSEA\u2019s conviction that an energy system that is based on the local resources in a community and the region and built by and for the members of the local community is the most efficient, reliable, cost-effective, and beneficial for economic growth and sustainability of our communities. And with the sustainable technologies available today, such a system is entirely feasible.\n\nFrom the examples of other jurisdictions, we know that when a community comes together to find solutions for their energy needs, it brings the members of the community together, and it increases energy literacy among the general public, which leads to energy conservation and other actions to promote sustainability within the community .\u00a0 The economic growth benefits include sustainable jobs, capacity building that can become an export commodity, tax revenues that can be reinvested in the local community, and much more.\n\nHence, the key element of the OSEA vision is that each community has their energy needs met primarily from local and regional renewable fuel sources, distributed and managed as local micro-grids. For electricity, this means that those communities that are already connected to the transmission grid will continue to stay on the transmission grid and thereby be interconnected to other communities. Thus the transmission grid becomes the backup for the entire regional network. To meet their heating, cooling, and transportation needs, these communities will use local, sustainable solutions, which include bioenergy, district energy systems, geo- and air-source heating systems, etc. ( the list is not exhaustive).\n\nFor remote\/ off-grid communities, on the other hand, storage backup has to be considered, and where feasible, adjacent off-grid micro-grids should be interconnected to each other for stability and reliability as well as to reduce the cost for storage backup.\n\nA system as outlined above would have the following advantages:\n\n1.Cost-effective: A decentralized, locally-sourced energy system will be less costly, especially when individuals are encouraged to invest and co-own their systems.\n\nBy supporting local micro-grids, we avoid huge cost for transmission grid build-outs and for large, central generation infrastructure upgrades that may seem a good idea today but will become stranded assets, as communities, individual homeowners and businesses demand the right to meet their energy needs.\n\n2.Modular:\u00a0 With renewable and sustainable technologies, energy projects will be smaller than with larger centralized nuclear plants and can add capacity to the system incrementally. The built-out of such an energy system can happen gradually according to the needs of the province and the communities.\n\n3.Fast &Flexible: Most of the projects that would be considered can be built with relatively small turn-around time, which means that the modular build-out could happen fairly quickly, making the system very responsive to changing circumstances, such as uncertainty in demand development or new technological breakthroughs.\n\n4.Supports local communities and local growth: Such a system puts the emphasis on the local communities, providing the community, not just with the energy they need to support the local economy but also providing the residents with good, sustainable jobs, and revenues from the generation of energy itself . The graph below illustrates the potential that exists for communities in keeping revenues in their local communities, by investing in local energy solutions.\n\nSource: QUEST, Community Energy Planning in Ontario: A Competitive Advantage For Your Community, June 2016\n\n5.Empowers Communities: By making use of the available resources in a local community, the system can directly support the local economy. But most importantly, the community gets to decide which resources to develop and which resources to leave untouched. Some of Ontario\u2019s communities have felt disempowered and disenfranchised by the GEA and the FIT rules, and it is important to give the power back to the communities and to let them decide what energy sources and technologies, within certain guidelines, of course, best meet their needs. Furthermore, there is an excellent opportunity to democratize the energy assets by allowing citizens to invest in and own\/ co-own their local generation assets and energy projects. This is a concept that has been advanced effectively in Germany and Denmark, but even in Ontario, we have seen that many people are interested in investing in energy assets. According to the Federation of Community Power Cooperatives, despite a rather small percentage of total ownership (see graphic below), more than $84 million\u00a0 have already been invested by individuals in local renewable energy projects through renewable energy co-ops across the province. The same report clearly shows that the dollars invested through a co-op tend to stay in the community and generate greater economic value .\n\nSource:\u00a0 TREC, Renewable Energy Co-op, The Power of Community, June 2016\n\n6.Removes social friction: As outlined in point 4, empowering communities and local ownership of renewable energy assets will help eliminate social friction in and between communities .\n\nA primary concern today is climate change, and the government of Ontario has initiated bold action to mitigate climate change and has set ambitious targets. To reach these targets, drastic measures are required, which also need to be reflected in the long-term energy plan.\n\nOSEA strongly recommends that, given the economic benefits of localized and decentralized energy systems to communities, a full cost-benefits analysis of alternative, decentralized energy delivery models be included in all long-term energy planning for the province of Ontario.\n\n\n\n2.Supporting the Vision of the Ontario Government\n\n2.1.Reducing the Cost of Energy\n\nRising energy costs pose a problem for many families who live on low or fixed incomes. This issue is exacerbated in rural communities and for the elderly.\n\nWe, therefore, agree that we need to do more to help Ontarians with their rising cost of living. Some key solutions, some of which are already being proposed or implemented, are:\n\n-Create local jobs in the energy sector by supporting local energy production and the development of local energy assets. This will help communities develop sustainable circular economies and decrease dependence on foreign investment and externalized cost, i.e. for waste management.\n\n-Avoid significant infrastructure investments in times of uncertainty with regards to electricity demand trends. The centralized bulk energy system is an outdated concept of the last century. Investing and subsidizing a centralized power system and not taking advantage of the efficiencies that come with the real integration of all distributed energy forms will lead to high electricity costs and stranded assets.\n\n-Focus on improving the overall energy efficiency of our power generation sector and link it to\n\nthe real energy needs of Ontarians.\n\n-Continue to support low-income households with rate subsidies. But, also, help all Ontarians to significantly decrease their total energy demand. It not only lowers the families' energy bills but also reduces the demand on our energy infrastructure. Energy conservation must have equal priority with electrification of heating systems!\n\n-Support communities and provide incentives to generate their sustainable energy. This creates\n\njobs (see the first point), local revenues for reinvestment, and ensures that communities are more resilient in light of increasingly severe weather events. Communities across Ontario are yearning for this opportunity. Community energy self-sufficiency, especially in remote and rural communities, decreases the need for extensive and costly transmission and distribution infrastructure investments and upgrades. Help communities to help themselves and reduce costs for EVERYONE!\n\n-Stop the amalgamation of LDCs and support the return to community-owned LDCs who will drive innovation and the energy transition. The German experience has taught us that large LDCs can be expected to be unsupportive of embedded generation or Distributed Energy Resources (DER) since they tend to seek synergies and economies of scale through bulk procurement and distribution systems. Unless business models change, large utilities will not be interested in customized local DER solutions because these require additional administrative effort and expertise on their end. Large LDCs will turn to bulk energy suppliers instead, thereby effectively eliminating the opportunity for community-owned DER development (with all the economic benefits for the communities attached).\n\n2.2.Fighting Climate Change\n\nOntario has recognized the urgent need to respond to the threats of climate change by taking action towards reducing the province\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the recent past, the provincial government has passed legislation, and developed policies and action plans to support the province\u2019s goal to significantly and rapidly reduce GHG emissions. Together, these initiatives aim to effectively decarbonize the electricity system, the heating & cooling systems, as well as the transportation sector and industrial processes.\n\nHowever, the Environmental Commissioner, Dr. Diane Saxe in her Special Report to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario , found that none of the scenarios presented by the Independent Electricity System Operator and Navigant meet the provinces targets for greenhouse gas reductions.\n\nOSEA agrees with the Environmental Commissioner and supports the recommendation to \u201cplan for an energy supply mix that enables Ontario to achieve its greenhouse gas targets.\u201d\u00a0 OSEA further recommends that the Ministry of Energy work very closely with the Ministry of Environment on Climate Change to better coordinate their plans and associated programs.\n\n\n\n3.The Reality of Energy Development Worldwide\n\nMany progressive and pioneering jurisdiction around the world have recognized the economic and technological (i.e. higher system resilience and stability) advantages of distributed generation and are in the process of moving away from large centralized power generation.\n\nIn fact, in its 2016 Report \u201cInnovating Urban Energy\u201d, the World Energy Council states: \u201cthe twentieth century model of centralized energy production and distribution by a limited number of actors is evolving into a data-driven, multi-directional, market-based platform where divisions between roles \u2013 producer, distributor, consumer \u2013 are becoming blurred and overlapping.\u201d Worldwide, promising innovative low-carbon distributed energy systems based on renewable fuels are evolving. These require the adaptation of a bottom-up planning approach and the integration of community and regionally developed and controlled energy grids. Smaller utilities that have struggled under the centralized generation system are now being provided with an excellent opportunity to adopt new business models that deliver more flexible and cost effective products with higher value-added for their customers. Where natural gas infrastructure is available, these community and utility-owned systems often include combined heat power systems, making use of locally produced biomass, on-farm or municipal biogas, landfill gas, sewer gas, etc., initially supplementing and later replacing natural gas as fuel.\n\nThe complete replacement of natural gas and thereby achievement of carbon neutrality of thermal and electrical energy generation is envisioned by these progressive and innovative societies through the introduction of power-to-gas, i.e. the catalytic production of methane as universal fuel.\n\nIn any case, integrated and co-generating systems and infrastructure for electrical and thermal energy yield the most energy efficient and flexible systems . Flexibility with regards to fuel type source (biogas, hydrogen, synthetic methane, etc.), energy storage and load management are built-in advantages. Recognizing that the automotive industry is also moving away from the concept of electrifying all traffic, by all means, makes such integrated systems even more economical. Market research by the automotive industry shows, that for larger vehicles fuels cell technology and gas and bio-fuelled trucks are much more likely to win the market penetration race.\n\n\n\n4.Concerns about the Approach to Long-term Energy Planning in Ontario\n\n4.1 Current approach:\u00a0 Assume continued centralized energy delivery model\n\nRecommendation: Communities are the key element to the solution.\n\nOur communities hold the keys to the development of a low-carbon energy system that also supports local economic development. Communities should be mandated and supported to develop sustainable community energy plans. The goal should be to move towards regional and community energy self-sufficiency. This can be achieved through micro-grids, based on integrated district energy systems, residential solar PV, cogeneration, community-owned bioenergy, geothermal, and water power as well as community wind farms where economically feasible and socially acceptable.\n\n4.2 Current approach:\u00a0 Top-down, centralized planning process\n\nRecommendation: Taking a bottom-up and integrated approach to energy planning.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s approach seems to be built on the assumption that Ontario will continue to fill only temporary gaps in its supply with distributed generation and that the bulk electricity system will continue to provide baseload power to the system. It, therefore, takes on a top-down planning approach. This justifies the omission of a comprehensive analysis of the actual potential for distributed electrical and thermal renewable energy generation but it is contrary to observable trends, globally and also within the province itself.\n\nOnly a comprehensive analysis of the potential for a distributed system (or a bottom-up approach) will allow energy system planners to fully understand the aggregated effects that increasing privately-owned, distributed generation, energy conservation, storage, and community energy self-sufficiency will have on the future distribution and transmission systems.\n\n4.3 Current approach:\u00a0 Alternative energy sources de-emphasized\n\nRecommendation: Bioenergy \u2013 the untapped asset\n\nBioenergy is widely ignored in all planning documents, yet there is great potential for it across Ontario. Many Bioenergy technologies are very mature and range from landfill- and sewer-gas to anaerobic digestion of agricultural and food waste, to biomass combustion, all of which can be operated as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, thereby providing maximum efficiency and flexibility to meet local peak demands for heat and electricity. Renewable natural gas is the essential linkage between the electrical, thermal, and transportation systems that are currently separately owned, controlled, and operated. Bioenergy technologies and processes are also crucial to the future of commercial transportation and heavy trucking, one of the greatest sources of Ontario\u2019s GHG emissions.\n\n4.4 Current approach:\u00a0 Communities develop local energy plans in isolation from central planning Recommendation: Encourage integrated community energy planning and avoid the risk of stranded assets and resulting high electricity rates\n\nMany communities are starting to understand the potential of using the development of local energy assets to meet local demand and as an opportunity to address concerns about reliability and cost head-on. More and more communities are considering or already developing their own Community Energy Plans that demonstrate a growing desire to become energy-independent and see the transmission grid becoming a source of backup support to the local system. If this trend results in the development of energy islands and micro-girds, the need for centralized electricity supply will decrease to a point where huge, unchecked investments into the continuation of the bulk power system will result in stranded assets and high electricity rates.\n\n\n\n5.Call for an Analysis of Alternative Options\n\nA comprehensive study of centralized nuclear and decentralized renewables should be undertaken to ensure that. The direction Ontario chooses to follow in this LTEP will lead to a future that Ontarians want, need and can afford.\n\nThe Conference Board of Canada calculates that the Darlington Generating Station refurbishment will create an economic multiplier of 1.3\u00a0 (2015) or 1.4\u00a0 (2016) but no information is available on how sensitive this number is to cost overruns.\n\nThe numbers we have for distributed renewable systems provide the following picture: The US Department of Energy in its study \u201cUS Energy and Employment Report 2015\u201d\u00a0 found that solar created 8.3 jobs per thousand MWh. We do not know if the US numbers are entirely applicable to Ontario, but a clear trend of better job creation from renewables is clear. Furthermore, a study of Ontario's co-op sector by the Federation of Community Power Cooperatives \u00a0 found that co-op sector investments offered an economic multiplier of 2.01.\n\nGeneratorNuclearWindSolarBio Energy\n\nGeneration amount (thousand MWh)7275441706023617158620\n\nJobs429097708830019219559\n\njobs per thousand MWh0.060.458.300.33\n\nSource: http:\/\/energy.gov\/sites\/prod\/files\/2016\/03\/f30\/U.S.%20Energy%20and%20Employment%20Report.pdf\n\nBecause Germany has committed to and is in the process of, nuclear decommissioning it provides an excellent source of information on the economics of investing in renewable energy. In 2013, Germany reported that it required \u20ac182,000 ($254,800 CAD) of investment to create one job in the turnover of equipment and capacity of renewable energy .\n\nThe nuclear refurbishment will create 8,800 jobs or 14,200 jobs , depending on which report by the Conference Board is being consulted. According to the Conference Board of Canada, for an investment of $12.8 billion, this would mean a cost of $1,454,545 per job or $901,000 per job, respectively. If $12.8 billion were invested in renewables, the German numbers suggest that we could create 50,196 local jobs. Furthermore, by comparing the economic multipliers of Ontario renewables versus nuclear, OSEA believes there is a 43% better return on investment from renewables.\n\nAnother consideration that Ontarians do not have is how the refurbishment will affect the global adjustment , which is the fastest growing portion of ratepayer bills.\n\nSource IESO understanding the global adjustment January 2016\n\nOSEA brings these points up because there is not enough information from the Ministry of Energy on how the nuclear refurbishment will affect Ontario, and if it is the correct course of action. Nuclear refurbishment may be the best choice, but that can only be determined by a comprehensive and publicly available cost\/benefit analysis of the economic, social, and environmental factors around a centralized or decentralized system. There are multiple jurisdictions around the world that are natural laboratories for these kinds of questions. Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States can teach Ontario what will happen if we choose nuclear or distributed renewables. Because the decision for nuclear refurbishment will lock Ontario into a centralized bulk supply systems for decades to come, it is one that must be made with eyes open.\n\nOSEA, therefore, recommends that a thorough analysis is done on the trends within the energy sector and the cost and benefits of the alternatives. OSEA has been working on a study entitled \"Combined Energy Options Ontario\" that would lend itself well to this undertaking.\n\n5.1.Introducing the Combined Energy Options Ontario Study\n\nThe Combined Energy Options Ontario project has been proposed by OSEA in partnership with the German Fraunhofer Institute IWES, and several Ontario Academic Institutions. The research project will provide Ontario\u2019s energy planners with a proven framework for detailed analysis, planning, and integration of ALL of Ontario\u2019s energy needs to establish a pathway and model for a 100% sustainable, low carbon, combined energy system in Ontario.\n\nThe study, and its results, documentation, and models will:\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 help us understand how and under what circumstances such an energy system can be realized, \u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 investigate economic, environmental, and societal opportunities,\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 identify technological and political barriers to implementation,\n\n\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0 support public communication and education of our politicians and civil servants about the potential for and opportunities of such an energy future.\n\nA primary objective of the CEOO study, therefore, is to jointly arrive at an understanding of how this new vision can be realized, what behavioral changes it requires, and what the social and economic impacts will be. Furthermore, the findings and analysis will help make evidenced-based decisions when developing Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plans.\n\n\n\n6.Innovation and Economic Growth\n\nInnovators and start-ups cite a significant dearth of risk capital available for new and novel technology development that is non-internet related, which is further amplified by a lack of market opportunities within Canada to test new technologies.\n\nOSEA would, therefore, like to point out that technology innovation by start-up firms is a key driver of new manufacturing and export businesses and that, support for smaller renewable energy projects offer a variety of opportunities to showcase Ontario companies to the global market. Furthermore, the implementation of renewable energy systems can also spawn further innovation.\u00a0 For example, CHP is driving R&D for biomass fuel drying, condensing heat recovery, and gasification.\n\nMoreover, there are many opportunities to enable innovative business models for the sale of excess energy generated by buildings. For example, if a building is generating excess heat allow the sale of the heat to neighboring buildings or third parties.\n\n7.Clean ENERGY Supply\n\nAny serious Long-term Energy Plan must consider and take an integrated look at thermal, electrical and energy for mobility. From the discussion guide and the consultations, it seems that the Ministry has finally recognized that energy is not electricity alone, which is a welcome shift. However, we urge the Ministry not to lose sight of this crucial aspect, and we point out that:\n\n&#9679;at the Ontario household level (transportation not included) only 28% of the energy consumption is electricity; the remaining 72% is heat , of which 89% are non-renewable and GHG emitting;\n\n&#9679;by shifting its approach to the larger energy sector, Ontario can make large gains to its GHG reductions at the household level, which will see positive climate change actions and engage citizens to take part in the transition;\n\n&#9679;Ontario can engage citizens and reduce household GHG emissions by supporting renewable heat sources as alternatives to natural gas. The options for renewable heat are bioenergy (including renewable natural gas), solar, ground or air sourced heat pumps, and deep geothermal.\n\n\n\n8.Regional Planning\n\nThe Integrated Regional Resource Planning (IRRP) process included three distinct scenarios. In addition to the \"wires only\" Deliver Provincial Resources solution, the IRRP also identified two additional scenarios: Centralized Local Resources, large, localized generation and Community Self-Sufficiency, conservation and small-scale distributed resources.\n\nScenarios are a starting point used to test the robustness of actions against the uncertainty in the future. And the best plans are a combination of steps, which reflect unique, local situations that are drawn from the scenario(s) discussion.\n\nThe current IRRP process chooses to see the scenarios as distinct alternatives in opposition, for the most part, to one another. Also, the urgency of the near term deflected any substantive discussion on the scenarios and their medium or long-term implications and\/or feasibility for the regions in the discussion.\n\nConsequently, Local Advisory Councils (LAC) groups were constantly frustrated in providing a meaningful, long-term perspective and contribution.\n\nIn this regard the regional planning process, specifically, the IRRP component was not successful.\n\nGoing forward, in line with OSEA's broader recommendations specifically, \"Communities are the key element to the solution.\" We recommend that a revamped regional planning process starts with the assumption that Community Self-Sufficiency is the desired end-state and that any wires only or centralized, local generation are in the service of achieving this end state.\n\nThis approach will:\n\n1)naturally, lead to the acceptance of the growing use of electricity anticipated in the Climate Action Plan,\n\n2)minimize the need for transmission corridors, expected in this document's question for consideration and, and\n\n3)result in greater community acceptance of trade-offs required, such as the need for reserved\/set-aside corridor lands.\n\nWhen \"communities are the key element to the solution,\" as OSEA proposes, communities take on ownership of the solution, reducing the social friction that may be associated with necessary trade-offs that, in the end, lead to Community Self-Sufficiency as defined in the IRRP process.\n\n9.Conclusion\n\nAs part of our pre-consultation, OSEA surveyed its membership to identify the key areas of consideration for the next Long-term Energy Plan. These factors were included in our pre-consultation submission in June 2016. The following key recommendations had been identified by our membership:\n\n1.Any future Long Term Energy Plan should be based on a publicly available, transparent, and full lifetime feasibility and cost analysis of the most sustainable technology and policy options. 2.Define clear, ambitious energy conservation and GHG emission reduction targets in the LTEP for all economic sectors and government agencies in line with Canada\u2019s commitment to the Paris Agreement.\n\n3.Improve stability and predictability of renewable energy procurement programs for all participants.\n\n4.Design the regulatory process to support and simplify the economic participation of the communities hosting the projects.\n\n5.Change building code to include mandatory and ambitious energy efficiency standards for new buildings.\n\nIn closing, we would like to reiterate that, to be as effective as possible, the 2017 Long-term Energy Plan needs to take a(n):\n\n&#9679;Bottom-up approach: Community driven\n\n&#9679;Integrated approach: Advances synergies between technologies for maximum efficiency &#9679;Evidence-based approach: A full, public analysis of alternatives\n\nOn behalf of the OSEA membership, I would like to thank you for your consideration.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nNicole Risse\n\nExecutive Director\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207175]\n",

        "comment":"Executive Summary\n\nTerrestrial Energy has chosen to locate in Oakville, Ontario.\u00a0 Terrestrial Energy is developing an Advanced Reactor called the Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) for 2020s deployment.\u00a0 The IMSR400 offers the potential for deep decarbonization by providing the industry with a clean, convenient, and cost-competitive alternative \u2013 a 600 oC hot common industrial salt.\u00a0 These salts are excellent heat transfer fluids, they transfer heat efficiently from the reactor to an industrial plant for not only electric power production, but also for co-generation, process heat applications and chemical synthesis.\u00a0 The inherent control features of the IMSR provide 190 MWe of dispatchable power, at an affordable capital cost, and with an operating flexibility that can embed effortlessly into existing transmission systems.\n\nTEI\u2019 Strategic Posture\n\n1.Clean, reliable, affordable energy is critical to Ontario\u2019s future prosperity and quality of life.\n\n2.Electricity will play an ever-increasing role in our energy supply mix due to electrification of transportation and continued growth in electricity consumption.\n\n3.Reducing carbon emissions wherever technically and economically feasible is an energy policy imperative driven by climate change realities and evolving public attitudes towards preserving the environment.\n\n4.Creating a robust supply mix is good policy, including a range of renewables; nuclear should\n\nplay a role that is commensurate with its relative value\/cost and benefits equation relative to competing supply choices\u2026in other words, every supply source should \u201cearn the right\u201d to be part of the supply mix based on demonstrated benefits relative to cost.\n\n5.Nuclear technology is evolving rapidly with the emergence of Generation IV designs that offer significant benefits relative to the current state-of-the-art; Ontario\u2019s LTEP should reflect this technology evolution and provide for a spectrum of investments in early-stage development of the most promising designs.\n\n6.All technologies need to be evaluated based on their full cost and ability to deliver needed electricity supply capacity, in particular the provision of baseload power to the grid.\n\n7.The refurbishments of the Bruce and Darlington Nuclear Power Stations are good economic and strategic decisions and will deliver a solid baseload capacity to the Province of Ontario through to roughly 2050, but planning must look beyond that timeframe to consider replacement technologies. Given the lengthy product development and testing life cycle of nuclear power plants there is not the luxury of deferring investments in advanced nuclear; rather, now is the time to be supporting advanced nuclear development to bring forth the best solutions for the next wave of new supply capacity.\n\n8.Supporting the indigenous Ontario nuclear sector is good policy, both bringing forth direct benefits to Ontario through lower cost supply provided by local suppliers, and opening up the potential for robust export industries based on creating technologies that are competitive on a global scale.\n\nTEI\u2019s Position on Nuclear Power Generation\n\nAlthough the installed capacity of nuclear has declined on a percentage basis by 4% between 2005 and 2015 the contribution to total energy production has increased by 7% and nuclear meets almost 60% of Ontario\u2019s electricity demand.\n\nNuclear generation provided the largest share of Ontario\u2019s electricity in 2015, producing 92.3 TWh of electricity; 2 \u00bf times that of hydroelectric at 37.3 TWh; 6 times that of the 15.9 TWh generated from natural gas; and 6 \u00bf times that of non-hydro renewables such as wind, solar and bioenergy that provided 14.2 TWh.\u00a0 Arguably, nuclear is the backbone of Ontario\u2019s electricity system and a source of reliable, cost-effective baseload generation, and as such, nuclear is also the greatest enabler of Ontario\u2019s robust supply mix.\n\nIn addition, carbon emissions from the electricity sector are only about four percent of the province\u2019s total emissions or approximately seven megatonnes of GHG emissions in 2015.\u00a0 Lower demand, and conservation contributed to this decrease, but the largest impact on the lowering of emissions was the retirement of Ontario\u2019s coal-fired fleet of generators.\u00a0 In 2003, when coal accounted for 25% of Ontario\u2019s electricity production, GHG emissions attributable to electricity generation were 32.5 megatonnes or about 7 \u00bf times greater than today\u2019s levels.\u00a0 GHG-free nuclear power generation in tandem with the uptake of renewables has empowered the electricity sector in Ontario to achieve what, unquestionably, qualifies as the single largest GHG emissions reduction action on the continent, and was primarily responsible for Ontario achieving its ambitious 2014 emissions reduction target of 6% below 1990 levels.\u00a0 Refer to figure below.\n\nFinally, the nuclear industry consists of over 180 companies and is an important driver of Ontario\u2019s economy, employing 60,000 people and generating billions of dollars in economic activity each year.\u00a0 Nuclear companies and research laboratories in communities across Ontario have expertise in the design and construction of sophisticated systems and components, that not only support the on-going refurbishment of Bruce and Darlington units, but can also pioneer the innovation and entrepreneurial leadership that will foster the development of advanced nuclear technologies.\n\nFor these reasons, Terrestrial Energy has chosen to locate in Oakville, Ontario.\u00a0 Terrestrial Energy is developing an Advanced Reactor called the Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) for 2020s deployment.\u00a0 The IMSR400 offers the potential for deep decarbonization by providing the industry with a clean, convenient, and cost-competitive alternative \u2013 a 600 oC hot common industrial salt. These salts are excellent heat transfer fluids, they transfer heat efficiently from the reactor to an industrial plant for not only electric power production, but also for co-generation, process heat applications and chemical synthesis.\u00a0 The inherent control features of the IMSR provide 190 MWe of dispatchable power, at an affordable capital cost, and with an operating flexibility that can embed effortlessly into existing transmission systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Ontario Ministry of Energy framed an important question in the Long Term Energy Plan discussion framework:\n\n\u201cWhat strategies should Ontario pursue to harness the potential of its nuclear sector to meet its future energy needs?\u201d\n\nThe IESO\u2019s median demand projection predicts that the province\u2019s installed capacity will need to increase from 39,527 MW to 42,635 MW by 2035 and there is potential that increased electrification -- of transport, for example -- will produce even higher demand.\u00a0 No single option can meet all consumer needs at all times and the IESO hypothesizes choices that include combinations of wind, solar, hydroelectricity, natural gas, bioenergy, demand response, nuclear and long-term contracts for imports, and new technologies.\n\nTerrestrial Energy takes the position that:\n\n\u2022Nuclear power generation is a valuable provincial resource, and nuclear has become the most important set of heritage assets of the province as nuclear power has grown and progressed over the past seven decades.\n\n\u2022The human capital, the knowledge base and the supply chain capability of the nuclear industry is a significant contributor to both the Ontario economy and to Ontario\u2019s innovation landscape. \u2022The refurbishment of the existing nuclear fleet is a judicious strategy to establish clean and reliable base-load power for the next generations.\n\n\u2022The adoption and promotion of technologies such as Terrestrial Energy's IMSR400, is consistent with Ontario\u2019s aspiration to maintain its reputation as a world leader in the development and utilization of clean energy sources, and will further enable the flexibility of Ontario\u2019s electricity system, contribute to its diversity, and present manageable build-cycles that will foster cost discipline in the sector.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207176]\n",

        "comment":"Dear Minister,\n\nI am writing as a representative of a renewable energy co-operative developer and also a director of the Federation of Community Power Co-operatives. Renewable Energy Co-operatives (RE Co-ops) have allowed people in Ontario to directly benefit from community ownership of energy projects, participate in co-op decision making, and learn about the positive environmental impacts of renewable energy and energy conservation.\n\nIn just 5 years, Ontario RE Co-ops have grown to 8,000 members and invested over $85M in local Community Power projects. That figure is expected to triple in the next 18 months.\n\nTogether, our members have invested thousands of hours of their time and put their RRSP savings to work into real projects to affect climate change. They are community activists and are very supportive of the government\u2019s initiatives on Climate Change.\n\nCo-operatives operate under the 7 guiding principles of co-operatives, to build an enduring democratic civil society and, as such we aim for a positive and collaborative outcome to solving together the challenges ahead.\n\nWe believe that Ontario MUST transition to 100% Renewable Energy by 2050.\n\nTo meet that goal, we need to recruit every citizen, business, organization, public institution and local community to work collaboratively toward that common objective. We need an Energy Transition Plan that lays out the What & When across all sectors:\n\na.Buildings\n\nb.Transport\n\nc.Electricity\n\nd.Agriculture\n\ne.Waste Management\n\nWe think the Long Term Energy Plan should be the comprehensive blueprint for that transition.\n\nWe can mobilize Community Capital to invest in local Energy Projects.\n\nRapid technology developments in Distributed Energy Resources are reshaping the energy landscape everywhere. Thousands of smaller local generation projects of today are displacing the massive centralized bulk energy system generators of yesterday. This opens the door to local ownership of those projects \u2013 and our members are ready to take up the challenge.\n\nWhether those investments are in Conservation, Generation, Fuel Switching or Storage, the motivation is the same \u2013 invest in local projects, under local control, which create local jobs and retain profits in the community.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan should facilitate the mobilization of that willing capital.\n\nWe think Partnerships with local Municipal Governments are the key to rapid adoption.\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the key to each economic stimulus program (whether Federal or Provincial) has been \u2018shovel-ready\u2019 projects that are sponsored and\/or endorsed by local Municipal Councils. But Energy Projects are different \u2013 they are not familiar and well understood projects like roads, bridges, sewers and water treatment facilities. There is a clear need for capacity building at the local level \u2013 and our members can help.\n\nEach of the RE Co-ops across the Province has learned how to tap into the expertise and skills of their membership. We draw upon willing capable volunteers to identify promising projects, to mobilize community capital, to marshal technical resources. We have proven our capabilities to develop, construct and maintain successful projects. We know how to work cooperatively and collaboratively. We make good partners.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan should foster partnerships between Municipalities and RE Co-ops to co-invest in local energy projects of all types.\n\nWe are convinced that this transition must put Conservation first.\n\nTo fight climate change and reduce our environmental footprint, Ontario\u2019s next energy plan must make conservation and efficiency the first priority for all energy decisions. This principle has to apply to our buildings, institutions, industries and transportation systems.\n\nThe \u201cAchievable Potential Study\u201d submitted to the IESO in June 2016, showed we have the potential to cost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30% by 2035. I think the government should pursue and promote all cost-effective conservation measures.\n\nWe have asked for the Renewable Energy Co-operative definition to be changed from \u201celectricity\u201d to \u201cenergy\u201d. Our established RE Co-ops are a natural fit to provide community based financing of energy efficiency retrofits, district heating and conservation.\n\nWe want to see local communities take control of their energy futures.\n\nWe believe the Long Term Energy Plan must open the door to Community Power. The Ontario Energy Board will unleash massive new private investments through a simple regulatory change to mandate Virtual Net-metering across the Province. Existing RE Co-ops will be able to scale up by an order of magnitude if allowed to supply our local Municipalities under long-term Power Purchase Agreements. And there will be a surge in new start-up RE Co-ops everywhere but especially in the smaller rural townships.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan needs to consider the scale and scope of the impending surge in local energy autonomy. This momentum, spurred by outspoken leaders such as Oxford County and County of Brant, cannot be stopped. If ignored, the outdated centralized system will face escalating stranded assets and an enraged public for decades.\n\nWe ask that the government wean Ontario off of nuclear over the next 15-20 years.\n\nThe world is embracing Distributed Energy Resources, in contrast with the centralized model of the 1960s. The good news is that good jobs will migrate to the local communities alongside the adoption of local energy projects.\n\nThe Long Term Energy Plan is the ideal place to build a compelling foundation for that transition a.From 2016 supply mix to 100% RE mix\n\nb.From Centralized Grid systems to fully distributed microgrid systems\n\nc.From external energy dependencies to resilient communities\n\nd.From monopoly supply chains to local jobs and local ownership\n\nWe cannot allow the current system to collapse \u2013 but we need the majority of our efforts and investments to be put into the new systems.\n\nWe are committed to help change the tone of the public discourse around the Energy file.\n\nThe public has to be involved \u2013 not in \u2018conversations\u2019 but in actions, projects, investments, innovations, outcomes. There is a groundswell of public support as evidenced by the surge in RE Co-ops across the Province, in terms of memberships and dollars invested. We want to accelerate the public engagement in the transition.\n\nThere are huge climate challenges ahead \u2013 our Governments cannot \u2018do it\u2019 alone. But they can dictate the Transition in terms of outcomes and timelines. We need to focus our energies on building the new future together.\n\nMarc van Beusekom\n\nTreasure, Federation of Community Power Co-operatives\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207178]\n",

        "comment":"Responses to points \"For Consideration\" raised in \"Planning Ontario's Energy Future\" Discussion Guide:\n\n\u2022What are the significant challenges facing utilities and what can the government do to meet them? Challenges include a reduction in the number of rate payers due to some loss of industry and manufacturing in the province, and lower resulting revenues as ratepayers conserve to reduce their energy bills.\u00a0 The government could increase investments geared towards renewable energy production and consumption, thereby diverting spending on fossil fuels into sustainable electrified transportation.\u00a0 As more ratepayers come online or increase electrical consumption to power vehicles from transit buses, to trains, to personal road vehicles, electrical energy revenues will rise.\u00a0 Cap and trade revenues can help to fund incentives for distributed clean energy production (such as solar PV) and storage, energy efficiency such as home energy retrofits, heat pumps, electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.\n\n\u2022What are the most important benefits of a modern grid? Increased reliability? Greater information on your energy usage?\n\nGreater reliability and resiliency are of the utmost importance.\u00a0 These can be achieved by investing in distributed energy production and distributed energy storage.\u00a0 Programs such as Green Button should allow consumers to be more informed about their energy consumption and spending. This should result in more efficient energy utilization particularly if integrated with smart appliances, thermostats, electric vehicle charging stations (such as the Edison Award winning ChargePoint Home - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9IDLMFS04Ug or Flo Home -https:\/\/flo.ca\/at-home\/single-family\/x5 units), etc.\n\n\u2022What are the best uses of microgrids in Ontario?\n\nThe deployment and implementation of microgrids should be much broader in scope.\u00a0 Remote communities do represent an ideal scenario for the deployment of microgrids.\u00a0 The government should avoid spending substantial resources to connect these communities to the electrical distribution grid and consider investing in self contained microgrids including local renewable energy production, energy storage and system management.\u00a0 This approach might mirror the success of cellular phone deployment over land-lines in remote areas around the globe.\n\nIn addition, microgrids should be implemented for all types of campuses from residential to university, business, commercial and manufacturing.\u00a0 This is an area that has tremendous potential for the future of energy in Ontario.\u00a0 It serves to decentralize, derisk, decarbonizes and improve resiliency of our energy infrastructure.\u00a0 (see: Used Batteries Get New Life Powering The Grid - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/eMileage\/posts\/1609279462455974)\n\n\u2022Are there any barriers preventing the use of microgrids?\n\nNo insurmountable barriers are apparent.\u00a0 However, there may be perceived barriers related to historic organizational challenges of the centralized energy production and localized distribution structures.\u00a0 To modernize our energy infrastructure, these organizational structures may benefit from independent and impartial review.\u00a0 Customers are more concerned about reliable and affordable energy, than which company is responsible for producing vs delivering it to their homes and businesses.\u00a0 With microgrids, customers may even participate in their own energy production and storage, negating some of the need for expensive transmission\/distribution capacity.\u00a0 Therefore costs could be lower for all involved.\n\n\u2022Would you be willing to participate in a program where your utility could use your home storage device from time to time to operate a more reliable electricity distribution system?\n\nYes.\u00a0 This would be of particular interest if customers could also financially benefit from participating in a bi-directional energy distribution system.\u00a0 In addition, electric vehicle owners might also want to participate by integrating vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and vehicle-to-home (V2H) charging systems that allow them to share available stored energy in their vehicle\u2019s batteries during periods of high or peak demand.\u00a0 When the number of grid-connected EVs grows to millions of units, this will represent a substantial instantly available distributed energy storage reservoir. A fleet of 100 Nissan Leafs represents potentially 3000kWh of connected energy storage.\u00a0 A fleet comprised of 100 Chevy Bolt EV or Tesla Model S vehicles could more than double that number.\u00a0 Of course, only a fraction of the battery would be available for use.\u00a0 Using a projection of 5% of vehicles in the province, assuming an average 50kWh battery capacity of which 5% may be available at any point in time yields an estimate of (8 million vehicle^(statscan) x 5% x 50kWh x 5% = 1,000,000) 1000MWh of potentially available storage.\u00a0 (see: Canadians Support Government Actions To Spur Clean Energy - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/eMileage\/posts\/1609249422458978)\n\n\u2022How can Ontario further support innovative energy storage technologies that leverage our existing natural gas infrastructure assets and take advantage of our clean electricity system?\n\nOntario can take advantage of our clean electricity system by allowing electric vehicle owners to charge their vehicles at no cost during off-peak or surplus power periods.\u00a0 This would contribute to a growing energy storage reservoir using resources that might otherwise go to waste.\u00a0 This should also help to balance energy demand, better utilize available energy production capacity and reduce the amount of overall investment required.\n\n\u2022Which innovations offer the greatest benefit to your community and the energy system as a whole? Distributed renewable energy production and storage offers tremendous opportunities for our energy system as a whole.\u00a0 A dynamic, resilient system from energy production to consumption benefits all stakeholders.\u00a0 Intelligent charging of electric vehicles during periods of low demand would benefit both the grid and customers through better capacity utilization via Demand Response pricing structures which should result in lower rates.\n\n\u2022How should the public and private sectors cooperate to encourage innovation in the energy section?\n\nBy removing any barriers to private sector partners to participate in energy production and removing barriers to LDCs participating in energy storage, and other service offerings behind the meter, such as electric vehicle charging, there should be a much more rapid deployment of these services.\n\nPartners such as LDCs and taxi companies, mail and parcel delivery carriers, etc. should cooperate on the deployment of fast charging infrastructure and local energy storage to facilitate electric transport\/delivery fleets.\n\n-Uber To Launch an All Electric Fleet - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/eMileage\/posts\/1340858862631370?match=I2V2dGF4aSxldnRheGk%3D\n\n-Tesla To Deliver It\u2019s Largest Privately Owned Supercharger Station - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/eMileage\/posts\/1522877974429457?match=I2V2dGF4aSxldnRheGk%3D\n\n-London Black Cabs Raieses $400M to Develop PHEV Taxi - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/eMileage\/posts\/1147695051947753?match=I2V2dGF4aSxldnRheGk%3D\n\n-Electric Taxis Are On Their Way - http:\/\/www.fleetcarma.com\/electric-taxis-on-their-way\/\n\n\u2022What actions could the government take to support the adoption of alternative fuels?\n\nOntario could take advantage of the experience of other jurisdictions.\u00a0 While Ontario wishes to become a leader in the export industry of renewable energy, we appear to be slowing in our innovation rather than accelerating.\u00a0 We have seen a reduction of investments in solar energy deployment and wind deployments.\u00a0 We have deployed almost no renewable energy storage on our grid. Perhaps we could learn from the experiences of other countries that have made major investments and bold moves toward increasing the sustainability, in addition to our small trials of various storage techniques.\u00a0 It is already clear that battery storage will be a major component of future energy systems, yet we have not taken advantage of the falling cost of battery storage, nor offered incentives for ratepayers to do so.\n\nOffering electric vehicle incentives are an excellent action to increase adoption of our locally produced electricity as a transportation fuel.\u00a0 However, we have done very little to make the public aware that these incentives exist.\u00a0 The province should invest in joint programs with the transportation sector to make use of our own electrical energy before investing in expanding imports of fossil fuels.\u00a0 For example, Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power could work with Toronto Hydro and GO Transit to electrify GO buses and trains.\u00a0 This adds to the ratepayer base and keeps investment in Ontario.\u00a0 The lower operating costs and health benefits of cleaner air benefit transit riders and all Ontario residents.\u00a0 Similar programs should be rolled out with HydroOne Brampton\/Brampton Transit, PowerStream\/York Region Transit, Oakville Hydro\/Oakville Transit, etc. across the entire province.\u00a0 Battery storage at transit depots would also help to stabilize the grid, shave peak demand for charging and reduce operating costs for fleets of cleaner transit vehicles.\n\n\u2022Should Ontario set provincial conservation targets for other fuel types such as natural gas, oil and propane?\n\nYes.\u00a0 However, consumers should also be provided with resources that they need to learn about and acquire alternatives to fossil fuels, such as solar photovoltaics, heat pumps and electric vehicles.\n\n\u2022To meet the province\u2019s climate change objectives, how can existing or new conservation and energy efficiency programs be enhanced in the near and longer term?\n\nExisting energy efficiency programs such as building energy retrofits can be further enhanced by integrating transportation electrification in the program.\u00a0 The installation of charging infrastructure should be recognized for homes, multi-residentual buildings and businesses, as should the switch from gasoline to electric vehicles.\u00a0 In particular, fleet operators should be encouraged to convert their fleets to electric vehicles which increase the rate-payer base, while reducing GHG and local air pollution.\n\n\u2022How can we continue to inform and engage energy consumers?\n\nConsumers are confused as to why the success of electrical energy conservation has resulted in higher electricity rates.\u00a0 However, it is clear if there are fewer consumers (less industry) and consumers buy less electricity, along with massive investments in new and refurbished generation and distribution, the cost of our energy infrastructure must be higher per unit of energy produced. The opportunity that has largely been missed by many is to shift from fossil sources to renewable electrical energy.\u00a0 By replacing gasoline, fuel oil and natural gas consumption with electrical energy, the consumer could dramatically cut energy costs.\u00a0 This approach deserves much greater attention.\u00a0 Energy customers should be informed why they are spending more and should be reassured that with more electrical energy consumption, particularly during off-peak periods (when distributed energy storage can be recharged) and with more rate-payers, electricity rates should go down, rather than up.\n\n\u2022What role should distributed renewable energy generation play in the ongoing modernization and transformation of Ontario\u2019s electricity system?\n\nDistributed renewable energy generation should play the primary role in the ongoing modernization of Ontario\u2019s electricity system.\u00a0 Renewable distributed energy is already cost effective and costs continue to decline.\u00a0 However, a critical component of distributed renewable generation is distributed energy storage.\u00a0 The intermittent nature of solar and wind pairs well with distributed energy storage which is able to capture energy when it may not be immediately consumed and release energy to the grid when it may be in demand.\u00a0 Energy storage can also help to achieve net zero buildings while increasing resiliency of our electricity system.\n\n\u2022What strategies should Ontario pursue to harness the potential of its nuclear sector to meet its future energy needs?\n\nNuclear provides reliable baseload generation.\u00a0 The percentage of energy production from nuclear is substantial.\u00a0 Combined with local and distributed energy storage, Ontario\u2019s existing nuclear assets could continue to provide reliable baseload for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u2022What are the best tools to support Indigenous community engagement and leadership in Ontario\u2019s energy sector?\n\nOntario could support Indigenous community engagement by incorporating some of the successful programs implemented in other regions.\u00a0 For example try to replicate the efforts of this Ottawa-born renewable energy developer:\u00a0 David Isaac: Leader in First Nation solar energy - http:\/\/www.davidsuzuki.org\/blogs\/climate-blog\/2016\/12\/david-isaac-a-leader-in-first-nations-solar-e nergy\/)\n\n\u2022To meet a higher demand, what mix of new electricity resources would best balance the principles of cost-effectiveness, reliability, clean energy, community engagement, and an emphasis on Conservation First?\n\nFor example the students in the York Catholic District School Board (http:\/\/www.ycdsb.ca\/news\/archive\/042116-solarprojects.html) are learning about renewable energy through engagement in their own energy production.\u00a0 Energy production from solar photovoltaics mounted on school roofs is dynamically monitored on display monitors throughout the school, by students and faculty.\u00a0 Programs such as the Centre for Sustainable Energy at Georgian College (http:\/\/www.cleanenergydevelopments.com\/about-clean-energy\/projects\/Centre_for_Sustainable_Technolo gies_at_Georgian_College) provide skills graduates will need to work in growing technology fields of solar renewable energy, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, geothermal technology, etc.\n\n\u2022What policies will Ontario need to adapt to a transformation in the fuels sector?\n\nA significant increase is expected, to the number electric vehicles in the province.\u00a0 Most of these vehicles will recharge during nighttime hours.\u00a0 The result should be a reduction in gasoline demand and an increase in electricity demand.\u00a0 A policy to prioritize the use of Ontario\u2019s off peak generation capacity for transportation should be beneficial to our energy sector and our economy.

        "comment":"December 16, 2016\n\nAndrea Pastori\n\nCabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator\n\nMinistry of Energy\n\nStrategic, Network and Agency Policy Division\n\nStrategic Policy and Analytics Branch\n\n77 Grenville Street, 6th Floor\n\nToronto Ontario M7A 2C1\n\nMs Pastori,\n\nRe: 2017 Long Term Energy Plan\n\nThe Ontario Geothermal Association (OGA) represents the geothermal heating and cooling industry in Ontario, and includes as its members suppliers, designers, installers, drillers and engineers working in both commercial and residential markets across Ontario.\u00a0 We are pleased to have the opportunity to make recommendations to Ontario Ministry of Energy as part of the review of its Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP), as we believe that our sector can play a key role in assisting Ontario to reach both its energy planning and its greenhouse gas emission reduction objectives.\n\nOGA is already on the record in support of the direction charted by the Government of Ontario in relation to reducing GHG emissions and the industry has made the point emphatically that geothermal heating and cooling ought to form a significant part of the province\u2019s plans.\u00a0 The heating and cooling of buildings represents a major energy use in the Province of Ontario and much of this energy is supplied by fossil fuels (natural gas and heating oil).\u00a0 Harnessing the thermal energy stored in the earth not only allows for a shift from carbon based fossil fuels to a renewable energy source, but it allows for a much more efficient use of the modest amount of electricity required to support these systems.\u00a0 Geothermal is a proven technology whose time has come for Ontario.\n\nWe are pleased to find in the LTEP Discussion Guide a clear recognition that, in light of the government\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan,\n\n\u2026the 2017 LTEP should take a broader view of the province\u2019s energy needs and consider how the uses of electricity and fossil fuels influence each other. For example, because Ontario\u2019s electricity supply is largely emissions free, commitments in the Climate Change Action Plan foresee a switch from conventional fossil fuels to the use of electricity for heating and cooling buildings and powering transportation (p.8).\n\nThere are recognized obstacles to the widespread uptake of geothermal systems in the province, most notably the relatively large up-front capital investment required, relative to other systems. There are, however, effective methods for overcoming this obstacle.\u00a0 Some time ago the province made it possible for municipalities to introduce Local Improvement Charges (LICs) as a means to encourage energy-efficient upgrades to homes by making affordable financing available over a longer period of time and tying the repayments to the property affected as opposed to the owner\/occupant. More needs to be done, however, to encourage municipalities to implement these tools as participation to date has been very limited.\u00a0 An alternative or supplemental approach to this type of program might involve supporting collectivized (possibly utility) ownership and financing of geothermal loop fields in a district energy arrangement where thermal energy is delivered to buildings.\u00a0 There are successful models for this type of arrangement across North America and Ontario should explore policy tools or regulations that would support programs of this type at home.\n\nThe OGA encourages the Ministry of Energy to recognize geothermal heating and cooling systems as an important tool towards the fulfilment of the objectives of the LTEP.\u00a0 Benefits of the widespread adoption of geothermal systems in Ontario\u2019s energy mix will include the following: \u2022Geothermal is simultaneously a high-efficiency (arguably the most efficient technology on the market) and a low-carbon solution for building heating and hot water needs;\n\n\u2022The technology is applicable anywhere in Ontario where installation of heat exchangers is possible (almost everywhere) and can be used to dramatically reduce energy poverty in areas not serviced by natural gas;\n\n\u2022Investment in geothermal technologies will pre-empt the need or desire for expansion of existing natural gas infrastructure;\n\n\u2022A significant expansion of geothermal systems across the province can be managed without requiring an upgrade of existing electrical infrastructure;\n\n\u2022The technology is a well-understood, tested and mature application that works reliably and very efficiently;\n\n\u2022The technology can dramatically reduce peak electrical winter peak demand compared to other (air source) heat pump technologies;\n\n\u2022Geothermal can also reduce summer peak demand by 30-50%, compared to all other cooling solutions, including air-source heat pumps, central air-conditioning systems and chillers with cooling towers; \u2022Geothermal will contribute to favourable electrical load profiles for local electric utilities across the province (increased base load, reduced peak load);\n\n\u2022Geothermal in general reduces energy consumption in comparison to any other heating and cooling solution, which reduces consumer exposure to price risk related to energy or carbon cost inflation; \u2022Geothermal technology will contribute to \u201cenergy security\u201d because most of the energy (thermal energy) is on site, and the balance (electricity) is for the most part produced locally within the province;\n\n\u2022Economic activity associated with the installation of geothermal systems are comprised of mostly local (roughly 70-80%) content, creating high-skilled and local jobs and significant investment opportunity for Ontario\u2019s businesses;\n\n\u2022Geothermal allows buildings to become completely \u201cnet-zero,\u201d in terms of carbon and energy, and enables buildings to incorporate complementary technologies such as thermal storage for demand side management, use of locally generated power (solar) without the use of inverters (loss of efficiency), leverage battery storage, and integration with electric vehicle use;\n\n\u2022Geothermal enables the transition of Ontario\u2019s energy for buildings to be 100% carbon-free without construction of massive central power generation and upgraded power distribution\n\nAs noted above, geothermal (ground source heat pump) systems are tested and proven to deliver significant energy savings and GHG emissions reductions.\u00a0 Yet market penetration remains limited. In order to facilitate more widespread uptake of this technology, there is need to better educate delivery channels to ensure systems are installed and maintained to the highest possible standards. There is also a need to educate the marketplace in general about the availability and benefits of this type of system.\u00a0 The geothermal industry is prepared to work with the Government of Ontario to develop the programs needed to develop the marketplace for this technology.\n\nThe OGA appreciates the opportunity to make this submission to the Ministry on the Long Term Energy Plan.\u00a0 We would be pleased to make ourselves available for further consultation on the development of programs and policies that will achieve the climate change goals of the Province of Ontario.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJim Bolger\n\nChair\n\nccOGA Board of Directors\n\nMartin Luymes, HRAI\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207180]\n",

First, Suspension will send that innovation elsewhere. We will be purchasers of technology from elsewhere rather than producers and exporters of innovative renewable technology. Second, this is an industry that requires time to ramp up and will not be there when the tap is opened again (as it will be). Countries that continue to support the industry will step in and sell their product to us. Third, while there may be some excess electricity in the province right now, to move to a lower carbon economy will require renewables rather than gas plants.

Fourth, while renewables have had a small impact on the cost of electricity there have been much larger reasons such as inflation, and nuclear refurbishment. There has been little if any information from the government as to the true reasons for the increases in electricity rates leaving renewables as a political scape goat.

        "comment":"FUL DOCUMENT SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL TO MINISTRY - PLEASE POST EMAILED PDF FOR VIEWING EASE.\n\nAndrea Pastori\n\nCabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator\n\nMinistry of Energy\n\nStrategic, Network and Agency Policy Division\n\nStrategic Policy and Analytics Branch\n\n77 Grenville Street, 6th Floor\n\nToronto, Ontario M7A 2C1\n\nDecember 16, 2016\n\nOntario\u2019s 2017 Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP): Planning Our Energy Future\n\nDear Ms. Pastori:\n\nThe Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (OSPE) appreciates the opportunity to submit commentary to support the development of the 2017 Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP).\n\nWhen it comes to Ontario\u2019s energy future, the importance of proper planning cannot be overstated. The management of our energy sector is arguably one of the most complex and integral responsibilities of the provincial government, and in order to plan this sector effectively, the insight of engineers is of paramount importance.\n\nOSPE is the voice of engineers in Ontario and takes its role as a trusted resource and advocate for evidence-based decision-making very seriously. Engineers have the technical knowledge that is required to develop an optimal power system plan and an integrated energy system plan for the economy as a whole. It is imperative that the Government of Ontario grant its professional engineers more independence in planning and designing the provincial energy systems in accordance with the outcomes-based objectives determined by government and public consultation.\n\nIt is OSPE\u2019s position that the government should return to its prior role of establishing high-level goals for Ontario\u2019s energy systems and leave the detailed planning and design to the agencies and organizations that have the required engineering expertise to develop those systems in a cost-effective manner. Determining the supply mix and where that supply should be located are an integral part of the detailed planning and design process.\n\nLooking to the future, Ontario must achieve balance between its environmental commitments and its economic welfare. Reducing carbon emissions in non-electrical sectors of the economy will be more difficult to achieve and potentially far more costly than Ontario\u2019s experience with the electrical sector if it is not done in an optimal way. Close attention must be paid to the engineering that is required to efficiently achieve these complex transitions.\n\nAs part of the consultation and engagement process, the Ministry has held a number of information sessions across the province. OSPE\u2019s involvement in these sessions has been significant, with board members, subject matter experts, members of our Energy Task Force, and general members providing input on behalf of Ontario\u2019s engineers.\n\nEngaging OSPE\u2019s submission: the first section highlights areas for consideration; the second section offers high-level recommendations; and the final section contains pointed responses to the questions forwarded in the LTEP Discussion Guide, Planning Ontario\u2019s Energy Future. In an effort to relieve cost pressures on ratepayers, Appendix A details OSPE\u2019s recent policy research to put downward pressure on electricity rates. All told, this document is the culmination of months of research and consultation with contributions from OSPE participants in the LTEP meetings noted above, and aligned stakeholder groups.\n\nIf you have any questions or wish to meet to further discuss the information communicated in this submission, please contact Patrick Sackville, Lead, Policy & Government Relations at patrick@ospe.on.ca or (416) 223-9961 ext. 225.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSandro Perruzza\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nOntario Society of Professional Engineers\n\nMichael Monette, P.Eng., MBA\n\nPresident and Chair\n\nOntario Society of Professional Engineers\n\nAreas of Consideration:\n\n1.Technology is Changing Rapidly in the Energy Sector\n\nPrescriptive top-down approaches to power system planning and retail price plans that no longer reflect the current market conditions are ineffective and costly. They also create large amounts of surplus zero emission electricity that cannot be utilized economically in Ontario to help reduce emissions in other sectors. The province needs to establish a more market driven approach that allows new useful technology to flourish when it is developed. Smart electricity price plans are a key enabler of technology innovation and successful market penetration in a low emission environment.\n\n2.Understanding the Capacity Market\n\nThe Independent Electricity Market Operator (IESO) is planning to introduce capacity markets to procure capacity competitively rather than using a technology centric procurement approach. OSPE welcomes more competition, however, there are many legitimate types of capacity that are required to achieve an optimal supply mix.\n\nThe capacity market must be sophisticated enough to allow all required types of generation to successfully compete where they provide value. For example, nuclear generation is currently the most cost effective technology to reduce base load CO2 emissions but it cannot compete in a capacity market that procures only short-term capacity.\n\nIn addition, wind and solar generation cannot compete with natural gas fired generation if the carbon price is only $50 per tonne of CO2 as suggested by the federal government. Some of Ontario\u2019s impressive emission reductions over the past 12 years can be undone if the capacity market is not sufficiently sophisticated to differentiate among the various economic, technical and environmental requirements.\n\n3.Electricity Prices\n\nElectricity prices are too high relative to Ontario\u2019s trading competitors in the North American Free Trade (NAFTA) market. Further, Ontario businesses cannot get access to Ontario\u2019s surplus zero emission electricity at the same price as adjoining power systems on the same terms and conditions.\n\n4.Location of Costs in Electricity Prices\n\nElectricity prices include cost components that are not related to a competitively run power system. These extra costs are preventing the use of surplus electricity from being used to reduce emissions in other sectors. See Appendix A for details on which components could be moved to more appropriate tax supported accounts to help lower Ontario\u2019s high electricity prices.\n\n5.Sub-Optimal Supply Mix\n\nOntario\u2019s supply mix is sub-optimal. There are significant amounts of non-dispatchable generation that produce power out of alignment with consumer hourly demand. That creates large amounts of zero emission electricity that must be exported at low prices or curtailed (wasted) due to price plans that do not reflect the conditions of the current electricity market.\n\n6.Surplus Sale\n\nToo much surplus zero emission electricity (&#8776; 10 TWh\/yr in 2015) is being sold at very low prices to adjoining jurisdictions on an interruptible basis instead of being used in Ontario for fuel switching applications to help lower emissions in other sectors.\n\n7.Surplus Curtailment\n\nToo much surplus zero emission electricity (&#8776; 5 TWh\/yr in 2015) is being curtailed (wasted) instead of being used in Ontario for fuel switching applications to help lower emissions in other sectors.\n\n8.Market & Price Plans\n\nOntario does not have an interruptible electricity market or price plan to effectively utilize its surplus zero emission electricity inside Ontario.\n\n&#61656;Electricity Pricing & Energy Management\n\nCurrent electricity price plans are not effective at reducing peak load because they do not produce enough savings for consumers to invest in energy management equipment that will automatically level their load.\n\n&#61656;Residential & Small Business Plans\n\nCurrent residential and small business electricity plans discourage these consumers from using surplus zero emission electricity when it is available during \u201con peak\u201d and \u201cmid peak\u201d time-of-use hours because there are no provisions to reduce the rates when surplus electricity is available.\n\n&#61656;Large Business & Industrial Plans\n\nCurrent large business and large industrial plans discourage these consumers from using surplus electricity when it is available due to the large global adjustment, transmission, and distribution energy charges. These charges should be capacity based charges not energy based charges.\n\n9.Transmission & Distribution\n\nTransmission and distribution capacity is being inefficiently utilized by intermittent generation that is installed in large farms remote from the load.\n\n10.Lack of Long-Term Storage\n\nOntario has a low emission power system with relatively little long-term storage. This makes it difficult to effectively use intermittent wind and solar generation economically to supply uninterruptible electrical load.\n\n11.Capacity Characteristics & Peak Demand Are Misaligned\n\nOntario has too much capacity that cannot be relied upon when system peaks occur and Ontario has too little storage to compensate for that deficiency. About 95% of solar is not available for the winter peak demand. About 90% of wind is not available for the summer peak demand. This means that intermittent generation like wind and solar have little capacity value in Ontario\u2019s power system. The value of wind and solar generation is primarily their fossil fuel displacement value and carbon dioxide reduction value. At current natural gas prices and expected carbon allowance prices that is only a fraction of their contractual cost per kWh.\n\n&#61656;Wind Generation\n\nWind generation has relatively little economic value in Ontario\u2019s low emission power system. Wind generation would have greater value if wind could be used to supply interruptible loads that can switch from fossil fuel to electricity and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions in other sectors. The value of wind is greater when it is installed close to the load it serves.\n\n&#61656;Solar Generation\n\nSolar capacity has already reached its optimum maximum capacity in Ontario\u2019s power system. Additional capacity is likely to result in additional surpluses of zero emission electricity that will be wasted. Additional solar generation capacity could be accommodated if solar could be used to supply interruptible loads that can switch from fossil fuel to electricity and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions in other sectors. The value of solar is greater when it is installed close to the load it serves.\n\n12.Research & Development\n\nSponsoring R&D and pilots to improve technology and to find integrated solutions that reduce costs is a wise investment. However, widespread deployment of high cost solutions before their costs have come down will create upward pressure on costs and rates.\n\n13.The CCAP Heat Pump Strategy\n\nThe Climate Change Action Plan proposes to deploy heat pumps for building heating and the IESO\u2019s Ontario Planning Outlook has two scenarios named C and D that have purpose built electrical capacity to supply heat pumps for winter heating of buildings. This purpose built additional winter capacity will have a relatively low operating capacity factor of about 30 or 35% so it will come at a levelized cost almost double the current cost of electricity.\n\nThe additional electricity and capital cost for the heat pumps will add considerably to the cost of heating homes and other buildings. A better strategy is to use available surplus electrical capacity on an interruptible basis and rely on natural gas when electrical capacity is not available, especially on the coldest days when heat pumps require an auxiliary heat source. Electricity should not be used as the auxiliary heat source or that electricity will likely come from natural gas generating plants that will produce double the CO2 emissions and 5x the energy cost compared to using natural gas directly as the auxiliary heat source.\n\nFrom an energy efficiency perspective, options within buildings which optimize both the natural gas and electricity infrastructure would represent the best model to support (optimizing peak\/off peak cycles, for example).\n\n14.The Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI)\n\nThe ICI is transferring Class A large industrial consumer costs onto Class B residential and commercial consumers because some Class A consumers can game the rules to achieve an overly generous global adjustment (GA) reduction. For example, consumers can test their standby generators on the 5 highest demand days and then achieve a global adjustment reduction for the entire year. The reduced electricity bill for the Class A consumer is much greater than the cost reduction benefit for the power system as a whole so the costs are effectively transferred from ICI participating Class A consumers to non-participating Class A and Class B consumers by the rate calculation formula used to set Class A and B rates.\n\n15.Balancing Conservation, Efficiency & Capacity\n\nA zero-emission electrical system is essentially a fixed cost system. While conservation and energy efficiency is always wise, when overall system demand is dropping as it has for the past several years, the expected power system savings by not investing in additional capacity is not realized. Consequently, conservation and energy efficiency programs lower electricity bills for individual consumers who practice it but increase the electricity bill for those that do not because the fixed system costs have not changed and must be recovered.\n\n16.Attention to the Economy & General Affordability\n\nThe large-scale electrification of homes, businesses, and industry would have significant negative impacts for economic and affordability considerations.\n\nRecommendations for the 2017 Long-Term Energy Plan:\n\nWithout Thorough Analysis, Avoid the Large Scale Electrification of Fossil Fuels\n\nLarge scale electrification of fossil fuel demand will be expensive because electricity currently costs about 5x more than natural gas on an energy content basis. Detailed analysis should be conducted before specific applications are either incentivized or mandated by regulations to ensure the extra cost per tonne of CO2 emission is acceptable.\n\nUse the Right Energy for the Right Application\n\nElectricity and natural gas systems work in a complimentary fashion to meet the province\u2019s energy demands. Leveraging existing energy infrastructure and maintaining a diversified energy portfolio will help meet emissions targets in an affordable manner that maintains long term energy supply and reliability.\n\nRealize the Potential of the Electric Vehicle Program\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) are now cost effective on an energy cost basis provided most of the charging takes place during off-peak hours. Incentives to reduce consumers\u2019 anxiety over higher capital cost, range, charging time, and battery life should continue to be provided until those anxieties subside in order to facilitate rapid adoption to reduce CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. OSPE has indicated its ability to deliver thought leadership and public awareness campaigns to encourage EV market penetration.\n\nExplore Natural Gas Applications for Transportation\n\nUnderstanding that the transportation sector is the leading contributor of GHG emissions and that EV adoption will take time, Ontario should take advantage of economic and effective solutions to reduce emissions such as supporting the deployment of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for fleet and heavy transportation applications.\n\nOffer Consumers Surplus Zero Emission Electricity at its Wholesale Price\n\nSurplus zero emission electricity should be made available on an interruptible basis at its wholesale market price without additional markups to produce zero emission hydrogen using electrolyzers. If this is done, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) would also be cost effective on an energy basis. Incentives to reduce consumers\u2019 anxiety over higher capital cost and degradation should be provided until those anxieties subside in order to facilitate rapid adoption to reduce CO2 emissions in the transportation sector.\n\nEmpower the Market to Achieve an Optimal Supply Mix\n\nOntario\u2019s new capacity market for generation needs to be sophisticated enough to allow all cost-effective generation technologies to successfully bid into that market so that an optimized supply mix can be achieved.\n\nDevelop a Market for Interruptible Electricity\n\nOntario needs to develop a market for interruptible electricity. The market or price plans need to differentiate between surplus zero emission supply and surplus carbon emitting supply. Ontario consumers should be allowed to purchase surplus zero emission supply on an interruptible basis at only its wholesale market price (effectively its marginal cost of production) with no other price markups such as global adjustment, transmission, distribution, debt retirement and regulatory charges. Those charges have effectively been fully recovered from the consumer\u2019s uninterruptible electrical consumption. This pricing approach for surplus zero emission electricity will make fossil fuel displacement by surplus zero emission electricity economical for consumers. That will help achieve the 2030 emission reduction goal across the entire economy. Carbon emitting supply should not receive relief from various electricity price markups or that will encourage higher CO2 emissions.\n\nPrice Planning: High Fixed Costs, Low Marginal Costs\n\nIn the longer-term Ontario needs to move to an electricity pricing strategy that recognizes zero emission power systems have high fixed costs and very low marginal costs. Low emission electricity should be priced primarily on capacity demand (kWs) and to a much lesser extent on energy demand (kWhs) to better match the cost of providing electrical service and provide a much stronger incentive for all consumers to flatten their load profile across the whole day.\n\nResidential and small commercial plans will likely need to be different than large commercial and industrial plans because residential and small commercial consumers are not familiar with demand charges. It will be easier to develop a special plan for them rather than educate the entire population on how to differentiate between kW and kWh consumption.\n\nOSPE proposed such a plan to the government in 2015.\u00a0 That plan will strongly encourage consumers to level their load demand on an hourly basis over the whole day using automatic load leveling equipment. Over time, power system costs will fall per unit of electricity because it is much cheaper to supply dependable base load electricity than dependable peak load electricity.\n\nProduction & Demand Characteristics\n\nOntario needs to stop adding electrical generation capacity that has production characteristics that are out of alignment with consumer hourly and seasonal demand until storage costs are much lower (typically 10x lower for short term storage and 100x lower for long term storage). Such capacity has relatively low value for supplying uninterruptible electrical demand and only has modest value for interruptible electrical demand used for fossil fuel displacement and carbon dioxide reduction based on the expected prices for natural gas and carbon allowances.\n\nUnderstand the Respective Strengths of Electrical & Natural Gas Systems\n\nTo reduce CO2 emissions at an affordable cost the energy system planners should take advantage of the strengths of both the electrical and natural gas systems. The Ministry can facilitate optimal system planning and design by developing electricity price plans that reflect the true cost of providing base load and incremental peak load and allow the market to offer technology to meet both needs. System plans should be flexible enough to adjust base load and peak load supply as consumers adjust their demand profile with new technologies like local storage, microgrids, and energy management equipment.\n\nSystem planners should be aware of the characteristics of each technology including:\n\na)On the demand side: it is often cheaper to modify the hourly electrical load demand than build capacity to meet the unmodified profile. Price plans that reflect the real cost of providing both base load and incremental peak load electricity so that energy management solutions including local short-term storage are incentivized automatically. Because not all consumers are in a position to purchase energy management equipment, these new price plans can initially be voluntary until more experience is gained.\n\nb)On the supply side: intermittent generation like wind and solar will cause backup supply like natural gas generation to cycle more often and reduce both its efficiency and increase its emissions. Some jurisdictions have found that large penetration of intermittent renewable generation can cause as much as 50% of the expected emission reductions to be lost due to the more frequent load maneuvers required of the natural gas backup supply. Some modest amounts of storage local to the renewable generation facilities (especially solar) may be cost effective to mitigate emission increases described above and curtailment of surplus zero emission electricity during high production hours.\n\nc)Zero-emission base load electricity is much cheaper to produce than peak load zero emission electricity. Finding effective price plans (voluntary or otherwise) to incent consumers to flatten their hourly load demand is important in order to lower the cost to achieve emission reductions.\n\nd)Nuclear achieves its lowest cost per kWh when it supplies base load consumer demand. Hydroelectric, wind and solar costs per kWh increase when they are required to supply base load consumer demand because of the additional storage required to achieve zero CO2 emissions at the high capacity factors.\n\ne)For base load demand, for each installed kW of capacity, nuclear technology reduces CO2\n\nemissions 6x more than solar, 2.6x more than wind, and 1.7x more than hydroelectric due to the high operating capacity factor of nuclear generation. Nuclear generation is relatively climate change insensitive compared to hydroelectric, wind, and solar generation.\n\nf)After conservation and energy efficiency, the lowest cost way to reduce carbon emissions in the industrial, building and transportation sector is to switch from fossil fuels to electricity or to hydrogen produced from zero emission electricity. However, building new electrical capacity to displace fossil fuel consumption is 5x more expensive per unit of energy. Even with heat pumps that have a co-efficient of performance of 2x that of electrical resistance heaters, the cost is still 2.5x greater. Consequently, fuel switching is only economic if surplus zero-emission electricity from existing electrical capacity is used to accomplish the fuel switch.\n\ng)Low emission power systems produce large amounts of surplus zero emission energy. That surplus should be sold on an interruptible basis at the wholesale market price (without other markups) to Ontario consumers to facilitate fuel switching out of fossil fuels. Currently the surplus is being sold to adjoining jurisdictions on an interruptible basis at very low prices or being curtailed (wasted).\n\nResponses to the 2017 LTEP Discussion Guide:\n\nDistribution and Grid Modernization\n\nThe electrical distribution system will face costly upgrades if the government forces consumers to switch from natural gas heating to air sourced heat pumps with electrical auxiliary heating. OSPE recommends that the government adopt an integrated energy supply approach for winter heating loads and leverage the strength of the both the electrical system and natural gas system to minimize the electrical generation capacity that will only run during the winter.\n\nSmart electricity pricing plans will help incentivize the development of distribution connected technologies in a rational way to provide lower cost energy solutions. Smart price plans will facilitate cost effective implementation of microgrids, virtual power plants, behind the meter thermal and electrical storage and energy management control systems that will help to achieve the province\u2019s CO2 emission goals.\n\nMicrogrids\n\nOSPE is concerned high electricity prices combined with electricity price plans that no longer reflect current wholesale electricity market conditions will encourage consumers to deploy natural gas fired microgrids and combined heat and power systems in situations that lead to the displacement of zero emission generation on the transmission and distribution system. This will be a regressive step if Ontario is serious about eventually reducing CO2 emissions by 80% or more across the entire economy.\n\nThe province\u2019s and federal government\u2019s stated expectations for carbon prices in the medium term are too low to discourage the use of low cost natural gas for electricity production in microgrids or CHP facilities.\n\nTransmission\n\nTransmission should ideally be used to bring electricity to consumers from remote facilities such as hydroelectric sites, from nuclear facilities that cannot be located inside cities and to exchange energy with adjoining jurisdictions.\n\nLarge scale solar and wind farms use transmission inefficiently. Intermittent generation like wind and solar have better value if they are located much closer to the load they serve.\n\nStorage\n\nStorage is still much too expensive for large-scale deployment on the power system. However, smaller short-term storage facilities are becoming economic behind the meter to provide a number of load management services including backup during power failures. Unfortunately, the current electricity price plans that do not provide consumers with sufficient financial incentive to deploy local storage solutions. The long term success of a zero emissions economy including wind and solar will depend on significant storage improvements. Investment in R&D and pilot installations for energy storage should be key going forward.\n\nInnovation and Economic Growth\n\nPicking winners is not a recipe for success in a rapidly changing technology environment. OSPE suggests a market driven approach built around smart price plans that automatically incent the market to deploy cost effective solutions.\n\nGovernment support will still be needed to fund higher-risk R&D and pilot projects until the early technology development reaches a stage that market forces will drive deployment.\n\nConservation and Energy Efficiency\n\nConservation and energy efficiency is important and should be encouraged but how it is coordinated with other CO2 reduction initiatives that require more electricity is important. To be clear, energy conservation is the most cost effective way of reducing carbon in our economy and should continue to be critical tool.\n\nA low emission power system is a fixed cost system. If demand falls off more rapidly from the \u201cconservation first\u201d program and is not compensated for by increased demand for CO2 reduction initiatives then electricity rates will rise to recover the fixed costs on a declining volume of energy sales. Alternatively stranded publicly owned or guaranteed assets can be written off to a tax supported account but that will increase government deficits and debt.\n\nClean Energy Supply\n\nHydroelectric and nuclear generation are best suited for base load demand because of their higher capacity factors and higher fixed costs. If consumers can be incentivized by smart price plans to flatten their hourly load demand then nuclear and hydroelectric generation can meet that additional base load demand at a much lower cost than renewable intermittent sources like wind and solar generation.\n\nA review of jurisdictions around the world demonstrates that low emission power systems all have high hydroelectric penetration, high nuclear penetration or a combination of the two.\n\nWind and solar generation have the highest value when they displace carbon fuels on an interruptible basis (no requirement for dependability or for storage) and they are distributed and located close to the load they serve.\n\nRegional Planning\n\nProvision of infrastructure \u201creserved\u201d areas or corridors as part of the official planning process is important. The provision of energy centers where the population density is high enough can also relieve pressure on the transmission and distribution system. These energy centers can have gas-fired generation that can be used for both power system reserve and to provide local energy security and resiliency following a severe storm.\n\nGas-fired generators used for power system reserve should also be distributed around the province especially in urban areas. High-rise buildings are not inhabitable if power is lost so having access to natural gas fired backup power is important in a world where climate change is projected to progress rapidly.\n\nIndigenous Energy Policy\n\nMany indigenous communities are off-grid and use diesel generators for their electricity needs. These communities could benefit from wind generation with storage, or small hydroelectric or biomass generation if those sources are readily available locally. Each community needs to be assessed individually.\n\nMany indigenous communities do not have the financial or technical capacity to develop their own zero emission energy systems. Some support from the government to make those solutions available and train local residents to participate in the design, construction, and operation of those systems would create badly needed high-value employment.\n\nExtending the transmission system to off-grid communities or alternatively creating a separate regional grid to interconnect the off-grid communities would also help to improve electrical services to those communities.\n\nEngineers should be involved in assisting indigenous communities\u2019 energy planning and implementation\n\nSupply Mix\n\nThe supply mix should be determined and optimized as part of the detailed planning and design process by qualified professional power system engineers. The supply mix should not be determined by the Ministry in advance of the detailed planning process. The Ministry should develop high-level goals for the energy sector and allow detailed planning and design to determine the supply mix and location of that supply. The power system planning must also take into consideration changes in consumer demand and distributed generation that is installed in the distribution system for good economic and environmental reasons.\n\nOverall goals set by the Ministry can be adjusted to reflect analysis performed during the detailed planning and design of the power system.\n\nAPPENDIX A:\n\nPolicy Changes That Could Lower Electricity Bills for Consumers\n\nIESO has reported that in 2015 the power system had a total cost of $20.5 billion. About $13.1 billion was for generation costs and $7.4 billion was for transmission, distribution and other costs. In addition, consumers paid about $1.3 billion dollars in HST after business input tax credits.\n\nResidential consumers in urban areas pay about 19.8 cents\/kWh on average over the whole month (17.5 for electricity and 2.3 for HST). Residential consumers in low-density rural areas pay about 27.5 cents\/kWh on average over the whole month (24.4 for electricity and 3.2 for HST). Average residential customers use about 750 kWh per month so urban consumers pay about $150\/month, low-density rural consumers pay about $200\/month.\n\nMedium sized (Class B) and very large (Class A) businesses can pay additional charges for peak demand capacity and poor power factor. Class A customers can join the Industrial Conservation Incentive (ICI) program and earn discounts by lowering their demand on the highest 5 demand days. On average in 2015 Class A customers achieved a reduction of about 3.6 cents\/kWh over the whole year (businesses receive input tax credits for HST payments so they effectively pay the same HST whether or not HST is charged on their electricity costs).\n\nThe Ontario government plans to remove the PST portion of the HST beginning in January 2017. The PST portion is 8%, the GST portion is 5%. Currently (Nov 2016) the combined PST+GST or HST rate is 13%.\n\nElectricity rates are set in such a way as to recover total costs from the total demand in the system. Different rates apply to different consumer classes. In general regulators try not to transfer costs unfairly between rate classes. North American rules for trading electricity between power systems can affect rates in Ontario. Trading of interruptible electricity is done in the wholesale market at the marginal production cost not the full production cost. Ontario consumers must pay for the difference through what is called the global adjustment in retail rates.\n\nElectricity is currently about 6 times more expensive than the cost of natural gas on an energy content basis in urban areas. Low-density rural areas do not have easy access to natural gas and typically use other carbon-based fuels such as propane. Achieving low emissions across the entire economy will require some migration from higher emission natural gas to lower emission electricity. Unfortunately electricity will not displace natural gas at current retail prices for electricity and natural gas. The difference in price can be reduced by either lowering the price of electricity or by increasing the price of natural gas or a combination of the two.\n\nThere are four ways to reduce the price of electricity for Ontario consumers:\n\nA.Reduce operating costs or increase revenue from the sale of surplus electricity.\n\nB.Move existing costs not directly associated with producing electricity into tax-supported accounts.\n\nC.Transfer market risks from electricity consumers to investors.\n\nD.Remove government sales and water use taxes on electricity.\n\nThere is one way to increase the price of natural gas without imposing costs on the economy:\n\nE.Introduce a tax or price on carbon dioxide emissions but rebate the revenue back to consumers.\n\nA - Options that reduce electricity bills by reducing costs or increasing revenue:\n\nActions to Reduce RatesApprox. SavingsRemarksBackground Notes\n\nA1.Stop adding planned (directed) capacity to an over supplied system.100 M$\/yr in 2017 up to 500 M$\/yr in 2025Excess capacity drives rates up. The savings accumulate yearly until 2025 when\n\nplanned capacity increases stop. Estimate is based on 2,500 MW of excess directed capacity by 2025.The 2008-09 recession, rising electricity rates and conservation programs have permanently changed the demand growth rate. This has not been adequately reflected in planned capacity additions. The recent LRP-II deferral by the government only impacts about 1\/3 of the excess planned (directed) capacity.\n\nA2.Cancel committed capacity contracts that have not been built that have cancellation benefits or that are not in compliance with contractual in-service requirements.200 M$\/yrExcess capacity\n\ndrives rates up. Estimate assumes about 1,000 MW of higher cost committed capacity can be cancelled.Currently we have 8% excess overall capacity. However, what nameplate capacity is cancelled will affect carbon dioxide emissions differently because each technology has a different capacity factor. Nuclear operates at about 85% capacity factor and displaces the most carbon dioxide per kW installed, hydroelectric operates at about 50%, wind operates at about 30% and solar operates at about 15% and displaces the least carbon dioxide per installed kW.\n\nA3.Enter into firm delivery contracts for surplus clean energy supply to adjoining power grids instead of using the wholesale (spot) market for interruptible electricity.0 up to 350 M$\/yrUpper estimate is based on 50% of the 17.3 TWh of surplus clean supply can be sold on a firm basis at $40\/MWh more than the wholesale price for interruptible power.Interruptible power is priced at the marginal cost of production (essentially the fuel cost), uninterruptible power is charged at the full cost of production (includes capacity and labour costs) by agreement in North American. Providing firm clean electricity to adjoining jurisdictions means some of Ontario\u2019s domestic demand will have to be supplied by natural gas generation instead of clean electricity.\n\nA4.Allow Ontario consumers to buy interruptible surplus clean electricity at 1 cent\/kWh like adjoining power grids do on the wholesale (spot) market.0 up to 200 M$\/yReduces consumers\u2019 fossil fuel costs (not their electrical costs). Also reduces CO2 emissions by up to 3 million tonnes\/yr. Estimate based on a 1.2 cent\/kWh price differential between surplus electricity and natural gas at the home.Choosing option A4 exclusively over option A3 indicates that reducing Ontario\u2019s CO2 emissions is a higher priority than reducing electricity rates. Note that item A3 and A4 are mutually exclusive because they use the same energy.\n\nA5.Allow Ontario consumers to buy interruptible surplus natural gas-fired electricity at its marginal fuel cost (approx. 3 cents\/kWh).0 M$\/yr up to 300 M$\/yrWould reduce self-generation by consumers with less efficient fossil fueled equipment. Savings depend on amount of self-generation present in Ontario.Option A5 should only be available to consumers who can demonstrate that they will use the grid supplied gas-fired electricity to achieve lower CO2 emissions compared to their current production practices.\n\nA6.Do not mandate technology choices on the power system. Allow the cap-and-trade program to determine technology choices.$200\/tonne CO2 savings\n\n(annual savings are included in other items in this table)Will lower future costs of reducing carbon emissions from the present $250\/tonne to $50\/tonne by 2025. The $250\/tonne cost is from the Ontario Auditor General 2015 report on the cost of reducing emissions in the electricity sector using renewable energy generating capacity. Trading allowances in a cap-and-trade program effectively allows lower cost carbon reduction technologies to satisfy the emission reduction targets regardless of the sector in which they are installed.\n\nNote: Items A4 and A5 would require a special electricity price plan and smart controllers to correctly enable the energy flow and billing. The special plan should be voluntary for those consumers who have or will purchase the required automation and other equipment to use surplus electricity effectively. The special plan should remain in effect until the equipment capital costs are recovered \u2013 10 years is suggested.\n\nB - Options that reduce electricity bills by moving costs to more appropriate accounts:\n\nActions to Reduce RatesApprox. SavingsRemarksBackground Notes\n\nB1.Adopt the USA approach to subsidizing higher cost clean energy technologies (eg: use tax\n\nrebates not global adjustment to pay for extra costs for renewables). 1,700 M$\/yrEstimate is\n\nbased on 14% additional total costs for renewables in 2017 compared to conventional generation.Using different rules than our NAFTA trade partner USA to subsidize renewable energy development increases electricity costs in Ontario and makes Ontario businesses less competitive. Move those excess costs from the electricity account to a tax supported account.\n\nB2.Write off poor investment decisions in a tax account rather than the electricity account.100 M$\/yrEstimate is based on non-productive costs like gas plant relocation, etc. that are not\n\ncovered in the other items in this list.Consumers should not be expected to pay for planning errors. In private power systems investors pay for those errors. In a public power system the taxpayer should pay for those errors so that electricity rates remain competitive for businesses that compete in the NAFTA trading zone.\n\nB3.Write off surplus capacity costs in a tax supported account rather than the electricity account.1,000 M$\/yr\n\n(850 M$\/yr if option B1 is adopted)Current system has 8% excess installed generating capacity at peak demand. Estimate is based on generation costs only.Consumers should not be expected to pay\n\nfor planning errors. In private power systems investors pay for those errors. In a public power system the taxpayer should pay for those errors so that electricity rates remain competitive for businesses that compete in the NAFTA trading zone.\n\nB4.Remove stranded debt charge from larger electricity consumers.500 M$\/yrEstimate is based on\n\n70 TWh\/yr that is subject to the stranded debt charge of 0.7 cents\/kWh.Consumers should not be expected to pay for planning errors. In private power systems investors pay for those errors. In a public power system the taxpayer should pay for those errors so that electricity rates remain competitive for businesses that compete in the NAFTA trading zone.\n\nB5.Transfer the conservation costs to a tax supported account rather than the electricity account.400 M$\/yrEstimate based on IESO annual budget for conservation.Conservation costs are\n\nnot part of electricity production costs and with surplus capacity this charge in not helping to reduce electricity costs. In fact, conservation costs in the presence of excess capacity actually raises electricity rates.\n\nNote: Ensuring that Ontario businesses are competitive in a free trade zone like NAFTA, CETA or TTP is important so that Ontario does not lose the sales, jobs, employment income and government income tax revenue.\n\nC - Options that reduce electricity bills by transferring risks from consumers to investors:\n\nActions to Reduce RatesApprox. SavingsRemarksBackground Notes\n\nC1.Pay full production costs only for delivered energy to Ontario consumers.0 to 850 M$\/yrThe maximum savings are estimated assuming the excess costs due to take-or-pay provisions in the contracts is 50% of the total production costs on 17.3 TWh of surplus energy.Stop signing take-or-pay contracts at full production costs. Build anticipated curtailment into the contract price so that investors assume the risk of future market demand changes or technology changes. Options C1 and B3 are mutually exclusive. Only the savings for one of the options applies even if both options are adopted.\n\nD - Options that reduce electricity bills by eliminating government sales taxes and water use taxes on electrical energy:\n\nActions to Reduce RatesApprox. BenefitRemarksBackground Notes\n\nD1.Eliminate hydroelectric production tax for water use.400 M$\/yrEstimate based on hydroelectric production of 36.3 TWh and average tax of 1.1 cents\/kWh.Lower tax revenue will impact negatively\n\non Ontario deficits and debt and funding for municipalities near hydroelectric facilities. D2.Eliminate PST on electricity consumption.1,600 M$\/yr and -800 M$\/yr input tax creditAffects provincial tax revenues.Ontario has already announced the elimination of the PST on Jan 1, 2017. This will impact negatively on Ontario\u2019s deficit and debt.\n\nD3.Eliminate GST on electricity consumption.1,000 M$\/yr and -500 M$\/yr input tax creditAffects federal tax revenues.This will impact negatively on federal deficit and debt.\n\nE - Options that increase the price of natural gas (and gas-fired electricity) to effect reductions in carbon dioxide emissions:\n\nActions to Reduce RatesApprox. SavingsRemarksBackground Notes\n\nE1.Introduce a price on carbon dioxide emissions but rebate the cap-and-trade program revenue on a per capita basis to those families with less than $100,000\/yr family income-100 M$\/yr in 2017 to -350 M$\/yr in 2025Higher gas costs will raise the price of electricity for the 10% of electricity produced by natural gas plants. The estimate assumes a carbon price of $15\/tonne in 2017 to $50\/tonne by 2025.\n\nThe estimated $2 billion\/yr in cap-and-trade revenues in the early years will be cost neutral to the economy if the funds are rebated to consumers.Consumers can choose to spend the money on emission reduction technologies to reduce their future carbon emission costs or on general consumer expenditures. Both will result in additional economic activity that will offset reduced economic activity and income tax revenue losses due to the carbon price. Mid and low income consumers are likely to spend most of the refund amounts on consumption rather than saving it. Consequently, refunding the cap-and-trade revenue to consumers is likely to produce similar economic benefits as compared to the government purchasing carbon reduction technologies. Refunding the cap-and-trade revenue will likely give consumers more satisfaction because they can allocate the funds to the highest family needs. Emission reductions could be greater if the government spends the cap-and-trade revenues on the most cost effective carbon reduction technologies.\n\nElectricity Price Impact of CCAP Plan to Deploy Electrical Space Heating\n\nThe government\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) proposes to deploy electric heat pumps for winter space heating. Heat pumps are more efficient than electric resistance heaters but at a higher capital cost. However, installing low-emission electrical capacity to meet the additional demand of space heating in the winter will result in a significant upward pressure on electricity rates. The reason is that electrical capacity dedicated for space heating will operate at approximately 30 to 35% capacity factor rather than the present 65 to 70% capacity factor for the grid overall. During the spring, summer and fall that dedicated capacity will be idle unless we find other uses for the surplus electricity. At half the operating capacity factor the levelized cost of that dedicated capacity will be double the current production costs. That will drive electricity rates higher. Carbon prices will have to be very high, in excess of $600\/tonne at current gas commodity prices to make natural gas retail prices comparable to electricity retail prices in order to displace natural gas in the industrial sector. We can price surplus low emission electricity at its marginal cost of production of about 1 cents\/kWh to encourage displacement of natural gas in various industrial sectors. However, this means most of the production cost of that surplus electricity must still be borne by the electricity consumer. A comprehensive cost study should be undertaken before deploying dedicated electrical capacity to meet the needs of space heating loads. That study should include an hour-by-hour supply and demand simulation analysis of the power system to correctly quantify the amount of surplus low emission electricity that will be created.\n\nSummary\n\nIn 2015 the cost of operating the power system was about $20.5 billion and consumers paid an additional $1.3 billion in HST (after including a business input tax credit estimated at $1.3 billion\/yr). Policy changes can reduce the price of electricity in Ontario to levels that are similar to competing jurisdictions in the NAFTA trading zone. Adjusting for mutually exclusive items the financial implications of adopting all of the proposed policy changes are:\n\nConsumer electricity bill reductions = $5.5 to 6.3 billion\/yr\n\nImpact on provincial government tax revenue = -$1.2 billion\/yr\n\nImpact on federal government tax revenue = -$0.5 billion\/yr\n\nImpact on provincial government revenue due to write-offs and transfers = -$3.6 billion\/yr\n\nTotal impact on provincial government revenues = -$4.8 billion\/yr\n\nTotal impact on federal government revenues = -$0.5 billion\/yr\n\nCap-and-trade discretionary new funding = $2 billion\/yr (based on 2017 carbon price and emissions)\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207183]\n",

When the awareness of the big nuclear waste storage issue hits the news the wave of resistance to nuclear will grow. It is completely unsustainable. nothing could be clearer. And the options for clean energy are growing. Ontario has the chance to shine once again. We can lead the way as we have done with the closing of coal fired plants.\nLook to importing hydro power from Quebec and supporting all renewable options, including new energy storage technologies.\nAnd stop subsidizing businesses' consumption of energy - they should be encouraged to use renewable sources to support their energy use.What about all those flat roofed factories at the edges of Toronto - the perfect location for multiple arrays of solar.\n[Original Comment ID: 206227]\n",

        "comment":"Andrea Pastori\n\nCabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator\n\nMinistry of Energy\n\nStrategic, Network and Agency Policy Division\n\nStrategic Policy and Analytics Branch\n\n77 Grenville Street, Floor 6th\n\nToronto, Ontario, M7A 2C1\n\nIt is with great pleasure I write in response to the Ministry of Energy\u2019s discussion guide: Planning Ontario\u2019s Energy Future about Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP).\u00a0 In reviewing the broad spectrum of guiding questions in the guide, ClimateActionWR has identified four priority areas for the LTEP that would address needs and concerns we see in the community of Waterloo Region. These priority areas are: i) conservation and demand management, ii) local, renewable energy supply, iii) innovation and, iv) communication.\n\nFirst some background on our own project: ClimateActionWR focuses on supporting actions and developing new opportunities that will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at a local scale in the community of Waterloo Region. Led by REEP Green Solutions and Sustainable Waterloo Region, ClimateActionWR supports the implementation of the Climate Action Plan for Waterloo Region. The community Climate Action Plan set a community-wide greenhouse gas reduction target of 6% by 2020, a target that would be best supported by a LTEP for Ontario that makes greenhouse gas reductions a priority in energy supply, distribution and use and prioritizes local investment in achieving such reductions.\n\nConservation and Demand Management\n\nAs our provincial electricity supply shifts away from fossil fuel based sources, it will become an imperative to focus on conservation targets for our other fuel types including natural gas, oil, and propane.\u00a0 As such, a critical first step will be to set conservation targets for these fuel types, and provide either the financial mechanisms (carrot) or legislative requirements (stick) to ensure that service providers achieve these targets.\u00a0 In addition, it will become increasingly necessary to balance the scope of any conservation and demand management (CDM) efforts so that they support all sectors: industrial, commercial, institutional and residential.\n\nIn electrical CDM plans, we are seeing an increasing emphasis on servicing the largest industrial, commercial and institutional customers with incentive programs because it is currently the most cost effective way to deliver demand reductions.\u00a0 This approach has left residential customers with fewer incentives available to them, and as electricity costs rise, it becomes increasingly difficult to offset those rising costs with a corresponding investment in energy efficiency in homes. To overcome this, we recommend that the Ministry of Energy alongside the IESO, consider resuming sector specific targets for conservation, so that our local distribution companies (LDCs) are able to invest in innovative programs for all sectors.\n\nWe recognize the importance of emphasizing \u201cConservation First\u201d under the new framework of the IESO \u2013 we undoubtedly need substantial reduction in overall demand to support our growing population with our existing generation capacity.\u00a0 However, this emphasis appears to have come at the cost of considering the power of shifting demand as a mechanism to reduce cost as well as the greenhouse gases generated by natural gas during peak hours.\u00a0 We recommend resuming targets and financial support for LDCs to support demand shift amongst their customers.\u00a0 Moreover, we are encouraged by recent announcements about the expansion of the Industrial Conservation Initiative to include 1MW customers and expand the number of sectors eligible for this program.\u00a0 We encourage this effort, and suggest opening the program to all customers who have a demand of 1MW or more regardless of sector.\n\nFinally, in the areas of conservation and demand management, we want to emphasize two systematic barriers to the uptake and success of CDM programs.\u00a0 First, the environmental attributes section of legal agreements between the IESO or LDCs and their customers has proven to be a deterrent for some consumers.\u00a0 In its current form, this language suggests that the IESO or LDC would gain the associated benefits (be it cap and trade or tax benefits) for any greenhouse gas reductions that result from the project, regardless of what proportion of the project was funded through these entities.\u00a0 We recommend reviewing and clarifying this language, and consider allocating any benefits based on the proportion of the project funded. \u00a0 Second, we ask that the Ministry of Energy carefully consider ways to mitigate the inherent conflict of interest that occurs when a utility provider is asked to focus on conservation and demand management. For any business, it would be difficult to grapple with a mandate to reduce the amount of your own product that is used by a customer, and it is no different for our local utilities.\n\nLocal, Renewable Energy Supply\n\nWhen considering the future of our provincial grid, we want to emphasize the importance of resiliency.\u00a0 In particular, resiliency of a grid can be support by an increased concentration on local, renewable generation.\u00a0 To support this, we recommend the Ministry of Energy improves the ease of access to the grid for residents, businesses and institutions through simplified net-metering or \u2018virtual\u2019 net-metering processes.\u00a0 Moreover, we support the Ministry\u2019s continued investment and support for Community Energy Planning (CEP) through project funding.\u00a0 We encourage the Ministry to look for ways to provide deeper support to communities once their CEP is developed so that they are able to implement these plans. Such an investment may include seed funding, or loan guarantees to cover the risks of community owned small to mid-sized energy projects. Finally, placing emphasis on renewable generation for any growth in our base-level demand must be a continued priority for the Ministry of Energy and, as such, we advocate for the renewal of the Large Renewable Procurement Program.\n\nInnovation\n\nTo succeed in our local, provincial, national and international long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals we will require innovation.\u00a0 As such, we support investment in innovation.\u00a0 However, such an investment should not be limited to technical innovation; in many areas we need an equal, or perhaps larger, focus on social innovation. \u00a0 Three particular areas have been discussed in our community with regards to innovation: thermal energy, energy storage, and energy benchmarking. First, we see the need to investigate the development of a thermal grid and utility provider, to support the sharing of heat waste in communities.\u00a0 Such a development requires a large paradigm shift in how we think about supplying heat to our communities.\u00a0 Secondly, in order to achieve reliability and resilience in our grid we see the need to invest in research and community projects for renewable energy storage.\u00a0 Finally, we encourage the Ministry of Energy to continue its pursuit of energy benchmarking for all buildings.\u00a0 Overall, what we have observed in our community is that the technical solutions are available, but the success of our initiatives depends on uptake by citizens and business, and we need creative ways to engage them. Therefore, social innovation must be a priority for investment in innovation.\n\nCommunication\n\nAs a broad final comment, we want to stress the importance of providing clarity and guidance around the issue of fuel switching.\u00a0 We feel that the Ministry of Energy is in a strong position to influence communication around this issue.\u00a0 In particular, we still see low level of energy literacy amongst the broader community, which makes it difficult to have conversations about fuel switching.\u00a0 For example, residents and businesses in our community have been encouraged to move their heating systems off of electricity and toward natural gas for over a decade.\u00a0 It will take some substantial and well-guided work to re-educate the public about the benefits of switching in the opposite direction. We encourage the Ministry to take a stance on this issue, and clearly communicate the benefits and costs to businesses and residents.\n\nWe thank you for your time and consideration in reviewing these comments and look forward to seeing a new LTEP from the Ministry of Energy that that makes greenhouse gas reductions a priority in energy supply, distribution and use while also prioritizing local investment in achieving such reductions.\n\nSincerely,\n\nClimateActionWR Plan Manager\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207187]\n",

It was founded in 1986, and focuses exclusively on the business issues of independent power producers (IPPs) in Ontario. Its 22 generator member companies build, own and operate independent power projects in Ontario, across Canada and elsewhere in the world, and produce a little less than half of Ontario's electricity from clean and renewable resources including co-generation, hydro-electric, natural gas, nuclear, wind, wood waste, and solar energy. APPrO\u2019s membership includes generators, marketers, contractors, equipment suppliers, consultants, local distribution companies, fuel suppliers, service providers and financiers. Its goal is the achievement of an economically and environmentally sustainable electricity sector in Ontario that supports the business interests of electricity generators, ratepayers and the provincial economy. APPrO plays a leadership role in the formation of electricity policy and rules to facilitate investment in sustainable electricity infrastructure and the clear and transparent pricing of electricity in Ontario.\n\nAPPrO\u2019s comments are designed to open discussion and strengthen parts of Ontario\u2019s electricity planning outlook that have been left unaddressed or unresolved within the OPO and LTEP, to fill in certain details and contribute to improving clarity in the underlying assumptions.\n\nAPPrO\u2019s comments reflect its view that a \u201csecure, reliable supply and the ability to operate effectively in the markets should be the objectives of any supply portfolio for Ontario\u2026in serving these objectives, the principles of robustness, flexibility and balance should be advocated.\u201d\n\nOne fact about planning that is universally accepted is that it is the planning that is important, not necessarily the plan itself. Unforeseen events arise, things change. A fundamental requirement therefore is that the plan should be a robust assessment of the expected supply-demand case over the forecast period with the consideration of potential variations in to the supply and demand using proven and accepted methodologies. APPrO submits that the plan should focus on obtaining the best price for power over the long run for ratepayers while maintaining sufficient optionality (i.e., having more rather than fewer options) to deal with unforeseen events and issues. As the IESO noted during the IPSP process (itself the victim of unforeseen changes) \u201cOntario will now have its peak demands in the same season as the major adjacent markets\u2026 We cannot assume that they will be available to make up Ontario's shortfalls when we experience extreme temperatures.\u201d\n\nSummary of APPrO Recommendations on LTEP\n\n1. Minimize long-term electricity costs by:\n\na)Maximizing the economic use of existing resources\n\nb)Committing to long-term, transparent, stable, independent governance of the electricity system designed to maximize the effectiveness of market functions and competition amongst resource options;\n\nc)Conducting a full independent cost-benefit analysis of all major planning commitments and disclosing the analysis as part of the LTEP; and\n\nd)Preparing fully developed contingency plans specifying where and how additional capacity would\n\nbe procured in the event that either supply or demand does not materialize according to the projections outlined in the IESO\u2019s scenarios.\n\n2. Establish firm and comprehensive standards of transparency\n\nWhen major supply agreements are under consideration, the proposed procurement mechanisms should be fully disclosed well in advance, and the methods for comparison of costs and market impacts, and reliability impacts, fully shared with all market participants and stakeholders.\u00a0 The methods and standards for ensuring this kind of transparency should form a key part of the LTEP.\n\n3. Independent oversight and improved governance of the IESO\n\nAPPrO supports stronger governance for the IESO that brings it in line with other similar organizations across North America.\n\nKey Questions to Address in the LTEP\n\nAs APPrO and other stakeholders have reviewed the OPO and LTEP discussion materials, key questions have emerged.\u00a0 Many generators are concerned that crucial questions remain unresolved.\u00a0 For example:\n\n\u2022Has the OPO identified and quantified all relevant risks?\n\n\u2022Has the OPO formulated and critically compared all the realistic options available to manage risks?\n\n\u2022Considering the pace of change apparent in the energy sector, does the plan identify sufficient flexibility mechanisms and specific contingency options to respond to the various types of change? \u2022Does the approach meet the standards of best practice evident in the tools used by other jurisdictions, organizations and institutions (e.g., complete and widely available data, open and transparent examination and assessment)?\n\n\u2022Has the LTEP been designed to be resilient to changes of Government, built to endure and maximize the degree of predictability for consumers and investors?\n\nThe case can be made that the LTEP needs to be structured such that reasonably clear and positive responses to each of these questions are available to consumers, stakeholders, and concerned observers.\n\nThe Primacy of Cost Minimization\n\nIt is abundantly clear that electricity prices have emerged as a central public policy issue in Ontario.\u00a0 Premier Kathleen Wynne, speaking at the Canadian Club on December 13 stated that, \"I have committed to finding more ways to lower rates and reduce the burden on households in the weeks and months ahead.\"\n\nElectricity rates are determined by a combination of short- and long-term factors.\u00a0 The most effective approaches for minimizing the growth electricity rates are those that address the full range of causes, recognizing that the greatest impact is likely to be available from finding efficiencies in long-run capital costs, and continuing to drive for efficiencies and excellence in operating cost. We believe opportunities exist to further encourage operational efficiencies in the system through a combination of incentive regulation, consolidation in the LDC sector, competitive forces, and increased focus by market participants on both costs and customer service.\n\nAPPrO and others have in many instances recommended that the Ontario Government seek to minimize long-term capital costs by:\n\na) Ensuring that new procurement is conducted on an open, competitive market basis, to the greatest extent possible; and\n\nb) Ensuring that the electricity system as a whole is governed by a transparent, rules-based framework, minimizing factors that could lessen competition or lead to an un-level playing field for any entity, and avoiding decisions that could increase uncertainty or lead to sudden changes in direction.\n\nAlthough the current OPO and LTEP indicate that Ontario is not facing an immediate shortage of energy or capacity, there are periods in the near future where capacity shortages are entirely possible.\n\nIt is therefore not just prudent but highly important that the Province, as part of its LTEP, take clear and definitive steps to ensure the availability of required capacity at the most attractive long-term prices.\u00a0 If the Province postpones securing these options until the need is more certain, it will almost certainly be more difficult and more expensive to meet the power system\u2019s needs at that time.\n\nAPPrO has therefore recommended that the IESO in its implementation of the LTEP include fully developed contingency plans specifying where and how additional capacity could be procured in the event that either supply or demand does not materialize according to the projections outlined within the IESO\u2019s scenarios as described within the OPO.\u00a0 In the absence of prior arrangements resulting from contingency planning, the most attractive, technically robust and economic options may simply not exist.\n\nWhat options are available to planners and policy makers to reduce the long-term costs of energy for consumers?\n\n\u2022Facilitating private sector investment, especially long-term commitments. This is important because longer term investments can achieve better costs of capital and other efficiencies, which are a primary component of electricity rates.\n\n\u2022Maximizing system diversity and balance, both geographic and in generation types in an economic fashion. Diversity reduces both costs and risks as different types of supply have distinct capabilities for responding efficiently to specific circumstances. In this vein, recognize that nuclear power, hydroelectric and gas-fired generation will continue to play a critical role in power system reliability for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u2022Establishing firm and comprehensive standards of transparency. Suggested approaches are detailed below.\n\n\u2022Reducing the scope for and likelihood of out-of-market actions, sudden or unexpected policy reversals, one of the most significant causes of avoidable cost increases.\n\n\u2022Establishing rigorous and regularly updated tests of the costs and benefits of all sources of generation.\u00a0 Any major new planning or contractual commitments should be consistently based on objective economic and reliability criteria, and if contract renewal is not offered in the future, effective mechanisms to ensure revenue certainty must be sufficiently developed and workable. \u2022Reconsidering decisions relating to the allocation of free allowances to generators under Ontario\u2019s cap-and-trade program, which are likely to have a direct bearing on market prices for electricity.\n\n\u2022Ensuring full public consultation on the LTEP, and making adjustments to the plan based on such consultation, to reduce the likelihood of subsequent changes which can be costly.\n\nA Principled Approach to Planning Is Required\n\nIn order to address the key questions noted above, APPrO believes that a pragmatic approach to planning is necessary.\u00a0 The 2013 LTEP was designed to balance five principles: cost effectiveness; reliability; clean energy; community engagement; and, an emphasis on conservation and demand management (CDM) before building new generation.\u00a0 Development of the next LTEP should also be guided by a similar set of principles that should appropriately be revised from the 2013 principles in order to reflect changes in the direction of the energy sector.\u00a0 For example, the LTEP should seek to strike a balance regarding maintaining security and reliability of supply, minimizing cost to customer, transparency, flexibility, increased electrification, GHG reduction, social equity and cost, and meeting other public policy objectives, etc.\n\nAPPrO Recommendations\n\nRecommendation 1a: Maximize Use of Existing Resources with Contingency Planning and\/or Bridging Program\n\nIn accordance with the Ontario Government\u2019s climate change plans and maintenance of system reliability, the LTEP needs to support an optimized solution which maximizes the use of existing energy infrastructure while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\u00a0 Prior to making commitments to new generation that could be costly and may not provide as much flexibility, considerations with respect to leveraging existing generation facilities should be made.\n\nAPPrO believes there needs to be a bridge contract program if electricity ratepayers are to benefit further from existing facilities.\u00a0 Inaction will undoubtedly cost ratepayers more for \u201cnew steel in the ground\u201d otherwise.\n\nIn general, Ontario\u2019s planning approach does not respond in any concrete way to the increasing level of supply uncertainty and risk.\u00a0 Normally, a plan that foresees increasing levels of risk and uncertainty would provide mechanisms for increased flexibility and quick response capability, as well as alternative scenarios to consider in the event of unexpected developments.\n\nWithout revenue certainty, existing generation after contract term expiry\/close to or at end-of-life will be hard pressed to remain in-service.\u00a0 Generation facilities that do remain in-service will likely need to find additional value outside of the current electricity sector framework in Ontario (e.g., through bilateral agreements, export opportunities, etc.) and\/or will demand sufficient market revenues (which will likely need to take the form of revenues from multiple electricity products (e.g., energy, capacity, ancillary services, where applicable environmental attributes, and potentially new products not yet defined) to continue operations. Many Non-Utility Generators (NUG) facilities with expired contracts have already closed.\n\nRecommendation 1b: Maximizing the effectiveness of market functions and integration of LTEP and IESO\u2019s Market Renewal Initiative\n\nIn March 2016, the IESO launched the Market Renewal Initiative, indicating an intention to explore future changes to Ontario\u2019s wholesale electricity market.\u00a0 A primary objective of this initiative is to improve market efficiency and transparency.\u00a0 The LTEP planning process should reflect the same high standards of transparency and in fact be integrated with the Market Renewal Initiative process.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy has indicated conceptual support for the initial direction of the IESO\u2019s Market Renewal Initiative, as evident by Minister Thibeault\u2019s remarks at the APPrO annual banquet on November 15 and then at the November 28 Empire Club of Canada luncheon.\n\nAPPrO continues to support initiatives aimed at increasing efficiency and transparency in the operation and investment in Ontario\u2019s electricity market.\u00a0 APPrO therefore supports the IESO\u2019s Market Renewal Initiative in principle with the recognition of these concerns:\n\n\u2022Ensuring contract and commercial continuity;\n\n\u2022Improved transparency and openness;\n\n\u2022Full cost-benefit analysis; and\n\n\u2022Stronger governance for the IESO that brings it in-line with other similar organizations across North America.\n\nIf the intention is for markets to have greater relevance and if generators and others are to have sufficient confidence in the markets both for commercial continuity related to current assets and to guide future investment, then the IESO\u2019s Market Renewal Initiative needs to demonstrate that it will objectively make fact-based decisions.\u00a0 Like every other successful market, this will involve checks and balances and independent decision making criteria.\u00a0 APPrO therefore notes the following recommendations with respect to procurement of resources, which should be reflected in the LTEP and within the Market Renewal Initiative:\n\n1.There should be many mechanisms in the IESO\u2019s \u2018tool kit\u2019 regarding how resources are procured or secured, with a recognition that not one mechanism could satisfy all resource and generation fuel types.\n\n2.Despite the mechanism or mechanisms selected for resource procurement, what is important is revenue certainty over the relevant contract period.\u00a0 There is currently a great deal of uncertainty as to future revenue sources anticipated under the LTEP.\u00a0 Both new and existing generation resources will require revenue certainty in order to ensure availability of resources to help meet Ontario\u2019s future reliability and power system needs.\n\nFurthermore, there is a fundamental disconnect in the current logic in the LTEP behind the security of future supply from generators with expiring contracts.\u00a0 Through the market renewal initiative, the IESO has indicated its expectation that a competitive capacity market of some kind will secure capacity from these generators at a cost significantly less than CONE and realize savings for the ratepayer. This is reflected in the economics of the long term cost of electricity in the OPO. At the same time the Government wishes to reserve the right to acquire energy and capacity it deems economic outside of this market and to make policy changes that would affect this capacity market at will. These out-of-market actions make accurate forecasting of generator revenues extremely difficult if not impossible. Investors will not extend the operation of existing assets beyond their contract term without revenue certainty. Thus, the expectation of savings in securing capacity is unlikely to be realized as forecast revenues from other sources will need to be significantly discounted.\n\nRecommendation 1c: Full Cost-Benefit Analysis of all Planning Commitments\n\nIn a situation of heightened attention to electricity prices and rising costs to electricity customers, it is crucial that the Province and stakeholders within the electricity sector be able to make informed judgments on the cost implications of planning commitments.\n\nIt is therefore APPrO\u2019s central recommendation that a full and independent cost-benefit analysis is performed on each major planning commitment entailed in the LTEP, and that the assumptions, methodology and calculations are released for public review along with the proposed details of the LTEP.\u00a0 It is appropriate that a plan like the LTEP should establish standards for performing such cost-benefit analyses, timelines and how such analyses will be used at various points during the timeframe of the plan.\n\nAny decision to rely on imports as an alternative to generation based in Ontario should also be contingent on rigorous cost benefit analysis.\n\nRecommendation 1 d: Preparing Fully Developed Contingency Plans\n\nStrengthening the Data and Analysis in the OPO\n\nA primary concern noted by APPrO members is the nature of the data collected for use in the planning process. For example, Power Advisory LLC has noted that, \u201cThe OPO lacks sufficient assessment of future risks and accompanied contingencies to mitigate and address these risks. Unfortunately, the OPO is not a rigorous Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) and does not utilize sophisticated methodologies and techniques used to determine power system needs along with the capabilities and cost effectiveness of resource options to potentially meet these needs, as is done within other IRPs or within all U.S. wholesale capacity markets. \u2026 The IESO\u2019s OPO only provides a forward view of potential demand outlooks with a single supply outlook that may or may not meet Ontario\u2019s future power system needs.\u201d (Power Advisory Market Update, October 2016.)\n\nAs noted by Dianne Saxe,\u00a0 the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, the current public consultation is taking place on a discussion guide and general scenarios, rather than on the specific options to be proposed as part of the LTEP.\n\nOne of the Environmental Commissioner\u2019s recommendations is that details need to be provided \u201cto hedge against \u2026 energy supply risks.\u201d Although the Commissioner\u2019s report focuses on the risks associated with one type of generation, her comments apply across the board to all types of generation. She observes that, \u201cThere needs to be a serious contingency plan and there should be public consultation on that contingency plan.\u201d\n\nConsidering that the central objective is to achieve a more effective, reliable and cost efficient system, more analysis than has been presented to date including cost, reliability, environmental and risk impacts, is appropriate as part of any planning process. A high level of rigour is appropriate when major decisions are being made.\n\nImportance of Separating Strategic Choices from Demand Projections\n\nThe OPO presents four primary scenarios that appear to conflate demand projections with strategic choices.\u00a0 The alternative courses of action or strategic choices available to Ontario have not been clearly defined or separated from demand projections.\u00a0 The scenarios presented in the OPO are primarily demand projections which provide only a portion of the information necessary for comparing alternative courses of action.\u00a0 Ideally, planning is intended to enable choices to be made amongst alternative courses of action, having ensured that participants are well informed with respect to projected conditions.\n\nAlthough there are many ways to characterize the range of choices available to the Province, in order to compare options, it\u2019s necessary to formulate representative alternative courses of action. As an example of alternative courses of action, the key strategic options could be summarized as: 1. Priorization of long-term cost reduction.\n\n2. Priorization of carbon reduction, with electrification used to reduce carbon from transportation and building sectors.\n\n3. Priorization of wholesale market development as to be defined within the IESO\u2019s Market Renewal Initiative, facilitation of price-based competition for wider range of resources, elimination of impediments to consumer choice amongst alternative supply options.\n\n4. Priorization of innovation including smart grid, consumer enablement, micro-grid, Small Modular Reactors, demand-response, and distributed energy resource technologies.\n\nWhile stark choices between the above listed alternatives 1 to 4 are not required, it is useful in a planning process to establish a sense as to the relative priority to be placed on cost reduction, carbon reduction, wholesale market development, technology innovation, and possibly other priorities.\u00a0 Planning options can be constructed with various relative rankings of these priorities.\u00a0 Other potential planning priorities include short-term cost reduction, flexibility\/responsiveness, mitigation of environmental impact however defined, equity between regions, customer classes and with Aboriginal communities.\n\nAlthough net supply and demand projections are affected by strategic choices like these, the underlying levels of supply and demand (i.e., gross demand prior to load reduction) can be projected independent of these prioritizations.\n\nThe major alternative directional choices to be made in Ontario include the following:\n\n\u2022Supply Mix influence: How much influence to accord to pre-determined supply mix parameters? \u2022Supply Mix definition: Should supply mix be defined in terms of specific supply alternatives or in terms of performance characteristics, or some combination of the two?\n\n\u2022Carbon reduction targets: To what extent should annual carbon reduction targets be treated as obligatory?\n\n\u2022Electrification of transportation and buildings: One of the most promising strategies for simultaneously prompting new investment, encouraging innovation and reducing carbon emissions is to provide for increasing levels of electrification, particularly in buildings and transportation. Although there may be cost challenges to overcome in some types of electrification, electrified services are likely to be much more precisely controllable, thereby attracting retail consumer interest, while simultaneously helping the Ontario grid to mitigate the challenge of Surplus Baseload Generation and enabling the most comprehensive options for decarbonisation of the economy as a whole.\n\n\u2022Further reliance on markets and development of competitive systems or further reliance on central administration.\n\n\u2022Accommodating the growth of micro-grids, self-supply, storage and other forms of active distribution load reduction including the Distributed Energy Resource Tariff.\n\n\u2022Stance with respect to imports and exports: does the Province wish to encourage electricity trade with other provinces and states only as far as economic as competitive forces would dictate, or is it willing to make investments in order to expand electricity trade further for other reasons? \u2022Maximizing the value derived from existing assets: perhaps most important, to what extent and under what conditions is the Province prepared to consider incremental investments in existing capacity in order to ensure it derives the maximum value of existing investments before making new investments?\u00a0 How is analysis of these considerations to be factored into assessments of alternative planning options?\n\nSupply Risk\n\nThe diversity of existing Ontario generation, including nuclear, hydro-electric and gas-fired, and other forms of generation, with wide geographic distribution represent a sturdy \u2018backbone\u2019 to the Ontario grid.\u00a0 Together these resources generate dependable and relatively affordable power, while meeting all-of-Ontario and regional supply needs, with significantly lower GHGs than ten years ago. In fact, Ontario\u2019s electricity sector emissions are now a relatively minor contributor to the Province\u2019s carbon footprint. The IESO notes that \u201cGHG emissions from the electricity sector now make up roughly only 4% of the province\u2019s total emissions.\u201d\n\nThe OPO performs limited assessment of supply-side risk over the planning period and does not attempt to describe the type of future supply requirements that Ontario may need (e.g., energy, capacity, ancillary services, etc.).\u00a0 Instead of assessing supply-side risks and describing alternative supply outlooks, the OPO abruptly concludes that in the near term no new supply resources are required based on existing generation and the ability to repower all resources after end-of-contract or end-of-life.\n\nHowever, there is no assurance that the generation associated with expiring contracts will be available as shown in the OPO. For each major type of generation on which the plan relies, there should be an impartial assessment as to the risks of unavailability of that capacity, or performance below planned levels. To the extent this risk is significant, contingency plans to substitute for that capacity should also be part of the plan. In the case of Non-Utility Generation contracts for example, many are due to expire in the near future. In fact, more than 300 MW is liable to be shut down by 2019 unless there is a bridging program, with another 200 MW potentially going out of service by 2022.\n\nThe OPO contains no details about the nature of any future procurement of resources.\u00a0 Although the industry has no shortage of expertise, creativity and access to capital with respect to making new investments, given the current lack of clarity on procurement processes, even the investment necessary to maintain existing assets becomes risky and less dependable.\n\nOver the 2020s and into the 2030s, the majority of contracts for generators will expire and presently there is no clear path for contract renewal or certainty that an alternate market mechanism will be successfully implemented in order to provide needed revenue certainty.\u00a0 Lack of revenue certainty for generation under expired contracts will increase the cost of maintaining or re-powering existing generation facilities or lead some generation facilities to be laid up, mothballed, or even fully retire.\u00a0 Establishing clarity and stability in terms of commitment to existing contracts increases predictability and thereby reduces costs.\n\nRecommendation 2: Establishing Firm and Comprehensive Standards of Transparency\n\nTransparency is a basic requirement for any power system planning or for the IESO\u2019s Market Renewal Initiative. Confidence in the plans and the energy market depends on availability of data at all stages of development and operation of power sector assets. With respect to the LTEP, it is important to ensure there is sector-wide confidence in the adequacy of the assumptions and the comparisons between planning options.\n\nOne crucial standard of transparency could be stated as follows.\u00a0 When major supply agreements are under consideration, the proposed requirements and procurement mechanisms should be fully disclosed well in advance, and the methods for comparison of costs, market impacts, and reliability impacts, must be fully available to all market participants and stakeholders.\u00a0 The methods and standards for ensuring this kind of transparency should form a key part of the LTEP.\u00a0 Transparency should also apply to the contracting process and any other potential new processes to secure supply resources. Going forward, such concepts as open-book contracts might be considered.\n\nRecommendation 3: Establish independent oversight and improved governance of the IESO\n\nIn order to manage risk and maximize confidence in the LTEP, it is important that it be constructed in a way to ensure that the basic tenets of the plan are relatively unlikely to be fundamentally disturbed by any future change in Government.\n\nAPPrO also supports stronger governance for the IESO that brings it in-line with other similar organizations across North America, especially given the potentially significant work being proposed under the IESO\u2019s Market Renewal Initiative.\u00a0 APPrO has on many occasions requested the IESO to consider governance reforms.\u00a0 This is informed by its members\u2019 participation in energy markets throughout North America.\u00a0 Ontario is an outlier in North America in its lack of oversight over IESO practices.\u00a0 However, Ontario is not New York or like other U.S. wholesale markets, and our constitutional, legal and regulatory systems are quite different from those in the U.S.\u00a0 Hence, simply importing what appears to work in U.S. markets without considering and understanding the relationship between U.S. markets and their systems of governance will likely not lead to improvement.\u00a0 However, it is instructive to note that where markets do work in the U.S., it is in large part because there are stronger independent oversight mechanisms at work, such as the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, independent market monitors, and so forth.\n\nFindings of a 2011 report\u00a0 titled \u201cGuidelines for Governance of the Electricity Sector in Canada\u201d further support APPrO\u2019s recommendation for independent oversight of the IESO.\u00a0 The central finding of the report was \u201cthe best way to run the energy sector is for government to take a hands-off approach.\u201d\u00a0 The report also recommended that the principle of independence of agency decision-making should be formally stated in legislation.\n\nIn a recent submission to the IESO, one of APPrO\u2019s members reiterated \u201c\u2026the importance of a reliable, impartial, independent, and transparent governance process to oversee future market evolution, decision-making, and dispute resolution.\u00a0 The IESO\u2019s [Market Renewal Initiative] would not only require multiple years to define and implement, its resulting market rules\u2019 fine-tuning and further development would also remain ever-evolving and increasingly complex.\u00a0 In this setting, disputes and conflicts would inevitably arise, not only between participant and participant, participant-and-the-IESO, but also between market-and-market.\u00a0 Credible governance that holds the confidence of all stakeholders is key to prevent undue external interference on market rules and thus efficient outcomes... [we urge] the IESO to consider the question of governance seriously in its initiative.\u201d\n\nThis could include changes to legislation to improve IESO independence, and to limit the ability of government to provide more than general policy direction and goals.\n\nIn general the investment community believes that costs will be minimized to the extent that government becomes less involved in specific decision-making and increasingly delegates decisions lower on the hierarchy to those most directly affected. This is not in any way a suggestion that government refrain from making policy but that its policy decisions be carefully designed to be durable and implemented at the most appropriate level.\n\nSummary of APPrO Recommendations on LTEP\n\n1. Minimize long-term electricity costs by:\n\ne)Maximize the economic use of existing resources\n\nf)Commit to long-term, transparent, stable, independent governance of the electricity system designed to maximize the effectiveness of market functions and competition amongst resource options;\n\ng)Conduct full independent cost-benefit analysis of all major planning commitments and disclosing the analysis as part of the LTEP; and\n\nh)Prepare well developed contingency plans specifying where and how additional capacity would be procured in the event that either supply or demand does not materialize according to the projections outlined in the IESO\u2019s scenarios.\n\n2. Establish firm and comprehensive standards of transparency.\n\nWhen major supply agreements are under consideration, the proposed technical requirements and procurement mechanisms should be fully disclosed well in advance, and the methods for comparison of costs and market impacts, and reliability impacts, fully shared with all market participants and stakeholders.\u00a0 The methods and standards for ensuring this kind of transparency should form a key part of the LTEP.\n\n3. Independent oversight and improved governance of the IESO.\n\nAPPrO recommends stronger governance for the IESO that brings it more in line with other similar organizations across North America.\n\nAPPrO appreciates being invited to provide input on the LTEP and trusts that the comments and proposals provided are received with the understanding of the objective of improving the plan to secure the most reliable, robust, and cost effective plan with the flexibility to address changes in supply or demand that might arise over the forecast period.\n\nDavid Butters\n\nPresident & CEO\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207189]\n",

        "comment":"Andrea Pastori\n\nCabinet Liaison and Strategic Policy Coordinator\n\nMinistry of Energy\n\n77 Grenville Street, Floor 6th\n\nToronto Ontario \u00a0 M7A 2C1\n\nRE:\u00a0 EBR Registry Number: 012-8840 Planning Ontario's Energy Future\n\nDear Ms. Pastori.\n\nOn behalf of Goldcorp, thank you for this opportunity to share a few recommendations in support of Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan.\n\nGoldcorp is one of the world\u2019s largest senior gold producers and represents more than half of the annual gold production in Ontario.\u00a0 We employ approximately 3,000 people in Ontario at 3 mining operations and a project, along with a corporate office in downtown Toronto.\u00a0 Goldcorp continues to invest in the Province - we\u2019re developing the Borden Gold Project in Chapleau and we recently announced the potential of a new, large scale open-pit mine in Timmins.\n\nOur mines in Ontario compete for capital with other jurisdictions around the world.\u00a0 When evaluating the attractiveness of a jurisdiction, the common measure is the All-In-Sustaining-Cost (\u201cAISC\u201d) per ounce.\u00a0 Goldcorp mines in Ontario tend to have a higher AISC than some of our mines in Latin America but other factors like land tenure, the availability of skills and a stable government and political climate continue to make Ontario an attractive jurisdiction within which to make investments and do business.\u00a0 However, for the sake of continued reinvestment in Ontario, it\u2019s critical we do everything we can to reduce or at least maintain our AISC. \u00a0 The escalating cost of energy in Ontario will pose a problem to future investment in large, energy intensive industrial facilities.\u00a0 Though we remain committed to Ontario so we\u2019re pleased to share recommendations that we hope will help to preserve the competitiveness of mining in Ontario.\n\nGoldcorp\u2019s energy summary in Ontario\n\n\u2022Energy represents ~ 12% of our total production cost in Ontario.\n\n\u2022Between Red Lake Gold Mines (RLGM), Porcupine Gold Mines (PGM) and Musselwhite Mine (MWM), Goldcorp consumes ~ 600,000 MWh per year and paid more than $50 M for electricity in 2015 (average rate ~$85\/MWh though one of our facilities pays $40\/MWh)\n\n\u2022In total, the Global Adjustment represents 50% of our electricity cost or roughly $25 M per year.\n\n\u2022Between 2012 and 2016, Goldcorp\u2019s nominal cost of power has increased by over 30%. \u2022Between 2013 and 2015, Goldcorp\u2019s Musselwhite mine reduced GHG emissions by 20,000 tCO2e \/ year and energy consumption by 100,000 MWh\/year through conservation and phasing out diesel generation.\n\n\u2022All three sites take advantage of the Northern Industrial Electricity Rebate program which reduces the cost of electricity by $20\/MWh though we go above our allocation so not every MWh consumed receives the rebate.\n\n\u2022All three sites employ an energy manager through the IESO Industrial Accelerator Program. \u2022Goldcorp\u2019s Borden Gold Project (Borden) represents the \u2018mine of the future\u2019 where low carbon energy technologies, digitization, and a focus on partnership and consultation with local communities underpins the viability, sustainability and profitability of a mine. Importantly, Borden is poised to become the first battery powered all-electric mining operation in Canada. Recommendations\n\n1.A low industrial rate\n\nWe recommend the Ministry maintain an Industrial Electricity Incentive (IEI) like program to provide the price certainty and low rate required to attract large capital investments.\u00a0 The importance of long term certainty cannot be overstated since investment decisions made today don\u2019t result in energy consumed until more than 5 years from now.\u00a0 An IEI type program would benefit projects like Borden Gold Project in Chapleau which is set to become the first all-electric underground mine in Ontario and will create jobs in a region where they are badly in need an economic boost.\u00a0 Also, a conceptual study of a \u2018Dome Century Project\u2019 in Timmins is underway to test the potential of a new, large-scale open pit mine in Timmins.\u00a0 Dome Century would be a huge consumer of electricity and would be a massive win for the community considering the town\u2019s economy has recently been contracting.\u00a0 To illustrate the importance of a low price, consider a highly automated and large industrial electric open-pit complex with a demand load profile of 60 MW coming online in 2022, like the potential open pit.\u00a0 If in 2022 the NIER program is fully subscribed and load shedding for an enormous gold processing facility is not an option and electricity customers pay the full price of carbon, the price of electricity will be a significant deterrent to the planned Dome Century Project.\u00a0 We expect the price in 2022 could reasonably reach $150\/MWh or more- $80\/MWh today + $20\/MWh for NIER + $10\/MWh for carbon and attach a historical increase of 6% per year over the next 6 years = $156\/MWh. \u00a0 Without an industrial incentive, a 60 MW industrial facility would pay $82 M for electricity per year.\u00a0 The price and its uncertainty will be significant barriers to this project.\n\n2.\u2018Green Electricity Program\u2019\n\nTo better align environmental and industrial incentives, the Government must ensure that significant electricity loads consumed in favour of fossil fuels are priced competitively.\u00a0 One of the most significant opportunity to cut emissions is through fuel switching \u2013 generally from diesel mobile equipment to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and mining conveyance, automation and other electric systems.\u00a0 A competitive industrial price for electricity will significantly incentive companies to adopt BEVs, automation, conveyance and generally do our part to phase out fossil fuels and transition to a low carbon economy.\u00a0 The potential large 60 MW mining complex in Timmins could either be designed as a \u2018mine of the future\u2019, highly reliant on electricity but with the $82 M per year cost, or designed as a standard mine with a fleet of large diesel trucks consuming 60 Million liters of diesel per year.\u00a0 Over a hypothetical 20 year life of mine that is 1.2 Billion liters of diesel or more than 3 Million tons of CO2.\u00a0 To the extent, we will reduce the carbon footprint of our operations and we see a competitive price for electricity in doing so.\u00a0 We recommend considering a program that would guarantee a lower electricity price for companies who make large fuel switches in favour of electricity and that lead to significant and sustainable decrease in GHGs.\n\n3.Conservation\n\nWe\u2019d like to congratulate the Government on programs and incentives that effectively help Goldcorp manage the cost of electricity like the Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI), Northern Industrial Electricity Rebate (NIER), Industrial Electricity Incentive and Industrial Accelerator Program (IAP).\n\n\u2022The Northern Industrial Electricity Program has been a very helpful program in managing our energy expenditures.\u00a0 But we are not refunded the $20 for every MWh so we\u2019d like that the program be expanded to cover all existing industrial operations with minimum loads and further expanded to make room for new projects like Goldcorp\u2019s Borden Gold and the Dome Century Project. \u2022We recommend extending the IAP\u2019s Energy Manager Funding program or extending its mandate and consolidate reporting across any programs that exist.\n\n\u2022We recommend the IAP recognize the merits of conservation projects and de-risk the projects by committing capital up front.\n\n\u2022As mentioned above, we strongly urge the Gov\u2019t to ensure a low industrial rate for major investments like the IEI like program.\n\n\u2022While the ICI is a very effective program for some, it\u2019s not good for facilities that must run 24\/7 to remain competitive.\u00a0 There must be other programs for Class A because absorbing the full annual Global Adjustment leads to rates as high as $110\/MWh like at RLGM and PGM.\n\n4.Impact of Cap and Trade on electricity\n\nNotwithstanding the government\u2019s commitment to apply Cap & Trade Program proceeds to the electricity, that commitment only lasts during the first compliance period (2017-2020). Industry needs to know what comes next. If some form of price mitigation is not included post-2020, Ontario\u2019s industrial loads will experience a step-change increase to their already steadily increasing electricity bills. In light of the need to remain globally competitive, it will be even more important as Ontario\u2019s price disadvantage gets worse.\n\n5.Natural Gas\n\nWe support the existing Natural Gas Access Loan, the Natural Gas Economic Development Grant and the commitment to use up cap and trade proceeds for introduction of renewable natural gas.\u00a0 We invested $20 M to run a gas pipeline to Red lake and the benefits of displacing baseboard heating with natural gas have been massive both for the community and Goldcorp. \u00a0 Similar access across the north into communities like Chapleau will be helpful.\n\n6.Solutions to address infrastructure in the North\n\nFrom ongoing improvement efforts, we\u2019ve managed to find efficiencies at our mines and drive significant savings.\u00a0 For example, three years ago our Musselwhite Mine was one of our least productive mines and was struggling to attract new capital.\u00a0 Musselwhite has turned it around and now operates as one of the most efficient mines in Goldcorp\u2019s global portfolio having reduced its All in Sustaining Cost by 30%.\u00a0 This has meant investment in new opportunities like a recently approved $100 M Musselwhite expansion project which will further reduce operating costs by handling more ore more efficiently.\u00a0 The expansion will add approximately 3 years to the mine life which means an additional 840,000 Oz. in gold production.\u00a0 It also increases our rate of production from 4,000 to 4,300 tons per day, unlocks exploration potential for long term growth and increases employment for local, remote First Nations.\u00a0 Currently 22% of our 811 employees are from local First Nations communities.\u00a0 The project will lead to increased royalty payments as part of our Collaboration Agreement and more business opportunities for First Nations.\u00a0 Even after a huge effort in Energy Conservation and reduction in diesel fuel, the mine is grid constrained at 19.5 MWs off the Ear Falls TS. \u00a0 Goldcorp has conducted a study that suggests that an increase of 2 or 2.5 MWs is feasible without risk to the stability of the system.\u00a0 Considering the importance of Musselwhite Mine for the North and this project to extend the life of the mine, Goldcorp would like the IESO to revise planning for the E1C and M1M based on more realistic assumptions for weather and or at least consider a load rejection scheme of up to 2.5 MW over and above our current allocation.\n\nNorthern communities have less infrastructure than the south for obvious reasons.\u00a0 In Red Lake Hydro One was unwilling to expand transmission so Goldcorp built a 10.7 KM transmission line from Harry\u2019s Corner to our Balmer facility.\u00a0 The concept of an \u2018enabler\u2019 for infrastructure would help meet the challenges of a lack of ROI on infrastructure for private or public actors.\u00a0 Although infrastructure in the North generates GDP, sets the stage for economic development, and has multiple social and environmental benefits, it rarely meets the public use test.\u00a0 Instead, Goldcorp was left holding the bag for a critical piece of infrastructure that will lead to increase of supply to the region.\u00a0 An \u2018enabler\u2019 model would defray upfront costs because it would take into account these challenges.\u00a0 This concept has been used in the development of renewable energy in the Province.\u00a0 The OPA supported the OEB\u2019s initiative to address obstacles facing development of remotely located renewable resources through an enabler concept and subsequently made changes to the Transmission System Code.\n\nGoldcorp would be pleased to discuss this further in a face-to-face meeting with the Ministry.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWade Bristol\n\nSenior Vice President\n\nGoldcorp Canada Ltd.\n\nCc: Honourable Michael Gravelle, Minister of Northern Development and Mines\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207191]\n",

        "comment":"December 16, 2016\n\nOn behalf of Hydro One Limited (Hydro One), thank you for providing an opportunity to make a formal submission to the Long-Term Energy Plan review process.\n\nAs stewards of Ontario\u2019s electricity grid, Hydro One\u2019s mandate is to provide safe, reliable, cost-effective electricity transmission and distribution. The Company carries out its business in every corner of this province and operates in places where no other utility can or will. Hydro One owns and operates the largest electricity transmission and distribution business in Ontario with total assets of $24B.\n\nAs you know, Hydro One is on a journey towards becoming a new customer-centric company. The Company\u2019s new Leadership Team, strong balance sheet and geographic service territory, along with the mandate to grow as a business not only aligns well with the government\u2019s plans for a stronger economy and electricity system, but uniquely positions Hydro One to help the Government of Ontario achieve its electricity, economic development and environmental goals.\n\nOntario has a distinct advantage over most other jurisdictions in having a vehicle for integrated energy and environmental policy planning through the Long-Term Energy Plan and Hydro One proposes that this vehicle is used to promote ideas that will empower customers and propel economic development.\n\nAs such, Hydro One is offering solutions to some of the critical challenges facing the electricity sector, including modernization and reliability, economic development, affordability and the importance of enhancing consumer choice.\n\nA Modern, Reliable System\n\nThe size, strength and efficiency of our electrical grid are critical to reliability and Hydro One\u2019s ability to deliver electricity that sustains and secures the economic and social well-bring of every community in Ontario. However, the system is aging. The previous Long-Term Energy Plan focused on increasing transmission capacity in Northwestern Ontario, connecting remote First Nations communities and implementing timely local transmission enhancements as needs emerge throughout the province.\n\nThe current Long-Term Energy Plan should consider innovative solutions to increase the reliability of the system. This is consistent with the proposed review of the procurement model, aimed towards taking a technology-agnostic approach which will allow cutting edge innovations and engineering solutions to become a part of Ontario\u2019s modern electricity system.\n\nAs an example, microgrid applications consisting of renewable generation, energy storage and control are rapidly emerging as an opportunity for utilities. Hydro One is pursuing microgrid applications in a number of communities served including an island supplied with costly submarine cables and a First Nations community utilizing diesel. Further, Hydro One has been contacted by a residential community developer with a proposal to explore the co-development of a microgrid for a newly planned community in Southwestern Ontario.\n\nMicrogrid applications can provide energy self-sufficiency, improved reliability, reduced carbon footprint and potential to forgo costly replacements of submarine cables and above-ground infrastructure. In addition, these projects will help Hydro One establish knowledge and capabilities in deploying and operating microgrids for a variety of applications and to the benefit of all Ontarians.\n\nIt is recommended that the Government of Ontario contemplate regulatory approaches such as enabling the development and operation of microgrids, community net metering, storage and other innovative solutions to ensure Ontario\u2019s grid remains modern, reliable and affordable. Regulatory certainty on the treatment of innovation is desired to ensure that this work can continue into the future. Hydro One welcomes the opportunity to discuss options for the deployment of new technology with First Nations and the Government of Ontario.\n\nRegional Economic Development\n\nThe electricity sector plays an essential role in powering Ontario\u2019s economy; where community and economic development begins, electricity infrastructure is sure to follow close behind. The Long-Term Energy Plan represents an opportunity to identify areas where energy policy can add value and help efforts to grow the economy, attract foreign direct investment and strengthen Ontario\u2019s competitive edge.\n\nServing over 1.3 million customers across the breadth of Ontario, Hydro One powers the province\u2019s largest manufacturers, sawmills, greenhouses and mines. The Company also powers the anchor tenants in rural and small-urban Ontario that make up the economic backbone of communities from Leamington to Kenora. For these communities, attracting new investment and winning the mandates that allow existing businesses to expand are what keep them vibrant and thriving.\n\nThe high cost associated with building and expanding electricity infrastructure in Ontario can send businesses elsewhere in search of lower cost opportunities. While the province\u2019s tradition of \u201cuser-pay\u201d has been the basis of Ontario\u2019s regulatory regime, there are options that would reduce the cost burden and thereby increase the long-term viability of commercial and industrial businesses and their mandates in rural and small-urban Ontario to strengthen the province\u2019s diverse regional economic clusters.\n\nThrough Hydro One\u2019s participation in the Ministry of Economic Development and Growth\u2019s Investment Ready Program, along with the thousands of connections the Company has made with businesses across the province, there are some regulatory barriers to growth that, if softened, could make it easier to attract investment and stimulate growth.\n\nSpecifically, the Transmission System Code and Distribution System Code are exceptionally prescriptive in how electricity service providers manage the capital cost risks associated with expansion and connection. In both Codes, once a load projection is developed and revenue from future demand or consumption is factored in, the remaining capital costs must typically be paid up front in one lump sum. While this is designed to protect Ontario\u2019s rate payers from undue risk, the reality in many cases, is protracted work and pressure on customers to arrive at a financing solution. The cash-flow pressure associated with this regulatory requirement represents a deterrent to employers seeking to locate in the province or expand an existing facility.\n\nIt is recommended that the Government of Ontario grant more flexibility to utilities to manage the risks of capital cost recovery and flatten these costs over a longer period of time by directing the Ontario Energy Board to amend the Transmission System Code and Distribution System Code to have a positive effect on Ontario\u2019s industries. By implementing this solution, the Government of Ontario would respect the cash-flow pressures on new and growing businesses, and remove a barrier to economic development while not adding any additional costs to customers.\n\nAffordability\n\nThe Government of Ontario has made significant efforts in recent months to provide rate relief to Hydro One\u2019s customers such as removing the provincial portion of the HST, changes to Rural and Remote Rate Protection and the Industrial Conservation Initiative. Hydro One believes, however, that additional support is still required for Ontario\u2019s residential, small business and industrial rate payers. Building on Premier Kathleen Wynne\u2019s commitment to lower electricity prices and Minister Thibeault\u2019s comments on alternative pricing plans, the distribution sector can apply its expertise and advice towards further bending the cost curve.\n\nOntario has put into place a series of policies designed to foster the growth of clean energy and conservation and demand management (CDM). The costs associated with these programs are substantially socialized through the price of electricity, specifically the Global Adjustment along with other significant clean energy costs supported under various provincial programs.\n\nThe Global Adjustment is now the dominant and fastest-growing component of electricity rates across customer classes in Ontario and forecast to continue to outpace other components of the electricity bill over the next five years. Putting aside upside pressure on other components of the price of electricity, this increase in the Global Adjustment will, albeit indirectly, result in further pressure on residential customers and will act as a disincentive to economic development opportunities. Further, increased costs can have the impact of reducing the ability of utilities, such as Hydro One which is sensitive to customer bill impacts, to make necessary investments in grid infrastructure and modernization.\n\nThe implementation of a cap and trade system in Ontario, along with the Climate Change Action Plan are welcome changes, but not without their challenges. For example, many related initiatives such as CDM programs whose costs are still covered by the Global Adjustment and other electricity bill mechanisms could represent significant increases to the cost of power. This comes at a time where indications from the new US Administration are that, not only will there be no carbon regime, but it is likely that there will a removal of regulatory burdens including the elimination of the US Clean Power Plan and a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate and other changes that will improve the investment climate in the US.\n\nIt is recommended that the Government of Ontario contemplate allocating a portion of the revenues from the cap and trade program to fund elements of the Global Adjustment or otherwise, provide a source of funding for the application of innovative solutions, CDM programs and critically-needed electric vehicle charging infrastructure. These features will materially enhance Ontario\u2019s ability to support economic development and deploy advanced electric grid infrastructure that integrates seamlessly with Provincial and Federal environmental sustainability objectives.\n\nConsumer Choice\n\nWhile affordability is a topic of considerable debate within Ontario\u2019s electricity sector, Hydro One believes that there are other opportunities to better serve Ontario\u2019s residential electricity customers by offering a broader suite of service options. By testing, supporting and offering alternative solutions that reflect Ontario\u2019s diverse customer profiles, there is an opportunity to closer tie Ontarians\u2019 consumption habits to their bill, permitting customers to better manage their energy use.\n\nHydro One has considerable data, insights and in-field studies that can be shared towards enhancing consumer choice and the Company welcomes the opportunity to work with the Government of Ontario, other utilities and the Ontario Energy Board on this critical work. Using Dynamic Energy Pricing as an example, Hydro One submitted an application to the Ontario Energy Board under the Regulated Price Plan Roadmap. The proposal offers customers commodity rate choices from a variety of options that best suit their electricity needs. This includes:\n\n\u2022Time-of-Use: Hydro One\u2019s pilot would consider rates with a much larger difference between the on-peak and off-peak prices as well as rates that do not have a mid-peak component.\n\n\u2022Critical Peak Pricing: Similar to Time-of-Use but with the option to charge a higher on-peak rate on a limited number of days annually when there is high system demand. The high critical price will be offset by a lower off-peak rate.\n\n\u2022Variable Peak Pricing: Similar to Critical Peak Pricing but with different tiers of critical prices that can be applied based on system need.\n\n\u2022Real Time Pricing: Prices are grouped into four-hour blocks and set based on the expected real-time electricity price. Prices are kept within an upper and lower band to avoid massive fluctuations in cost and customers are informed of prices in advance of the pricing period.\n\nThe pilot, if approved by the Ontario Energy Board, would test customers\u2019 appetite for assuming risk related to their commodity rate choice and help build the necessary billing infrastructure. Building on this collaborative work, it is recommended that the Government of Ontario direct the Ontario Energy Board to continue to explore further opportunities to enhance consumer choice with Hydro One and distributors.\n\nThank you again for providing this opportunity for early participation in the Long-Term Energy Plan. Hydro One is focused on making life better for our customers and welcomes the opportunity to work with the Government of Ontario.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207192]\n",

        "comment":"The current model of funding for CDM programs has left residential homes behind. There are some coupons for a few items and the gas utilities have an upgraded program. There are three problems: First, because of the funding model the LDCs have no requirement to push these programs. Other than for social housing, there are no funds specifically attached to residential energy reductions. Rather homeowners need to be the drivers of obtaining the products and the incentives. Second, There is no targets for residential energy saving. Consequently LDCs are outing all their efforts into the ICI sector and the residential sector continues on as if there is nothing that can be done there. Third, there is no connection between the gas incentive program and the electrical programs. So if the homeowner makes changes that have savings in both gas and electricity only the one utility gets credit. For example, if a high efficiency furnace is installed with an ECM motor the gas utility will be credited with the savings but not the electrical utility.\n\nRecommend that:\n\n1. a residential program structured to push out incentives to homeowners be introduced as opposed to the current program that relies totally on a pull rom the homeowner.\n\n2. a portion of the LDC CDM program have dollars and targets directly assigned to residential energy savings.\n\n3. the gas and electrical CDM programs be joined so that the savings attributable to each be assigned appropriately.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207194]\n",

        "comment":"I would like to comment on four areas:\n\n1.\u00a0 Public ownership.\u00a0 It is critical that Ontarians own their electrical utilities.\u00a0 Only if we own these can we begin to regulate the prices Ontarians have to pay for electricity and energy. Otherwise we will continually be at the mercy of private sector organizations, whose primary goal is to make money.\n\nStop any further sales of Ontario hydro, and begin the process of buying back what has already been sold.\n\n2.\u00a0 Green energy:\u00a0 Ontario's policies and investment (ownership) should be focused on green, non-fossil-fuel, non-nuclear sources of energy.\u00a0 Our biggest challenge is climate change.\u00a0 We need to do whatever we can to ensure the planet survives.\n\nI was extremely distressed to learn, through the consultation Open Houses,\u00a0 that I, as a citizen, through my government, owned not one single source of green energy. It is just as important that Ontarians own Wind and Solar electricity producers as hydro electric plants.\n\n3.\u00a0 Nuclear energy.\u00a0 Although nuclear energy avoids the immediate pollution and greenhouse gas emission problems of fossil-fuel produced energy, the long term disposal and storage risks have not been solved.\u00a0 We are creating more and more nuclear waste while merely hoping a solution will be discovered \"some day\".\n\nThis risk is too great.\n\n4. Consultation process.\n\nThe two tier consultation process is humiliating to ordinary citizens.\u00a0 Only \"stakeholders\" received a planned presentation and comprehensive overview of the Long Term Energy Plan.\u00a0 For the rest of us (majority of citizens), it was catch as catch can at the public Open House.\u00a0 What a farce!\n\nThis is no way to create an informed electorate.\n\nIn contrast, I think back to the climate change consultations, where everyone got treated to a structured overview of the issues, and then everyone's input was heard by the whole room.\n\nEither you value democracy or you don't.\u00a0 The LTEP consultation process clearly showed that the current Ontario government does not value democracy, and does not value informed citizens.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207196]\n",

        "comment":"Skate where the puck is going!\n\nMost of the world is abandoning expensive, dangerous nuclear. Our nuclear plants will become\u00a0 white elephants. They have already driven our electricity prices up to levels people are not happy with. The planet is moving to clean, safe renewable energy (RE). It is getting cheaper every year. With 20 year fixed price contracts the prices we will pay in the coming decades will seem reasonable to our children.\n\nWe must invest in new smart electricity systems that allow us to use our resources intelligently. The essential elements of a smart energy system are:\n\n1. recognize that greater efficiency can be gained by considering the energy system as an integrated\u00a0 whole, ie include heat, transport and electricity in integrated\u00a0 planning.\u00a0 The classic example of this smart thinking is with district heating systems. Burn sustainably produced fuel to generate electricity, use the waste heat through district heating systems to heat whole neighbourhoods.\n\n2.The LTEP\u00a0 should focus its RE purchases on community -based\u00a0 providers such as municipalities, public not-for-profits like universities, churches and co-operatives. Local development of our renewable resources such as solar , wind and especially biogas will raise levels of citizen engagement in the system that provides their own electricity. Some of the profits to ownership will stay right in the local communities.\u00a0 Instead of resistance we'll see community support for this direction.\n\n3. Integrate the LTEP planning process with the Climate Action Plan.\n\n4. We need to be developing pilot energy storage systems, not just centralized but also right where people use electricity. This will help overcome the supply\u00a0 limitations of somewhat intermittent RE. Biogas will play an important role here as it is a dispatchable source of energy.\n\n5 Emphasize energy efficiency or conservation,\n\nThere are two ways we can spend less money on energy costs.\n\nOne, prices could, somehow, perhaps be lowered But we know that the cheapest is not always the best. We don't want to burn more fossil fuels because we care about our planet's future. When past governments have frozen Hydro prices, utilities failed to make necessary investments in modernizing or even maintaining distribution and transmission infrastructure. We know where that led us... right where we now have to invest to catch up with infrastructure investments.\n\nTwo.\u00a0 We can lower our energy bills by consuming less energy. For example if cars get better fuel economy even if prices of fuel rise we can spend less on energy. Better even is switching to electric and cutting energy costs massively.\n\nOr if we live in houses that are much better insulated, ideally, zero-energy use houses, energy costs for home heating will become almost insignificant.\n\nObviously the best way to control energy costs is to reduce energy usage through improving efficiency.\n\n6. Wintergreen Co-op\u00a0 supports cap and trade pricing of carbon emissions as long as the revenues are not simply ploughed into general government revenues. They should be used to help people reduce their energy costs by reducing their usage. Lower income people should not suffer from Cap n' Trade auction fees. Part of the revenue should be used for assisting lower-income folks with the increases in cost.\u00a0 If you believe in a market -based system, sending appropriate price signals is a good way to move consumers away from excessive carbon emissions.\n\n7. Review Hydro One rules around RE generation to facilitate and promote more distributed RE generation. For example Hydro One should permit more embedded generation on the distribution system. There are many households that would\u00a0 like to instal a net metering solar system but HO won't permit it because they say we've exceeded the 7% limit on embedded generation! Investigate why European utilities can function with 15% as the cap on distributed generation.\n\n8, Plan to\u00a0 replace the dirty natural gas used right now with \"green natural gas\" produced from renewable sources such as biogas or methane produced form surplus electricity. Se Denmark's experience for this.\n\n9. Change the net-metering program to pay prices that appropriately reflect the value of solar electricity that is produced during the times of peak demand when spot prices are highest.\n\n10. Develop programs for collective net metering so that residents who would like to participate in RE production, but are unable to produce directly could become involved through community groups such as co-ops\n\n11. Reframe the Community Energy Planning exercises to focus on integrating with the Climate action Plan by focusing on distributed safe, clean, sustainable energy in our communities.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207184]\n",

I personally would like to stop or reduce the hydro dams we've created and allow the waters to flow the way nature intended, and I don't believe wind can give us what we need in overall power and efficiency. Add to that the studies conducted and the way the sound they create affect wild life. We should focus our efforts on creating solar materials such has solar roofing on homes, buildings and structures, solar farming etc and invest in our nuclear future as this is the cleanest, safest and most abundant source of energy.

        "comment":"December 16, 2016\n\nOntario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan\n\nhttp:\/\/www.energy.gov.on.ca\/en\/ltep\/\n\nMinistry of Energy\n\nGovernment of Ontario\n\nSubmission to EBR posting 012-8840, Planning Ontario\u2019s Energy Future\n\nInnergex Renewable Inc. (Innergex) is pleased to submit feedback in response to EBR posting 012-8840, Planning Ontario\u2019s Energy Future for consideration in the Long Term Energy Plan (LTEP) review. Innergex applauds the Government of Ontario for its leadership on renewable energy procurement and the achievements that have been made with respect to integrating over 4000 MW of wind and solar into the bulk transmission system. Furthermore, through the Large Renewable Procurement I (LRP I), the Ontario Government and the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) demonstrated that the cost of procuring renewable energy through a competitive process is comparable, if not less than, fossil fuel forms of energy generation.\n\nInnergex is a leading Canadian independent renewable power producer. Active since 1990, the company develops, owns, and operates run-of-river hydroelectric facilities, wind farms, and solar photovoltaic farms and carries out its operations in British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario, Idaho (USA) and France with an aggregate gross installed capacity of 1,359 MW. Furthermore, Innergex has four projects with First Nations equity partners, and over 40 contractual agreements with First Nations on our other Canadian projects.\n\nAt Innergex, we are very proud of our commitment to produce renewable energy exclusively.\u00a0 We have come to know that sustainable development isn\u2019t just about what we do, but also about how we do it. Our success has been founded on developing good projects, which for us means projects that are accepted by the local community, respectful of the environment, and economically viable both for us and the electric utilities we service \u2013 in other words, projects that strike a balance between social, environmental, and economic considerations.\u00a0 Over the years, our management has applied these principles of sustainability in building the Company, based on our long-term mindset.\n\nInnergex is proud to be a part of the Ontario electricity market through our currently operating facilities, as well as the partnerships we have developed to be prepared for future development opportunities. However, there are a few challenges and barriers that we would like addressed through the LTEP review.\n\n.\n\n1.Supporting Ontario\u2019s climate objectives\n\nThe Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) is a policy document that can only be successfully implemented if integrated within the policy development in other Ontario Ministries, including the Ministry of Energy. CCAP recognizes the opportunity to support electrification of key parts of our economy. Electrification can drive demand for electricity and other regulation services and Ontario should have a plan to meet these needs with renewable energy generation. This will require careful consideration of the impact that the CCAP will have on the electricity system and for the Ontario government to have a well-timed plan that will bring renewable resources online accordingly through the LTEP and technical documents such as the Ontario Planning Outlook (OPO). Furthermore, supply mix decisions that could result in increased use of Ontario\u2019s natural gas generation fleet have the potential to greatly impact the achievement of GHG reduction targets.\n\n2.Enabling Indigenous and Northern economic development\n\nParticipation in renewable energy projects have been proven across the country to unlock unprecedented economic development opportunities for First Nation communities. Ontario has the opportunity, through the LTEP, to both achieve the objectives of the CCAP and enable these economic development opportunities to help First Nation communities achieve economic independence.\n\nSeveral opportunities exist in Ontario through infrastructure investment and renewable energy development in Indigenous communities. Not only can strategic transmission investment and renewable energy development present economic opportunities in Northern Ontario, climate change goals can be met through the elimination of reliance on diesel generation in remote communities, environmental and human health threats related to diesel generation can be solved and the cost of electricity can be reduced in the North.\n\nThe Ontario Government has recognized the economic opportunity that ownership of renewable energy can present for Indigenous communities. Many communities in Northern Ontario have identified renewable resources and developed partnerships, with companies like Innergex, with the intention of tapping into this opportunity. However, the lack of grid capacity and grid connection has prevented many communities from being able to pursue their business plans. Not only are the remote communities in Ontario not able to avail this economic potential, they also live with the adverse environmental and health challenges that come with a reliance on diesel generation. The IESO has prepared a connection plan for transmission development in the remote parts of Ontario and Innergex supports the implementation of that plan, as well as the continued development of the priority lines in Northern Ontario identified in the previous LTEP.\n\n3.System, market and regulatory adaptation to changing energy landscape\n\nInnergex recognizes the investments that have been made over the past several years to upgrade Ontario\u2019s aging transmission system and encourages the continued momentum in order to strategically reinforce the existing transmission system and prepare the distribution system to adapt to the shifts in demand and types of use that will take place due to the dynamic forces that are changing how electricity consumers interact electricity and by the direction set out in the CCAP. This includes strategically increasing capacity on existing transmission lines and supporting Local Distribution Companies to reinforce the distribution system accordingly.\n\nThis is also a time of change for regulatory and market structures for Ontario\u2019s electricity sector. While there are several complex considerations that need to be addressed over the coming years, an environment that can better enables bilateral contracting directly with end users, facilitates value added electricity exports, as well as consideration for fair conditions for renewable energy in the IESO Market Renewal Initiative will be key to a healthy renewable energy sector in Ontario into the future.\n\n4.Clean electricity exports\n\nOntario is currently an exporter of electricity to the US, however it is happening primarily as a means of managing surplus energy and is not done in a manner that maximizes the benefit to the Ontario rate payer.\u00a0 With the recent North American commitment to 50 percent renewable generation by 2050 there is an unprecedented opportunity for Ontario to leverage our renewable energy resources as an export product.\u00a0 Ontario can support North America in its transition to 50 percent renewables (and beyond) while strengthening our economy by transforming renewable energy into our next great value added export product. Through the IESO Market Renewal Initiative, clean energy export should be enabled to allow the renewable energy industry to be able to avail this opportunity.\n\n5.Cost of electricity\n\nThe rate payers and the Government of Ontario have felt the pressure and challenges of increasing electricity rates and it is an issues that must be addressed with understanding for the people who are struggling to pay their bills, but also sensitivity to how perceptions of the drivers of the cost increase are impacting the renewable energy industry. Renewable energy has only represented a small portion of the increase on Ontario\u2019s residential electricity bill, but is receiving a disproportionate amount of attention as the leading cause. The misrepresented narrative that renewable energy is expensive has become embedded in Ontario and is having a negative impact on an industry that is heavily reliant on social acceptance to be able to develop and construct facilities. While the standard offer approach to renewable energy procurement resulted in higher costs PPAs, the LRP I demonstrated that renewable energy is cost competitive with other forms of energy generation. The LTEP should provide electricity price transparency and clarity to the Ontario rate payer, demonstrating all of the drivers and their proportionate contribution to increased rates in Ontario. Furthermore, it should provide information to rate payers on the ways in which future procurement of renewable energy can be done in ways that ensures cost competitive rates and future supply mix decisions should be based on a forward looking understanding of the cost of each technology and fuel type. The renewable energy industry is ready to partner with the Ontario government to deliver low-cost electricity to Ontarian\u2019s, but we need to work together to clarify what is a widely misunderstood issue.\n\n6.Principled and cost effective energy transition opportunities\n\nOntario\u2019s supply mix is relatively clean due to the leadership that the Ontario Government took in eliminating coal from the system. Recognizing that the remaining fossil-fuel emitting resources have a role to play in the reliable supply of electricity in Ontario it is still important to consider the opportunity that Ontario has to further clean its grid as several facilities that make up the natural gas generation fleet reach the end of their PPAs in the coming years. According to the OPO, natural gas makes up 25% of the total available supply mix, but only 10% of electricity production. Therefore, as a fossil fuel emitting resource that will likely face increasing price volatility in the future, retiring these facilities when their PPAs expire represents an opportunity for Ontario to further clean its supply mix while insulating the rate payer from price volatility and supporting GHG emission reduction targets.\n\nDecisions with respect to refurbishment and extending the life of the nuclear fleet should be considered in the same light and the most economic and environmentally responsible decisions should be made in order to further insulate the Ontario rate payer from increased electricity rates. While nuclear generation has historically served as a reliable foundation for Ontario\u2019s base load power, there are considerable risks associated with extending the life of a nuclear facility and refurbishment. For example, there will likely be unanticipated supply gaps throughout the refurbishment process resulting in the need to cycle Ontario\u2019s natural gas fleet more often, which can raise the spot market price for electricity and increase GHG emissions. Furthermore, the merits of extending the life of Pickering Nuclear Generating Station to 2022 \/ 2024 have changed over time as the capital and operating costs no longer present a cost savings to the rate payer. This is another opportunity to replace an aging facility with lower-cost, non-emitting resources.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith this LTEP, Ontario has the opportunity to build on the great work it has done to date with the coal phase-out, integration of large amounts of renewable energy generation in Ontario\u2019s supply mix, demonstrating that competitive procurement can attract new renewable energy development at a low-cost and facilitating meaningful local and Indigenous participation in the energy sector . It is imperative that the LTEP is aligned with and supports the CCAP to ensure the electricity system can support and enhance the Province\u2019s climate objectives. Furthermore, Ontario has the opportunity to leverage the LTEP to unlock broad economic opportunities for the Indigenous communities in the Province, especially those in Northern Ontario. Innergex looks forward to continuing to work with the Province to reach this success.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207186]\n",

The technologies discussed seem to have a focus on the supply side; distribution and grid modernization, natural gas expansion, microgrids, electricity transmission and pipelines, storage, innovation in supply areas but not in conservation or renewables. The only mention of conservation and energy efficiency says there are frameworks put into place. Two statements are troubling. First, \"The Conservation First Framework is designed to reduce electricity consumption by 7 terawatt-hours (TWh) or seven billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) by December 31, 2020\". The ambiguous wording leaves it open to missing this target by as little or much as can be spun by the LDCs, OPA\/IESO, government.\n\nThe second says the frameworks \"give distributors the flexibility to meet local needs and require programs to be cost-effective to ensure value for money'. This appears to be saying that conservation is now a program that can be undertaken \"wherever economically viable\" or these are not hard targets rather there is a lot of flexibility in doing something or as little as the LDC can argue is all that is economically viable.\n\nRecommend that strict reduction targets be set that LDCs are required to meet and commensurate budgets be provided.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207198]\n",

        "comment":"December 16, 2016\n\nRe: Support communities to go 100% renewable\n\nDear Minister,\n\nI believe that Ontario must take a different approach to developing renewable energy sources to be 100% powered by Renewable Energy by 2050. I want Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP) to take such an approach to developing our geoexchange resources.\n\nWhile I am a strong believer in putting conservation first, I also recognize that this will only get us part of the way there. Many older urban homes were built with different materials that limit the efficiency gains that can be made at a reasonable cost and this means finding a carbon free solution to heating and cooling them. Geoexchange systems are the answer.\n\nMoving to geoexchange heating and cooling \u2013 it\u2019s not too expensive, it\u2019s free.\n\nThe Canadian Constitution gives Ontario the rights to energy and natural resources; it is time to commercially develop our geothermal energy resources to heat and cool our buildings (geoexchange resources).\n\nThe first step is to recognize that the current and past approaches to using geoexchange resources failed; for building owners the cost of developing the resource on their own is too high; for governments the cost of subsidies to encourage individual building owners to develop the resource was too high; and for businesses the lack of guaranteed long term access to the resources and markets make it imprudent to invest in developing the resources.\n\nThe second step is to create a different approach to developing geoexchange energy resources, a market based approach. By using and\/or adapting policies employed in other parts of the energy industry Ontario can create a new market that producer\/distributers and customers are confident in. Using regulatory bodies to manage the natural monopolies \u2013 similar to gas production and distributors \u2013 created when developing and using local geo-exchange resources will be necessary to protect both suppliers and consumers.\n\nBy adapting the policy frameworks which support multibillion dollar capital investments in the oil and gas sector, Ontario can signal to the energy industry that there will be a place for them in our low carbon energy future. By using lease and royalty programs to regulate access and use of geoexchange resources, Ontario can create the economic certainty companies and investors need to justify building and operating district-based geoexchange systems.\n\nBy regulating and charging for access to geoexchange resources the province can also turn a major climate challenge into a new source of sustainable government revenue. Working together with municipalities, public and privately owned utilities, and community power cooperatives, Ontario can continue reducing its reliance on fossil fuels, while also keeping homes and business comfortable.\n\nKey components of a new approach to developing geoexchange resources will include:\n\n\u2022Exercising provincial authority to develop the resource and to set new terms and conditions for its use.\n\n\u2022Developing policies to regulate access \u2013 which could be a public auction similar to those held granting access to non-renewable resources \u2013 and set royalty fees.\n\n\u2022Developing policies to regulate the distribution and sale of the resource. The new systems will be natural monopolies like gas and electricity distributors and will need similar rules regulations.\n\n\u2022Provincial Municipal negotiations to develop consistent by-laws and regulations to encourage investments in cities across the province.\n\n\u2022Updating curriculums for post-secondary education institutions and worker training programs to offer training and apprenticeship programs for the workforce needed to build and operate the new systems.\n\n\u2022Provincial Municipal negotiations to develop revenue sharing agreements, preferably directing the funds to pay for local infrastructure projects in the communities where the revenue is generated; this will encourage municipal governments to work to roll out the new infrastructure system as quickly as possible.\n\nKey benefits of this approach are:\n\n\u2022It doesn\u2019t require significant government funding, companies will make the capital investments if the policy framework is there to support them.\n\n\u2022It doesn\u2019t require home and business owners to become resource developers, they just upgrade to a new heating system and cooling system like they did when they transitioned from coal to oil and oil to gas.\n\n\u2022It provides large investment opportunities for companies wanting to provide heating and cooling services to business and individuals \u2013 including a transitional path for companies currently delivery fossil based heating fuels.\n\n\u2022It creates skilled jobs in local communities across the province.\n\n\u2022It creates a new sustainable source of government revenue based on a renewable carbon free energy source.\n\n\u2022By investing the revenue in local transit infrastructure projects it will help fund reducing emissions in the transportation sector\u2013 the largest source of emissions in the province - as well. Ontario\u2019s Long-term Energy Plan should empower community groups and Municipalities to become energy producers. I want Ontario to continue to ensure citizens and communities have opportunities to own and participate in renewable energy projects.\n\nI believe this approach \u2013 moving to local district energy systems - will help reduce the impacts of climate change and support communities during the increasingly common extreme weather events such as ice storms, flooding and severe heat.\n\nI want Ontario to empower local communities, municipalities and industry to find common ground to support building a Province powered with 100% renewable energy. With a slight shift in perspective and approach it can be done.\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider my thoughts, I hope it helps you as you are developing Ontario\u2019s next Long Term Energy Plan.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPaul Mero\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207200]\n",

        "comment":"I commented on electricity before. Now I wish to make comments on fossil fuels. We must stop producing greenhouse gases as quickly as possible, which means phasing out fossil fuels.\n\n- Most importantly: Return carbon tax revenues to the taxpayer. Carbon pricing is the most important tool for reducing greenhouse gases and it must be implemented with the approval of the electorate to be successful. I am disappointed that Ontario has opted for cap and trade, which is far more cumbersome than carbon taxes. But that choice has been made. Now it is crucial to ensure that this is not just another tax grab. The government must follow B.C.'s lead in returning ALL revenue from carbon pricing to the citizens of Ontario. If the cap and trade is not revenue neutral, you will inspire a tsunami of resentment, and hand ammunition to the climate-change deniers who will use the carbon tax to stir up anger about any measures to reduce greenhouse gases. Keeping the revenue in government hands will be counterproductive in the end. It will backfire, and future governments will undo all the good that carbon pricing does. In the long run Ontario will contribute more to global warming rather than doing its part to reduce its impact. So you must make this program revenue neutral.\n\n- I commend the government for closing the coal-fired electricity generation in Ontario.\n\n- Reducing oil usage in the transportation sector should be the next priority. Measures like a tax on usage on high-traffic roads like the Gardiner Expressway make sense. The fuel efficiency standards of new vehicles need to be made more stringent.\n\n- Expand public transportation, encourage municipalities to convert their bus fleets to biofuels or electricity.\n\n- Encourage home efficiencies, bring back rebate programs for insulation, furnace replacement, heat pumps and other efficiencies. A person I talked with today said she has electric forced air heating and she pays $1000 per month on average. People like her need a program to help them convert to something more efficient. On this note, municipal production of heat from cogeneration and waste is a great idea which the province should be encouraging.\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207203]\n",

Electrical grids and operators must evolve in this direction or risk becoming obsolete. Ontario seems stubbornly committed the opposite; hunkering down on refurbishing old and wildly expensive nukes. Let's not.\n\nHow about leaning on Quebec's abundant water resources, spending $$$ on helping people use less electricity, investing in community-owned renewable infrastructure, and wide-spread electric vehicle charging.\n\nI'm not sure if you have noticed the wrath many people in the North feel about electricity prices. The Libs are paying a heavy price politically for fumbling the ball so severely on the energy front. Helping people consume less will go a long way.\n\nIf we are going to solve climate change and build a fair society, investing in conservation and helping people install net metered systems will ease the financial burden of being plugged into the grid and staying warm in the winter.\n\nPlease take a progressive and innovative leadership role rather than letting the nuclear industry dictate our collective future.\n\nAnd while you are at it, can we just move forward with a carbon tax and forget about the overly complex cap and trade scheme.\n\nthx for reading\n\nJustin\n\n[Original Comment ID: 207199]\n",

Specifically on electricity:\n- Do NOT refurbish any of the nuclear plants in operation, and don't build new reactors at Darlington. Reject OPG's request to continue Pickering after 2018. Let the Pickering nuclear plant cease power production and prepare decommissioning. It is too costly, and we have enough nuclear waste already, we do not need more.\n- Do submit the Bruce nuclear deal to public scrutiny through an Ontario Energy Board review.\n- Do set up long-term contracts with Quebec to buy their hydro-electricity. The recent deal to buy two terawatt-hours per year from Quebec is a small step in the right direction. It is much cheaper and better for the environment than nuclear. Upgrade transmission capacity between Ontario and Quebec.\n- Do keep time-of-day pricing on electricity. Do NOT remove the provincial portion of the HST on electricity bills. Subsidizing energy use is just another way to encourage more energy use. Subsidize energy conservation. Even better, return the provincial portion of the HST on electricity to low income households, ensuring that the revenue matches the rebate.\n- Do set up new government procurement programs for renewables and conservation. Axing the renewable energy programs in September was a mistake, especially when it looks like you want to pursue nuclear. It simply does not make sense for the government to insist that more solar and wind power are not needed but nuclear is needed.\n[Original Comment ID: 206314]\n",

However, nuclear energy is not a viable alternative, as there is no prospect in sight for a solution to the disposal of hazardous nuclear waste. The only remaining alternatives are conservation and development of renewable energy sources. Conservation has been ongoing for many years, and should continue, but is not enough.\nAccordingly, we must focus significant resources on renewable energy. This should be done on a broad basis, in a way that rewards investment, research, and innovation at all levels of scale, across all types of renewable energy.\nIn the meantime, use of nuclear and fossil fuels should continue only as long as they remain cost-effective. New plants of this type should not be built.\nMost importantly, the process by which energy projects are approved and funded must be transparent and fair. Once approval has been given, it should not be withdrawn without public consultation. The abrupt cancellation of natural gas plant and wind turbine projects on Lake Ontario are examples of how this should NOT be done.\nAll of this will cost money. Subsidizing energy costs is not sustainable. There is no free lunch, and we must be prepared to pay to make the world a better place for our grandchildren. \u00a0However, we must also spend that money wisely.\n[Original Comment ID: 204784]\n",

Despite this, the government\u2019s past energy plans have made no requirement for nuclear projects to undergo public review against alternatives. This needs to change.\nOntario\u2019s next energy plan needs to ensure there are a full and fair comparisons of the total costs of nuclear with alternatives and an opportunity for the public to have a say about which approach they prefer.\nClose Pickering\nOntario\u2019s 2013 energy plan committed to close the Pickering nuclear station between 2017 and 2020, but earlier this year the government announced they would renege on this promise and keep operating Pickering until 2024.\nReduce Ontario Hydro's staff numbers by 60%\nWith over 8,000 employees who earn over $100,000 per annum, it obvious that this fact has\nmajor effect on electrical costs for the consumer. This cannot stand!\nReduce\u00a0 the union staff numbers by 60% within the next 5 years.\nAlmost all of Pickering\u2019s output is surplus and exported to Michigan at a loss.\u00a0 This is driving up energy costs.\nPickering\u2019s continued operation also puts the public at risk. Ontario has not updated its nuclear emergency plans since the Fukushima disaster.\nI want the government to keep its promise to close Pickering before 2020.\nShutting Pickering down should be a first step in Ontario\u2019s long-term transition to renewable energy.\nSincerely,\nJohn Dickson\n[Original Comment ID: 206331]\n",

We should go 100% renewable.\nIt does not make sense, from an economic, social and of course environmental perspective, for Ontario to be investing in anything but green energy. There are incredible investment opportunities in green energy which will provide great jobs for Ontarians. Jobs that we WANT rather than those that we HAVE to perform.\nI think we need to do the following:\n1. We need to divest from coal and nuclear energy and invest in green energy. Ontarians of all ages support the move to green energy.The ONLY people who do not support this move are the beneficiaries of non-renewable energy.\u00a0 We are all worried not only about the world we live in and the long-term impacts it will have on our health but also the world we will leave to our children. I want to be a parent one day and I am terrified at the idea that my child will not get to see the same world that I see today. I am terrified that 2\/3 of the species in the world are at a high risk of extinction. I am outraged by the fact that air, from BC, is being sold to people by the bottle.\n2. Focus our efforts on reducing energy demand. This can be done through incentives, public education campaigns and, in terms of transportation, making quick and reliable public transportation available to everyone regardless of socio-economic status. One major way to reduce transport emissions it to make our commutes to work accessible via bicycles. We need safe bike lanes throughout our cities.\n3. We need to have a holistic conservation plan. This is a top priority.\n4. We need to quickly advance toward a low-carbon future. The environmental threats are imminent and they are real.\n5. We need to encourage citizens and communities to become energy self-sufficient. For example, through providing further incentives for homeowners to add solar panels to their property.\n6. We need to make our cities more livable. Our cities are currently based on consumption we need to change people's mindsets so that we value and enjoy our shared spaces as much as we do our private ones.\nWe do not need to make everyone rich but we can build our cities to make people feel dignified.\nOne final note, we cannot make these changes by eradicating our social welfare system. My partner and I are taxed at the highest tax bracket. I would pay even more if that money went to social services and environmentally sound policies. I know that many of my friends and colleagues would as well.\nI know that the current government has been criticized for increasing the cost of utilities. I do not care about that. I also want you to know that I highly support some of your social policies. For example, I was very impressed with the changes proposed to the sex education programing.\nBut I was incredibly disappointed with your plans to sell Hydro One. I do not want economic prosperity where it comes with the eradication of workers' rights and social policies. I do not care about the value of the Canadian dollar if that value is liked to oil (which of course it has been often to a detrimental point).\nI want to live in a province where my neighbours have a similar social network to me. I want to enjoy our parks\u00a0 and not my growing bank account. I want to breath clean air and ride my bike safely to work.\nI want to feel like my government is not being run by oil companies but by and for the people of Ontario.\n[Original Comment ID: 206356]\n",

I want Ontario's next Long-Term Energy Plan to acknowledge that going 100% renewable is not only a possibility but the ideal and most cost-effective option long-term.\nThe costs associated with lengthy nuclear and natural gas contracts, negative health implications, and growing decommissioning costs only outline why Ontario must aggressively pursue a low-cost renewable energy future. \u00a0The cost of high capacity solar panels has decreased 50% in the last 6 years. \u00a0The costs to decommission a nuclear plant grow with age and expansion. Whether it's the government subsidising electricity through rate cuts (with tax money) or growing electricity costs, the taxpayer pays in the end no matter what.\nOntario\u2019s 2013 energy plan committed to close the Pickering nuclear station between 2017 and 2020, but earlier this year the government announced they would renege on this promise and keep operating Pickering until 2024.\nAlmost all of Pickering\u2019s output is surplus and exported to Michigan at a loss. \u00a0This is also driving up energy costs.\nThank you,\n- Jay\n[Original Comment ID: 204814]\n",

Communities should be mandated and supported to develop sustainable community energy plans. The goal should be to move towards regional and community energy self-sufficiency. This can be achieved through microgrids, based on integrated district energy systems, residential solar PV, cogeneration, community-owned bioenergy, geothermal, and water power as well as community wind farms where economically feasible and socially acceptable.\n2.Current approach: \u00a0Top-down, centralized planning process\nRecommendation: Taking a bottom-up and integrated approach to energy planning.\nThe ministry\u2019s approach seems to be built on the assumption that Ontario will continue to only fill temporary gaps in its supply with distributed generation and that the bulk electricity system will continue to provide baseload electricity to the system. It therefore takes on a top-down planning approach. This justifies the omission of a comprehensive analysis of the actual potential for distributed electrical and thermal renewable energy generation but is contrary to observable trends, globally and also within the province itself.\nOnly a comprehensive analysis of the potential for a distributed system (or a bottom-up approach) will allow energy system planners to fully understand the aggregated effects that increasing privately-owned, distributed generation, energy conservation, storage, and community energy self-sufficiency will have on the future distribution and transmission systems.\n3.Current approach: \u00a0Alternative energy sources de-emphasized\nRecommendation: Bioenergy \u2013 the untapped asset\nBioenergy is largely ignored in all planning documents, yet there is great potential for it across Ontario. Many Bioenergy technologies are very mature and range from landfill- and sewer-gas to anaerobic digestion of agricultural and food waste, to biomass combustion, all of which can be operated as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, thereby providing maximum efficiency and flexibility to meet local peak demands for heat and electricity. Renewable natural gas is the important linkage between the currently separately owned, controlled and operated electrical, thermal, and transportation systems. Bioenergy technologies and process are also crucial to the future of commercial transportation and heavy trucking, one of the greatest sources of Ontario\u2019s GHG emissions.\n4.Current approach: \u00a0communities develop local energy plans in isolation from central planning Recommendation: Encourage integrated community energy planning and avoid the risk of stranded assets and resulting high electricity rates\nMany communities are concerned about the high cost of energy, being able to provide their communities with reliable supply of energy, even when faced with extreme weather events, and with providing their citizens with a vital economy, in which to live and to conduct business. And many communities are starting to understand the potential of using the development of local energy assets to meet local demands \u00a0as an opportunity to meet these concerns head-on. We see more and more communities considering or already developing their own Community Energy Plans, with a growing desire to become energy-independent and the transmission grid becoming a source of back-up support to the local system. If this trend results in the development of energy islands and micro-girds, the need for centralized electricity supply will decrease to a point where extensive, unchecked investments into the continuation with the bulk electricity system will result in stranded assets and high electricity rates.\nFurther recommends:\n5.International trends and technological breakthroughs are showing us the way.\nProgressive jurisdictions around the world are transitioning to more resilient, efficient, and diversified renewable energy-based systems. These systems are built on distributed generation and are moving away from baseload and bulk supply designs to smart, digitalized, and highly adaptable distributed generation infrastructure.\n6.We need to understand the alternative.\nMuch research and planning has gone into the whether and how to continue with existing assets of the bulk electricity system. While the alternative of a decentralized, modular built-out based on locally-sourced, -owned, and \u2013operated resources has not been studied in-depth and the benefits are not fully understood or appreciated.\nIt is important that the future of our energy system is based on evidence. Any analysis of options should take into account the full cost and benefits to all people of Ontario\nIn conclusion, we thank the Ministry for allowing us to provide input into the long-term energy planning process. As this process evolves, we would like to support the Ministry\u2019s efforts to study the potential for a low-carbon, decentralized, integrated, and inclusive energy system. In this regards, the Ontario Sustainable Energy Association has started to work on this through the Combined Energy Options Ontario project, an early presentation and executive summary has already been submitted to the Ministry by myself and Nicole Risse ED of OSEA. I recommend that your ministry support this project since it will create a solid basis for future energy planning and decision making.\nSincerely,\nDr. Christine Koenig\n[Original Comment ID: 204817]\n",

I am grateful everyday to be surrounded by the beatiful lakes, forests, and wildlife of Ontario, and I am especially grateful for the health of my family and friends. Growing up across the water from the Pickering Power Plant, I would look throught the beautiful tress to see smoke barreling out of the plant. I am told that there was a time when you could fish off the dock in my backyard.

I am told that there were many more birds, chipmunks, foxes, rabbits, snakes, and spiders than I have seen in my years at that home. But the thing I've been told that I remember most of all was the day my parents told me we had to move becuase my Mother's doctor told her that living so close to the plant was making her health issues worsen.\nSo today I write to you to ask you to make the choice to switch to 100% rebewable energy.

That would be a true cost to the Ontario public which I do not wish to burden future generations with.\nOntario cannot improve this situation on it's own. If Ontario demonstrates we are making an effort to work in this direction it will give other regions confidence that a spirit of cooperation on this issue is possible, and encourage others to pursue their own efforts.\nA shift to a greener economy should be accompanied by a boost in economic activity resulting from the demand for the development of new forms of economic activities and new ways of meeting our needs.\nI believe our economic activity is limited by the form government policy takes at every level under the guidance of neo classical economics, that neo classical economic theory is seriously flawed, and as such represents the major drawback to achieving fast and appropriate responses to this crisis.\nI therefore urge the province of Ontario to unite with other provinces and municipalities to send a clear message to Ottawa that it's cooperation with an appropriate fiscal response is needed, and that our monetary system allows the federal government the fiscal policy space to assist provinces in this task with a strong \"New Deal\" type progressive response which will also help us work towards full employment. We cannot afford to waste any available human resources in the pursuit of the goal of a green economy.\nOur economy and it's future growth prospects cannot afford the burden of paying economic rents to private owners of utility monopolies who would resist change in their pursuit of profit maximisation.

Thousands of cities and communities world wide, including Vancouver and Oxford County, have committed to this transition by 2050.\nGetting rid of coal was an excellent first step, but replacing this with natural gas instead of renewable energy is the wrong direction. Ongoing dependence on fossil fuel generating plants only increases carbon pollution and nuclear, which is now being abandoned world wide, is likewise a much more expensive and dangerous option. Your perception that we should wait for the cost of renewable energy to decline further also doesn't make sense. The maintenance of aging nuclear reactors will ultimately cost a great deal more than renewables. The price for solar, wind and biomass technology has fallen substantially and continues to decline rapidly, so increasing our reliance on renewable energy will ultimately lead to lower electricity bills.\nThis government should provide Ontarians with a fair comparison of all costs associated with nuclear vs renewables and then permit the public to indicate which approach they prefer. Don\u2019t allow lobbyists for the nuclear industry, the shareholders of companies like TransCanada, or the Power Workers Union to influence the decisions you make. Financial analysts state we should invest in renewables now. This could include an investment in the infrastructure required to transmit low cost hydro electricity from Quebec to Ontario. Citibank recently said the world has entered the \"age of renewables\", and Bank of America and General Motors have committed to going 100% renewable.\nFinally, the old tendency to mostly rely on large power producers instead of a more localized generation of electricity must also change. Empowering small businesses, municipalities, and first nations would result in more employment, healthier communities and a more balanced approach to power generation.\n[Original Comment ID: 206410]\n",

        "comment":"Nuclear energy may sound good but imagine the costs of maintaining the storage of radioactive waste for thousands of years. Would we want to be paying the costs for the electricity use of (selfish) civilizations from 1000 BC? The Earth appears stable but actually moves a fair amount over thousands of years. What happens if the containers are breached?\nFossil fuels have served us well but there is no denying it, they wreak havoc on our environment and will eventually run out. They should be used as a stepping stone only. Please reference Global Warming's Terrifying New Math By Bill McKibben. It states that if we want to hit the 2 degree Celsius global warming target, we need to limit our carbon dioxide emissions to 565 gigatons (between now and 2050). The problem, is the amount of carbon already contained in the proven coal, oil, and gas reserves of fossil-fuel companies and countries is 2,795 gigatons. That's approximately 5 times the limit which clearly indicates that we can't wait until all the reserves are used up. We have to put pressure on them to leave most of it in the ground, but with the current business model, they will extract it all. With this in mind, it should be clear that any further investment in a fossil-fuel economy is reckless and extremely risky.\nI would like to see a much higher percentage of renewables in the next 10 years, in the order of 70-90%. This will will gradually remove the demand for non-renewables. Ultimately, 100% renewables will need to be the mix in the next 25 years. I would propose taking aggressive advantage of rooftop solar. It generates electricity right where it is consumed reducing infrastructure costs, produces energy during the day when consumption is highest, has no added real estate cost, and allows citizens to be empowered and participate in the generation process and not just complain.\nIn term of electricity and home heating, a better direction would be the example of Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta. They use a community solar system designed to store abundant solar energy underground during the summer months and distribute the energy to each home for space heating needs during winter months. They also use solar panels for electricity. With no consumables, and zero emissions, their only cost is maintenance.\nThe rest of nature uses the sun as an energy source, why can't humans?\nTime of use pricing is a good step, but real-time pricing would be the ultimate goal. Yes, this means the cost will be high on a cloudy day with no wind. But it is akin to trying to start a campfire in a rainstorm. People should be encouraged to consume when the conditions are right.\nAs a final note, I would like to see tiered pricing brought back (ie. the price goes up after a tier). This means electricity will cover the necessities for all people at a low cost. If someone chooses to be wasteful or extravagant with their electricity consumption, then they can do so at the next tier at a higher cost (I would suggest double the price). Also, there should be lower fixed costs so that people who use tiny amounts of electricity will not be penalized.\n[Original Comment ID: 206413]\n",

Creates a lot of dangerous waste, very difficult to deal with, will have negative consequences on environment). We know in 20 years or so we won't have much choice BUT to use renewables, we may as well get started so we can work out the kinks before we're truly stuck. Why procrasinate? Take a big step, something concrete, and step up and be a leader! I study environmental engineering, so I get that there are big costs associated with this.

Incentives could be offered to stimulate growth in a number of areas:\n- Farmers have the space & the energy requirements to justify a long term investment.\n- Large warehouse operations have the roof space that could be transformed into solar installations leaving good farm land available to produce food. Industrial scale storage technology is progressing to the point that many operations could be largely self sustainable. At a minimum, the building codes should be changed so that no new large warehouses should be built without implementing a renewable energy solution.\n- Additionally, new home building codes should be changed to require, at a minimum, the basic infrastructure (i.e. hard wired) to allow the easy installation of solar panels & a battery storage either at the time of construction or at a future date. The costs of panels & batteries are coming down & the ability to amortise these costs via a long term mortgage makes the investment relatively inexpensive.\n- There should also be mechanisms for existing homes & rental units to make long term investments to lower energy consumption &, where possible, install renewable sources.\n- Larger projects could be manages at a small municipal level where the smart grid would be maintained at a local level without requiring province-wide grid upgrades.\n- Finally, the government should be investing in R&D to develop a HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. The issue with electricity from renewable sources such as solar & wind is the need for storage to address the fact energy production is reliant on the availability of sun & wind. Batteries are expensive, recharging is time-consuming and they require rare earth minerals that present a waste product problem. Hydrogen derived from renewable resources is the perfect storage technology ideally suited for powering vehicles (personal, transport & farm) and providing for the heating requirements for Canadian homes & businesses. Think of gas stations on major highways producing their own fuel and cars & trucks being able to refill the tank in minutes. Let's make Hydrogen R&D our focus so that we can export our knowledge & technology in a future economy.\nEvery November on Remembrance Day we honour the brave soldiers who fought in the wars to confront countries who would have dominated the world and threatened the future of our country. Let's make similar sacrifices today so that future generations will look back to our time and give thanks for the sacrifices we made to insure that they could continue to live on a healthy, sustaining planet Earth.\n[Original Comment ID: 206438]\n",

Natural gas upstream fugitive methane GWP over the next twenty years triples current accounting methods. Additionally, impacts of demand-side activities require \u00a0marginal operation and marginal construction calculation procedures based on locational and temporal system response. It is of utmost priority to generate the accounting protocols and undertake GHG analysis for scenarios.\nCurrent IESO capacity projections for fuel switching are in error by several-fold. If 50% of fossil-fuel heating is converted to air-source heat pumps, Scenario D, the peak demand will be 3 times the current peak and will occur in winter. This would necessitate a massive expansion in generation capacity to serve on demand and idle for most of the time. Natural gas generation to serve this load, would result in increased gas usage hence GHG emissions.\nIf 'conservation' is the first option and includes demand management, then building design and retrofit are the priority activities. Although the fuel and electricity industry are stakeholders that have been consulted, the Ministry has failed to engage building energy engineers in pre-planning analysis. Without doing so, there is no chance that a workable plan will be derived. Without transparent and defensible GHG accounting methods in place, Climate Change policies will have little or perverse influence on outcomes.\n[Original Comment ID: 204879]\n",

Many London homeowners and businesses have expressed concerns about recent electricity price increases and they have strong concerns that this will continue for the future. Unless these concerns are alleviated, there could be challenges with obtaining public acceptance of the Long Term Energy Plan.\n5.The City of London encourages the Province of Ontario to place a greater emphasis on raising \u201cenergy literacy\u201d for both homeowners and businesses in a manner that provides easy-to-understand, open and transparent information on the financial and environmental impacts of energy use and sources of energy used in Ontario. This information needs to come from a trusted and reputable entity that is neutral and unbiased in its assessment and communication of this information. Municipal governments such as the City of London have been playing a role in raising energy literacy at the local level as part of their community energy or climate change action plans.\n6.The City of London continues to encourage the Province of Ontario to take a holistic approach to the design and development of new conservation programs that takes into account the interrelationship between power, heating, cooling, water, and transportation energy needs associated with buildings, facilities, and industrial processes. Conservation programs need to be delivered with a \u201cbuilding as a system\u201d approach, rather than the narrow single-commodity focus usually associated with utility-delivered conservation programs in Ontario.\n7.The City of London encourages the Province of Ontario to relax existing Ontario Energy Board rules that prevent electricity distribution companies and natural gas distribution companies from playing an active role in the implementation of solutions, such as development and ownership of public electric vehicle charging infrastructure and CNG fueling infrastructure.\n[Original Comment ID: 206455]\n",

The facts have already been confirmed, we are killing the planet, so why aren't we doing anything about it. It's being done in other countries. Switzerland and Germany have been using renewable resources for years and are far closer to there targets than Canada, so we have no excuse for lagging behind.\nNature and the environment have been suffering from our lust for energy since before the fossil fuel industry's inception. Before oil was discovered in the ground, humans destroyed entire species of seabirds partly to harvest their oil. By the 19th century, the hunting of seabirds for fat deposits reached industrial levels, contributing to the extinction of the Great Auk among other species. Now oil spills and pollution are a huge threat to all living things.\nOur insatiable consumption of energy has destroyed species, created irreparable damage to the land and poisoned the air and water. The only excuses for pursuing fossil fuel projects are greed on the part of the industry and governments, and the apathy of the people.\nCanada is especially rich in renewable power sources such as wind, solar and geothermal, and has the tools, technology, ideas and innovation to utilize them. We can build a clean economy that will create long-term jobs, reduce extreme weather events, improve the well-being of all species, reclaim habitats, and reduce boom-and-bust cycles in the energy sector. We also have the wealth and knowledge to help other countries make the shift to renewable energy.\nThe sooner one province steps up to the plate, the sooner the others will follow.

Glen Thibeault,\nWe appreciate the opportunity to inform you of Bruce Power\u2019s relationship with Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) as the Ontario Government is reviewing their Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP).\nWHC promotes and certifies habitat conservation and management on corporate lands through partnerships and education. WHC Conservation Certification programs take corporate sustainability goals and translate them into tangible and measurable on-the-ground actions. Through collaborations for conservation with corporate employees, other conservation organizations, government agencies and community members, WHC programs focus on healthy ecosystems and connected communities. Over 700 WHC-assisted wildlife habitat and conservation education programs are found in 48 states and 17 countries.\nWHC\u2019s unique model of working with business has been honed over 28 years working with over 100 of the world\u2019s leading corporations including Ontario Power Generation, TransCanada, MEG Energy, and many others.\u00a0 We strive to empower business to implement meaningful conservation projects on their properties that engage employees and community members. WHC Conservation Certification programs exceed regulatory requirements and demonstrate a dedication to voluntary stewardship unique to the corporate leaders we work with. These projects range in size, complexity and location and span industry sectors. A full record of WHC-certified programs can be found on our website at http:\/\/www.wildlifehc.org\/knowledge-center\/conservation-registry\/.\nBruce Power has been a member of WHC since 2014 and has demonstrated not only good corporate citizenship, but also important community engagement.

        "comment":"The only logical plan to develop Ontaio's energy resources is to immediately transition to 100% renewable sources of energy. If we acknowledge the world's current understanding of human impact on climate change, then the only way for Ontario, and the rest of the world, to have a healthy and proliferous future is to protect the environment, and use renewable energy. All aspects of human society - including public health and the economy - are directly linked to the health of the environment, and the environment is being quickly degraded by non renewable energy sources.\nAny investment in non renewable resources is unsustainable, and therefore must come to an end in the near future. With this in mind, if Ontario were to include non renewable resources in its energy plan, even while transitioning to renewable energy, the benefits could only be short term and inefficient. Since there is no way to avoid the inevitable transition to renewable energy, the best way to use Ontario's resources is to invest them in long lasting and profitable renewable energy sources. Dependence on fossil fuels cannot last forever, and the old excuses of economics and gradual transitions are no longer believable or acceptable. Eventually, Ontario will be forced to accept the economic impact of an energy transition, and the longer we wait, the worse that impact will be.\nMany Canadians look to the liberal government to provide a reasonable and sustainable approach to Canada's environmental challenges, and in this case the only reasonable option is renewable energy. This means that in order to remain relevant, the liberal government must accept and embrace the necessity of sustainability in Ontario's energy plans.\n[Original Comment ID: 206487]\n",

I was convinced that by the time I was an adult, all houses would be solar powered. We have the technology. And the people of Ontario have the will. So it's now in your hands. I want Ontario\u2019s next Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP) to acknowledge that going 100% renewable is a viable option for Ontario\u2019s energy future. More and more communities, countries and companies are opting to be responsible and choose sustainability. Ontario\u2019s next energy plan should put policies in place to enable citizens, communities and First Nations to choose renewable, sustainable energy models.\nAlternative Approaches\nI know you will be getting many messages to empower everyone from citizens and co-ops to municipalities and First Nations to become energy producers. And a recent government study showed we have the potential to cost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30% by 2035. But I think we can do even better. I have long wondered why building codes don't limit the amount of energy that a new building can draw from the grid, depending on zoning. For example, all residential homes could have the same cap on energy from the grid, requiring larger homes to build in more energy efficiency and\/or generation of renewable power. But even more effective would be energy caps on commercial and industrial buildings, forcing them to factor the environment into the cost of their building plans.\nCome Clean on Nuclear Costs\nThe biggest barrier to shifting Ontario to 100% renewable energy is the government\u2019s current commitment to nuclear power.\nWhile the cost of renewables keeps declining, the cost of nuclear power has only ever gone up.

For the youth of Ontario, myself and a great number, if not most of my peers, and indeed for many others of various backgrounds and social situations, but especially for the youth, climate change is ever more at the front of our minds. The Paris agreement was a great step forward, but let it be clearly stated that this agreement is not ambitious enough; it does not go far enough. This is based on the scientific evidence. Never mind about our children and grandchildren, we are worried for our own futures on this planet! With every passing year we distance ourselves more and more from the winters of my own childhood - where a white winter was all but guaranteed. The globe is warming at an alarming rate, and so our home is becoming less and less recognizable.\nIf positive and sufficient action is not taken soon, it is all but certain that the land on which we live will be completely unrecognizable by the end of our lifetime. Something needs to be done, and soon!\nAs a citizen of Canada, and a life-time resident of this great province, I beseech you to commit Ontario to an 100% renewable future, on a timeline far more ambitious than what currently exists. The election result south of the border was a sore blow to any remaining hope for a sufficient attack to be made to tackle climate change, but this is all the more reason for more action from the rest of us. Let Ontario lead Canada to a renewable future, and serve as inspiration for the rest of the provinces and territories.\nWe owe it to ourselves, to our planet, and to the future of the human race to take affirmative action now. Please Mr. Minister, use your influence and authority to set Ontario on the track to 100% renewable future (and let that be the near future). Demonstrate to the people of our province and our country that there are at least some politicians thinking for the long-term well-being of their constituents.\n[Original Comment ID: 204903]\n",

        "comment":"GREY-BRUCE LABOUR COUNCIL\nRepresenting the Needs of Working People Since 1956\nCelebrating 60 Years of Building Communities\nGREY BRUCE LABOUR COUNCIL\nSUBMISSION TO\nTHE LONG-TERM ENERGY PLAN REVIEW\nDECEMBER, 2016\nWHO WE ARE\nOriginally chartered as the Owen Sound and District Labour Council, the Grey Bruce Labour Council (GBLC) was chartered to the Canadian Labour Congress in 1956. A labour council is an association of labour unions, lodges, associations, federations, or union branches in any given area. Most commonly, they represent unions in a geographical area. This can be at the district, city, or regional level. A list of the member Unions, the purpose, and objectives of the Grey Bruce Labour Council are included in this submission.\nSeveral of our member unions represent members in electrical utilities. The following comments on Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan are based on the knowledge, expertise and experience of our membership in the energy sector.\nThe GBLC participated in the Guelph session (and kept abreast of other sessions) along with representatives from our member unions.\nThe format was good with many views being expressed on the topics with some agreement expressed on several issues.\nAn observation at the Guelph session is that the system does have one flaw. On the wrap up the facilitators only reported on issues that lined up with the LTEP discussion document. Issues where the group did not agree or suggested improvements were not reported.\nOVERVIEW\nConsumers expect to have reliable and affordable electricity. They also expect that it will be produced and delivered to them in accordance with all applicable environmental regulations and be readily available to them today, tomorrow and in the future.\nThe GBLC believes that striking the right balance amongst a range of electricity supply sources can fulfill these expectations. This means decision-makers must be realistic about the trade-offs amongst the various supply opportunities.\u00a0 Each supply option must be considered based on its environmental impacts, cost, and contribution to meeting identified electricity system needs (baseload, intermediate and peak demands), job creation[, other economic benefits, safety, and the willingness of the community to host the facility that is sited or being sited.\nOntario\u2019s challenge is finding the best way to add \/ exploit new generation technology while building on its existing low carbon base of nuclear and hydro-electric generation to ensure a clean, affordable and secure energy supply for the long-term.\u00a0 The GBLC submits that nuclear energy must continue to play its current role in Ontario\u2019s supply mix\u2014providing over fifty percent of the province\u2019s electricity now and into the future.\u00a0 The environmental and economic benefits are too compelling to do otherwise.\nCURRENT STATE OF ONTARIO\u2019S ELECTRICITY SYSTEM\nHistorically, Ontario\u2019s supply mix has benefitted environmentally and economically from the province\u2019s hydroelectric and nuclear generation. Together these supply sources have delivered low-cost, low-carbon, reliable and safe electricity that has helped to make Ontario the industrial heartland of Canada.\nOntario\u2019s closure of its demand-following coal generating stations and transition to wind, solar and backup natural gas generation has resulted in a number of conspicuous impacts.\nGas Emissions: With over seventy percent of the province\u2019s electricity supply coming from hydroelectric and nuclear generation, Ontario has one of the lowest carbon electricity system footprints in the world.\u00a0 CANDU reactors provide over 50 percent of this electricity.\nEach year CANDU reactors help avoid about 90 million tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is about the same amount as taking 81 percent of Canada\u2019s cars off the road.\nThe closure of Ontario\u2019s coal stations was positioned as diminishing the carbon footprint even further.\u00a0 Even with the closure of coal stations, the province\u2019s increased reliance on natural gas generation has compromised its ability to achieve Ontario\u2019s GHG targets. More than seventy percent of the time wind and solar generation are idle, and not producing and the shortfall in achieving GHG emission targets can be attributed to the role natural gas generation plays backing up wind and solar. Building more wind and solar generation will require more natural gas generation, which will result in more GHG emissions.\nElectricity Prices: Looking at a variety of analyses, including one from Ontario\u2019s Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), Ontario\u2019s electricity prices are on a trajectory to continue to increase. Residential, commercial and industrial consumers have reacted negatively to these rising prices. High electricity prices are not conducive to sustaining existing jobs or creating new ones. In the experience of the GBLC, rising electricity prices have put low income citizens at risk of having to choose between paying electricity bills and buying food.\nEnergy Security: Exploiting existing low carbon nuclear and hydro-electric sources in Ontario provides security of supply. The exploitation of these sources must be undertaken before any further dependence on wind and solar is undertaken. Ensuring that existing sources of nuclear and hydro-electric are exploited also limits further dependence on natural gas. Natural gas supplies are not entirely in the control of the province and as a result are exposed to security of supply issues.\nThis full exploitation equates to refurbishment of all Darlington and Bruce Nuclear units, operation of the Pickering Nuclear units for as long as possible and refurbishment along with new hydro-electric units.\nReliability: The renewal of Ontario\u2019s electricity system is intended to replace ageing equipment and assets and to take advantage of new technologies that will modernize the system at the same time.\u00a0 Adding new intermittent wind and solar generation, embedded generation and micro-grids and providing consumers with smart meters have precipitated the need for more \u201csmart\u201d control technologies to maintain reliability. Besides\u00a0 adding undefined costs to the investments required to renew Ontario\u2019s electricity system, new operating rules and regulations have had to be developed.\u00a0 All of this makes it more challenging and expensive to maintain the future reliability of Ontario\u2019s electricity system.\nEconomic Growth: Real economic growth and investment will be generated by the complete refurbishment of all units at Darlington and Bruce Nuclear Generating Stations. There is also a significant economic stimulus and GHG reduction advantage by keeping the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station operational until 2024.\u00a0 The extent of the growth and investment is of[ significant benefit to Ontario. As per the Conference Board of Canada, the economic activity from refurbishing the Darlington Station will generate, on average, more than 11,000 jobs per year between 2014 and 2023. Ontario workers and businesses are expected to receive 96 percent of the economic benefits. With major component replacement, already underway at the Bruce generating stations and the refurbishment of the Bruce units set to begin in 2020 similar job creation and investment is expected.\nFor more than a century, Ontario has focused on developing a secure electricity supply as the foundation of its economy. Nuclear energy has, and will continue to be a major provider of reliable, low-carbon, low-cost electricity for decades to come. Recent job creation numbers for Ontario suggest the province is doing well creating new employment however most of these new jobs are part-time. Ontario continues to face a difficult challenge in replacing the over 200,000 high value manufacturing jobs that disappeared during the last decade. Continuing to rely on low-cost, low-carbon baseload nuclear energy is Ontario\u2019s best option for all the foregoing and to create sustainable full time employment.\nPursuing firm imports from Quebec to displace low-carbon nuclear or to supplement our province\u2019s variable, expensive wind energy doesn\u2019t make environmental or economic sense. A key study finding, indicated that the required intertie investments would be economically undermined by the lack of winter generation capacity in Quebec and the forecasted future generation shortages in both provinces. Required transmission upgrades are estimated to cost up to $150 million per year, which is 50 percent higher than the cost of the single cycle gas turbine alternative previously identified and recommended by Ontario\u2019s Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO).\u00a0 The IESO\u2019s earlier analyses also concluded the firm import option was too expensive\nPublic Acceptance: Ontario\u2019s nuclear stations are situated in supportive communities.\u00a0 Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and Bruce Power have invested significant time and resources to establish solid relationships with the communities.\u00a0 Local support is evident for the refurbishment of the reactors at the Bruce and OPG. The GBLC is a longtime supporter of Bruce Power and since 2001 has appeared as a positive intervener in front of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) numerous times.\nLocal support for Bruce Power and Nuclear Power is demonstrated by the significant uptake by the public of the petition showing this local support. This petition is supported by the GBLC, the Canadian Nuclear Workers\u2019 Council, the Power Workers\u2019 Union, the Society of Energy Professionals, Young Generation Nuclear, Women in Nuclear, Bruce Power and the Bruce Power Pensioners Association and with numbers rising it has already been signed by close to 6,000 people.\nOPG enjoys solid community support for refurbishment of all reactors at the Darlington site. By comparison, public opposition to new wind power developments has been evident across rural Ontario. It appears that the coal fired Nanticoke and Lambton Generating Stations will be decommissioned. Despite community support for the Nanticoke and Lambton generating stations to be converted to renewable, carbon neutral biomass and natural gas, it appears these stations will be decommissioned. The reliability of these units would exceed that of intermittent wind and solar and would contribute less in GHG as the biofuel would be the primary fuel source.\nThe GBLC submits that investments in the renewal and expansion of Ontario\u2019s nuclear generating capacity must remain the first priority of the province\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan.\u00a0 These investments are the best way to lower greenhouse gas emissions, provide stable electricity, and long-term energy security, job creation and economic prosperity.\nCost: Refurbishing all of Ontario\u2019s remaining reactors will help replace the 3,200 megawatts of GHG emission-free electricity that will be lost with the closure of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station in 2024.\nEnsuring Ontario continues to have reliable low-carbon supply nuclear generation positions our province to benefit in other ways.Transportation is Ontario\u2019s biggest source of GHG emissions.\u00a0 The base load GHG emission-free electricity provided by CANDU reactors aligns well with the overnight off-peak charging of electric vehicles. Ontario\u2019s CANDU reactors could also play a role backstopping hydroelectric generation in other provinces as well as helping our fossil-fuel dependent neighbors in the United States.\nEconomic Benefits: The economic benefits of refurbishing all of Ontario\u2019s nuclear reactors in addition to building two new CANDU reactors are equally clear.\nAnalyses show that these investments would be advantageous for Ontario\u2019s economy as this province hosts the majority of Canada\u2019s $6 billion-a-year industry and its 160 supply chain companies and 60,000 direct and indirect jobs.\u00a0 Additional benefits would flow to Ontario\u2019s colleges and universities that are involved in nuclear research, development and training and student enrollment in nuclear related disciplines.\nThe Strapolec analysis indicates that refurbishing Ontario\u2019s reactors along with the construction of two new nuclear reactors at Darlington is estimated to provide a $60 billion dollar net incremental benefit to Ontario\u2019s economy compared to building more wind generation.\u00a0 The impact of carbon pricing was not included in the study, such pricing would be expected to further favor nuclear generation.\nThis $60 billion net incremental benefit includes $27 billion in savings to ratepayers and $29 billion in direct investment in Ontario, including the creation of 100,000 more person years of employment in high-value jobs many of which would be in the advanced manufacturing sector.\nOther Aspects of the LTEP\nThe GBLC further submits that Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan should focus on investments that: \u2022 Maximize the value of Ontario\u2019s existing generation, transmission and distribution assets; \u2022 Spur manufacturing and expedite economic recovery and growth;\n\u2022 Ensure sound planning that is based on rigorous analyses that accounts for the costs of GHG emissions, prices carbon\u00a0 and provides for comprehensive, transparent public consultation.\n\u2022 Renew and modernize the transmission and distribution network including\u00a0 smart grid technology deployment that facilities electric vehicles and electric powered public transit systems.\n\u2022 Provide assistance with plans to make the local Canada Post offices community locations for charging of electric vehicles\n- Add renewable, carbon-neutral biomass as an energy resource by converting Ontario\u2019s Nanticoke and Lambton coal fueled generating stations to use biomass, along with natural gas;\n\u2022 Develop Ontario\u2019s remaining cost-effective hydroelectric potential sites;\n\u2022 Deliver conservation programs that are based on realistic targets, cost benefit-analyses; and, \u2022 Ensure Ontario has the skilled workforce it will need to operate and maintain its electricity system in the future.\n\u2022Furthermore, the GBLC calls for a moratorium on any additional wind and solar generation development until cost\/benefit analyses are completed that include;\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the full costs (including backup generation);\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 impact on system reliability;\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 GHG emissions; realistic job creation numbers; and\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 realistic economic-spin off impacts\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fuel conversion of Nanticoke and Lambton generating stations before any further expansion of the natural gas generation fleet\n-the environmental impacts of decommissioning solar and wind farms due to premature aging of components\n- excess capacity issues are addressed while continuing to fully exploit Ontario\u2019s nuclear and hydro-electric generations sources.\nGBLC Conclusions and Recommendations\nWe suggest that a diverse mix of generation is required but the LTEP discussion document must revisit the proposed mix.\nThe GBLC strongly suggest that a Labour Union advisory committee be established to advise the Minister of Energy on the LTEP for Ontario.\nThe GBLC recommends the following:\n\u2022The amount of Wind and Solar produced electricity should be capped.\n\u2022Pump storage hydro-electric stations be seriously considered.\n\u2022The refurbishments of Darlington proceed as planned.\n\u2022The refurbishment of the Bruce Power Units proceed as planned.\n\u2022The life extension of Pickering NPP be approved.\n\u2022A new build NPP be approved for the Darlington Site.\n\u2022Bio energy be expanded for power peaking\n\u2022Existing coal power plants be considered for gas conversion.\nThe GBLC is prepared to answer any questions or concerns you may have with our submission.\nList of GBLC Union Affiliates:\nPower Workers\u2019 Union, CUPE 1000\nSociety of Energy Professionals (SEP)\nOntario Secondary School Teachers Federation (OSSTF)\nOntario English Catholic Teachers Association (OECTA)\nUnifor\nOntario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU)\nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW)\nElementary Teachers Federation of Ontario (ETFO)\nNational Farmers Union (NFU)\nService Employees International Union (SEIU)\nCanadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE)\nOntario Nurses Association (ONA)\nInternational Woodworkers Association (IWA)\nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW)\nCanadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW)\nCanadian Union of Skilled Workers (CUSW)\nList of Associated Organizations:\nChartered to the Canadian Labour Congress\nMember of the Ontario Federation of Labour Executive Council\nOn the board of the Four County Planning Board\nOn the board of the Bruce Grey United Way\nPurpose and Objective of a Labour Council;\nThe Grey Bruce Labour Council (GBLC) represents thousands of unionized workers across Bruce and Grey Counties.

        "comment":"Ontario's next Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP) should going aim for 100% renewable energy as the way of the future. It is vital that Ontario be a leader in reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions through the use of renewable energy. Ontario's plan should put policies and incentives in place that enable citizens and communities to make choices that will reduce their energy consumption and use renewable clean choices.\nEnergy conservation and efficiency need to be the number one priority for all energy decisions. How can we reduce energy demand - building code for energy efficient houses is one very easily low hanging-fruit.\nThe LTEP should also empower citizens, muncipalities, cooperatives, and First Nations to be energy produces.\u00a0 Municipalities should be using the methane that they capture through treatment process and using the heat and electricity that they can generate rather than flaring, new landfills should be designed to capture emissions, small scale biogas systems for food waste and manures should be promoted, it should be easy to install wind and solar energy systems. Currently the Ontario government relies on nuclear energy for a large proportion of it's power and this needs to change - renewable energy is getting cheaper and many nuclear plants in Ontario now require very expensive maintenance. A fair comparison of the total costs of nuclear to alternatives should be made.\nRecently large solar and wind projects were cancelled because we have too much energy and are exporting it at a cost. However, in 2013 Ontario's energy plan committed to closing the Pickering nuclear station between 2017 and 2020 but now the government has annouced they will continue to operate until 2014. Most of Pickering's output is suplus and exported to Michigan at a loss - why is this happening when renewable clean energy solutions are being stopped? I am not saying all nuclear is bad - but when renewable cheaper clean alternatives exist - they should be the first choice.\nIt should also be easy to install geothermal at homes and businesses. And micro-hydro should also be considered. I live in a town with a canal with many damns on it, none of them harness the energy they produce.\n[Original Comment ID: 206559]\n",

        "comment":"Hon. Glenn Thibeault\nMinister of Energy\n4th Floor, Hearst Block\n900 Bay St.\nToronto, Ontario\nM7A 2E1\nDear Mr. Thiebeault,\nAs founder of the Butterfly Gardens of Saugeen Shores (BGOSS), I am sending this letter to you on behalf of our organizations support for Bruce Power and their role in Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan.\nWho we are:\nButterfly Gardens of Saugeen Shores (BGOSS), is a volunteer community organization whose mandate is to care for and protect Monarch Butterflies and pollinators. Monarch butterflies are a species of special concern because of habitat loss, misinformation about their host plant; milkweed, deforestation and the extensive use of herbicides throughout Canada and the United States. BGOSS began in 2015 to assist Monarchs by planting native plants in select pods throughout our community.\nOur mandate has 3 guiding principles:\n\u2022provide a food source for Monarchs and other pollinators\n\u2022enhance the visitors experience in Saugeen Shores\n\u2022educate people on the plight of Monarch butterflies and native gardening\nLike many community organizations, BGOSS had a vision to better its community, help a species at risk and to engage people in its activities. We gained early support from the town, a service club and a provincial park friends group. Then, along came Bruce Power who listened to our ideas and liked our attention to environmental stewardship. The support and partnership of Bruce Power, allowed our organization to fulfill its mandate financially and to accomplish its purpose in a more timely fashion.\nWhat we have accomplished:\nIn the spring of 2015, the Butterfly Gardens of Saugeen Shores, with 60 volunteers, planted over 1,400 plants in a series of 13 pods throughout Saugeen Shores. The largest pods are along the Lake Huron shoreline in the newly created Captain Spence Path in Southampton. Other pods are located at: Saugeen First Nation, MacGregor Point Provincial Park, Perkins Park, and the Bruce County Museum and Cultural Centre. All of these pods have been certified and registered as Monarch Way Stations. With the support of Bruce Power we were able to create social media and marketing materials to help inform and educate the public about our role in protecting the environment in Saugeen Shores. Bruce Power was also instrumental in partnering with BGOSS to allow us to attend local school Earth Day events. At these events we were able to share with school children the importance of planting native plants.\nIn the fall of 2015 BGOSS conducted several Monarch tagging days. These were open events for the community to attend. Bruce Power employees participated in these events and helped us during our week long planting in the spring.\nIn 2016, our second year of operation, we were greeted with news that one of our tagged Monarchs (from the fall of 2015), was recovered in Mexico, -- a distance of over 5,000 km and some 5 months later. Bruce Power once again showed their commitment toward our community and the environment by actively supporting our new plantings, and sponsoring our educational communication materials. BGOSS created 3 new pods along the Saugeen Rail Trail and created professional signage at each pod with an accompanying map on our web site. We developed a model for community engagement by training 35 volunteers to become Pod Squad Ambassadors.\u00a0 Our Pod Squad Ambassadors became land stewards for each of our 17 pods. Collectively, they amassed more than 2,500 hours of community engagement by planting plants, maintaining our pods, educating the public and assisting in our programs.\nAnother highlight was the installation of a mural at Perkins Park in Southampton. This mural, created in partnership with Southampton Rotary and the Southampton Art Centre, depicts the life cycle of the Monarch and its north and south migratory routes. To further promote BGOSS, Bruce Power submitted photos and write-ups on our initiatives for the 2016 and 2017 Wildlife Habitat Councils\u2019 desktop calendar.\nValue to Community:\nBruce Power has effectively communicated with BGOSS throughout our 2 years of operations. They genuinely care and they want to know how they can help. We found this approach refreshing. They don\u2019t just hand out grant money to worthy community organizations. They have rolled up their sleeves and assisted Butterfly Gardens of Saugeen Shores with maintenance and planting of native plants, they attended our meetings, shared their resources with us and have truly cared about our purpose and its value to the community. They have indeed embraced the concept of community: working together to create a better place for people to live and work in. We learned early on in our partnership with Bruce Power, that they care about the environment, -- not only locally in Bruce County, but, in our situation, throughout North America, as the plight of the Monarch Butterflies is a continental issue.\nWith the assistance of Bruce Power, our dedicated volunteers and partners, Butterfly Gardens of Saugeen Shores believes that we can make a difference in the lives of the Monarch butterflies.\nPlease accept this letter of support for Bruce Power and their role in Ontario\u2019s Long Term Energy Plan.\nSincerely,\nButterfly Gardens of Saugeen Shores\n[Original Comment ID: 206611]\n",

Climate Change is a global issue that can be solved by acting locally. Ontario\u2019s next energy plan should empower everyone from citizens and co-ops to municipalities and First Nations to become energy producers.\nThe biggest barrier to shifting Ontario to 100% renewable energy is the government\u2019s current commitment to nuclear power. While the cost of renewables keeps declining, the cost of nuclear power has only ever gone up. Almost all of Pickering\u2019s output is surplus and exported to Michigan at a loss. \u00a0This is driving up energy costs.\nPickering\u2019s continued operation also puts the public at risk. Ontario has not updated its nuclear emergency plans since the Fukushima disaster, which had devastating consequences on the entire Pacific Ocean and every continent touched by the Pacific Ocean. \u00a0I want the government to keep its promise to close Pickering before 2020.\nShutting Pickering down should be a first step in Ontario\u2019s long-term transition to renewable energy. \u00a0The second step is educating and empowering all our citizens on the steps they can take at home to reduce their environmental footprints, for the future of humanity is at stake.\nSincerely,\nA concerned Global Citizen who lives in the GTA\n[Original Comment ID: 204934]\n",

If one of these reactors were to fail and melt down (as we have seen others melt down), the lake on which it sits would be poisoned with radioactivity for eons.\nEven if there was no nuclear accident, the disposal of nuclear waste presents a huge ongoing hazard that is really totally unnecessary. And the life of spent nuclear fuel goes on for generation upon generation. We are poisoning our children into untold future generations.\nWe don't need to do this!

This is thanks to many factors, but one is ambitious targets for energy consumption in our Building Codes.\nI'm taking the time to write you this because I strongly believe that 100% renewable energy is the type of ambitious policy thinking that is best for our province. I know from following the work of Standford professor Marc Jacobson, as well as industry leaders in renewable energy technologies, that these aren't pipe dream ideas. I also understand a bit about the hidden social costs of nuclear energy (how much carbon goes into building and operating a plant and who will underwrite a nuclear power plant), so I don't believe that Nuclear should be part of the future. I won't even waste my breath on fossil fuels (other than to point out the obvious, that there is no rational or moral argument for investing in more fossil fuels when you consider 100% renewable energy as possible)\nI am a passionate Canadian and I feel very strongly that without government policy that somewhat reflects public opinion, our democracy becomes a sham. Public pressure on the forming of this policy may be the only democratic instrument within the larger interplay of private actors that can end up affecting all Ontarians. As such, crafting a policy that reflects what the people want, as opposed to strong private lobbies, is fundamental to a healthy and functioning society.

The methane loss in fracked gas, not to mention the threat of earthquakes and water loss and contamination, make it a very bad choice. We need to be off all fossil fuels too quickly to justify any major new investments - even if it's not fracked.\nSupport local energy independence through renewable sources. This is the best chance for long-term prosperity in smaller and more remote communities.\nPrioritize conservation and energy efficiency to the highest degree. Every kWh not used is a huge savings in cost and, in almost all scenarios, greenhouse gas emissions. Building codes should change to require new-builds to be close to energy neutral. Bigger subsidies for lower-income Canadians and penalties for higher income Canadians should be implemented to help with this.\nShow people that higher electricity prices are reasonable; polluters should pay. We've got a distorted, fossil-fuel friendly market, because the cost of environmental damage has been externalized. This must end.\nThe pipeline principles are sound - except that no pipeline company comes close to meeting them and none could ever adequately cover the environmental costs. It's 2016. Building Energy East would mean 33 Gt CO2 per year just to mine and prepare the product, effectively wiping out Ontario's coal-fired gains. It's too late to build major new fossil fuel infrastructure. Period. Canadian business leaders, the World Bank, and many others point out the need to act swiftly on climate change. Climate leaders can't approve of new pipelines. Ontario should strenuously oppose this if the embattled NEB ever resumes its hearings. Kudos to Ontario for listening to Ontarians and being critical of Energy East.\nPursue local energy storage and smart-grid options that help get Ontario off fossil fuels.\nPublic ownership and engagement is needed in the transition to carbon-free fuels. Despite the political danger, science shows that we must transition. Most of the necessary technology exists. Help Ontarians reduce energy demand (public transit, bike lanes, energy retrofitting). Make Ontario a leader in the new economy by incentivizing everything that's taking us in the right direction and discouraging\/pricing everything that isn't. (Support lower-income Canadians).\nWealthier Ontarians will need to pay for this transition. Don't hesitate to use fee differentials or progressive energy pricing, as well as higher taxes, to facilitate this. It's in all of our best interests.\nNuclear is vastly expensive. Use funds instead to build distributed renewable or to support communities to build and own their own.\nGet the energy audit before sale program in place immediately. Subsidize the cost for the first two years to avoid backlash, but then transfer it to the seller. We'll get used to it. It's a great way to get people motivated to do something.\nSet reduction targets for all fossil fuels. Force Union Gas to stop scaring customers with \"your rates are going up because of the government\" messages. It's exactly the wrong message. Mandate energy suppliers to carry a message about why reductions are necessary and about how the pricing reflects the damage and is meant to help consumers reduce consumption and gradually transition away from fossil fuels.\nTrade cleaner energy to reduce dirtier energy. Phase out nuclear as it becomes expensive to refurbish. Divert funds to renewables. Distributed renewables are the future. Pursue a renewables-only as quickly as possible policy. We're not trying to change the world, we're now trying to save it.\nEnhance the supports for Indigenous communities to lead in renewable energy generation. Look at it as reparations, a way to right past wrongs and prepare all of Ontario for the future.\nIf you had to install a solar hot water system to be able to have a hot shower, would you? Enact policies for Ontario to be carbon-neutral in energy by 2035. We can do it. It will change our lives. They will almost certainly be better. This is our challenge and there can be nothing that stops us!\nBe bold. Be leaders.\n[Original Comment ID: 204996]\n",

Despite this, the government\u2019s past energy plans have made no requirement for nuclear projects to undergo public review against alternatives.

        "comment":"SPEAKING OUT FOR A 100% RENEWABLE ONTARIO\nWhile the Ontario government is holding a public review of its next energy plan, it isn\u2019t asking the right questions to put Ontario on the course to 100% renewables.\nThis is intentional: the government\u2019s current energy policies are designed to protect Ontario\u2019s existing outdated and dirty power system. We want a new energy system that empowers citizens and communities to switch to 100% renewable energy.\nClearly, most of the questions are designed to discourage people from speaking out in favour of renewable energy. For example, it asks how we can \u201charness\u201d nuclear power to meet future energy needs. Whenever faced with such questions, the government needs to be told \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s the wrong question to get us to 100% renewables.\u201d\nHere are some key messages the government needs to hear:\n\u2022Ontario should join the global movement toward 100% renewable energy.\n\u2022Ontario\u2019s next energy plan needs to come clean on the true cost of nuclear power and help citizens and communities to empower themselves with renewable energy.\n\u2022Ontario\u2019s next energy plan needs to remove barriers to citizens and communities becoming energy self-sufficient.\n\u2022I want Ontario to take the renewable path to a low-carbon future.\n\u2022Going 100% renewable is the right path for Ontario to fight climate change and end our reliance on risky and costly nuclear power.\nOn nuclear power:\n\u2022The next energy plan needs to plan for replacing our existing reactors with renewable energy.\n\u2022The next energy plan should require nuclear projects to be compared to renewable energy options.\n\u2022All future nuclear projects should be independently and publicly reviewed.\n\u2022Nuclear power creates radioactive waste and the risk of a Fukushima type accident.\n\u2022Ontario\u2019s next energy plan should acknowledge that operating nuclear plants on the Great Lakes and in the Greater Toronto Area is an unneeded risk.\nOn Conservation:\n\u2022The top priority of the next energy plan should be reducing energy demand wherever possible.\n\u2022The next energy plan should pursue all affordable conservation.\n\u2022A recent government study found Ontario could cost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30% by 2035.\nOn Renewables:\n\u2022Ontario\u2019s next energy plan needs to ensure Ontarians can take advantage of the declining cost of renewables.\n\u2022After conservation, renewable energy should be the top priority of Ontario\u2019s next energy plan.\nOn the electrification of transportation and heating:\n\u2022I support electrifying transport and heating to displace fossil fuels, but conservation and renewables should be used to address any increased electricity demand.\n[Original Comment ID: 205016]\n",

        "comment":"To Whom It May Concern:\nI believe that the most efficient and sustainable use of public capital spending on energy (or Ontario Hydro spending) when it comes to energy generation and energy distribution utilizes alternative energy sources that are renewable and sustainable and do NOT require the use of fossil fuels or potentially hazardous nuclear fuel.\nWith the vast sums of money that have been spent on nuclear plants and will potentially be spent on retrofitting older nuclear plants, given the current technological advancement of current technologies and new technologies that are pending in the next few years, I believe that we can follow the example of Germany and use a lot more solar and\/or wind generated energy (or better yet, new state of the art alternative energy sources).\nThe Ontario government could encourage each home (where feasible) to put solar energy panels on their roof along with a small quiet vertical wind turbine. \u00a0Along with the battery wall packs (e.g. Tesla\u2019s 14kWh PowerWall https:\/\/www.tesla.com\/en_CA\/powerwall#design ), the home would not only be self-sufficient but would typically be able to contribute to the grid during the day as well (when there are peak energy requirements).\nIf the Ontario government would invest in the cost effective manufacturing of state of the art solar panels, solar shingles, and small vertical wind turbines (along with the electronics for using such sources) in massive volume, the price will be very reasonable per kilowatt hour generated (and that price will continue to drop as technology drives greater energy conversation efficiencies).\nIf the government were to grant the average Ontario homeowner with one third of the costs (e.g. $10,000 for a $30,000 system) for the maximum energy generation for the home, for every one billion dollars that would be spent on refitting nuclear plants and improving distribution lines, 100,000 Ontario homes (or ~400,000 Ontarians) would now be energy elf-sufficient AND they would be able to provide excess power back to the grid. \u00a0In reality, the government would most likely provide a 1\/3 grant based on the nameplate power the system can generate.\nWith the age and inherent problems with our current energy distribution grid in North America and how susceptible it is to going down (think 2004 for example, ice storms, one part of the grid pulling down another part of the grid due to e.g. transformer failures, etc.) \u00a0, it is wise to ensure Ontarians have the ability to generate their own energy on a sustainable basis.\nMoreover, Ontarians with their own energy generation facility would provide a lot of additional jobs in Ontario, especially if there was an incentive to Ontario companies to provide the solar cells, wind turbines, electrical connections and controllers, etc.\nThe Ontario Government may also consider legislation requiring mandatory solar cell shingles on all new homes from here on in until a better technology comes along.\nElon Musk (Tesla Motors) has stated in November, 2016 that the cost of using solar shingles on a roof (new home or a home that needs to be re-shingled) will be the same or LESS than the cost of traditional shingles. \u00a0This is BEFORE the benefit of the generated electricity. \u00a0Why would not every new home use this technology?\nThe Ontario Government also needs to get rid of all the legislative and \u201crules and regulations\u201d red tape that prevents small energy operators from feeding their renewable energy to the grid. \u00a0A small energy producers should be able to get a permit and be connected to the grid in one week or less, not the current long drawn out system that actually discourages small power generators from bringing their power to the grid.\nAlso, there are other better alternative energy devices that have been invented that have been suppressed by larger corporations seeking to protect their profitable energy profits. \u00a0The Ontario government needs to work for the people, not the large corporations. \u00a0These older and new energy devices must be allowed to come forward for the benefit of all of humanity; it provides a competitive advantage for Ontarians if we have cheap, dependable energy\/electricity. \u00a0The Ontario Government needs to do all in its power to make this happen and encourage more entrepreneurial development of alternative energy.\nWith solar shingles on Ontario\u2019s homes (and small vertical wind generators for the times when it is NOT sunny but windy instead) along with a \u201cTesla like\u201d PowerWall 14kWh battery pack, we can generate a lot of electricity for homes and electric cars with the excess going to the grid when it is needed the most during the day. \u00a0This investment is far superior to further investment in nuclear generators or fossil based fuels.\nLet\u2019s move toward a sustainable, clean, renewable future as it relates to energy for Ontarians.\nThank You.\n[Original Comment ID: 205030]\n",

Eric Hoskins\nMinister of Health and Long-Term Care 10th Floor, Hepburn Block\n80 Grosvenor St.\nToronto, Ontario\nM7A 2C4\nDear Ministers,\nI am pleased to share with you the enclosed report entitled, Clean Air Ontario co-authored by Bruce Power and the Asthma Society of Canada. The report features updates from Ontario\u2019s 2016 Climate Change Action Plan, along with Bruce Power\u2019s ongoing commitment to providing 30 percent of Ontario\u2019s electricity needs.\nOntario has clearly demonstrated the positive impact of eliminating coal-fired energy. This commitment has provided a significant reduction in the province\u2019s level of harmful GHG emissions, allowing the number of smog days in the GTA to plummet from 48 in 2005 to zero in 2014. A major part of this achievement was made possible through the refurbishment of previously laid-up nuclear reactor units, including four of the units at the Bruce Power site.\nThe Asthma Society of Canada believes nuclear power will continue to play a critical role in meeting the energy and air quality needs of the province. Taking steps to sustain our nuclear industry helps the effort to slow climate change, and is beneficial to the health and wellness of the people of Ontario.\nCleaner air in the province means improved health for Ontario\u2019s most vulnerable citizens, including those who live with asthma and other breathing issues. According to a 2005 Ministry of Energy report, phasing out coal helps avoid 25,000 emergency room visits, 20,000 hospital admissions and 8.1 minor illness cases, resulting in a financial benefit of $2.6 billion annually.\nI appreciate you giving this report and its contents serious consideration. This report is also being provided as a submission to the ongoing Long-Term Energy Plan review process, and as such, will be provided to the Environmental Registry as part of this consultation process.\nIt is imperative that we meet the growing global demand for electricity in a way that improves quality of life, while protecting the environment. The Asthma Society of Canada is proud to partner with Bruce Power on this report, and cannot emphasize enough the role clean, safe and carbon-free nuclear power plays in improving the lives of Ontario residents.\nSincerely,\nVanessa Foran\nPresident and CEO of the Asthma Society of Canada\nCC.

We are also submitting this report as part of the Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP) review process so this important information can be considered.\nThe report summarizes the company\u2019s achievements over the last 15 years within a P3 structure, including the continuation of policy support for Ontario\u2019s LTEP. This project will enable Bruce Power to add value to the province for decades to come through the provision of affordable energy, thousands of jobs, and billons of dollars in annual economic activity.\nBruce Power is a critical component of Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan. As you are aware, Bruce Power contributes nearly one-third of electricity supply across the province and the rate of the generated power comes in at a cost of thirty percent less than the average residential price of energy. Bruce Power also employs more than 4,000 people on a permanent basis, and has been the single largest source of job creation in Ontario\u2019s trades sector over the last decade. In addition, the total economic impact is estimated to be 22,000 jobs across Ontario.\nBruce Power\u2019s strong track record of delivering significant value through low-cost and reliable electricity demonstrates that nuclear power can be operated safely and cost-effectively by the private sector in a competitive market. As one of the largest P3s in Canada, and the first involving nuclear power generation, the Council strongly believes that Bruce Power stands as a compelling model for future P3s in the global energy sector.\nIt is my hope that you give this report and its contents into serious consideration during your review. The Council urges the government to continue investing in nuclear innovation and continue to utilize the P3 model, which is allowing nuclear energy to be an invaluable component of Ontario\u2019s energy mix and is integral to Ontario and Canada reaching its GHG emission targets. This will help ensure that Ontario and Canada are positioned to capitalize on the next wave of the industry advancements, have cleaner energy, and strengthen our economy.\nSincerely,\nMark Romoff, President and CEO\nCC.

Safe Hospitals\u201d, which highlights the dynamic and synergistic relationship between the nuclear and health sciences sectors in the Province.\nNordion is a global health science company, based in Ontario, which provides products used to prevent, diagnose and treat diseases. In partnership with Bruce Power, Nordion supports a wide spectrum of health care services which are vital to patients in Canada and around the world, through the production of Cobalt-60.\nCobalt-60 serves a number of critical purposes within the healthcare system.\u00a0 For example, medical-grade Cobalt-60 supports oncological treatment by providing a stable and predictable radiation source for the treatment of cancers and brain disease. Cobalt-60 is also used to sterilize approximately 40 per cent of the world\u2019s single-use medical devices, including items such as sutures, syringes, surgical gowns and masks.\nThanks to a recently signed agreement, Bruce Power has confirmed that it will continue to provide Nordion with a reliable, long-term supply of industrial and medical-grade Cobalt-60 for the next half century. The exceptional duration of this arrangement is a testament to the strong working relationship that Nordion and Bruce Power have built. This partnership not only provides meaningful solutions in support of patient care, we believe it is also fundamental to the future of Ontario\u2019s economy.\nWe believe it is critical that Ontario remains committed to ensuring the long-term availability of Cobalt-60 from Bruce Power, which will help ensure that the Province remains at the forefront of technological innovations that meet the needs of a modern health care system, while securing the future of many well-paying, high tech jobs in Ontario.\nI would appreciate it if you would give this report and its contents your positive consideration.\n[Original Comment ID: 206621]\n",

As part of a modern, balanced electricity system, nuclear energy is a critical component of public policies to grow the economy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Region consists of eight states and two provinces, many of which rely on nuclear energy to power their economies in an environmentally conscious manner. In fact, this region relies on nuclear for 30 per cent of their electricity and 50 per cent of their non-emitting electricity supply. Nuclear power produces zero carbon emissions while generating the same reliable and affordable base load, setting it apart from other sources.\nAssuming the refurbishment schedule proceeds accordingly, as per Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP), Bruce Power will continue to supply two-thirds of Ontario\u2019s nuclear energy for decades to come. Through securing the sustainability of the Bruce Power site, the long-term, annual economic impact of the facility will result in 22,000 direct and indirect jobs; $4 billion will also be generated towards Ontario\u2019s economy through direct and indirect spending, such as: labour income, operational equipment, supplies, and materials. The upcoming refurbishment of six Bruce Power reactors will itself inject nearly $1B into the region\u2019s economy on an annual basis.\nIn addition, the refurbishment of the four Darlington nuclear units owned by Ontario Power Generation, which will span 10 years and will secure 3,500 megawatts of affordable, reliable and emissions-free power, will contribute a total of $90 billion to Ontario\u2019s GDP and increase employment by an average of 14,200 jobs annually, including over 2,600 jobs onsite at Darlington.\nI appreciate your consideration in regard to this report and its content. The Council of the Great Lakes Region and its industry partners, including Bruce Power, Ontario Power Generation and the Provincial Building and Construction Trades Council of Ontario, share a common belief that such a reliable and clean electricity system will truly benefit the economy. There is no single, well-established project, facility or infrastructure project in the province that will have such significant economic impacts as the refurbishment of Ontario\u2019s nuclear fleet.\nSincerely,\nMark Fisher\nPresident and CEO\nCc:Members of Provincial Parliament, Legislative Assembly of Ontario\nMr. Bruce Campbell, President and CEO, IESO\n[Original Comment ID: 206622]\n",

Jobs & Growth.\u201d This report has determined that the life-extension activities and ongoing operations at the Bruce Power site will create thousands of jobs and inject billions of dollars into Ontario\u2019s economy for decades while also providing low-cost, stable electricity to families and businesses for decades to come.\nThe report focuses on Bruce Power\u2019s role within the Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP), as it has now commenced its life extension project that is on-time and on-budget. This program will include the Major Component Replacement Program starting in 2020. Our report concludes that Bruce Power brings a \u201cone-two punch\u201d for our province to achieve balance in generating clean, affordable, reliable electricity for Ontario\u2019s families and businesses, while securing investments as a key source of job creation and economic growth.\nIn creating this report, three organizations \u2013 each with their own focus and specializations \u2013 have come together to demonstrate a collective interest in the future of the nuclear industry and the economic vitality of the province. The Provincial Building and Construction Trades Council of Ontario represents craft unions in the construction sector; the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters represents Canada\u2019s largest trade and industry association; Bruce Power provides one-third of Ontario\u2019s electricity. All three drive Ontario\u2019s economy forward, and have a shared desire to see both affordable and stable electricity prices, while securing quality, sustainable jobs.\nEnergy policy is a challenging file, particularly because it touches virtually every area of public policy. There is robust and comprehensive public debate and dialogue on what constitutes the right mix of sources of electricity generation. That being said, the three aforementioned leaders all agree that in the roadmap laid out by Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan, Bruce Power is at the heart of the province\u2019s economic and energy framework.\nI appreciate you giving this report and its contents your consideration. The Bruce Power site is an economic engine for the Province of Ontario and is one of the main energy sources for southern Ontario. Public investment in our nuclear infrastructure and in the talents of our human capital will ensure that our workforce will have the skills and knowledge needed for long-term success.\nSincerely,\nPatrick J.

Steven Del Duca\nMinister of Transportation\n3rd Floor, Ferguson Block\n77 Wellesley Street West\nToronto ON M7A 1Z8\nDear Ministers,\nI am pleased to share with you the enclosed report entitled, \u201cAccelerating the Deployment of Plug-In Electric Vehicles in Canada and Ontario.\u201d This is a collaborative report released by Bruce Power, Plug\u2019n Drive, Pollution Probe, and the University of Waterloo\u2019s Department of Chemical Engineering. This report explores ways to build upon existing federal and provincial policies to maximize the decarbonization of the transportation sector, and to help achieve climate change commitments.\nElectric vehicle (EV) technology has enormous potential to help our provinces and territories reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector, which is the second largest contributor to GHGs in Canada.\nHuman activity is a leading contributor to GHGs, causing irreparable damage to our environment. Climate change is an urgent threat that demands leadership and decisive action. As global citizens, we have both a responsibility and an obligation to ensure that our provincial governments present a collective voice to maintain or lower our carbon dependency. We need to strike the right balance in fulfilling our energy demands; as such, we need to support our various industries like nuclear, hydroelectric, natural gas, and renewable sources. As critical as it is to diversify our energy sources, it is equally important to facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles; this will take meaningful steps towards lowering GHG emissions.\nOntario is Canada\u2019s largest province and represents the heart of economic productivity and manufacturing. Demonstrating leadership amongst its provincial counterparts is crucial in realizing the reduction of Canada\u2019s emissions. The province itself has come a long way in GHG emission reductions to date through its phase-out of coal, refurbishment of nuclear reactors, and enhancements of renewables. That being said, it must be emphasized that transportation within the province is now its primary emissions contributor, and must be a main area of focus for decarbonization.\nCanada and Ontario have made significant strides over the past few years, such as the introduction of EVs, initiating the transition to a low-carbon transportation sector. This report explores the key elements of a successful EV strategy, and identifies opportunities to further build on existing policy and action, resulting in an enhanced and accelerated deep decarbonization of the transportation sector.\nThis report is also being provided as a submission to the ongoing Long-Term Energy Plan review process, and as such, will be provided to the Environmental Registry as part of this consultation process.\nI appreciate you giving this report and its contents your consideration. Electric vehicles are undoubtedly the future of a cleaner, less carbon-intensive transportation system in Ontario and across Canada. Through a collaborative mindset and a common focus of increasing EV usage, governments, businesses and non-profit organizations can work together to makes EVs more economical and practical for both rural and urban residents by implementing many of the strategies outlined in the report.\nSincerely,\nCara Clairman,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 James Scongack, Ingrid Thompson,\nPresident and CEO of Plug\u2019n Drive\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vice President, Corporate Affairs of Bruce Power\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CEO of Pollution Probe\nMichael Fowler,\nProfessor at University of Waterloo\nCC.Members of Provincial Parliament,Bruce Campbell, President\/CEO\nLegislative Assembly of OntarioIESO\n[Original Comment ID: 206624]\n\n",

Put Conservation First\nTo fight climate change and reduce our environmental footprint, I think Ontario\u2019s next energy plan should make conservation and efficiency the first priority for all energy decisions.\nA recent government study showed we have the potential to cost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30% by 2035.\nI think the government should pursue all cost-effective conservation.\n2. Empower Communities and Citizens to go 100% Renewable\nOntario\u2019s next energy plan should empower everyone from citizens and co-ops to municipalities and First Nations to become energy producers.\nIt should empower communities like Oxford County that want to go 100% renewable.\n3. Come Clean on Nuclear Costs\nThe biggest barrier to shifting Ontario to 100% renewable energy is the government\u2019s current commitment to nuclear power.\nWhile the cost of renewables keeps declining, the cost of nuclear power has only ever gone up. Despite this, the government\u2019s past energy plans have made no requirement for nuclear projects to undergo public review against alternatives. This needs to change.\nOntario\u2019s next energy plan needs to ensure there are a full and fair comparisons of the total costs of nuclear with alternatives and an opportunity for the public to have a say about which approach they prefer.\n4. Close Pickering\nOntario\u2019s 2013 energy plan committed to close the Pickering nuclear station between 2017 and 2020, but earlier this year the government announced they would renege on this promise and keep operating Pickering until 2024.\nAlmost all of Pickering\u2019s output is surplus and exported to Michigan at a loss.\u00a0 This is driving up energy costs.\nPickering\u2019s continued operation also puts the public at risk. Ontario has not updated its nuclear emergency plans since the Fukushima disaster.\nI want the government to keep its promise to close Pickering before 2020.\nShutting Pickering down should be a first step in Ontario\u2019s long-term transition to renewable energy.\n[Original Comment ID: 206625]\n",

Therefore, making and investing in any long-term commitments that are at odds with that fact are irrational and likely harmful to present and future generations.\nAny projects underway, or proposed, that exacerbate climate change or detract from the development of less carbon intensive sources of energy are a waste of resources and time. Both of which are finite under the present climactic conditions.\nResources and time should be reallocated to 1.the generation or purchase of renewable energy and 2. the development of infrastructure that supports the distribution of renewable energy.\nThe LTEP should ensure Ontario puts conservation first and reduces demand through conservation or efficiency programs wherever possible.\nThe LTEP should prioritize all future energy generation and purchase from renewable sources over less sustainable sources.\nAny policy or regulatory regime that does not incentivize the use of renewable energy over unsustainable sources of energy should be amended or repealed to incent public and private entities to use renewable sources of energy.\nThe LTEP should priortize the development of through policy and regulatory regimes that empower Ontarians and communities to generate power locally with renewable energy.\n[Original Comment ID: 206629]\n",

Ontario is headed in the right direction with its new waste management strategy (Bill 151 - Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act passed in June 2016), and I believe we should continue this environmentally-friendly, job creation-focused approach with the energy plan.\nOntario's next energy plan must ensure that there are full and fair comparisons of our energy options - evaluations that consider the total costs of nuclear with alternatives, and renewable energy in particular. The costs of nuclear are climbing and the costs of renewables will continue to decline. We must consider job creation potential as well as the very serious potential climate change implications of our energy choices.\nOntario should also be focusing on reducing the amount of surplus energy we create (especially at the Pickering nuclear station) and prioritizing conservation. A recent study showed that we could cost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30 percent by 2035. Particularly given the climbing costs of energy bills, I believe a conservation approach could really appeal to Ontario residents and be successful.\nFinally, I think the LTEP should allow communities, and First Nations in particular, to become energy producers. Communities should be empowered to generate their own electricity, particularly in areas where doing so could reduce burden on infrastructure (powerlines, etc.) and reduce cost burden on remote, rural, and\/or lower income people. This could also benefit communities that rely on seasonal residents\/visitors (cottagers, etc.) as their running costs will be lower (lower or eliminated \"delivery\" costs when they are not living there), which will free up that spending to be spent in the community, such as supporting local businesses or fundraising events.\n[Original Comment ID: 205061]\n",

We need to see a comprehensive plan that switching to 100% renewable energy is a viable option for Ontario\u2019s energy future.\nMore and more municipalities, countries and companies are well along in their planning to transition to 100% renewable energy. Ontario\u2019s next energy plan should put policies in place to enable citizens, communities and Indigenous communities to go 100% renewable.\nPut Conservation First\nTo fight climate change and reduce our environmental footprint, Ontario\u2019s next energy plan must make conservation and efficiency the first priority for all energy decisions. This principle has to apply to our buildings, institutions, industries and transportation systems.\nA recent government study* showed we have the potential to cost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30% by 2035.\u00a0\u00a0 I think the government should pursue and promote all cost-effective conservation measures.\nSeize Opportunities\nI want Ontario to continue to be a leader in the green energy transition.\nI\u2019m extremely proud of Ontario\u2019s leadership in phasing out coal and increasing energy from renewable sources, and I would like to see Ontario maintain its reputation as a climate leader.\nI am concerned that three-quarters of our energy use still comes from fossil fuels, which are directly contributing to climate change. I believe we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels by encouraging adoption of electric vehicles, and investing in public transit and green district heating technologies.\nOntario should also ensure we take advantage of emerging innovations in clean technology, such as smart grids, and storage.\nEmpower Citizens and Communities to go 100% Renewable\nOntario\u2019s Long-term Energy Plan should empower community groups and Municipalities as well as First Nations & M\u00e9tis communities to become energy producers.\nGovernment policies like the Feed In Tariff program have allowed communities to participate in and benefit from renewable energy production, which has led to a number of important and tangible benefits.**\nI want Ontario to continue to ensure citizens and communities have opportunities to own and participate in renewable energy projects.\nBuild Resilient Communities\nI am concerned about the impacts of climate change, and the probability of increasing erratic weather events such as ice storms, flooding and severe heat.\nIn order to reliably keep the lights on, I believe Ontario should strengthen our local power production and distribution systems, and rely less on large centralized power plants.\nI am concerned with Ontario\u2019s heavy reliance on a bulk energy supply from small number of large nuclear plants, and I believe decreasing our reliance on nuclear will lead to a more flexible, more cost-effective energy supply in the long run.\nI want Ontario to empower local communities with the tools they need to go 100% renewable.\nThank you very much for taking the time to consider and review public input into Ontario\u2019s next Long Term Energy Plan.\nSincerely,\nDaniel Bida, CFA\nExecutive Director\n*Source: Achievable Potential Study: Long Term Analysis, submitted to IESO on June 30, 2016. **TREC\u2019s \u201cPower of Community\u201d report commissioned polling and economic modelling data to find that community owned renewable energy projects in Ontario have generated $2 in economic activity for every $1 spend on the projects, created twice as many jobs as industry-owned projects, increased grid resiliency and reliability, and enhanced public support for renewable energy.

In recent times it has been observed that the impacts can be felt socioeconomically as well since Canada's currency is directly dependent on the price of said energy system. This is impractical. I am proud that Ontario has no coal fired power plants however we are still using dated technology that has long lasting impacts with regards to waste products, nuclear energy. Nuclear could be wonderful if there were a way to actually extract all the energy from the rods or a way to reduce the radioactive aspects of the waste other than time. \u00a0Thankfully there are other technologies at our disposal that have a lessened impact such as wind, solar and if done properly, hydroelectric. By utilizing multiple sustainable energy systems we can energize Ontario. With investments into alternative energy systems in terms of R&D, environmental assessments, product design, manufacturing, and installation; we can increase jobs that require skilled trades and professionals. With new solar technology like that recently developed by Tesla\/SolarCity, not only can every resident of Ontario generate electricity but our businesses and indeed the major utilities. This, in my opinion, fosters a society of sharing and cooperation in which we can be proud. Is it not these ideals that make us Canadian? I look forward to seeing more wind turbines and solar farms in the future.

Given the very real problems we face from climate change, the only sensible option is to make conservation and efficiency the priority for the future. \u00a0 All cost-effective conservation measures should be considered and adopted.\nThe province should help those communities who have opted to go 100% renewable: \u00a0help for citizens who wish to do so would also be very helpful.\nNuclear power has been proven to be dangerous and is not a viable solution for the future. Therefore, it makes no sense to continue to keep throwing money at the industry. \u00a0The continued operation of the Pickering nuclear plant continues to drive up energy costs, as well as putting the public at risk. \u00a0Shutting this plant would be an excellent first step toward the province making the transition to renewable energy.\n[Original Comment ID: 205082]\n",

        "comment":"There are only so many things an individual citizen can do to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Already, I limit my use of electricity by shutting off lights I'm not using, putting on another sweater or using another blanket rather than turning up the heat, choosing public transit or walking rather than owning\/driving a car, choosing to keep my still-functioning 5-year-old smart phone rather than upgrading (despite frequent \"offers\" to upgrade by my service provider), reducing consumption in general by borrowing\/sharing\/renting rather than owning (from books to tools to cars\/trucks). I no longer own my own residence, and so have no control over the type of heating in my building, or whether to install solar panels or other renewable energy devices. Landlords are often unwilling to make changes to old infrastructures without some kind of incentive... so governments have the responsibility to create incentives for property owners (both landlords and private owners) to install renewable energy devices such as solar panels, perhaps even small windmills on roofs, etc. There should also be bylaws in all cities - or perhaps a province-wide mandate - that all new building construction\/development projects adhere to minimum LEED standards.\nI am no expert in any of this, but I do believe that not only is it important to drastically reduce carbon emissions and our dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels, it is also possible to work towards and achieve goals regarding switching to renewable energy sources. Other countries and cities are doing it... it's not impossible. Why is it that a country and a province so wealthy as Canada and Ontario lag behind in implementing renewable energy projects? Given the urgency - with climate change becoming an ever-greater threat to the well-being of everyone on this planet - it is perplexing and upsetting that there seems to be such ambivalence or even reluctance around creating and implementing renewable energy projects.\n[Original Comment ID: 205088]\n",

Increased reliability? Greater information on your energy usage?\nWhile reliability is important, we need to redefine what reliability means, especially for commercial customers. \u00a0Currently, a momentary outage that clears a fault on the system and restores power is considered to improve reliability yet for many of our sensitive commercial and industrial customers this type of interruption is as disruptive as a long outage. \u00a0As storage technologies improve, they will provide an economical means for sensitive customers to ride-through these momentary interruptions. \u00a0A modern grid should be able to offer this type of service for a premium price.\nCustomer\u2019s conservation efforts will be reinforced if they have immediate feedback to their actions. \u00a0Customers should have access to devices which display the immediate effects of a customer\u2019s consumption changes such as turning off a stove or starting an air conditioner. \u00a0For these measurements to occur, communication devices need to be embedded in the meter and talk to a display device in the home. \u00a0These devices (Zigbee) were available when the Province mandated smart meters. \u00a0Utilities asked if the incremental costs ($15) of this technology could be recovered as part of the smart meter program and were denied. \u00a0Consequently, the Province made a 15-year decision (life of the meter) to preclude this technology. \u00a0The Province needs to reconsider these decisions and allow utilities recovery on these and related expenditures.\nA modern grid includes advanced outage detection, isolation and restoration capabilities. \u00a0This enables a utility to operate with fewer staff and consequently a higher level of efficiency and lower cost to the customer. \u00a0Utilities have already reduced staffing levels and the opportunity to capture original baselines for efficiency improvements may have already passed. (The low-hanging fruit has already been plucked.)\nA modern grid is a \u201ccommunication-assisted\u201d grid. \u00a0Utilities will need more reliable communication systems to operate their \u201cInternet of Things\u201d. \u00a0A promising communication media \u2013 WiMax \u2013 operating on 1.8 GHz (the frequency set aside for utility use by Industry Canada \u2013 the federal agency managing spectrum) \u00a0is limited by federal regulatory rules to devices which are stationary. \u00a0This means that utilities who invest in a WiMax infrastructure will not be able to achieve all the efficiencies they would otherwise achieve as they cannot utilize the infrastructure to enable their vehicles as data collection hubs. \u00a0Provincial assistance to provide relief on this rule would lower costs for customers.\nWhile Ontario is paying attention to cyber security, many of its key distribution assets (transformer stations, generators) are very vulnerable to physical attacks. \u00a0In consideration of maintaining reliability of supply, the Province should consider improving the resistance of those assets to physical attack as a part of the LTEP.\nSimilarly, it is commonly accepted that climate change has already resulted in more frequent and more damaging incidents of storms. \u00a0In consideration of maintaining reliability of supply, the Province should include improving the strength and resilience of the transmission and distribution systems to withstand those weather disturbances, including the abilities of utilities to respond, as part of the LTEP discussion.\nWhat are the best uses of microgrids in Ontario?\nMicrogrids offer customers the opportunity to improve their reliability and to reduce peaks and reduce their cost of power. \u00a0For a utility however, the proliferation of microgrids and distributed generation complicate the operation of the grid. \u00a0 Incremental costs for utilities to accept and manage microgrids should be supported in rates.\nAs noted previously, a microgrid may provide an opportunity to provide a customer increased power quality. \u00a0Costs to manage this technology by the utility should be supported in rates. \u00a0Costs to deliver this technology to specific customers should be supported by the customers with incentives provided by the Province through a \u201cCDM-like\u201d mechanism.\nAre there any barriers preventing the use of microgrids?\nWhen a microgrid isolates from the grid, then that microgrid manages voltage and frequency within the microgrid. \u00a0While this is not a problem for single customer microgrids however multi-customer \u201cneighborhood microgrids\u201d present technical challenges. \u00a0The Province will need to consider and address issues that microgrid participants might experience due to the lack of grid voltage and frequency management. \u00a0Utilities must be exempted from any liabilities associated with microgrids and customers benefitting from microgrids must also accept any associated risks.\nAs well, power supplied by a microgrid to a customer in a multi-customer microgrid will need to be settled separate from power supplied by the utility grid. \u00a0This will require special monitoring and billing systems and perhaps special meters (current smart meter 1-hour resolution may not be sufficient). \u00a0These costs will need to be supported in rates.\nTraditionally, large generator customers seek permission to connect from their utility whenever they want to re-connect to the utility after a period of non-generation. \u00a0Large microgrids should also be remotely \u201cpermitted\u201d (issuing an electronic \u201cpass\u201d or approval) when re-connecting to the grid. \u00a0A remote, automatic means of managing these permissions should also be developed and will need to be supported by rates.\nWould you be willing to participate in a program where your utility could use your home storage device from time to time to operate a more reliable electricity distribution system?\nNote: This question is assumed to refer to the use of customer\u2019s battery storage to provide frequency regulation to the grid. \u00a0This frequency regulation is typically provided by the transmitter rather than the distributor. \u00a0Frequency regulation can be provided by drawing power from the connected, charging battery or reducing load from the grid by stopping the charging of the battery.\nThe use of distribution customer\u2019s battery storage for frequency regulation can be managed with current technology however this should be subject to verification of the participant\u2019s actual participation to ensure the participant does not collect credits while bypassing the system operation. \u00a0This is likely best done at the distribution utility level and would require systems, staff and (likely) meters capable of sufficient resolution. \u00a0These costs will need to be supported in rates.\nGiven current costs of batteries, losses on charge and discharge and decreasing ability to fully recover energy injected into today\u2019s batteries, it is highly unlikely that energy arbitrage would be viable with today\u2019s technology. \u00a0It will take several significant leaps in battery technology and cost effectiveness for arbitrage to be a viable proposition. \u00a0This would then seem to limit energy storage to high value transactions or roles.\nUnreliability of wind generation drives the operation of \u201cspinning reserves\u201d \u2013 generally, natural gas fired generators that run on idle but can ramp quickly and fill in for variable resources that drop out of the supply mix with little notice. \u00a0The use of battery or other storage to backstop spinning reserves may allow the spinning reserves to stand down and not consume natural gas nor emit greenhouse gases when they are idling. \u00a0Storage devices would bridge the gap between when a reserve supply was called upon and when it could start, run and ramp to meet demand.\nHow can Ontario further support innovative energy storage technologies that leverage our existing natural gas infrastructure assets and take advantage of our clean electricity system?\nNatural gas systems typically experience their lowest demand at the time that the electricity systems experience their highest demand \u2013 for summer peaking utilities only. \u00a0Natural gas microturbines are a technology that may be used to generate electricity when the gas delivery system is at a low point in their usage cycle and the electricity distribution system is at its high point in the usage cycle. \u00a0The gas turbines may be able to generate power that can be stored for later use \u2013 for example at night time when solar supplies are not available or are insufficient.\nWhich innovations offer the greatest benefit to your community and the energy system as a whole?\nThe customer\u2019s participation in the management of the generation and distribution of electricity needs to be simple and predictable for the customer. \u00a0Projects offering cost effective and simple means for this participation will benefit the community and energy system.\nHow should the public and private sectors cooperate to encourage innovation in the energy section? n\/a\nShould Ontario set provincial conservation targets for other fuel types such as natural gas, oil and propane?\nThe Province\u2019s position on other fuel types is confusing to customers. \u00a0On the one hand, the Province has stated that they want customers to move away from natural gas \u00a0and are imposing a carbon cap and trade system while on the other hand are offering incentives for customers to install behind-the-meter natural gas fired co-generation. \u00a0This dichotomy of messages leaves customers confused and less willing to invest in new technologies.\nTo meet the province\u2019s climate change objectives, how can existing or new conservation and energy efficiency programs be enhanced in the near and longer term?\nThe carbon cap and trade program is confusing to most customers, including sophisticated commercial energy buyers. \u00a0Implementation of similar systems in other jurisdictions have shown that the carbon credit market is weak. \u00a0A simpler means of discouraging the use of carbon is suggested. \u00a0As well, the Province has, while issuing FIT and microFIT contracts, reserved for itself those carbon credits that might arise out of the use of solar rather than carbon-fuel energy sources. \u00a0This will likely be seen as duplicitous by the general public as those rights were taken before anyone had any idea that they would someday have value.\nHow can we continue to inform and engage energy consumers?\nThe public is generally ill-informed about the state of the generation, transmission and distribution systems, the needs for investment in those systems and the consequences of not investing in those systems. \u00a0Local utilities can help deliver those messages however messaging and funding to deliver it should be provided to the utilities. \u00a0Too often, the energy system operators blame each other and government policy for the high price of electricity. \u00a0Customers do not always distinguish between distributors, generators, transmitters, regulators and policy makers. \u00a0A strong common front between these system participants is needed in order for customers to believe that the system is being managed for their best advantage.\nWhat role should distributed renewable energy generation play in the ongoing modernization and transformation of Ontario\u2019s electricity system?\nDistributed renewable energy generation is related to grid modernization and transformation but it is not a fully coadjutant relationship. \u00a0Distributed generation (DG) is forcing grid modernization and transformation. \u00a0Renewable energy generation was likely going to happen due to market forces and technology improvements at some future time regardless of its Provincial promotion. \u00a0Grid operations with high levels of DG penetration have not yet been fully vetted in North America and there is still much to learn about the ways and means by which such systems are best operated. Forums to share best practises and support for utility costs to modernize and transform the grid to enable high penetration DG are encouraged. \u00a0DG cannot be counted upon as an always available source of supply. \u00a0In fact, whenever there is a system upset, DG is forced off and not able to return to the system until the system is stable. \u00a0Consequently, grid systems still need to be sized for full \u201ccold load pick-up\u201d. \u00a0Renewable generation may reduce greenhouse gases and help mitigate climate change but traditional, centrally sourced supplies will still need to be available and capable of supplying the full load.\nSolar renewable energy generation technology and costs are continually improving and consequently have a high likelihood of becoming a larger part of the supply portfolio in the future. \u00a0The LTEP should include a projection of the technology and cost improvements and be informed by that projection.\nParis Agreement on Climate Change\nCanada (16-10-05) as well as the US (16-09-03) are signatories to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change which comes into force on November 4, 2016. With this agreement, it is expected that the playing field will be leveled in terms of the \u201cgreening\u201d of the energy supply. \u00a0Currently, Ontario has one of the greenest grids in North America. \u00a0This comes with some cost that manifests as higher electricity costs than neighbouring jurisdictions. \u00a0Hopefully, as the terms of the agreement come into force, those neighbouring jurisdictions will move away from their cheap, carbon-fueled electrical supplies and their costs come more into line with those paid by Ontario customers. \u00a0The LTEP should recognize that Ontario is leading other jurisdictions in this regard and consequently its customers are finding it difficult to be competitive with other countries and provinces. \u00a0The Province should not just look to its own rate forecasts but also be informed by the rate forecasts of its neighbours and it should ensure that it trends towards establishing power rates that are competitive with its neighbours, as a long term goal.\nThe Paris Agreement also contemplates the elimination of fossil based fuels by 2060. \u00a0The Province has stated a goal to eliminate the use of natural gas in many sectors. \u00a0Nevertheless, the natural gas distribution infrastructure must be maintained without an expectation of a revenue return over the accustomed number of years. \u00a0In order that this infrastructure remain viable, depreciation rates for investments will need to adjust for the expected decrease in asset useful life.\nTransmission Expansion\nThe LTEP contemplates an expansion of transmission to bring power from new hydro generation facilities in Northern Ontario and power from Quebec to central Ontario where the greatest usage growth exists. \u00a0The costs of this expansion are stated to be \u201csystem costs shared by the electricity ratepayers.\u201d \u00a0Southwestern Ontario has surplus generation already and has supported wind and solar generation that benefits the province at the expense (some say) of the quality of life in this area. \u00a0It is proposed that electricity ratepayers in the southwest be exempted from these incremental costs to serve the GTA.\nNatural Gas Storage to Support Electricity Generation During Summer Peaks\nThe Province states, \u201cSince natural gas is also used to generate electricity, the storage facilities in Ontario can also be used to supply generators during periods of high electricity demand.\u201d \u00a0The natural gas transmission system has ample capacity to supply summer peaking generation without drawing gas out of storage. \u00a0In fact, the storage facility exists because that transmission system does not have sufficient capacity to supply demand for gas during winter heating peaks. \u00a0This storage system should not be used to supply natural gas generators during summer peaks.\nHow can Ontario further support innovative energy storage technologies that leverage our existing natural gas infrastructure assets and take advantage of our clean electricity system?\nDuring summer, natural gas demand dips and the natural gas line compressors across the province generally are idle or lightly used. \u00a0The engines on these compressors could power generators rather than compressors during summer peak periods. \u00a0This would obtain a higher usage factor on these assets and potentially eliminate or minimize investment in generator-only facilities.\nThe Discussion Guide states, \u201cOnce RNG (Renewable-sourced natural gas) is processed to remove impurities, it can be mixed in with conventional natural gas and use the same pipelines and equipment.\u201d \u00a0The problem with RNG is that it is rife with caustic liquids and gases (landfill gas) and has a high carbon dioxide content. \u00a0It is expensive to condition that gas to pipeline quality. It is less expensive to build a steam generator with a combustion chamber designed for the gas quality produced by the renewable source. \u00a0Once converted to electricity, issues with quality disappear.\nRenewables\nThe Province allocates capacity to accept generation on feeders and stations on the basis that all generators will be generating their maximum capacity, all at the same time, at a time that the feeder\/station is at minimum load and least able to absorb the generation. \u00a0These assumptions are very safe however this situation only rarely occurs on a feeder\/station. \u00a0These assumptions limit the amount of generation allowed to connect or alternatively drive significant investment in reactors to limit the available fault current on a feeder\/station. \u00a0A different construct, whereby distribution utilities are allowed to manage generator access to the grid would allow greater numbers of customers to participate in renewable generation and defer costs of fault current remediation.\nIt will be helpful to explain how the LTEP will impact the Climate Change Action Plan, and vise versa? \u00a0Currently, the respective Ministries seem to be developing programs to best accomplish their goals in the absence of other Ministerial and\/or Provincial initiatives. \u00a0An example of this is Behind-the-Meter Generation (BMG). \u00a0These projects (which largely depend on Natural Gas) were just included under the Conservation First Framework in 2015, yet the Province just announced their new Cap & Trade system which could significantly impact the viability of these projects. \u00a0Clarity on how the Ministries can and will work together through the LTEP and Climate Change Action Plan to ensure there is minimal duplication of efforts and confusion amongst the ratepayers of Ontario would be helpful in gaining acceptance of the programs.\nCurrently if a customer has taken advantage of energy conservation programs , and their load drops below class A thresholds they are not allowed to participate in the Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI) program. \u00a0It is suggested that \u00a0this be addressed in the LTEP (or other vehicle) to allow them to be credited for conservation efforts to bring them back to Class A.\nCDM targets are known until 2020, however it is hoped that the LTEP will clarify the future of CDM after 2020? Will will it continue? \u00a0How will it be funded? Will it be rate based?\n[Original Comment ID: 205121]\n",

        "comment":"I am a citizen representing only myself, not any lobby group. I feel the Ontario government's public review of its next energy plan (LTEP) is not asking the right questions to put Ontario on the course to 100% renewables. Rapid and destructive climate change, a booming human population always demanding more energy, finite fossil fuels and extremely dangerous nuclear fuels all point us inexorably toward a 100% renewable energy future. Ontario should seize this opportunity to move away from fossil and nuclear once and for all, and invest massively in renewable energy.\nOntario can no longer protect its existing outdated and dirty power system. We can no longer \u201charness\u201d nuclear power to meet our future energy needs, simply because it has been proven over and over again, all around the world and most recently in Fukushima, just how devastating a nuclear accident is. It would be just as devastating here in South-Eastern Ontario where our nuclear power stations are located in Canada's most populated corridor.\nThe way forward is as follows:\n1. Ontario must join the growing global movement toward 100% renewable energy - those nations who start the transition early and massively will reap the benefits in very little time. Ontario cannot afford to be left behind with dangerous and finite energy sources;\n2. Ontario\u2019s LTEP must come clean on the true cost of nuclear power, and help citizens and communities to empower themselves with renewable energy. Nuclear creates radioactive waste and is simply too dangerous. The cost of maintaining and refitting aging stations is already much too high. Ontario must reinvest these precious funds into renewable, which by definition will eventually pay for themselves. Renewables are the right path for Ontario to fight climate change AND end our reliance on risky and costly nuclear power.\n3. Ontario\u2019s LTEP needs to remove barriers to citizens and communities becoming energy self-sufficient. This means investing in local solutions and energy sources, so that every region can harness it sown potential and not be burdened by the energy costs of others. In other words, Ontario must take the renewable path to a low-carbon future, and this means local power and empowerment.\n4. Nuclear power:\n- The LTEP must plan to replace existing reactors with renewable energy.\n- The LTEP must require nuclear projects to be compared to renewable energy options.\n- Any future nuclear project should be independently and publicly reviewed.\n- The LTEP must acknowledge that operating nuclear plants in the Great Lakes\/GTA is an unneeded risk.\n5. Conservation:\n- The top priority of the LTEP must be to reduce energy demand wherever possible.\n- The LTEP should pursue all affordable conservation options (a recent government study found that Ontario could cost-effectively reduce electricity demand by 30% by 2035.)\n6. Renewables:\n- The LTEP must ensure that Ontarians can take advantage of the declining cost of renewables.\n- After conservation, renewable energy should be the top priority of Ontario\u2019s next energy plan. - I support electrifying transport and heating to displace fossil fuels, BUT conservation and renewables should be used first to address any increased electricity demand.\nThank you.\n[Original Comment ID: 205135]\n",

Where possible taken from the grid distribution.\n1) commuter trains and designated Tramway systems are used throughout the world with great success. 2) battery powered vehicles that are recharged \u00a0by connecting to the national grid.\nThe most effective and clean way of producing electrical power is the use of nuclear generators. No other system, with the exception of Hydro Generation, is as efficient or clean.\nThe Province is at the moment buying power from various sources and high costs none of these is particularly efficient or constantly stable. The prime example of this being wind power, but small generating operations burning wood, natural gas or garbage come into this category. Solar panels will I believe fail in the long term to be cost effective when used on a large scale.\nThe Candu nuclear reactor is a well designed system as we can attest to here in Ontario however it is outdated and does create some waste. All the 50 years of The Pickering Power station waste in stored on site.\nFast-neutron reactors are the most efficient way of dealing with existing nuclear waste. These new reactors would solve the power requirements of Ontario and hopefully return competitiveness to our industries.\nThe placing of nuclear waste in disused mines is an expensive and unnecessary route to take with a much more viable option being available.\nFor long term carbon free power generation this is the best option.\n[Original Comment ID: 205166]\n",

As a researcher and PhD student working in the field of renewables, I support, based on scientific evidence, a flexible, reliable, ecological and democratic energy system that is 100% renewable, decentralized, and owned by Ontarians.\nI want Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan (LTEP) to set the goals, actions and timelines for such a transition. We need to see a comprehensive plan that switching to 100% renewable energy is a viable option for Ontario\u2019s energy future.\nMore and more municipalities, countries and companies are well along in their planning to transition to 100% renewable energy.

I recently visited Colorado and was impressed by their utilization of wind power on the upper plains.\nI especially think it is important to support electric vehicles and the implementation of charging stations across Ontario. I am saddened that the most efficient electric car, the Tesla, is not being supported in the way of rebates. It is imperative that the best green technology be encouraged. The Tesla is by far the best electric car on the market and should be supported as much as possible.

It seemed plausible then, but in hindsight, had we put our efforts into renewable technology, we could now be world leaders. We could have used the exorbitant costs of nuclear to develop sustainable technology.\nIt's time to make the switch. Nuclear is costly in both capital and operating costs; disposal has never been completely satisfactory. As we have seen in other countries, there are dangers. Even with Candu reactors, there are dangers especially with the factors in staff performance.\nLets change to a track that would allow us to hold our heads high in terms of climate change, job creation and global leadership in sustainability.\nThank you\n[Original Comment ID: 205296]\n",

        "comment":"I encourage Ontario to plan for and begin shifting toward 100% renewable energy to power our communities. Continuing to rely on fossil fuels and nuclear fission to power our communities is short-sighted, fiscally dubious, and dangerous.\nRelying on fossil fuels for our energy will put a strain on Ontario's budget as these scarce resources continue to diminish and become more expensive. Additionally, use of fossil fuels produce harmful emissions. which put our communities at risk both in the short-term due to pollution, and over the long-term as emissions continue to accelerate climate change, leading to an increased incidence of destructive\/disruptive extreme weather events and other consequences for future generations.\nDisasters such as Fukushima and Chernobyl have shown us the inherent danger in continuing to rely on nuclear fission for our energy, particularly when the current state of our aging nuclear infrastructure is taken into account. Repairing that infrastructure would, of course, be extremely expensive and would not negate the risks involved in nuclear power generation.\nThe move to renewable energy is inevitable as fossil and nuclear fuels continue to diminish and other economic giants, like China, begin to shift more aggressively toward renewables. Consequently, it is not a question of if Ontario will shift toward 100% renewable energy, but when. Beginning to shift now and investing in industries and technology to enable this shift would position Ontario as an expert and leader in this area. Countries such as Germany have shown us that this expertise and technology can be lucrative and create good jobs, when commodified and sold to other countries. Additionally, shifting to renewables would allow Ontario to save money on healthcare as emissions are reduced, and allow us to avoid spending the billions of dollars required to refurbish our nuclear infrastructure.\nFor all these reasons, I strongly encourage Ontario to comit to and begin moving toward 100% renewable energy now.\n[Original Comment ID: 205299]\n",

        "comment":"I agree with the sentiment of the LTEP; it is incumbent upon the Ministry of Energy to look past any government's short-term (~4 year) view, and instead have a long-term plan.\nA major long-term necessity is the societal reduction of its impact on the environment. \u00a0Most pressing is the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \u00a0In the 1980s, Ontario was able to significantly reduce acid rain production by implementing scrubbers in its coal plants. \u00a0With the refurbishment and restart of 2 OPG reactors and 4 Bruce Power reactors since 2003, Ontario's electrical system weaned itself off coal completely by 2014, and reduced its use of natural gas from the 2011 peak.\nNuclear power generation dates back to the first Canadian nuclear-generated electricity in June 1962; nuclear-generated production began to rise rapidly in 1971, with the start of the first Pickering reactor. \u00a0Ontario's successful home-designed and built reactors have delivered ~2,670 TWh to the grid to the end of 2015, equivalent to about 17 years of the total 2015 Ontario net electrical production. \u00a0Had that amount of electricity been produced by coal (its most-likely alternative), it would have added another 2.9 billion tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere, to say nothing of the releases of NOx and SOx, and the enormous piles of fly ash. \u00a0In 2016, I predict Ontario's reactors will deliver another ~90 TWh of emissions-free electricity. \u00a0For the past dozen years, Ontario's reactor fleet has had a capacity factor of 79%.\nThanks to the vision of nuclear pioneers and the support of government this accomplishment was achieved; the initial developments of sixty years ago (with continuous supportive R&D to this day) are bearing fruit because of good long-term planning. \u00a0Ontario needs to continue to support nuclear power development, beyond the current slate of refurbishments (as valuable as they are).\nNow that we have a much cleaner electricity generating system, thanks primarily to hydro and nuclear, we need to use electricity better to reduce other greenhouse gas emissions. \u00a0The main candidate area is transportation - supporting the electrification of railways (including enlarged public transportation systems) and road vehicles.\nWith the application of \"smart grid\" technologies, charging electric vehicles could help damp the grid oscillations, caused primarily by capricious wind generation. \u00a0Over the past years, Ontario's industrial wind production has had an average capacity factor of 29.9% (with significant variance), a number which demonstrates its variability. \u00a0Industrial-scale solar power has less data, but has an average capacity factor of 19.4% with less variability than wind (the diurnal cycle is predictable). \u00a0While both solar and wind have their parts to play in the grid, they have limited roles which have more than likely reached saturation (particularly wind).\nOntario is well placed to continue to develop a lower-emission environment, thanks to its large grid and the contributions of nuclear and hydro in particular. \u00a0The current healthy state of electrical generation is the product of good planning and foresight from decades ago.\n[Original Comment ID: 205358]\n",

        "comment":"Well the province is pretty well screwed for the near future due to Liberal bungling of the energy file and from pushing forth unsustainable costs for solar and wind power that we don't need. \u00a0The conversation started long ago but the government would not participate. Good luck getting participation now!\n[Original Comment ID: 195683]\n",

        "comment":"Setup and strongly advertise program offering free installation of roof solar panels, with the installer companies being paid for hydro used by occupants by occupants at low rate guaranteed rate, as well as feeding electricity to grid that installer is paid by hydro for also at guaranteed rate. Installers cover their cost and earn profit over time. Hydro company benefits from reduced supply\/demand pressure pushing costs and necessary rate up. :-) :-)\n[Original Comment ID: 195727]\n",
