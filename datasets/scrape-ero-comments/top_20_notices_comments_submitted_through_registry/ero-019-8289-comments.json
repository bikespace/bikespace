        "comment":"We are in favour of this decision of a 14 year extension. Of course, we wish we did not have go through these extensions all of the time (this has happened too many times throughout my 60 years on this planet) and wish that this issue would be settled once and for all. The cottagers have proven since the 1890's that they love the location, the land and wildlife. Cottagers have always been very respectful of the environment. They have a right to have and maintain their cottages. Many have been here 2, 3, 4 generations, residing beside all of the campers that come from both Canada and the United States. Most years, the campgrounds cannot even be filled, so no sense in expanding that area. Ecology and wildlife have thrived (hence, the culls most years). Birdwatchers come to experience the wonder of Rondeau Park. If that weren't the case, we would have no visitors. These 2 factors show that the environment is not being hurt by cottages existing in the park. Cottagers put out nuts for the wildlife, hummingbird feeders, water pedestals for the birds. If anything, we are adding to the existence of wildlife and not hindering it. This is done for free and out of love. We are tired of having to fight government after government to keep our cottages. It costs so much money to fight for what is ours. My father was raised at Rondeau beginning in the 1930's, as was I, my children and now the family's grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It's not just about cottages, it's about family history and ancestral dwellings. So, we are in favour of this extension. Thank you.\n",

        "comment":"Hi there,\nI think it was a mistake to not end the leases in 2017 as per the original agreement.  However, although it was a long extension, I liked the proposal here https:\/\/ero.ontario.ca\/notice\/011-1300  better than this one.  At least it was a reasonable length of time, and it was final.  This one is just postponing the problem to 2038 with no finality at all.\nOne three-year and two two-year extensions... now it's not as high profile anymore.  Your proposals are getting softer and softer... what happens in 14 years?  The same darn thing. This is costing the taxpayers a lot of money with all the work going on behind the scenes on this file.\nMake a final decision and stick with it, and with the consequences.  For example, many honorable cottagers left because they kept to the original lease agreement!!  Be like that.\nIf you terminate the leases, you are keeping with the government's mandate there to put ecological integrity as a priority. If you don't, then you are serving the interests of a few hundred well-off people with really cheap cottages (who throw fits when they have to meet their agreements), instead of the people of Ontario as a whole and the natural habitat that could exist there if these leases ended.  You should at least start charging more for the leases (at least fair market value for rental of the land!)... I should think that these people can afford it if they really want to stay badly enough.\nI looked for the plan amendment wording attachment to the posting but didn't find it. What's online is about the 2022 amendment.  As such, I assume the plan amendment is ONLY changing \"2024\" to \"2038\", but it would be good to have that clarification in the posting itself.\nIn summary, if you must do this, please have a final and binding decision in 2038 associated with the lease extension.  As well, get an appraiser and start charging fair market value rent for each leaseholder based on each parcel's land value.\nThanks.\n",

        "comment":"I have no issue with the extension of the leases until 2038 . However , I think it would be advisable to extend the previous lease extension offer of several years ago that does not allow transfer of the lease to anyone but the leasee,s  spouse . As well , any lease should be considered to expire on the death of the leasee and\/or their spouse  and the property on the leased land removed and environmental remediation to take place . The purpose of this is , obviously , to avoid real estate speculation and the potential windfall profits that may ensue .\n",

That should still be the case if the 2038 extension is approved . In short , if the extension is granted , there should be no room for real estate speculation and the attendant financial windfall that would occur . Any sales of property on leased land should involve the removal of said property from the park . Buy a house from a leaseholder and all you get is the house , not the lease . Is this the status of the current proposal or will sales of property allow the buyer to assume the lease until 2038 ?\n",

        "comment":"Though the previous lease only expired in 2017, it's fair to say that successive governments have left Rondeau's cottagers in limbo for decades. For as long as I can remember, cottagers have asked for greater transparency regarding the government's intentions. Does the government want cottages at Rondeau or not? If they do want cottages, then cottagers deserve real proof in the form of an extended lease. 14 years is a step in the right direction, but it's less than half as long as it should be. Cottagers deserve to know why 14 years was chosen. Why not 30 years? What is the motivation behind this direction?\nI am happy to tell my children, the 4th generation of my family at Rondeau, that we'll be able to remain at Rondeau for 14 years. But the question remains, \"What then?\" It's incumbent upon the government to explain its long-term strategy, even if this current lease is only a medium-term solution.\n",

        "comment":"I support the proposal in ERO 019-8289 to amend the Rondeau Park Management Plan to allow cottages to remain in Rondeau Park until at least 2038. My understanding is that the Provincial Parks act already authorizes cottages can remain in Rondeau Park through 2038, so it is quite a surprising use of Ontario taxpayer dollars that the Rondeau Park Management Plan has not already been updated accordingly.  Plus, Rondeau was chartered to include cottages and the Heritage Cottage Community has been integral to the park ever since.\nNew lease agreements and extensions must be developed in consultation with the Rondeau Cottagers Association.  Too often we have seen the government attempt to draft terms without consultation with the cottagers only to discover they have overlooked obvious shortcomings of their proposals.  Start the conversation directly with the Rondeau Cottagers Association Executive Board.\nAct on the decision for ERO 011-1300 posted on December 20, 2019 which stated that \u201cOur final policy decision respecting this proposal will allow us to consult on a proposal for a new option for the long-term occupation of cottage lots.\"  Key term there was LONG TERM OCCUPATION.  The cottage community is ready, willing and able to engage in a thoughtful discussion on how to achieve that.\nWe need willing and motivated members of the government to engage in that discussion rather than continuing to push things down the road for the next minister or administration to deal with.\nA long term tenure agreement has substantial opportunity to benefit the long term health of the park.  Let's get the government and the cottagers engaged in activities that make things better.\nThis can be an awesome partnership if only the government would engage with the cottagers rather than treating the cottagers like the enemy.\n",

        "comment":"I Support the extension up to 2038 and well beyond that date if necessary to complete the sale of the lots to the cottage owners. I believe the sale of the lots to the existing cottage owner is the only reasonable and sensibly option for the Crown and the public. The lease is only a short term bandaid that needs to lead to  the sale of the lots. This park was built on the existence  of cottages in the park. I would like to assume that this lease  extension is to allow time to finalize the sale of the lots to present cottage owners, which was agreed upon by previous Ministers.\nThere a lot of false statements made about the cottage community in Rondeau, and the true facts are being ignored. Cottages are Not harming the park or the environment. They actually create habitat for species. Not destroy it. Many people make unfounded comments about cottagers, just because that is what some people do about everything.\nFinal comment - extend the lease till 2038, but make the sale of the lots to the cottagers asap.\n",

I think their people within the Ministry that refuse to look at facts and push for their own agenda and not reality. Cottages HAVE  NOT harmed this park, but made it. They seem to think a degree is more knowledge that lifetime experiences of local people. Just think, over 125 years of cottages, and the dune beach is more than 300 feet wider now than when cottages were first encouraged to be built. And none of that area is built upon. Cottages are not taking up any of the lakeshore beach. NOT ANY. And the fact is there are only 5 cottages that have water frontage, and they are all on Rondeau Bay, NOT Lake Erie. Plus these 5 lots take up 250 feet in total of a 8 mile Rondeau Bay shoreline. The benefits that these cottage lots provide far surpasses any negative idea that one may suggest.\nOver 125 years of cottages and the ecology is still thriving and going strong.\nYes - extend the leases.\n",

It financially makes no sense to move towards ending the cottage community in the park. The cottages are great stewards of the park, and generate income for the government as well as the local businesses in Chatham Kent.\nMoving forward together to develop a fair long turn solution is the right thing to do.\nThank you.\n",

In fact, it was one of the two reasons the park was created.  It is not clear to me that day users in tents and Winnebagos are better for the park ecologically.\n2) That said, renewal lease terms must be at market rates and not create a situation whereby increased land rent is used to effectively evict cottagers.\n3) The Ministry should not be allowed to stall its decision as a way to \"wait out\" the cottagers as decisions related to refinancing and capital improvements are required.\nPlease make this a priority as it has taken far to long to achieve clarity on this issue.\n",

Further, I would urge the Ontario government to implement a long-term permanent plan to provide certainty to the existing cottage owners that their leases will continue to be extended past the 2038 year well in advance of the expiry of any lease dates.  The cottage users are a significant part of the Chatham-Kent community and economy, and therefore, I wish them to remain.  As a long-time user of the Rondeau park, their presence does not negatively impact my enjoyment of the park.\n",

Marking up lease rates 200 - 1000% like other provincial parks is unreasonable and are bad faith negotiations resulting in underhanded removal of lease holders.\nLastly, I totally think that Rondeau cottages add and greatly enrich the park\u2019s history & heritage. Please remember the cottages were there before the park was a park. Although campers certainly are necessary and add short term value to the park, they are not invested in a long term commitment as a lease holder is.\nLeaseholders have been and will continue to be excellent stewards of the land. Some cottage owners are multi-generational who are very invested in continuing this tradition of ownership and land management.\n",

I hope it doesn't take till 2038 to achieve that. The sale of the lots is the VERY BEST solution for the management plan and the future health and benefit for all of Ontario including the MNR.\nIt is very unrealistic to think that going back to total nature is progressive. If that is the MNR's thoughts, they are totally out of step with reality.. Since cottages were first allowed in this park, the ACTUAL LAKE SHORE BEACH has INCREASED dramatically. Cottages are not and have never been built close to the shore line. The sale of the  lots would not change that. Lots would remain the same size. The beach would still remain Crown property.\nI could go on and on about how cottagers have co existed with nature.\nIn conclusion, extend the leases with intent to selling the lots as promised by previous Ministers.\n",

The cottagers are an integral part of the success of the park.\nI have a few conditions\n- the extension should be longer than 14 years, or, at the very least, there should be some proposal to renew.  This keeps the cottages in good condition.\n- all cottage owners must agree that they are users of the cottage - they must not be part of any VRBO, rental, B&B, etc\n- if the cottage owner wants to dispose of the property, then it must to sold to a family member first, if none are available it can go to a new owner so long as they a)do not already own a cottage in the park and b)agree to the above terms that this is not a rental property.  All new owners must agree that they will not resell the property for a minimum of 10 years save and except acts of God, death, etc.\nI also think that the park should allow for the infilling of cottages in the north of the park.  i.e. whereever there was an existing or historical cottage, in the past, a new cottage should be allowed to built, so long as there are limitations on the size of the cottage (i.e. under 1200sq feet of ground floor, no more than 2 stories, etc).\n",

Any extensions or new lease agreements must have reasonable terms and costs so as to not make cottage ownership unaffordable and something that would only be available to the rich.

The park was originaly created with leaseholders in mind to promote tourism, and cottages have formed an important part of the heritage of the park for over 100 years in some cases.\nWith cottages and their occupants present for close to a century, the park has managed to flourish as a safe haven promoting biodiversity to the point where new species, not indigenous to the area, like the Fowler Toad, have managed to find a habitat that suits them.\nThe lease terms and conditions need to be sufficiently long duration and reasonable monetary outlay, to ensure cottage maintenance is financially viable. No one wants cottage owners to have to pay punitive rates, and then let their cottages degrade.\nA long term plan (>50 years) would help cottage owners to plan and budget for the upkeep of their structures and sewage. Cottage owners have been awaiting more clarity regarding the future of the leases for a long time. It has been extremely stressful not knowing whether to fix a roof, repair a leak, or replace a broken window without assurance that the cottage would exist one or two years into the future.\nThe clarity of the currently proposed amendment, gives a somewhat reasonable time horizon for cottagers to plan, and the Ministry to be able to flex to changing environmental conditions.\n",

        "comment":"Ecological Costs Associated with Cottage Tenure in Rondeau Provincial Park\nIncluded are two sources that identify several ecological opportunity costs associated with allowing private cottage leases to continue in Rondeau Provincial Park, particularly the effects on various species and habitats. The most prominent issues highlighted are:\n\u2022 Invasive species: Cottage lots and the activities of cottagers can contribute to the spread of invasive plant species, impacting natural ecosystems. The report suggests that the introduction of non-native species may occur through garden escape, planting, and disturbance associated with cottage activities.\n\u2022 Water quality: Septic systems from cottages can negatively affect natural nutrient cycles, potentially leading to increased costs for the Crown to manage nitrogen and phosphorus leaching into ground and surface water.\n\u2022 Erosion and Habitat Fragmentation: The sources note that footpaths created by cottagers accessing the beach, along with the presence of roads and cottage lots, contribute to erosion and habitat fragmentation. These disturbances can lead to blowouts, disrupt natural habitat connections, and limit the park's ability to implement restoration programs like prescribed burning.\n\u2022 Impacts on Species at Risk: Cottage lots and associated access roads negatively impact various species at risk in the park. Road mortality is a significant concern, particularly for species like the Eastern Hognose Snake, Eastern Foxsnake, Five-lined Skink, and Fowler's Toad. The report also notes that activities like dragging recreational equipment on the beach pose a risk to the endangered Fowler\u2019s Toad. Additionally, the report observes that the presence of bird boxes on cottage lots may be subsidizing House Wren populations, potentially leading to competition with the endangered Prothonotary Warbler for nest cavities.\nThe report emphasizes that the cottage lots occupy land within provincially rare ecosystems, including beach\/dune, tallgrass, and savannah communities. Restoring these areas to their natural state is presented as a way to quantify the ecological opportunity costs. The report suggests that removing the cottages would enhance the protection of endangered species and their habitats, improve the provision of ecosystem services, and allow for more natural ecological processes.\nOne study found that the area of dune habitat disturbed by human activity in Rondeau decreased by almost 50% between 1955 and 2006, primarily due to the cessation of bulldozing activities in the dunes. However, despite this recovery, the study concluded that the largest source of disturbance to sand dunes in the park remains the private cottages. In 2006, disturbance attributed to cottage leaseholder access accounted for 82% of the total disturbed area in the dunes, a significantly disproportionate amount compared to the disturbance caused by the much larger number of campers and other park visitors.\nThe report suggests that while it's difficult to quantify the full extent of the ecological damage caused by the cottages, the costs of restoring and naturalizing the cottage areas could be used as an approximate measure of the ecological opportunity cost. However, it also acknowledges the challenge of accurately valuing the non-market benefits of a healthier ecosystem, which are borne by society rather than the Crown.\nThe sources highlight the ecological trade-offs inherent in allowing private cottage leases to continue in Rondeau Provincial Park. They suggest that while there have been improvements in managing the impact of the cottages, their presence continues to pose a significant challenge to the park's ecological integrity.\nIn summary due to habitat disturbance, invasive species introduction and ongoing mortality of species at risk, Society is bearing the cost of these losses for the benefit of a few cottagers.\n In good conscience this practice cannot continue and plans must be made to end the occupation of Rondeau Provincial Park.\nSources:\n1) Value of current cottage leases in Algonquin and Rondeau provincial parks.\nPrepared by Eric Miller and Jeff Wilson at Green Analytics\nApril 5, 2013\n2) Coastal Vegetation and Dune Disturbance Change Analysis for Rondeau Provincial Park, 1955-2006\nMinistry of Natural Resources and Forestry\nParks and Protected Areas Policy Section\nS.

        "comment":"I support the lease extension until 2038. I understand the value of maintaining important ecosystems. In my view, the cost of removing to the surrounding Chatham Kent community, both economically and as a community, is not commensurate with the benefits of expanding ecosystems in the park. The cottages represent a only small portion of the land of the park, so the incremental gains to the natural environment are likely not greater than the costs to the overall community.\nThere does not seem to be a strategy involved about how the park should be used long-term. Is it for people or is it for ecosystems? With a long-term lease, both the Park and the cottagers can adequately plan for what they want that future to be.\n",

This promise was then ignored and ultimately disregarded by mid-level MECP \/ Ontario Parks bureaucrats, despite repeated promises by the Minister (and subsequent Minister) that this lot sale plan was \"official government policy and irreversible\".  It is shocking that the clear direction of a Minister can be totally reversed by a mid-level Manager yet this appears to be how the Government of Ontario operates.

The original 1894 charter highlights the cottage community as a key reason for the park's establishment, and this Heritage Cottage Community has been vital since the park's beginning.\nAny new leases or extensions related to this initiative should include fair terms and conditions, avoiding punitive economic measures aimed at eviction. It's essential that new lease agreements are created in collaboration with the Rondeau Cottagers Association.\nThe decision regarding ERO 011-1300, announced on December 20, 2019, indicated that a final policy decision would allow for consultations on a new long-term cottage lot occupation option. The cottage community is eagerly awaiting this proposal and looks forward to discussions on establishing a long-term solution for cottage tenure.\n",

        "comment":"I oppose any extension for cottagers. This is a provincial park and should be used only for day use and camping. The world, Canada, and Ontario needs more green space and the footprint left by cottagers is detrimental to the natural environment.  The campsite portion of the park covers a very small amount of the total area but the cottagers take up a very significant amount of the park and interfere and hurt the environment.  Cars, noise, septic tanks, and other human activity and pollution all have an impact and reducing any amount of these would leave the park and nature in much better shape.\nPeople are not allowed to live in the park during the winter I would assume because it is hard on the eco-system so why is it that having people live there in the summer is somehow acceptable?\nWhy extend it for an additional 14 years if the end game is to eventually have the cottagers leave then why not address that now and have them removed? Presumably at some point the cottagers will be asked to leave so it should be now.  Years ago when individual leases expired those cottages were removed and left for nature to take over and to my mind that worked out very well so the same should happen now.\nThis specific park has many uses and functions all of which would be markedly improved if the cottagers were removed.\nA provincial park is just that a park, not an exclusive playground for wealthy people who can afford to have a second residence, especially now when so many Ontarians are struggling.\nIf having people reside in provincial parks is such a good idea why isn't the province proposing opening all of the provincial parks to cottagers? My guess is that the backlash and outcry against any government foolish enough to do this would be enormous.  Rondeau therefore should be no different. It is way past the time these cottagers should be removed. Rather than extend their leases it is time for them to be out.\n",

That is why I support the proposal to modify the Park management plan to extend cottage lease eligibility to 2038.  Also, we need to be ever mindful of the final decision of ERO 011-1300, to come up with a truly long term scheme for occupation of cottage lots as promised by four separate Ministers. This needs to be done without further delay. I suggest that talks with the Rondeau Cottagers Association commence as soon as possible.\n",

Allegations made by some that the cottages harm the environment are not supported by evidence.  After more than 100 years the ecology of Rondeau is thriving.  The notion that private cottages do not belong on Provincial parks is held by some who are obviously unfamiliar with the reason for the existence of Rondeau Park as evidenced in the Park Charter of 1894. The heritage cottage community needs to be preserved as it is documented to be a cultural heritage landscape of Provincial significance and this was promised in the final decision of ERO 011-1300 on December 20, 2019. It is time for permanent security of tenure.\n",

Cottagers have become more aware of the importance of our natural environment. Many lots have become partially naturalized. Past studies of cottage impact on the environment have not shown a negative impact to the Park.\nOn the economic side of things the cottages provide a significant financial boost to many local businesses and trades people.\nI am in favor of a 14 year lease extension.\n",

Yes, renew the lease to a long term lease of 25 year renewable for another 25 years or 50 year lease renewable for another 50 year lease. The cottages are a viable economic part of the regional economy. Many cottage owners are also owners operators of large industrial businesses that employ thousands of people in the area. Without the cottages, we risk losing the large employers b\/c the cottage owners may move their business to a location where they can have a long lease or own the land and cottage.

The cottagers are stewards of the park and drive hundreds, if not thousands, of the parks\u2019s visitors each year- providing valuable revenue to the park to keep it functioning and well maintained for all who wish to enjoy it. I think it would be irresponsible to close down such a valuable revenue source for something that so many people can benefit from beyond the cottage owners themselves.  I see no valid reason to prevent a long term solution to keeping cottages and their income stream - ( whether through their lease fees or via the many visitors that the cottages bring to be park each year) - in the park. The Rondeau cottage community has existed for over 100 years and the park is thriving. It is thriving so much so that an annual deer cull is required. Please consider a long term solution to keeping Rondeau cottages in Rondeau. The cottagers are a kind and friendly community who respect,  care for and honour Rondeau as the beautiful haven that it is. Propaganda that has been distributed to  the contrary has been misinformed, false  and defamatory and needs to be addressed and corrected.\nRondeau cottages need to stay in Rondeau as originally intended and therefore a long term solution needs to be made to ensure that happens.

It only makes sense!  Everywhere else, rental rates, property values, mortgages, increase significantly each year. The lease rate should increase as well.\nThe Park absolutely needs the increases to the lease costs, to maintain the services that it provides for the cottagers. (Road maintenance, snow removal, tree maintenance\/removal, \u201cpolicing\u201d,etc.)  And also, the added revenue could be used towards rebuilding the large dock on the bay.

        "comment":"Yes. Approve the extension. It is very hard to understand that with 87 % of Ontario being CrownLand, that this very very very small piece of land, that was encouraged by the Crown for construction of Cottages, remains a problem for the MNR to let go. Cottages have NOT harmed this area. In fact, the MNR by not allowing a whitetail dear herd reduction for years, caused more harm to the natural vegetation than cottages ever could. That seems to left out of any conversations the MNR has ever had with the public. It is because of the damage caused by the OVER population of the whitetail deer, that the vegetation of the park was badly destroyed, and  NOT by the presents of the cottages.\nExtend the term of the management plan, but approve the sale of the lots to cottagers. It would be a Win Win Win for everybody. MNR - Cottagers - Chatham Kent , and even the Province of Ontario.\n",

Family members had also been long time park staff, with certificates of appreciation for their lengthy support and work for the Department of Lands and Forests, as what it was previously under.\nAt no time, were the cottages deemed to be a threat to the existence of the park, but actually a driving force behind it being considered \"The Crown Jewell \" of Ontario's parks. Let's continue to restore that title by working with the cottage community, not by working against it\nExtend the term, but make the sale of the lots.\nAs Premier Ford has said, A Promise Made is a Promise Kept.\n",

        "comment":"Subject: Proposal for Extension of Cottage Leases at Rondeau Provincial Park\nI am writing in support of the proposed extension of cottage leases in Rondeau Provincial Park for an additional 14 years. This extension not only supports the interests of the cottage owners but also aligns with the broader objectives of the park and the community.\nMany cottage owners have invested significant time and resources into their properties, creating a sense of stability and belonging within the park. An extension would provide these families with the assurance and predictability they need to continue maintaining and improving their cottages, which helps preserve the unique character of the Rondeau Community.\nLong-term residents contribute to the local economy and park activities, fostering a vibrant community that benefits both visitors and conservation efforts. This extension would encourage the continuation of community traditions, such as the sailing club that enrich the park experience for all.\nFrom an ecological standpoint, stable cottage occupancy is beneficial. Long-term leaseholders are more invested in the sustainability of their surroundings, promoting stewardship and responsible usage of the park\u2019s resources.\nImportantly, a 14-year lease extension can provide the provincial administration with a predictable framework for planning and resource allocation while ensuring that recreational use of the park continues to flourish in a sustainable manner.\nThank you a concerned citizen\n",

        "comment":"I fully support proposal ERO 019-8289 and amendments to the Rondeau Park plan for continuation of the vibrant, sustainable and financially supportive community of the cottages within the park.\nThe cottages occupy a very small percentage of the total park land - and have been a caring community providing stewardship to the lands in collaboration with park management over the years. In fact the original charter fully embraces and lists cottages within the park land as one of the core justifications for creating the park itself.\nDecisions regarding cottage properties and proposals supportive of long term cottage occupancies have been outstanding since 2019 and again promised in early 2020. Cottages and visitors expect and deserve to have decisions made that provides clarity and process in support of continued and long term cottage leases within Rondeau as part of original concept and as sustainable and responsible stewardship in the future.\nCottage leases must be negotiated with due consideration of tenure and historical legacy integral with the park history and future and must be of reasonable terms, operational conditions and costs. Families deserve the right to continue enjoyment of this park as originally intended and be economically feasible to do so. It must be considered the significant value, awareness and monies cottage lease holders, guests and friends bring to Rondeau and the greater  Chatham Kent area overall.\n",

        "comment":"I endorse the extension to the cottage leases. I do however, think the extension is not long enough. Any extension needs to provide sufficient certainty for investments to upgrade or even maintain the existing cottages. I would suggest a minimum of 20 years extension is required. The cottages need to be maintained- but without a substantial period of time to have a \u201creturn\u201d on those investments I am concerned there will be insufficient investments made. By \u201creturn\u201d I mean getting value from investing in the properties both from a financial perspective and from having the time to enjoy the benefits through use.\nAs health and safety in building standards continue to improve and evolve I would hope there would be sufficient incentive for cottagers to continue to invest. Insufficient certainty for the future does not provide such incentive, nor does the current 14 year proposed extension provide such.\nThe cottagers provide a good balance for Rondeau Provincial Park. They are responsible stewards within the park year round as well as contributing to economy inside and outside the park. Invariably they are a net positive impact in my opinion.\nWhile I endorse the extension, I believe more needs to be done.\n",

The final decision reached in ERO 011-1300 was to put forth a new long term solution for the occupation of cottage lots in Rondeau.  That decision was over nine years from the original proposal...hardy a decision made in haste, hence being referred to as a \"final\" decision. That decision needs to be honoured: a plan is needed for a long term solution.  In the meantime, any new leases need to be negotiated in good faith with the Rondeau Cottagers Association.\n",

        "comment":"I am not in favour of the lease extension. However it might be the lesser of two evils, if the government holds the cottagers to accountability.\n-the current lease that leaseholders signed and agreed to, does not allow cottagers to have their Rondeau cottage as their sole place of residence, yet there are probably at least a dozen cottagers who make it their sole\/primary residence. If this lease extension goes forward, there will likely be more and more who make it their primary\/sole residence, and will eventually demand or expect increasing services such as municipal water supply. Increased services will ultimately cause greater negative impacts on the fragile natural environment of this nationally significant provincial park;\n-cottagers should not intrude in any way on the area beyond their official cottage lot. For example they should not be dumping anything across the Lakeshore Road into the forest. This has happened too much in the past, and there is some junk, but even worse, are the non-native plants that have been deposited, allowing them to propagate and negatively impact the forest; also they should not expand\/store equipment onto adjacent vacant lots, or towards the beach area at all;\n-cottagers should not be planting any species of plant not native to the park on their lots, as some will eventually end up beyond the lot and negatively impact the natural environment; they should be encouraged to remove the non-native plants that are already on their lot;\n-eventual removal of cottages has been in the existing park management plan, yet the government continues to capitulate to the interests of them, rather than doing what is right to protect this nationally significant natural area. However in the few cases where cottages have been removed, the government does not attempt to restore the newly vacant lot, resulting in many non-native plants to take over, some species which are quite aggressively invasive, which will expand beyond. If the government was committed to protecting this natural environment, there must be an approved restoration plan for any and all lots as they are vacated.\n-Any violation of the current or future lease conditions should result in a warning to them. Three violations, and their existing lease should be terminated;\n-the park budget should be expanded to ensure there are adequate staff all year round to monitor and deal with any violations of the existing or future leases.\nPlease do what is right for Rondeau as the nationally significant natural area that it is, and not give in yet again to the favoured few cottagers!\n",

The original 1894 Park charter describes the cottage community as one of the two reasons the Park was created and the Heritage Cottage Community has been integral to the park since its very inception.\nThe cottagers have been here for 100 years and it has been proven that they are wonderful stewards of the park. If you walk on the beach you will see people picking up garbage. They are usually cottagers. If there are bottles or waste left by the \"tourists\" it will be a cottager who stops to pick it up. If there is a snake or turtle on the road that could be hurt...again it would be a cottager who helps it out if harms way. We love this park and want to see it remain unchanged and pristine.\nThere is also the economic impact that we bring to the area. Personally, since we bought our cottage three years ago we have spent over one hundred thousand dollars in renovations and improvements to it. All of that has gone to local contractors and building supply businesses. As well since we are retired we have spent most of April to November at the park and we shop local businesses in the area. If you were to force the cottagers out it would be a huge blow to the local economy. We are just one cottage, if you multiply that by 275 cottages the economic effect that we have is undeniable!\nHowever, we don't live in a bubble. We know that there is an individual in Shrewsbury who has made it a personal crusade to get rid of us (the same Shrewsbury that allows untreated waste to leach into the bay!). He has tried to enlist the help of folks who have never been to the park and know nothing of what the cottagers do for this place. We ask you to consider his input into this decision with weight it deserves. He has a personal vendetta against some of the cottagers and he is trying to punish all of us.\nThere are many, many reasons why the cottagers are good for the park and should be allowed to remain indefinitely. We are a vibrant village of caring owners. A long term solution not only makes sense but it is the right thing to do.\n",

I see this as a positive initiative that will provide a significant economic benefit to the Chatham-Kent area.  By providing 14 more years of occupancy to over 200 cottages ensures there are hundreds of people using amenity and services in the area.\nAdditionally, the continued attendance of the park by the cottagers continues a long tradition of one of the original proposed purposes of Rondeau Park, a place of recreation.  The use of the park by the hundreds of campers and cottagers is a positive use of outdoors space in the summer and winter months.\n\tAs a final note, I encourage the government to look back at the original decision in ERO 011-1300 stating there is a desire to have a long term occupation of the cottage lots.  While a 14 year lease is welcome, it does not address the long term stability of the cottages.  The economic activity that would be brought forth by the cottagers in the event of a permanent occupancy due to renovations would be a boon to the Chatham Kent area.\nBest Regards\n",

Provincial parks should be for the use of everyone and no one small sub-set of the population should be given the privilege to enjoy the park land for their exclusive right. I do not support the lease extension. Rondeau's management plan indicated that the Rondeau leases should not be extended following their expiry, however here we are. I understand there is a history of cottagers in Rondeau but it is time to end this private use of our public parks. Not everyone has the opportunity to have a lease so why perpetuate leases of the wealthy few? Some of the leaseholder are not even Canadian citizens, they are international citizens that vacation here. I do not support the continuation of cottagers in Rondeau, I do not support the continuation of cottagers in Algonquin and I do not support giving perpetual lease extensions. It is time to kick the cottagers out of our provincial parks and removal all infrastructure from the park land and rehabilitate it. Humans have enough land outside the park. Habitat for valuable and at risk species is shrinking across this country. Reclaim some of the developed lease land and restore it and give it back to native flora and fauna, within park that will protected into perpetuity.\nThe Doug Ford government changed the funding structure of Ontario Parks, so that Ontario Parks no longer receives provincial funding and must run entirely on the revenue they receive from operations including lease fees. So I understand this is a revenue stream for Ontario Parks. Historically the Rondeau lease fees have been too low, remaining the same decades. Raising lease fees to match current day value is not good enough to justify continuing the lease program. Remove the cottagers from Rondeau! If the cottagers are upset, that is on them. The leases always had an expiry date. The policy intention of not extending the lease was in the Rondeau management plan for years. This government has to stop making decision based on a few loud people. The general public does not want cottagers in their provincial parks.  The Indigenous communities with treaty rights at Rondeau do not want the cottage leases to continue - they want them out!\nI do not support the leases in Rondeau. I do not support Rondeau's lease extension. I do not support the cottagers remaining in Rondeau (or Algonquin for that matter).

Many of them are no longer cottages, however, they have become full 4 season \u201ccottages\u201d and homes. I do not support private occupation of provincial parks, Rondeau is ever becoming a subdivision for an elite group and not a place for the average park visitor to enjoy.\nI believe that these cottages should be taken down as they are out up for sale. I can understand family cottages being passed through generations, however, I DO NOT agree with people making upwards of half a million dollars selling their cottages as they would their private homes. Provincial parks SHOULD be for the public to enjoy, and again, not benefit the select few. I have noticed that some of the cottages have been torn down over the years, but why have they stopped? This should be happening at a much quicker rate.\nOntario Parks is supposed to be \u201cprotecting important natural and cultural features while providing opportunities compatable ecologically sustainable recreation\u201d. I have a hard time understanding how all these developments are happening to the cottages and can still be protecting our environment. There are so many rare and important species that call Rondeau home, and all of this development cannot be compatible with protection. Recreation opportunities are provided for who? Again, not the general public but the cottagers. If that land was used by the park, there are so many options for uses for the public to enjoy. Instead, all of these beaches are essentially for exclusive use by a select group.\nThank you for the opportunity to express my concerns.\n",

Moving forward, fair lease terms are crucial to protect this heritage community. These terms should avoid any economic barriers that would drive current residents out, and the Rondeau Cottagers Association should play a role in drafting these agreements to ensure fairness. Furthermore, the long-term tenure proposal, first noted in ERO 011-1300 in December 2019, would bring much-needed security to the cottage community, and the community is eager to see it move forward.\n",

        "comment":"The cottage community in Rondeau Park is a vital piece of the park\u2019s legacy, dating back to 1894, and ERO 019-8289 offers a necessary step to secure this heritage until at least 2038. Fair and reasonable lease terms are key to keeping this community alive, and the Rondeau Cottagers Association should be involved in developing them. Any terms that are economically prohibitive would risk losing the very heritage that makes Rondeau so special. Additionally, the promised proposal on long-term tenure from ERO 011-1300, which was last referenced in December 2019, is something the community has been awaiting with great anticipation. Moving forward with this would give the cottage community the stability and security they need.\n",

Since its establishment in 1894, the cottages have contributed not just to the park\u2019s identity but also to its appeal as a destination where people can experience both natural beauty and historical charm. It\u2019s essential that new leases are fair and not overly restrictive, allowing the community to remain intact. The Rondeau Cottagers Association should have a central role in drafting these terms to ensure they are reasonable and in line with the community\u2019s needs. There is also a need to finally address the long-term tenure solution that was referenced in ERO 011-1300 in 2019. Moving forward on this proposal would provide the stability the cottage community deserves.\n",

Outside the park many cottage owners are paying property taxes greater than $10,000 per year. Not all these cottages are 4 seasons either.\nI am opposed to the proposal to kick the can down the road and not resolve the issue, recognizing that their lease is way past due.\nI would suggest that we change the park boudaries and let the cottages North east of the camping sites to be sold to the highest bidders. A smaller percentage of the sale proceeds could then be given back to the present owners of these cottages to enable them to buy the properties if desired. The funds can be used to enhance the park and its trails.\nThe other cottages in my perspective need to be discouraged from staying. This can be done by charging an aggresive lease costs and letting the leases go up double the rate of inflation. This would allow those who wish to stay to stay and the ones that feel the lease fee is too high to let their cottages come down. Overtime the cottages will be reduced and there would be no ultimatum to vacate and fight over this in 14 years. At the same time it is critical that we discourage present cottage lease holders in making major changes\/expansion to their cottages.\n",

It is not only a haven for the cottagers and Visitors but also a boon to the businesses in the surrounding communities that benefit substantially from the customers generated by the Park.\nAs part of this  process., Cottage Association representatives  should contribute to the creation of this amendment to assure mutual understanding and prevent unreasonable terms and conditions. The Rondeau Cottagers Association must be involved in the development  of the this process.\nERO 011 1300 dated  December 20, 2019, stated we would also consult together on a proposal for a new option for the long term occupation of cottage lots. Despite the fact that ERO 011 1300 provided  that this would be completed in \"early 2020\" , we have seen no such proposal to date.

As an Association we support this 14-year lease extension proposal with the understanding that discussions to make our cottage community PERMANENT will begin in a timely manner. As you know Rondeau Park was chartered for the purpose of cottaging in 1894 making us Ontario's original cottage community.\nAs per former Minister of the Environment, Conservation & Parks Jeff Yurek the province's preferred solution is to sell the existing cottage lots to the Municipality of Chatham-Kent as a single transaction.  The lots would then be sold to the individual leaseholders. Although this plan was initiated it appears that certain persons within Ontario Parks ignored the Minister's directive and now we are back to yet another lease extension. Please see the attached email from Minister Yurek confirming same. As per Minister Yurek at the end of his term as Minister this policy has never been withdrawn or changed and still remains Ontario's official policy on Rondeau.\nThe Rondeau Cottagers Association looks forward to restarting discussions towards the goal of a lot sale to ensure the permanence of our unique-in-Ontario Heritage Cottage Community and fulfilling the Minister's now five-years unfulfilled promise to our members. In the meantime we support the proposed change to the Park Management Plan to facilitate the community remaining intact while these discussions are initiated.\nFor additional information on our community please see:\nwww.rondeaufacts.ca\n",

        "comment":"1)  I support the proposal in ERO 019-8289 to amend the Rondeau Park Management Plan to allow cottages to remain in Rondeau Park until at least 2038. The history of the Park has always included cottages, and continue to be an attraction to the park for many of the local visitors.  They cottages are understated, charming, and cottagers are respectful of their community as the leases allow them to take custodial stewardship of the land.\n2)  To ensure that the exisitng leaseholders are able to continue to care for their cottages in the manner that makes them an attractive element of the park, and in keeping with the main reason for founding the Park, all lease extensions must be reasonable and not punitive in nature.  Imposing too much of a financial burden to leaseholders will diminish their ability to maintain the structures in a way that is positive for the Park.  Punitive leases will certainly cause our Heritage community owners to have to sell properties to the wealthy, a result that nobody wants.\n3)  The decision for ERO 011-1300 posted on December 20, 2019 stated that \u201cOur final policy decision respecting this proposal will allow us to consult on a proposal for a new option for the long-term occupation of cottage lots. We expect to post a new proposal on the Environmental Registry of Ontario early in 2020\u201d. The cottage community is anxiously awaiting this outstanding proposal and to have discussions to develop the long term cottage tenure solution.\n",

        "comment":"I am in favour of extending the terms. I am a cottage owner. I am totally in favour of the tentative agreement for us to buy our lots. It is in the best interest of all. The reasoning backing this is as follows:\n1. Cottages have been there since they were in encouraged to do so by the Province.\n2. They have not harmed the ecological integrity of the park.\n3. There is no evidence that any species has declined in numbers since cottages were erected, and just maybe the numbers have Increased. If it weren't for the cottages providing habitat  cover, the species may have been at risk.\n4. The cottages Do Not occupy ANY of the lake shore. In fact, the lake shore beach and sand dunes is 300 to 400 feet wider now in most places than when cottages were first allowed. It is just taken place naturally. That is the way the world evolves.\n5. The only cottages with shore line are the first 5 cottages inside the park and on Rondeau Bay. These lots take up 250 feet in total of a 8 mile shore line of park boundary  ( roughly 42,240 feet ).\n6.It is not fair to have in the lease that cottages must be kept in good repair, or the Ministry shall enter the property and make the repairs and charge the cottage owner for such repairs, and then could cancel or not renew the leases.\n7. Cottages have been and are good stewards of the land. It is time to make the sale to cottage owners as has been  negotiated by Previous Ministers.\n8. LESS than 1% of the park is occupied by these cottages, and that % is able to be sold.\nExtend the lease, but get the sale of the lots done soon, so everyone can move on and make this park the Crown Jewell it once was again.\n",

The cottage community has been a part of the Park\u2019s fabric since its charter in 1894 and there is no objectively demonstrated rationale for the removal of the Park\u2019s cottages.\nNew lease conditions and fees should be reasonable, balancing fiscal obligation to the Province, yet not resulting in financial eviction of the cottage community brought about by uncertainty around uncontrolled lease fee increases.\nThe Rondeau Cottagers Association must be included in fair and transparent discussions around future terms and conditions. All parties want honest, constructive dialogue, protecting the Park for all to enjoy.\nUltimately, a solution for long term tenure of Rondeau\u2019s cottage community must be pursued, as approved by ERO 011-1300, posted on December 20, 2019.\nThe current ERO proposal provides time and opportunity to address long term tenure of the historic and culturally significant cottage community.\nLet\u2019s ensure another 130 years of co-existence for all to enjoy.\nThank you.\n",

        "comment":"For over 100 years, and a part of the original plan for Rondeau, cottages and their owners have been a fixture of Rondeau Park.  The cottages were required to be substantial when the leases were granted, and over the years the owners, many of whom now are in thier 5th generation, have soulfully maintained their cottages AND the common grounds of the Park.  Generations have learned about the migratory birds that would not have done so if not for the cottages.  Traditions have been passed down, sailing vessels have been a mainstay (as opposed to noisy jet skis and power boats) and , should the leases be reasonably and affordably renewd through at least 2038, will continue to be so.  Because of this, and many other reasons,\n1)  I support the proposal in ERO 019-8289 to amend the Rondeau Park Management Plan to allow cottages to remain in Rondeau Park until at least 2038, and hopefully beyond so that many more generations can benefit from the beauty that our ancestors did.\n2)  It is further imperative that new leases or extensions as part of this initiative  have reasonable terms and conditions not those with economically unfeasible terms.   New lease agreements must be developed in consultation with the Rondeau Cottagers Association.\n3)  We have waited at least over 5 years, patiently, for something to be done to secure our leases on a long enough and feasible enough basis to continue to maintain the cottages in a fashion complimentary to the Park, and we look forward to honest and sincere efforts on the Government's part to allow the leaseholders to remain the Heritage of the Park, as was the original intent of Rondeau over 100 years ago\n",

        "comment":"Jason Travers and members of the Ontario Parks Operations Branch:\nThe problem with extending the Rondeau Park cottage leases is that the current cottagers already don\u2019t respect or follow the terms of their leases, are constantly pushing the boundaries, and nothing seems to be done about it.\nExtending the leases by another 14 years is the easy thing to do, but it just kicks the can down the road, all the while enabling these cottagers to do increased damage to this important Carolinian forest land and Great Lakes shoreline, seemingly without repercussions.\nIs Park Superintendent Brad Connor or anyone else doing regular checks of these cottage lots, and either fining or removing cottagers who violate the rules?\nOn just a cursory drive around the park North of Bennett the other day, and just at a glance, I saw these issues* (listed below).\nMr. Connor has the ability (and responsibility) to do more thorough checks all around the lots to prevent these cottagers from continuing to destroy the natural areas.\nPlease note that while the issue of invasive plants might seem like a gentle one, Rondeau is one of the last homes of the endangered Red Mulberry, (just one example), so having plants like White Mulberries on their lots directly prevents the Red Mulberry from regenerating (as the White is more aggressive).\nI also find it concerning that the Rondeau Cottagers Association, who say on their own website that their primary goal is to lobby to privately buy & own their lots, is continued to be given a foothold. They now have at least one member on the Chatham City Council (Alyson Storey) to petition for their private and greedy remit, which would directly take from Ontario residents and more importantly, from the (sometimes endangered) flora & fauna that call Rondeau Park home.\nIdeally, these leases would finally be discontinued, the land returned to nature, and a more robust plan of species protection\/ invasive plant removal put in place for the future.\nWith the constant encroachment of global warming and destruction of natural habitats, is this not the obvious and inevitable thing to do for future planning?\nBut as it\u2019s now October and it\u2019s likely too late to make a u-turn by the December lease end, please at least commit to a more rigorous policy of checking lease violations and damage to nature, and be decisive and proactive about removing cottages that don\u2019t comply.\nBeing complacent towards these cottagers\u2019 behaviour is doing a disservice to the rest of Ontarians, and to the nature in the park itself.\n(Also, please tell me you\u2019re discounting the assured 278 \u201cletters of approval\u201d you\u2019ll get to this proposal from the cottagers themselves. Of course they want their own leases to continue, and will call themselves \u201cStewards of the land\u201d - ha! - to convince you. The question is whether the other 14 million citizens of Ontario actually think this is the way forward for the park.)\nAnd instead of saying \u201cThe ministry is not considering sale of the cottage lots at this time\u201d, please assure Ontarians that their provincial park lands will NEVER be for sale to private (and in this case, largely American,) owners.\n\u2014-\n*Cursory\/ incomplete list of issues I observed recently, and only North of Bennett. I give these as a small sample - the park needs to be doing more to observe and weed these out - literally!\nHas invasive plants growing on property:\n18 cases, as follows:\n\u2022 vinca growing profusely in front lawns\n\u2022 huge invasive honeysuckle bushes in front lawn (5 cases)\n\u2022 large white mulberry in front lawn, English Ivy growing up front of cottage (2 cases)\n\u2022 lily of the valley growing along cottage \/ in a front flower bed (2 cases)\n\u2022 residential side of beach access #4 filled with euphorbia\n\u2022 barberry hedge* along beach access #6 property boundary\n\u2022 what looks like a barberry hedge* surrounding cottage\n\u2022 big Asian meadowsweet bushes along street side property line\n\u2022 Privet hedge lining front of cottage\n(*also worsens tick populations)\nMowing into the designated wild areas adjoining their lots:\n\u2022 3 cases\nInvasives in adjacent natural areas. Note that these are almost assuredly from cottages dumping garden waste, as going down Rondeau Road (no cottages) is fairly native, while the parallel lakeshore Road with cottages on one side is full of invasives including Japanese Honeysuckle, Dog Strangling Vine, etc.\n\u2022 Vinca thick along either side of beach access #2)\n\u2022 Lots of burning bush at front of beach access #3)\n\u2022 Thick vinca in forest south side of one cottage, driveway lined with barberry shrubs\nRenovations expanding the original building footprint:\n3 cases:\n\u2022 One added north side extension, doubling their  footprint\n\u2022 One with Tyvek wrapping currently up around a frame that exceeds the interior original cottage\n\u2022 One built a new screened in front porch in the past few years that exceeds the original cottage footprint. (Can they later just reinforce those walls, and that is a loophole to expand their building?)\nThere are also several instances of cottagers occupying their properties as full time residences\/ not using them only as recreationally, as intended.\n",

Many species are protected on the lots and cottagers are very concious of species at risk, unlike day users.  The leaseholders support the park and its commercial intsrests aside from lease fees taxes ekectricity chsrges etc etc.\n",

        "comment":"Cottages belong in Rondeau.  The Park was chartered for cottages in 1894 ...Rondeau is Ontario's Original Cottage Community!  The heritage cottages are in balance with the environment and the cottagers are good stewards. All of the cottage lots take up 0.6% of the park and block none of the Lake Erie shoreline. The proposal to amend the Park Plan in ERO 019-8289 should be supported. A plan should be developed in accordance with ERO 011-1300 to make the cottages a permanent fixture of Rondeau.  It's the right thing to do.\n",

        "comment":"Here\u2019s a rephrased version of your message:\n---\nI support the proposal outlined in ERO 019-8289 to amend the Rondeau Park Management Plan, ensuring the cottages remain in the park at least until 2038. The 1894 Park charter identifies the cottage community as one of the two founding purposes of the Park, and the Heritage Cottage Community has been a vital part of its identity from the very beginning.\nAny new or extended leases under this initiative must include fair and reasonable terms, avoiding the use of punitive economic conditions to force eviction. Lease agreements should be developed in collaboration with the Rondeau Cottagers Association to ensure transparency and fairness.\nThe decision on ERO 011-1300, posted on December 20, 2019, stated: \u201cOur final policy decision respecting this proposal will allow us to consult on a proposal for a new option for the long-term occupation of cottage lots. We expect to post a new proposal on the Environmental Registry of Ontario early in 2020.\u201d The cottage community eagerly awaits this proposal and the opportunity to engage in discussions to develop a sustainable long-term solution for cottage tenure.\nThank you.\n",

The park\u2019s 1894 charter lists the cottage community as one of the original reasons for creating the park, and these cottages have been an important part of the park ever since.\nAny new or extended leases should have fair terms, not unfair ones designed to force people out. The new agreements should be created with input from the Rondeau Cottagers Association to make sure they are reasonable.\nThe decision for ERO 011-1300, posted on December 20, 2019, said a new proposal for long-term cottage use would be shared in early 2020. The cottage community is still waiting for this proposal and looks forward to working on a lasting solution.\nThank you\n",
