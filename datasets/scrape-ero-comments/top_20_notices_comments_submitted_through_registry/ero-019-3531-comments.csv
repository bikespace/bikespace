54434,/comment/54434,"The government has heard from the public for years saying that removal of groundwater is not wanted, not sustainable and has deleterious effects on natural balances (reducing water tables with negative effects on swamps and creek/river waterflows). The water sale industry is a major source of plastic container pollution here and worldwide.
Ontario's water is a precious resource now and for the future and not to be taken cheaply. Water companies need to be made to pay commensurate with the amounts of profit and required to match volumes taken with equal value programs improving the natural water presence and wildlife. Definite legal restrictions on the amounts allowed with provisos enforcing reduced taking levels due to low rainfall and water tables.
In summary, it is preferred not to approve any more water industry but if it were authorized it should be made to pay fair value and be part of maintaining the resource.
Sincerely,

54531,/comment/54531,"This is an industry that is an environmental disaster as it takes 2 litres of water to create the plastic bottle that another litre of water goes into. The 24/7 heavy trucks on the roads shipping water across the country emit and damage roads and bridges.  Thus the taxpayer pays for this industry by paying tax dollars to mitigate the damage and harms to the environment.
That much plastic is a nightmare as recycling is not an effective alternative.  It ends up in our landfills, waterways, and lakes on its way to the ocean.  Humans are eating, drinking and now breathing in microplastics constantly.  This is an industry that must be held accountable for the destruction it causes and creates.  Please deny further depletion of groundwater and the proliferation of plastic pollution by denying this permit.

54534,/comment/54534,"Puslinch has too many competing interests seeking groundwater from farms, residents, gravel pits, and businesses.  In addition both Guelph and Cambridge are approaching with their Source Water Protection Areas. The priorities set in the new regulations place municipal drinking water, agriculture and the environment above commercial water bottling.  This is the clear example of these competing interests.  This very short comment period does not allow for proper responses from any of these competing interests.
There are also too many uncertainties to proceed with a renewal at this point.  This is a new owner with new expectations.  It is also groundwater we know too little about like rate of recharge, effects of climate change, population growth in the surrounding area, and sustainability.
It would be irresponsible to grant a permit quickly without a fulsome investigation into the repercussions.

There are Indigenous communities that do not have any clean water and haven't for decades now and who have publicly opposed permits to take water for bottling. Companies like Nestle, now Triton Water Canada Holdings, are making a massive profit from a natural resource. Not only are these companies making an insane amount of profit off of a natural resource, they are destroying our beautiful earth in the process with the plastic waste they are producing. Our oceans are filling up with plastic to the point where there will be the same amount of fish as plastic by the year 2050. WATER FOR LIFE, NOT FOR PROFIT!!!

Hillsburg is struggling to create a water treatment and muncipal water system and having ground water removed is the last thing they need at this time. The water bottler has taken enough from the ground water there.  The population there is destined to grow given the Places to Grow legislation.  They are in a difficult situation already.
We see what unbridled growth does to water supply in Collingwood.  This is replicated in other communities like the race to get water to satisfy growth in Centre Wellington.

54688,/comment/54688,"1. This new company has no track record in managing water extraction, transporting bottled water, or monitoring.  They are investors now in debt.  We can then anticipate layoffs as Metropoulous has done with other companies, leveraging loans, pumping up profit no matter what the results, and a quick sale.  This is not who we would want managing and taking Ontario groundwater. Their motivation is a quick profit only. The ten year permit cannot be granted to this ""Greed is Good"" group.
2. Ontarions need better protections for food and water security. No studies anticipate the availabilty or needs for water 10 years into the future at these sites.  Both are in rural, agricultural areas. There are many competing uses for water at each site and water bottling is the lowest of priorities.  The water leaves the watershed never to return.  It is a bad precedent and practice.
3. Another unknown is the long term effect of the presence of microplastics in plastic water bottles, our drinking water, and our bodies and the bodies of living creatures.  Research indicates that all of us have plastics in our bodies. No one knows the critical amounts for health issues.
The term in the application is far too long, it is a low water use priority, the company has no experience or track record, no stated environmental standards, no loyalty to the employees or consumers, and continue to use virgin plastic with its terrible environmental impact.  This permit ought not be granted as there a too many uncertainties with the new owner, and the length of the term.

I know water taking can be a bit of a hot topic, but I am confident that they have done proper research and the science is what I like to turn to.  As a Puslinch resident, I have seen first hand the work that Nestle does in our community.  Countless donations to the community do not go un noticed.  When I lived near their water plant they were very good with informing local residents about if they had any well problems or water problems, they had a team on call to rectify any problems, (and we never had any problems with our water or well).  Nestle has always been committed to the environment, as much as possible.  Since taking over from Aberfoyle Springs, they have streamlined the manufacturing process, eliminated a large percentage of packaging from day to day operations, and are good environmental stewards to the land around that they use.  I truly hope that the Government will see that Nestle has worked hard and continues to work hard to serve the community that they are in.

2. As the effects from climate change worsen including more frequent and longer droughts, ground water taking should be curtailed to minimize harm to our freshwater ecosystems.

They were the first in line when it came to donating to the local school playground, the soccer club and so many other local initiatives.  You could always count on them for support.  As you are aware, we have many water takers in Puslinch.  Compared to the water taking in other permits, Blue Triton could be seen as modest.  However, the data and science, led by Dr. Andreanne Simard, which was always shared with local governments and the public, was outstanding and always peer reviewed.  The government's own findings supported that the water taking by water bottlers in the province has no impact on the quantity or quality of water in the province.  I would also support that the permits expiry period be for 10 years.  This would put Blue Triton on a level playing field with other local water takers and help ensure that this outstanding corporate citizen continues to be a vital part of the community, providing employment, enhancing the corporate tax base, and continues provide healthy beverage choices.

Second, water is taken without the consent of First Nations and despite a cease-and-desist order issued two years ago (June 7, 2019) by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Council, the traditional leadership of Six Nations on the Grand, Nestlé/BlueTriton continue to ignore Indigenous sovereignty.
The bottling plant in Aberfoyle will continue to package water in single use plastic bottles -- millions of them every day – half of which result in litter or end up in a landfill. Single use plastic has a heavy carbon footprint in its life-cycle from production to distribution, and breaks down into microplastics, a growing threat to wildlife and human health.
In addition, Triton Waters entry into Ontario is part of a global trend of investors betting that the increasing scarcity of water (projected to worsen as climate crisis deepens) will make them rich.

Who is going to mandate that they stop drawing water when they all get to to vote? Who is monitoring their assessment of water levels. When cigarette companies were in charge of monitoring the impact of their products, could they be trusted? Asking private citizens to water their lawns less is obviously not going to deal with this. We the citizens and water users have to be protected from these self-interested companies.
Protect our water sources from these industrial groups. These are our water rights, they should not be sold off and controlled by companies like Blue Triton. They are a public good, they belong to the people.
Now is the time for our governments to show that they can see the dangers in the future and protect this vital asset.

As caretakers of some of the biggest reserves of fresh water in the world, it falls to us to behave thoughtfully with this task. There are two primary issues:
1. Sustainability. Water being removed from a watershed or ground water reserves should not exceed the natural cycle that replenishes it. If the levels of ground water fall, then there should be a moratorium on removing any for packaging and shipping out until it recovers.
2. Carbon pollution. Packaging water in small plastic disposable containers for sale, and then transporting it elsewhere for consumption is extremely inefficient, and uses a lot of energy. If water is needed elsewhere - for humanitarian reasons - and we can spare it (see point #1 above), then it should be shipped in bulk, and provided in re-usable containers.

Commercial bottled water is unnecessary, irresponsible, and wasteful. Groundwater resources are finite and vulnerable. Droughts, climate change, and over-extraction continue to impact our limited water sources.

Since 2016, there has been a 25% decline in water taken from the Puslinch well under permit 1381-95ATPY. It is time to phase out bottled water permits in Ontario and it should start with a five-year phaseout of the permit for Triton’s Puslinch well.

Water should be a resource of the commons, not bottled and sold, generating tons of plastic waste, so that a company can profit off of it.
Additionally, the Aberfoyle well is in the territory of the Haudenosaunee, who, two years ago, delivered a cease and desist order to Nestle, at that same well. In order to have reconciliation, we need to honour the wishes of those whose territory we are on and that involves not pumping water for profit from their lands.
The City staff of Guelph also did a study and found that, if the Aberfoyle well is continued to be pumped that it could endanger Guelph's city water supply within the next decade given the strains of a larger population and increased drought conditions.
Permits to draw water for the purposes of selling the water for profit should not be allowed in this province. Water is a right and it is something that we must protect and not commodify. We should be known by our descendants as those that cared for something as essential as water, instead of allowing it to be bottled for profit and sold by a corporation.

The public is very aware of the struggle against Nestlé's water take, not only in Canada but also in several other countries, and it seems that BlueTriton believes that we won't notice the name change from Nestlé to BlueTriton.
The Haudenosaunee Confederacy Council issued a cease-and-desist order two years ago to stop Nestlé from taking water. By requesting the permit and making plans to continue the water take, BlueTriton is ignoring Indigenous sovereignty, just as Nestlé has done. This is disrespectful of the First Nations sovereignty, and the taking of water from their land is a violation of their order.
Many First Nations communities across Canada are on boiled water advisories because their drinking water is unsafe. Auditor General Karen Hogan found a year ago that 60 advisories were in effect in 41 First Nations communities and that some communities wouldn't be able to get clean water out of their taps for many years. She told a press conference in Ottawa: ""I am very concerned and honestly disheartened that this longstanding issue is still not resolved. Access to safe drinking water is a basic human necessity. I don't believe anyone would say that this is in any way an acceptable situation in Canada in 2021.""
While this disgraceful situation continues, as it has done for decades, BlueTriton should not be permitted to take clean water from Indigenous lands and bottle it for profit. It is nothing short of insulting to take clean water from First Nations land, bottle it, and sell it to people in urban areas who already have clean tap water while First Nations remain on water advisories.

56256,/comment/56256,"I do not support lifting the moratorium on taking water for bottled water by corporations and am disppointed that this issue did not get more coverage in the media.  Water is a scarce source and ever more so now with increasing periods of drought.  The water supply needs to be managed and maintained for area residients first and foremost. I understand there is new legislation but there is a debate that it is not rigorous enough to protect our water supply.
Secondly, this application should not be treated as a renewal of a permit to take water but rather a new application given the new ownership. Also Nestles permit was issued decades ago and is problematic. At a minimum, Triton must comply with the new regulations.
It is my impression, Nestles basically sold these assets to a private equity firm due to the push back from the community on a number of issues and the backlash against profitting from bottled water.  I did note the timing of lifting the moratorium on April 1st aligned with Nestles finalizing the sale to the private equity firms which lead to the formation of Triton.

For the government to be complicit in the absolute THEFT of First Nations water is an even GREATER CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY, an ABSOLUTE travesty!
In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirmed the right of everyone to adequate food. However, access to adequate food in the rural areas of many developing countries depends heavily on access to natural resources, including water, that are necessary to produce food. The UN General Assembly declared access to clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right on 28 July 2010. But the right to water in the context of the right to food is a complex question. While drinking and cooking water would be protected, water for food production would probably not be covered under the minimum needs in arid areas.
A case in point to water being a necessity of life; the Bolivian Water War; whereby an international consortium “Aguas del Tunari” bought licenses to control the water of Cochabamba.

In theory, the provinces have owned the water since 1930, when the federal government delegated ownership with the Natural Resources Transfer Act. According to that act, the provinces have the right to sell their water to whomever they want, including companies like Triton, or their predecessor, Nestlé.
On the other hand, water could also be considered to be regulated by the federal government, which is responsible for the natural environment and Canada’s waterways. In addition, according to the Canadian constitution, the federal government has a “duty to accommodate and consult” First Nations and to make sure other parties do the same when extracting any natural resource, including water, from indigenous land.
This legal ambiguity has allowed certain companies to move in and extract precious water for next to nothing. Meantime, local First Nations and their neighbours suffer with substandard water supplies, which competing water extraction industries can only make worse.

When do the federal and provincial governments of this country begin to take responsibility for historic, recent, and current policies that have cause irreparable harm, both to the environment, and to the indigenous people who are an integral part of this nation??
Like millions of Canadian Citizens who are increasingly voicing their opinions, I see this 'industry' for what it really is. A low risk, high profit investment vehicle for a tiny minority of the population, who privately lobby our parliamentary representatives with disingenuous claims and assurances. The plain and extensively documented facts are clear - that this 'industry' has created a mountain of plastic waste, that has polluted our oceans and urban centres, poisoned millions of animals, and entered the food chain so that our children are now born with microplastic waste in their bodies. It has also added to the long and sordid history of the abuse of indigenous people, at the hands of successive governments, by taking billions of litres of potable water from their treaty lands, while they remain in many cases without a supply of drinking water in their communities.
This is an abusive industry, that has made no reparation for the devastation it continues to contribute to, and which encourages some Canadians to purchase its products in ignorance of the consequences. It should be incumbent on the Environmental Registry of Ontario to educate all citizens about environmental pollution, and require them to take responsibility for their choices.
Time is growing very short, to reverse the damage already caused by these types of investment schemes, that use our natural resources for short term profit, and disregard the consequences.

We DO NOT WANT 'economic growth' that destroys watersheds, pollutes our air, water and food sources, and continues to burn or sell fossil fuels in a blind, ignorant, profit-driven rush to provide investment opportunities for private lobbyists.

We have territories that don't receive clean free water from the tap. Are you working for all the Canadians or only for a bunch of greedy vultures?
Besides, do you have any idea of how many plastic bottles end up in parks and rivers? Probably if you went for clean ups in your neighbourhood or on the lakeshore you would know.
Bottled water should be the last resource for someone in need and not the wonderland for multinationals.
Government has been called to reduce plastic pollution, and an awareness raising campaign should be done to revert the image to consumers. plastic bottle water creates more damage than value, in all ways.

As it appears conditions and requirements surrounding this permit have not changed from when it was granted to Nestle, all previous concerns related to short and long term sustainability,  impact of resource extraction, and negative environmental impact remain valid and this permit renewal should be denied.
As if the above were not sufficient, proceeding with this permit renewal also disregards a Haudenoshaunee cease and desist order. A heavy handed approach by all government levels has had, and continues to have, disturbingly negative impacts on First Nations, Metis and Inuit peoples. At this critical time in our country's and province's relationship with Indigenous peoples and when a number of Indigenous communities do not have potable drinking water, something that the rest of us take for granted, it is unbelievable that the Haudenoshaunee would be dismissed in this way.
Lastly, BlueTriton's website speaks of sustainability with respect to resources and production. While that may make shareholders feel better, there is nothing 'sustainable' about manufacturing thousands or millions of bottles of water and transporting them. There seems to be a lack of understanding regarding the most recent science, planetary boundaries and issue of carbon that we all must now tackle.

56868,/comment/56868,"Everyone knows in their heads and hearts that the privatization of water is wrong. That it is one of the most dangerous outcomes that can come from continuing to allow corporations to bottle and sell water around the world.
What is even more frustrating and frightening is that the corporations and now private equity companies taking and profiting from all our Canadian water resources are foreign owned.
It takes courage to stand up and say NO when harm is being done. However, we have seen many leaders in the past do the right thing.  Leaders in Nova Scotia had the courage to close down a Pulp industry that was destroying their lands and water.  Leaders in the USA said no to an oil pipeline crossing their country because they knew that there were more sustainable energy sources in our future. Leaders in Bolivia said no to multiple exploitative corporations on behalf of their citizens.  None of these territories fell into ruin. No they were empowered and are leaders looked up to. The corporations suffered only a little financial loss and that was mainly felt in the size of their CEOs bonuses.
It is time for our Canadian leaders to use our tax dollars to say NO to bottled water and water taking for profit by Canadian and foreign owned corporations and and equity companies through
1) immediately developing and implementing tough policies and regulations to
a) protect our natural resources for the whole and future Canadian generations
b) enable the sovereignty of local communities trying to protect their natural resources, especially those first nations communities.
2)  enforcement of these policies and regulations with immediate termination of any licensing that is in place with no possibility of renewal.
3) ensuring that the entire population of our country has access to safe drinking water from their taps
4)  installation of water fountains in all the public places (downtown squares, museums, parks, schools, recreation centres, art galleries, etc) and ensure these fountains all have spouts that allow for reusable water bottles to be filled.
5) education with the public of their access to potable water from their taps, fountains etc.  This is especially important for our new Canadians - many of whom come from countries that did not have potable water. Make it drinking tap water the thing to do! It's all marketing.
How did we get here?
Generations before had gone through wars and needed to work together to survive. As economies recovered, they were able to make money, and common sense decisions that were for the good of the whole.  They saw the benefits of universal health care, social nets for those struggling.
As the population grew, so did the ability to be able to ignore those lesser advantaged, and the nature that sustains all of us. Now there is a greater lack of personal relationships; accountability to neighbours, and future generations.  It is enhanced by the narrow focus on capitalism with no long term or, greater care for the full impact of these decisions.
Bottling water is one of the greatest crimes to humanity that is only able to happen because, of antiquated government policies that have allowed a loop hole to be exploited.  Think of the history of the water letting policy. It was to allow movement of water for agricultural use (feeding people and animals). It is now used to create one of the greatest wastes of all time all in the name of convenience. Waste that drains local taxes in it's recovery and disposal. Waste that has lost it's value as a recyclable commodity, and instead is unnecessarily filling landfill sites.
This was not a surprise for many of us. We watched as public water fountains were removed from educational institutions, parks, and public sports and art venues. They were replaced by vending machines who promised a share of the profit to these public organizations and the vendors in the vicinity of public places. There was then some push back to all the sugary snacks and drinks in these vending machines.  Bottled water is touted as a great alternative to the sugary drinks.
Combined with intense marketing of the convenience and ""better quality"" of bottled water, people are now paying more for water in a bottle, than they do for gasoline for their car. And then when their thirst is quenched, they throw away the bulk of that water in a capped plastic bottle. That precious water is trapped in a polluting capsule of plastic for how long? Plastic that is leading to mountains of unwanted waste.
One Rock Capital Partners LLC and Metropoulos & Co. on Wednesday announced the completion of the $4.3 billion deal to buy Nestle Waters North America. The acquisition was announced Feb. 16. It came about eight months after Swiss food and beverage giant Nestle S.A. said it would conduct a strategic review of its North American waters division, as it sought to sharpen the focus of its global water portfolio. 31 March 2021

56869,/comment/56869,"I cannot imagine any reason why Ontario should be selling groundwater for bottling (and exporting) purposes. And selling our groundwater for less than its real value to us is insulting and reckless. Pricing water to reflect it's real value, including managing the risks of depleting it in some areas and depriving local communities access to it, would raise the cost considerable and maybe slow consumer demand for an unnecessary product. Our appetite for bottled water is based on marketing and falsely low pricing. We do not need bottled water in most of this province. Our indigenous communities do need safe drinking water - in quantity - from their taps.

57164,/comment/57164,"I fail to understand why the Ministry is treating this request as a renewal of an existing permit. Nestle Waters North America has sold its spring water holdings to an equity company that has created a totally new entity named Triton Waters Canada Inc. This company has no previous experience in the business of bottled water. Surely, if the permit system (PTTW) to extract groundwater is to have any appearance of legitimacy the new company should be treated as such and be made to apply for a completely new permit and assessed accordingly.
When Nestle Waters Canada had the PTTW for the Puslinch well the permit duration was 5 years.
Yet, Triton Waters Canada is seeking a permit duration of 10 years. This is an outrageous request considering the lack of experience and knowledge this equity company has concerning the extraction of groundwater within Ontario. It is an even more outrageous action on the part of this company when you consider that it is unlikely this company will still own this company in 10 years. One only has to examine the history of this company to see that it generally ""flips"" its holdings within a span of 3 to 7 years.
The Puslinch permit to take water should be denied because in 2020 Nestle Waters Canada extracted only 44% of the water permitted under its permit to take water (PTTW).
I also oppose this permit for the same reasons I opposed bottling by Nestlé Waters Canada. First, water is a public good and should be held in public stewardship, not be for sale as a commodity. Second, water is taken without the consent of First Nations and despite a cease-and-desist order issued two years ago (June 7, 2019) by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Council, the traditional leadership of Six Nations on the Grand, Nestlé/BlueTriton continue to ignore Indigenous sovereignty.
The bottling plant in Aberfoyle will continue to package water in single use plastic bottles -- millions of them every day – half of which result in litter or end up in a landfill. Single use plastic has a heavy carbon footprint in its life-cycle from production to distribution, and breaks down into microplastics, a growing threat to wildlife and human health.
It is more important that the water remain in the ground, to support all forms of life in the local ecosystem and to be conserved for future generations.
The climate crisis is making groundwater supplies less certain. Experts say groundwater is effectively a non-renewable resource, when measured on a human timescale, and should be considered a “finite” resource because of its slow recharge rates. In southern Ontario, the rate of recharge is highly variable and ranges from 10 years to upward of 10,000 years, depending on the source of the aquifer Only six percent of groundwater is replenished within a fifty-year span.

57560,/comment/57560,"This is Nestle with different branding. It would hardly be a surprise if the same group of wealthy shareholder and their corporate lawyers were behind this permit application as well.
Dozens of First Nations communities across Canada have not had access to safe drinking water for at least a year, and yet BlueTriton wants to pump clean water from Indigenous lands and bottle it for profit?
Even if this weren't the case, and indigenous communities had reliable access to clean drinking water, it is still short sighted to provide this permit. Bottled water companies create massive amounts of waste particularly in the form of various kinds of plastics, be they in landfill from ineffectual recycling programs or microplastics that have invaded every aspect of our environment. Bottled water companies also consume an unacceptable amount of energy during production, and produce an unnecessary amount of greenhouse gasses in every step including transportation and distribution.
In 2002, the United Nations officially adopted water as a human right. General Comment 15, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states the following: “The human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.” This means that the 145 countries who have endorsed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have to ensure fair and equal access to safe drinking water.
The government is obliged to ensure that people can enjoy their basic human rights. Part of the government’s duty is to protect this right, by preventing third party interference. For drinking water, this may involve the establishment of legislation that prohibits manufacturing companies from privatizing the supply. Even developed countries have not had good results when a company privatizes the water. In the 1980s, the British water system was privatized. In the first five years, 18,636 households had their water supply cut off because they could not afford the price of water, which had increased by more than 50 percent.
In short, I request that you not only deny this permit but create legislation that would severely limit if not entirely eliminate the number of permits granted to bottled water companies from now on.

Water is Sacred.

Due to public pressure and abuse of permits, they sold their bottled water service to Blue Triton. By virtue of the fact that now Blue Triton are going to disadvantaged communities in Ontario as Nestlé had been doing to get their water, that seems like Blue Triton intend on following the same concepts as Nestlé.
There are countless examples in the news, studies, and literature demonstrating that the world is running out of freshwater. [The term freshwater includes both surface water and groundwater].  Groundwater tables are declining, sinkholes are occurring, ponds and even lakes are drying up, the ground elevation is subsiding, the flow of rivers and streams are becoming less, wetlands (the surface storage of freshwater) are drying up or being filled in, droughts are increasing in part because there is less surface water exposed to evaporation and transpiration from vegetation to make rain, rivers and streams are being dyked and flows are being streamlined to get rid of precipitation quickly instead of slowing surface drainage to increase the recharge of groundwater, etc.  Our use and protection of freshwater must change. This can occur jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction by enacting laws and regulations to protect our water resources and by charging realistic fees for their consumption to encourage conservation of water.  Landowners must realize that they do not own the water on and under their land since the value that water has benefit to a much greater area.  However, they are nonetheless stewards of that water.
Every ""Large Freshwater Consumer) must have a current permit.  Prior to awarding any permit to a Large Freshwater Consumer, Ontario must conduct a watershed study by qualified independent authorities to determine the sustainable seasonal limits of water use for not only the proposed permit but also for other smaller uses such as individual freshwater wells and village water systems, projected impact of climate change, etc. Then, the quantity of water, both surface water and groundwater, must be monitored by measuring stream flows, groundwater table elevations, CABIN (Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network), etc, by independent qualified personnel for the watershed to ensure that water consumption is not exceeding sustainable use and negatively impacting water quality in the watershed.  Use of fresh water by a Large Freshwater Consumer, without a current permit must result in barring the use of the freshwater.  (However, note that Ontario has not been enforcing the need of current permits in the past.)  The permit and permit renewal must include a standard ""environmental clause"".
The term Large Freshwater Consumer is to be defined as those who exceed a threshold quantity of fresh water measured by month and by year. There must be one common total freshwater quantity threshold applicable to all users. The clause must apply to any agency, business, farm, municipality, individual, etc, that consumes or processes freshwater from the environment exceeding either of the defined threshold. The standard environmental clause must be adhered to regardless how they use the water (e.g, process water, irrigation, potable water production, street washing, bottling, fracking, thermal, etc).  records of water taken and how used must be required of them, be made publicly available,and be subject to audit by an independent, qualified agency awarded a Standing Offer Agreement by public tender.
The Environmental Clause in a permit should require the following.  The following data must be made available publicly, and subject to independent third-party audit.
1) Water consumption/use is to be measured by certified meters.
2) Records are required of water taken and how used.
3) Specific and time-based goals are to be set by the users for improved quality and quantity of freshwater.
4) Stewardship for freshwater conservation is to be promoted and financially supported from the permit fees by Ontario (e.g, naturalization of stream flows, shading of water bodies to reduce water temperature, promotion of freshwater plant and animal life (benthic, aquatic, etc), water reuse (e.g, grey water, reverse osmosis of brackish water), etc.
5) Regulations must be put in place that allow a jurisdiction to limit and enforce freshwater usage with fines and stoppages of service, despite permits, treaties, and allowed practices, if records indicate that freshwater usage in a watershed is exceeding permitted quantities, or if water consumption in a watershed is not sustainable, e.g, during a drought or new information on determining the available freshwater in a watershed.

•	The GRCA encourages and supports the continued use of numerical models developed for the Source Protection Program for Permit to Take Water applications.
•	At a minimum, Triton Water Canada Holdings Inc. (Triton Water Canada) should reduce pumping during declared droughts based on the average weekly rate rather than a monthly rate.  There will be a greater reduction in actual water use if Triton Water Canada reduces pumping based on average water taking rates rather than permitted maximum rates that are barely reached during non-drought periods.
•	As monitoring data are reviewed by the province, the MECP should ensure that discharges to watercourses that support cold water species are not affected by this water taking and that the hydrologic function of nearby provincially significant wetlands is maintained.
•	There are a large number of permitted and private domestic water takings in the vicinity of the permitted taking.  The GRCA encourages the MECP to consider the cumulative impacts of all water takings in the local subwatershed when reviewing this permit application.

Source Water Protection
The water taking on the subject property at 101 Brock Rd South, Puslinch, Ontario is located within a Wellhead Protection Area Q (WHPA-Q) designated with a significant risk level for protecting the sources of municipal drinking water.
The completed Tier 3 Water Budget and Risk Assessment study (Tier 3 Study) for the Guelph/Guelph-Eramosa area, undertaken as part of the required work under the Clean Water Act, 2006, identifies consumptive water takings, which includes water taking from Well TW3-80, as significant drinking water threats.
Significant drinking water threats mandate the development of water quantity policies to be included in the Grand River Source Protection Plan. Water quantity policy development addressing consumptive water takings and recharge reduction activities is currently in process.
The results of this Tier 3 Study have been accepted by the Lake Erie Region Source Protection Committee and the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks.  However, with policy development still in process, the Tier 3 Study results and policies have not yet been included in the Grand River Source Protection Plan and are not in legal effect.
In addition to the Tier 3 Study, a Risk Management Measures Evaluation Process (RMMEP) has been completed. The RMMEP identifies and updates significant threats, and ranks them to determine those that impact the municipal water supplies the greatest. The results of the RMMEP reveal that the majority of the highest ranked threats were City of Guelph municipal wells that impact themselves given increased future water demand and the relative close proximity to each other. The water taking from Triton Water well TW3-80 was ranked 20th within the RMMEP with a 1% impact on the closest municipal well (Burke Well). The complete Tier 3 Study and RMMEP reports are publicly available at http://www.sourcewater.ca/GGET-Tier3.
In response to the Interim Guidance Document released by the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks in 2017 outlining requirements for the renewal of Permits to Take Water for water bottling purposes, Nestle Waters Canada (now Triton Water Canada ) arranged for the numerical groundwater flow model developed for the Guelph-Guelph/Eramosa Tier 3 Study (Tier 3 Model) to be updated in the areas of the Aberfoyle and Erin operations and applied the model to assess the potential for cumulative effects, under both current conditions and various climate change and drought scenarios.
To apply the Tier 3 Model to the TW3-80 Permit to Take Water renewal, consultants from Nestle Waters Canada and the City of Guelph collaborated; this included sharing data between parties and consultations during data analysis, model refinement, and calibration, and leveraging the experience and local knowledge of these consultants gained through multiple years of data collection and analysis. The modelling report is included as a supporting document for the application to renew the Permit to Take Water for TW3-80.
Where numerical models developed through the Source Protection Program can be reasonably modified or updated such that they meet the technical expectations and requirements, the GRCA continues to encourage and support the use of these models for assessing Permit to Take Water applications.
Low Water
The Mill Creek watershed is affected by drought periodically.  Because the watercourses in this watershed are dependent on groundwater for baseflow, it is important that all water takings, including deep groundwater takings, reduce pumping rates during drought periods.  Triton Waters is encouraged to continue the commitment to drought management shown by Nestle Waters by continuing their participation on the Grand River Low Water Response Team.
 
The permit renewal application states that Triton Water Canada will commit to voluntarily reducing monthly maximum permitted water use during times of declared low water conditions by 10, 20 and 30 percent, respectively.  Based on past water pumping information provided in the application, these reduction targets on a monthly basis will not result in an actual reduction in water use during a drought period.  At a minimum, Triton Water Canada should reduce pumping during declared droughts based on the average weekly rate rather than a monthly maximum rate.  There will be a greater reduction in actual water use if Triton Water Canada reduces pumping based on average water taking rates rather than permitted maximum rates that they barely reach during non-drought periods.
Natural Heritage
The water taking is located adjacent to the Provincially Significant Mill Creek Wetland Complex, which has both recharge and discharge areas.  Changes to water levels can greatly affect the hydrologic function of the wetland complex. GRCA recommends that Triton Water Canada review the monitoring data collected over the period of the current permit and take any necessary action to ensure the hydrologic function of the wetland is not impacted.
Watercourses in the Mill Creek watershed support cold water fisheries, including Mill Creek which supports a self-sustaining population of brook trout and brown trout.  Both species are sensitive to and reliant on groundwater discharge with brook trout heavily keying in on discharge areas for their spawning activities. As monitoring data are reviewed by the province, the MECP should ensure that discharges to watercourses that support cold water species are not affected by this water taking.
Cumulative Impacts
The GRCA encourages the MECP to consider the cumulative impacts of all water takings in local subwatershed when reviewing this permit application.  There are a large number of permitted and private domestic water takings in the vicinity of TW3-80.  It is important to consider all of the groundwater takings in this area when reviewing any individual permit application.
Monitoring Program
The proposed changes to the monitoring program would benefit from additional supporting information made readily available. This could include the original intent of the monitoring locations that are proposed to be removed, well logs, and hydrographs such that the proposed changes can be fully reviewed.

However, we have allowed multinational corporations (first Nestle, now BlueTriton) to profit from that resource in exchange for pennies. To make matters worse, many First Nations still don't have clean drinking water, and yet we are selling it!  As it stands, BlueTriton's permit should be denied. Water is a resource that first and foremost should be for Canadian citizens, not a corporation.

First, water is a public good and should be held in public stewardship, not be for sale as a commodity. Second, water is taken without the consent of First Nations and despite a cease-and-desist order issued two years ago (June 7, 2019) by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Council, the traditional leadership of Six Nations on the Grand, Nestlé/BlueTriton continue to ignore Indigenous sovereignty.
The bottling plant in Aberfoyle packages water in single use plastic bottles -- millions of them every day – half of which result in litter or end up in a landfill. Single use plastic has a heavy carbon footprint in its life-cycle from production to distribution, and breaks down into microplastics, a growing threat to wildlife and human health.
In addition, Triton Waters entry into Ontario is part of a global trend of investors betting that the increasing scarcity of water (projected to worsen as climate crisis deepens) will make them rich.

57795,/comment/57795,"The Morwick G360 Institute at the University of Guelph would like to provide a letter in support of Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. (formerly Nestlé Waters Canada) permits to take water.
The Morwick G360 Institute is a part of the University of Guelph that specializes in groundwater research. We have been actively pursuing research in the Guelph area and surrounding townships since 2003 with a focus on understanding flow systems and the properties of the aquifers and aquitards in the area. These studies and collaborating with different private and public parties interested in groundwater resources have allowed us to stay up-to-date on many activities in the area. We feel that decisions surrounding water management should be data-driven and the collection of high quality groundwater data is fundamental in this process.  With regard to the two specific permits of Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. we feel that:
- Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. has taken voluntary efforts to monitor the subsurface in a high resolution depth-discrete manner, beyond standard practice,  to examine system responses both underground and at the earth’s surface;
- Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. has demonstrated transparency in sharing data through the public dissemination of annual reports;
- Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. has established an effective  multi-faceted groundwater monitoring program that includes the local ecosystem and surface water.
- Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. has attempted to minimize cross-connection between hydrogeologic units by employing relatively short screen pumping intervals;
- The regulations around permits to take water should be based on scientific understanding and should be applied universally and consistently across all permitted parties;
- The permits to take water are based on the previous permits, effective monitoring data supporting no adverse impacts and do not suggest an increase in water takings.
Given the above, we believe that Triton Water Canada Holdings, Inc. has demonstrated a better than average commitment to the sustainable use of groundwater resources in Guelph and surrounding areas.
Sincerely,
Professor Beth Parker, PhD, FCAE, BCEEM, LEL
