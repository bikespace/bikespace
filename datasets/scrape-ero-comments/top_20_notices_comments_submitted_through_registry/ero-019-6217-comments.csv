62196,/comment/62196,"The present Government was elected based on the promise that will not change any of the Greenbelt designation.
Housing crisis will not be solved by allowing new sprawling mansions in the existing Greenbelt.
There is an acute need of entry level homes and condos, not multi acre mansions.
There will be no affordable homes developed in the existing Greenbelt lands, as these locations will not be service by public transportation.
There is enough space, decrepit neighbourhoods, etc, in existing cities boundaries which could be developed for entry level homes. All these could be accessible by public transportation, and will fully justify public money invested in redevelopment of these areas, as well in the public transportation.
This new proposal is the culmination reward for all big pockets developers which have supported Doug Ford , with the clear mandate to allow development in the existing Greenbelt.
Adding new land to the Greenbelt will not change these facts.
Any change to the Greenbelt should be done either by Referendum or by a policy platform during new elections.

62214,/comment/62214,"The Greenbelt is in place for a reason and protects critically important agricultural land, sensitive ecosystems and species at risk and consists of unique and important ecological features that provide ecosystem services for the GTHA and beyond. The ""realignment"" means the destruction of many of these features and unknown future costs in the absence of these ecosystem features. A few key points:
1) Ontarian's did NOT vote for this in the last election and have been extremely clear that they do not support the destruction or removal of greenbelt land for development or otherwise. This means Ontarian's do not support the bogus attempt to placate them with a false ""offset"" program. Going against what Ontarian's have voiced begs the question - do we really live in a democracy and who is the Ford government really working for?
2) Destroying sensitive ecological/agricultural land to support housing development is spitting on future generations and is incredibly poor planning. Densify areas with infrastructure to support current residents and newcomers. Using incredibly valuable land requiring expensive infrastructure for a small number of single detached homes that require dependency on vehicles will amount to benefits to developers and the wealthy while pushing costs (environmental and otherwise) onto the vulnerable.
3) I suspect this policy will go forward regardless of the outcry because the current conservative government does not listen to the residents of Ontario (the majority of Ontarian's voted for progressive policies including NOT building highway 413 in the last election). When this goes through, an accounting of profits should be made public so Ontarian's can see who is profiting off of Ontario's loss of green space.
I and many around me are absolutely outraged at this conservative government once again going against what the majority of Ontarian's have voiced. Do not touch the greenbelt. Do not open up greenbelt lands for development. Do not develop ridiculous ""offset programs"". Leave the greenbelt alone.

62243,/comment/62243,"Opening up the green belt is a stupid idea. There is no infrastructure to support any new housing projects. Why not just build the new houses in downtown cores or close to them and have transit reach them. And it will make no difference if the houses/condos all cost around 1-2 mil and they have been like that for the last couple of years due to greed. That land is essential to keeping business in check notation by farming and growing crops and not having to import them. I would also say that the land that would be exchanged should be included in the green belt no matter what. I get that houses have to be built but why not build them on land that has already been developed as it will cost less. Why not follow leed principles. Doug ford made a promise to never touch the green belt and I expect him to keep it.

Full disclosure: I am not now, never have been, have no plans to become a member of any political party, nor run for political office of any kind. I am also not a member of any environmental group, although I do receive emails from some groups.
On November 4, 2022, Housing Minister Steve Clark of Doug Ford’s Ontario Conservative Party government announced changes to Ontario’s Protected Greenbelt. This would add 9,400 acres of new protected lands, but removing 7,400 acres of currently protected lands.
This is in contrast to their position before the last provincial election and statements made by Mr. Clark, last year, where he claimed that no land would be developed. There were no plans to remove or trade any lands.
“I want to be clear. We will not in any way entertain any proposals that will move lands in the Greenbelt, or open the Greenbelt lands to any kind of development.”
CTV News article, November 4, 2022, Minister Steve Clark quoted from an earlier story.
While his words sound apologetic and surprised, he didn’t really seem bothered by being called out for going back on his word.
But here we are today. Now, it turns out that he has not told the truth, or has gone back on his promise, and that lands currently protected are at risk.
While I applaud the addition of 9,400 acres being added to the Greenbelt, I just wonder how long those lands with be protected. Before Mr. Ford’s first election to premier in 2018, he promised the same thing: no development of the Greenbelt, however he was caught telling developers that they would be opening up land for development.

Where does it end?
I believe that, given Premier Ford’s penchant for development and his love for land developers and what I personally believe is his disdain for environmental protection, he would not be satisfied until every inch of arable land from Fort Erie to London and Kitchener, east to Kingston and north to Barrie is completely paved over, and end up with a Greenbelt up around Kakabeka Falls or Fraserdale. The whole idea of the Greenbelt was to locally produce food and allow green spaces for all to enjoy.
You can understand my concerns with the truthfulness of this government, and its commitment to the environment and Greenbelt protection. I honestly believe that this current government cannot be trusted with making sensible and environmentally friendly decisions. I strongly believe that no land in the Greenbelt is safe from development under this current government. Where will it end?
I urge the government to add the proposed 94,000 acres and reject the removal of the 7,400 acres. Find areas that are not environmentally sensitive to build homes and encourage businesses and industry to build in those areas, instead of stressing the already highly urbanised areas.

It's not about housing, it's about making money for developers clamoring even while their coffers are bulging. There's housing available now, but only a small percentage of people can afford it. There's space in golf courses, but Ford's buddies won't allow that to be used. You want to solve the housing crisis? Make housing more accessible, legislate against owning multiple properties, legislate against corporations buying up houses as part of their portfolio. And that's not even going into the harmful environmental effects. Look at what has been happening with weather patterns in the past few years. Ontario has been largely unaffected because we have natural defenses. The Greenbelt is part of that. There's a reason it's been protected all these years, and it's NOT because we think it's pretty! You'd think someone who likes to go to the cottage as much as Ford would understand that nature is worth preserving. It's revolting that people who only think about their wallets are steamrolling over all of us. This needs to STOP.

No, not everyone wants a 'house with a little white picket fence'.  Sensible development would include multi family dwellings and low rise apartment buildings, on areas near the cities with infrastructure that is either expandable or already in place.
It would include replacing low income housing with a certain proportion rent geared to income units in every new condo development, and rent control on all new rental units.
This is a blatant land grab and giveaway to the construction and realty industries that will be extremely detrimental to the province's air and water quality. It will also seriously impact our local food supply.

62544,/comment/62544,"This is a short sighted and selfish proposal. The Greenbelt was originally set aside and protected as it is extremely ecologically sensitive and important land. Removing these essential sections of it would destroy much of its ecological value for short term gain. Even if new areas are added this will not fix the huge amount of environmental harm done by destroying these heritage sites. It would additionally push already threatened species such as coyotes into suburban or urban areas, negatively affecting people living there, their pets, and the species themselves.
The housing crisis should be addressed with increased density in areas which already contain the infrastructure necessary to support this number of people. The Greenbelt should NOT be sacrificed for a few thousand homes and money in developers pockets when we already have physical space and infrastructure for these people elsewhere.
The Ontario government knows how valuable the Greenbelt is and it is disgusting that they are willing to destroy such important land for what is, at best, a futile attempt to fix a problem that could be addressed in other ways, and at worst, a corrupt attempt to put money in the pockets of their friends.

62578,/comment/62578,"While I agree that protecting the Galt Paris Moraine area is wise in terms of protecting the ground water source, there is an issue of fairness. Property rights that owners of those properties enjoy today will no longer be available to them once the boundaries are changed. This is a ""good"" that will be enjoyed by the broader population of the Province at the expense of those current landowners. What is the expense? Currently some of them have the right to apply for a severance of their property to create a new parcel of land. For some this may be to allow a child or a loved one to acquire the land needed to construct a new dwelling. It will also prevent the construction of a second or accessory dwelling unit on the property. Again, we are talking about the need for affordable housing, and taking away the opportunity for individuals (not big developers) to provide a range of housing for their families.
I see two potential remedies.
First, compensate the property owners who will be affected. Establish the value of the lost property rights and have the province (or the developers who will benefit from their lands being removed from the Greenbelt) pay compensation.
Second, determine what level of restriction is really necessary to protect the groundwater supplies, if this is the rationale.  Perhaps an individual severance or the construction of a second dwelling on the property would not be judged to have a detrimental effect, and could be allowed, while preventing large scale development.  Large scale developments are not possible in this area at the current time, so losing this is not as important to the individual property owner, but it is more important in terms of protecting the water supply.

First off though the addition of the Paris Galt Moraine to the projected greenbelt should have been done years ago.  This must proceed.
The proposal to remove lands from the greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan Area for housing development is nothing short of a betrayal to the people of Ontario and our natural spaces.
The greenbelt cannot be considered as an inventory of undeveloped land to siphoned off when a developer feels like they can make a buck.
Ontario needs farmland, greenspace and natural areas close it is urban core.   The protection of this area is an excellent policy and model to the world.  A failure to appreciate the greenbelts benefits and economic opportunities illustrates a profound lack of foresight.
Ontario's need for housing does not need to be answered with more urban sprawl.  Higher densities, in-fill projects, and brownfield redevelopment is the answer.  In my GTA community our small downtown is seeing 3 mid-size condo projects under development.  In each case under-utilized buildings have been torn down for the new projects.  The future effect will be more density, a major boost to our downtowns business district, and without the cost of adding new roads, sewer, and other municipal infrastructure.  This is the model we need more of in all communities around the GTA.
Any proposal to remove even a single acre from the greenbelt cannot go forward.  This is a dishonest policy change, a lie to the voters of Ontario, and another blow to our environment.

The promised amendments make these statements nothing short of a lie.
I staunchly oppose any efforts to develop on our pristine and ecologically important protected countrysides and natural heritage ecosystems as designated in the Greenbelt Plan. While the province is facing increased pressure to build more homes, there is no reason to build on top of valuable ecological lands. There is an abundance of undeveloped land outside of areas designated in the Greenbelt Plan that could be built on. Efforts should also be focused on building upwards not outwards – densification as opposed to advancing urban sprawl.
The idea that the negative impacts of removing the Greenbelt lands will be offset by adding lands to the Paris Galt Moraine is a complete fallacy. The environment comprises of interconnected ecosystems to provide essential ecological services to humans and wildlife. It is maintaining the connectively and range of these protected countryside and natural heritage ecosystems that is so vital.  By the same token of adding Greenbelt lands to the Paris Galt Moraine to promote “recharge to the groundwater aquifers that support drinking water supply, local ecosystems, agriculture, and growth management, and more,” the same will be degraded in the 11 areas where which Greenbelt protected lands will be developed upon. The fragmentation of the Greenbelt across its range will result in a severe loss of biodiversity, groundwater recharge services, water decontamination services, erosion control, flood prevention and resiliency, agricultural support, and access to nature that simply cannot be offset by adding Greenbelt lands in a singular area.
In the face of impending environmental threats such as climate change, increased intensity and frequency of storms, heat waves, wildfires, and natural disasters, the ubiquitous spread of contaminants, the hyper-extensive loss of biodiversity and natural environments, can important decision makers in this government really look at themselves in the mirror and say they left the world a better place for their children and grandchildren through proposed amendments such as this one?

Steve said ""I want to be clear: We will not in any way entertain any proposals that will move lands in the Greenbelt, or open the Greenbelt lands to any kind of development.""
This regulatory proposal, as well as its policy proposal (ERO Number 019-6216) does both. It moves lands in the Greenbelt, and opens the land to development. I am not supportive of a government who goes back on their word in such an appalling way.
Existing towns and cities near the Greenbelt are in such a unique position to benefit from the nature that surrounds them. Developing more urban sprawl completely destroys these social and economic advantages. Expanding the Greenbelt (rather than relocating it) and building cities upward instead of outward offers the perfect opportunity to grow a thriving population while reinforcing a big part of what makes Southern Ontario such a wonderful place to live; Our close proximity to nature.
The nature of our Greenbelt sequesters carbon, provides clean drinking water, and attracts tourism. If that wasn't enough, our forests are home to a greater diversity of wildlife than any other region in Canada. With many of humanities most useful scientific discoveries coming from the natural world, the importance of doing our part to protect what little of it remains is becoming no less than absolutely necessary.
I strongly urge the Provincial Government to rethink this proposal. Increasing population density within existing boundaries and improving public transportation would not only achieve the goal of creating more affordable housing. It would create stronger local communities, be an attractive location for those looking to raise a family in Canada and so much more; It would protect the Greenbelt for future generations to enjoy, as I have.

62774,/comment/62774,"This should not be approved. The Greenbelt Plan was enacted to provide the following benefits to everyone living in Southern Ontario:
It contains many of Canada’s most ecologically and hydrologically significant natural environments. These natural areas do the following for us:
- clean the air
- provide drinking water
-provide diverse flora and fauna habitats, including pollinators
- provide opportunities for recreational activities that benefit public health and overall
quality of life.
Additionally, the region has some of Canada's most important and productive farmland.
Its fertile soil, moderate climate and abundant water resources support
agricultural production that cannot be duplicated elsewhere in the province and
the country.
How are we planning to provide clean drinking water, some of Canada’s most productive farmland, clean air to residents of Ontario if we remove parts of the very thing that provides us with these irreplaceable resources?
The amendments being made go against the direct policies set out by the Greenbelt Plan. The Greenbelt Plan specifies that ""Settlement areas outside the Greenbelt are not permitted to expand into the Greenbelt"".
This goes directly against the policy because the proposal is planning to expand a Settlement Area currently outside of the Greenbelt, into the Greenbelt, as shown in the Redesignation Maps in the proposal.
According to Greenbelt Act Subsection 8: Conflicts with Greenbelt Plan:
8 (1) Despite any other Act, the Greenbelt Plan prevails in the case of a conflict between the Greenbelt Plan and,
(a)  an official plan;
(b)  a zoning by-law; or
(c)  a policy statement issued under section 3 of the Planning Act.  2005, c. 1, s. 8 (1).
As a result, although amendments may be proposed if the size of the Greenbelt Land Area is not diminished, the proposal cannot be approved due to direct conflict with the policies outlined in the Greenbelt Act.
Furthermore, the removal of 11 different zones within the Greenbelt cannot be replaced by 1 single addition. This is fundamentally flawed from an ecological perspective and there is no explanation whatsoever that describes how a single addition to the Greenbelt will make up for the removal of 11 zones within the Greenbelt in terms of productivity of the land.
Why have we not looked into utilizing the land that we already have within cities instead of resorting to urban sprawl? Can we please realize that urban sprawl only creates more congestion, air pollution, and removes the green space that we need to live? In Hamilton, for example, there are so many empty parking lots left vacant. We should be looking into developing those areas, not protected green space that provides us with clean water and air.
This proposed amendment is short-sighted and does not take into account a long-term vision of how Ontario should be built. What we should be doing is developing lands that are already within our city boundaries, expanding and investing in public transit, and moving away from urban sprawl. Urban sprawl only amplifies our dependency on highways and cars which are the very things we need to move away from to sustain a healthy population of humans now and into the future.
Please reject this proposal before it is too late. Because eventually, there will be no more Greenbelt left to remove, it will be all gone. And at that point, we will have no clean water or a reliable source of food. No amount of housing can replace those basic necessities of life.

There are lots of commercial properties that could be converted to residential with help from all level of governments. Both in the rezoning, restructuring and building and in the cost to the renter or purchaser to make it affordable.

62845,/comment/62845,"I believe this proposed amendment is not appropriate for the people of Ontario and does not fully adhere to the purpose of the Greenbelt Plan or its supporting documentation.
Within the Greenbelt Plan, under section 5.6, there are clear definitions of where an amendment can be made outside of the 10-year review. This proposal does not address any threats to the overall effectiveness and integrity of the plan, does not improve the plan, and is not extending the Greenbelt's coverage. While it could be argued that this is necessary as a ""major new provincial policy that creates a need"", I do not believe this to be the case. The plan itself acknowledges that housing needs to be addressed beyond the big cities and in rural areas - areas which can be developed outside of the protected lands of the Greenbelt. Further, this plan specifies a need to protect the environment under the ""Heritage and the environment"", ""Natural Hazards"", and ""Protecting heritage while meeting housing needs"" which agree with the purpose that the Greenbelt plan and the proposed ""removal"" areas serve.
Building upon that, the regions that have been selected to be removed by this proposed amendment are ""Protected Countryside"" and ""Natural Heritage Systems""; both of which are vitally important to the surrounding areas. Per the Greenbelt Plan, 1.1 ""Context"" and 1.4.2 Section 3, these regions are agricultural and natural systems which provide food and other environmental support.
 -  The Agricultural System is a group of inter-connected elements. It has two components: the agricultural land base, which is comprised of prime agricultural areas, including specialty crop areas, and rural lands that together create a continuous, productive land base for agriculture, and the agri-food network, which includes infrastructure, services and assets important to the viability of the agri-food sector.
 - The Natural System identifies lands that support both natural heritage and hydrologic features and functions, including providing for pollinator habitat, which is an essential support for agricultural production and for ecosystems.
 - Both systems maintain connections to the broader agricultural and natural systems of southern Ontario.
Using these definitions, the proposed ""addition"" to the Greenbelt plan does not compensate for the damages that would occur by removing the Protected Countryside and Natural Heritage Systems that would be removed if this amendment is approved.

The greenbelt was put in place to protect the environmental and human health of the Greater Toronto Area. The greenbelt provides ecosystem services (clean air, clean water, etc.) worth billions to the people of Ontario and ensures a sustainable future for this region, the economic driver of Ontario. Starting to chip away at it, at all, is a slippery slope that sets the precedent that the boundaries do not matter. These proposed areas will encourage further urban sprawl, pave over farmland and greenspace, and continue with the 20th century reliance on personal automobiles. These results (e.g. emissions from automobiles, carbon sequestration lost from paving over the environment, etc.) go directly against our commitments in the Paris Agreement at COP21.
How were these sites selected? Many do not appear to be logical extensions of existing neighborhoods. There may also be significant unintended consequences, including having to pay compensation to affected residents who lived near the border of the greenbelt. Homeowners pay a premium for access to the natural environment, and privacy, if they back on to greenbelt lands. Can further rationale for the selection of these sites be provided? Can the names of the landowners of the 11 plots of land be publicly released? This would be important information to ensure that the policy process is evidence-based, fair and transparent.
It does not appear that the lands being added to the greenbelt, to offset the lands being removed, are suitable for development, anyway! You can't build houses on urban river valleys, so to say (or imply) that this is direct offset is disingenuous. It also does not make sense to develop the Paris Galt Moraine and the Oak Ridges Moraine.
The tactics related to this proposal also suggest that this proposal is not in the public interest. To release this ERO post on a Friday afternoon, during the CUPE labour issues, suggests that the government was hoping to fly under the radar.

I’m not a scientist, but I get it. Shouldn’t elected officials controlling our world have to take a course in ecology before they destroy it for us?

63192,/comment/63192,"I am writing to you as a resident of Thornhill. Our family has been residing in Thornhill since 2006, in the Dufferin and Clark area, and we have always greatly enjoyed and appreciated having a lot of natural green space around Thornhill/Vaughan. We are very happy to see multiple bird species in the area, as well as all sorts of wild mammals such as rabbits, raccoons, and foxes. I enjoy exploring various natural areas with my son, such as the Marita Payne Park trail, and the Nashville Conservation Area.
We now are extremely concerned and outraged by the announcement of the provincial government in regards to the opening up of the Greenbelt for development.
The Greenbelt is an area that should be permanently protected. The value of the Greenbelt is in providing life to other species such as plants, birds, and wild mammals, and the value also lies in the human enjoyment of natural forests. Ontarians greatly respect and appreciate nature and we would be devastated to see Greenbelt destroyed by developers. The benefits of more houses WOULD NOT outweigh the devastating costs of the destruction of these natural areas. Our family has chosen to live in this area specifically due to the availability of natural forests and swamps around Vaughan and Richmond Hill, the quality of life does not just lie in owning a house, but the surrounding area greatly matters. Seeing the Greenbelt turn into more suburbs and plazas would be devastating to the residents of Ontario.
The residents of Thornhill DO NOT support the proposed destruction of Greenbelt around Vaughan, Richmond Hill, King, etc. The extension of monotone suburbs is not more valuable than the life of all plants and other species that reside in the natural areas of the Greenbelt.
Yes, we do need more housing in Ontario, but this is not the solution. I also work in Anti-Money Laundering field, and I am quite informed on the topic of real estate purchases. Instead of destroying precious natural spaces, the Ontario government needs to focus on preventing laundered money flowing into real estate investments. Not enough is being done about money laundering and we see investors buying up homes, leaving some of them empty, and leaving out of the market families with average salaries. We also need to focus on changing the zoning laws and building more dense housing units such as row houses and townhouses. We have solutions that do not involve destruction of protected environmental areas.
Please help us stop the development of the previous Greenbelt, I hope that my children and future grandchildren will never see the Greenbelt turned into driveways and Walmart parking lots.

63478,/comment/63478,"Dear Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing:
Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I am not entirely clear on the difference between ERO 019-6216 and ERO 019-6217, so I am also providing a comment here. Apologies for any duplication.
I oppose the proposed removal/redesignation of lands from the Greenbelt (ERO 019-6216, ERO 019-6217) for the following reasons:
-	In this era of uncontrolled climate change, and with limited existing greenspace in the GTA, the Greenbelt provides a measure of resilience to Ontarians residing nearby and reduces costs (and taxes) for all Ontarians.
-	For example, greenspaces have been shown to improve health. Access to greenspace would be great, but even if the greenspace is private, it is visible and more relaxing than seeing construction or subdivisions.
-	Greenspace helps absorb heat and rain, reducing “heat island” effects and flooding (or pressure on stormwater systems). In addition, it reduces the need for air conditioning and repairing damages from flooding which necessitate more resources and further contribute to greenhouse gases and climate change.
-	Nearby farmland supports supply chain and resiliency of the area, rather than relying on land that is farther which also results in higher transportation costs.
-	In short, the existing Greenbelt land is supporting health and the economy (supply chain resilience) and reducing climate change costs and emergencies that would ultimately be borne by Ontario taxpayers.
Because of these concerns, I find the proposed “trade” (removing 7000 acres and designating 9400 acres of other land as part of the Greenbelt) insufficient, in particular:
-	This amendment opens up land for development and removes greenspace but does not replace it with additional greenspace in similar locations (i.e. the land that is being added to the Greenbelt will stay in its existing condition; it is not land that was developed that is being restored back to a more natural state. If you would unpave 9400 acres of unused pavement and make it greenspace, that would be a better trade.) As such, I still have concerns about the diminished greenspace in the GTA that the Greenbelt protects.
-	Your proposal earlier this year (ERO 019-3136, ERO 019-4485) already considered adding land from the Paris Galt Moraine and Urban River Valleys (URVs). In particular, Phase 2 of designating URVs (in ERO 019-4485) specified that “Key Principles for Expanding the Greenbelt identified in phase 1 were also applied. In particular, 1. No removal or land exchanges proposed – This proposal is about growing the size and quality of the Greenbelt, and the government will not consider the removal of any lands from the Greenbelt”. The current proposal contradicts ERO 019-4485 and does not explain why land exchanges are proposed for the URVs. In addition, the Summary of Comments for ERO 019-3136 didn’t seem to identify a need to trade the URVs and Paris Galt Moraine for proposed development areas elsewhere, so there is a lack of rationale and transparency as to how this is a relevant or compensatory trade.
-	Moreover, if the Paris Galt Moraine and URVs should be protected and added to the Greenbelt based on merit, then they should be added to the Greenbelt for that reason. There is no requirement to remove land in that process.
Finally, I would like to raise alternatives.
-	Ontario has a lot of land. There is no fundamental reason development needs to occur in the Greenbelt specifically.
-	One could argue that previous or existing development policies and urban planning have not considered and addressed long-term needs. (Apparently we didn’t plan and allocate land around the Greenbelt with a long-term view). However, continuing to make these same choices that got us here will not solve the underlying problem.
-	What happens when those 50,000 homes are inhabited and additional people want to move to the area? Do we keep carving up the Greenbelt to build large homes and subdivisions?
-	Why is the rest of Ontario not a desirable place to live? How can we build healthy communities throughout Ontario while planning for long-term needs? Why do we need to build on GTA greenspace that is currently protected, that supports health, economic, and environmental resiliency, and whose loss would ultimately result in financial costs for residents of the GTA and Ontario?
Thank you for your time and attention. I hope that you will find alternate solutions to building homes that do not require removing protected Greenbelt land.

I agree there's a housing crisis, however, cutting into the Greenbelt won't fix it. Additionally, the plan is to cut into small sections, but we all know that overtime we'll keep cutting bit by bit and the Greenbelt will be gone.
There are other opportunities to improve the housing crisis, such as refurbishing and renovating old buildings. Furthermore, the housing crisis isn't completely caused by lack of housing, rather the astronomical rent and purchase costs of living in Ontario.
There was a promise made that the government would leave the Greenbelt alone and they need to uphold that promise. There are alternatives to the housing crisis. It's not right for us (humans) to take more land from animals.

63723,/comment/63723,"I completely oppose this redesignation because it would not solve the affordable housing crisis – instead, it would undermine the whole point of the Greenbelt as permanent protection for important lands. It would also speed up urban sprawl, endanger an important water source, proceed without any legitimacy, enrich a few developers and worsen government opaqueness, leading to rising public distrust and suspicion. We must build affordable housing in existing settlements and near transit hubs. We must also protect the Paris Galt Moraine without sacrificing other valuable Greenbelt land, e.g. in the Oak Ridges Moraine.
The Greenbelt is supposed to provide permanent protection. That was the whole point of the law: to actually stop urban sprawl and encourage compact development, while protecting important farmland and natural features forever. But this proposal would roll up the Greenbelt on the GTA side, while expanding it on the outside of the belt. The net result would be a rolling movement of the Greenbelt outward. No land would be really protected, as the next crisis (housing, jobs, etc.) would push the Greenbelt outward again. Instead, the protection should be permanent. As with National and Provincial Parks, any additions to the Greenbelt must not be at the expense of removals.
The real housing crisis in Ontario is not the shortage of expensive single-family units in the far suburbs or rural areas. The real crisis is the lack of affordable housing near city centres and transit hubs. Yet this proposal does not require that the resulting housing be affordable. On the contrary – it would cause expensive and unaffordable urban sprawl.
Studies show that there is enough land in existing designated settlement areas in Ontario to accommodate current and future populations. We need to ensure that currently designated lands are developed, not sacrifice protected lands to line the pockets of speculators.
Moreover, one piece of natural land cannot be exchanged for another as if they were widgets. The Oak Ridges Moraine protects a vital water source for the GTA and provides irreplaceable habitat for wildlife. Protecting the Galt Moraine is valuable in itself, but it is wrong to lose protection for any other land in the process.
Finally, the proposal lacks any legitimacy. There is no democratic mandate for this scheme - there was no mention of such trade-offs in the government’s election platform. There is zero transparency on how any Greenbelt lands were chosen for redesignation – or who, exactly, chose them.
There is no proof that these lands are “ready for housing development” (some of them are not even near roads). There is no information on who owns this land, how, exactly, they got their lands into this proposal – or how much they would profit from this process. All this creates an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion.
In summary, I strongly urge the government to withdraw this ineffectual, illegitimate and wrong-headed proposal, and ensure affordable housing development where it’s actually needed most: in existing settlement areas and near transit hubs. I also urge the government to expand the Greenbelt to protect the Paris Galt Moraine without removing land from any other part of the Greenbelt or any other protected area. The Greenbelt must provide permanent protection!

Your proposal will destroy extremely valuable wetlands that we CANNOT replace in order to fund developers. The housing crisis needs to be solved using rezoning of single-family home neighborhoods into multi-use ones, using regulation of the housing market's predatory practices of speculation and the blind bid system incentivizing realtors to push housing prices higher. The housing crisis is not solved by destroying our environment. Those wetlands serve a vital purpose to the survival of life on the planet. Pollenators rely on those wetlands and without pollenators plants do not grow. Food security disappears. Those wetlands are vital to the water flow that prevents severe flooding. It is also an important carbon sink. With the ongoing climate emergency, where these things are more important than ever, this plan is immensely short-sighted.

64055,/comment/64055,"I was very dismayed to see the government go back on their words published last year in the Toronto Star where Minister Steve Clark stated that the government was ""not going to entertain any conversations about a land swap"" in regards to Ontario's Greenbelt.
The government is now doing exactly what they said they wouldn't, which they must see makes their constituents and, more broadly, the people of Ontario think three things:
1. That the Minister is not a man of his word
2. That he only said what he said for expediency/convenience
3. That he will lie to us again
The Greenbelt is supposed to be permanent. The most important thing that can be done to protect these lands and the species that reside in them is to keep the Greenbelt whole. This allows for migration of species, limits pollution within habitats, and creates ecosystem resiliency against extreme natural events.
By opening up the Greenbelt to land swaps, you allow for the whittling away of our important natural resources and ecosystems substituted by other areas which are, for the most part, already under some type of environmental protection. This does not conserve more public land, and chokes off the Greenbelt into parcels which cannot exchange biodiversity.
But the housing. We need more housing!
There is a sore need for affordable housing in Ontario. There is a sore need for affordable everything. Gas, food, services, infrastructure, and more are all outpacing Ontarians' ability to pay.
I will save my rant on why that means we should be working to improve wages and not trample Charter Rights to force labour unions to accept untenable contracts.
I'll instead focus on initiatives you could work to enact right now that would help with Ontario's housing shortage without destroying crucial natural ecosystems:
- Focus on zoning that builds housing within existing municipalities where new residents can take advantage of high walkability and public transit to keep their transportation costs down
- Don't allow developers to pass along the costs of suburban sprawl to municipalities that would need to provide new roads and utilities to housing outside of their existing municipality boundaries - allowing this makes living more expensive for everyone except the developers building in the Greenbelt
- Don't rezone Southern Ontario farmland so that it can be turned into subdivisions - Southern Ontario has a unique climate within Canada which allows us to grow many crops that otherwise need to be imported. Relying on importing food from other countries increases costs for consumers, creates unnecessary pollution, and lowers the resiliency of Canada's food supply chains.
- Pass legislation to ensure developers build housing that Ontarians want rather than what makes the developer the most money. We want (and need!) less poorly built single-family homes in sprawling car-dependent subdivisions, less luxury condo skyscrapers, and more affordable housing in multi-use neighbourhoods.

Hamilton, and Ontario must increase medium and high-density housing within existing city boundaries. Expansion into Greenbelt lands must be an absolute last resort. Viewing or walking through Hamilton's downtown allows you to see dozens of city block sized parking lots available for housing.

65073,/comment/65073,"I do not wish to see lands removed from the existing Greenbelt. Those lands were designated in 2005, less than 20 years ago. It is a shame that the government believes protecting land is a short-term endeavour. There is no mention in this proposal of what kinds of housing the Greenbelt land would be used for, or that it would even help with affordability which is one of the main issues driving the housing crisis. I believe this plan is not well thought out and we will be giving up more than we will be getting. Also, many Greenbelt lands help to prevent flooding, which is becoming more and more of a concern as climate change is nearing irreversible damage. This is not the time to be giving up designated land, this is the time to be protected it. I understand he wishes to add to the Greenbelt elsewhere, but it is designated in places that are already dense and developed and having green space is incredibly important for not only humans, but all biodiversity. Giving up so many parcels in places that are already developed will result in less access to green space. The current proposal only adds green space in one area which will limit how many people use the green space and will not support biodiversity in our plants and animals in the same way that many parcels of land spread over an area can. There are many places to build housing and many creative housing solutions that avoid disrupting the Greenbelt. Doug Ford promised Ontarians that he would protect the land. The housing crisis has not changed so much since his promise in 2018. He is seeking a short term solution with long term, damaging implications for the land and for the people who live on it and around it. Protect the Greenbelt, build affordable housing elsewhere.

65191,/comment/65191,"I am writing today to register my opposition to the changes in the Greenbelt which have been made in support of bill 23 to build more homes faster bill. It is necessary for us to have a bill called the happy healthy homed Ontarians bill. This would support gentle healthy densification when consultation with the existing community has been completed. Two of the key areas in this bill that I oppose are:  1. The cutting of cooperative consultation with the public and environmental agencies such as conservation authorities, when development is planned.  2.  Reducing  the environmental protections when development is considered, to the very basic prevention of disasters such as floods with no regard for natural heritage systems and biodiversity. This approach will and has only contributed to decreasing our health and contributing to climate change. This is not a collaborative approach for healthy homed Ontarian's.  Much work has been done and should be utilized in this area, for example, the Ontario housing affordability task force states “a shortage of land is not the cause of the problem land is available both inside existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside the Greenbelt… Most of the solution must come from densification…“  on my street alone there are four large homes which have been completely empty for over four years and continue to remain empty. Many of us in our suburbs have large lots that could be shared.  Our roads, parks, schools, libraries and other infrastructure are already established and paid for and are continuing to be supported by our taxes. The proposed changes to the Greenbelt, under bill 23 undermine collaboration, democracy and negatively impact healthy communities. I would ask bill 23 be rescinded . This bill would result in real estate and developers being very busy repeating our unhealthy past of sprawling subdivisions for the upper middle class which in the end will not address our current housing problem or support the healthy and creative changes we need.

More sprawl is bad for the city and its residents. There are vast tracts of existing poorly used land. Golf courses, for instance. Or the innumerable low density big box shopping areas and their attendant sprawling parking lots.

Most importantly, the housing crisis alone is not real; the economic crisis is. Inflating the housing market with more cheap contracting development is a false solution for an empty crisis. Let's make the quality housing already available more accessible. Let's value heritage homes and properties through feasible restoration and affordability.

As a resident of Hamilton in the lower city, I see so much underutilized land and vacant buildings that I'm sure with the right remediation would be more than suitable for homes. Not to mention these properties already have access to critical infrastructure, eg roads, hydro, water, sewer, internet etc. Surely this is the case with the other proposed areas.

We would, however, suggest that not only the parcel of land at Kingston Road/401 be considered.
 Ajax has  significant acreage on the north side of Taunton Road (Westney Road, Salem Road, Audley Road , Lakeridge) which is currently designated Greenbelt. This acreage should be included along with the proposed  amendments .
These lands, specifically between Westney and Audley, have services in place, are surrounded on the south by commercial and residential development, and are very close to industry i.e Amazon distribution centre.
The location, close to public transit and serviced by Taunton road ( 4 lanes) lends itself perfectly to increased development.   From an agricultural perspective, the land is poor and much lies fallow. Viable farming on much of this land would not be fiscally feasible.   Greenbelt lands would continue to abut the properties on the north.
As private landowners of many years within this catchment we are very supportive of any changes which would remove these lands from the Greenbelt restrictions. .These lands, within the city boundaries, could be much better utilized by the building of homes or industry.

1) Developing on the greenbelt will not solve the housing issue. We need more affordable homes and developments within the city limits. No one will be able to afford the monster single detached homes which will be built by land developers. If we need more suburban neighbourhoods than build outside the greenbelt. The government should be investing in better and cheaper public transportation that can get people to and from work around the city. Make it easier/cheaper to take public transit than driving a car. It's a ridiculous thought that more rural developments are needed; use the abandoned buildings in Toronto and convert them to homes and bring back the industries to the city. Toronto doesn't need to spread, we need to densify because climate change and the future of the planet is more important than single detached homes.
2) Climate change. From all the growing scientific evidence and research and protests that are constantly being done, we still think, as a government, that it is ok to destroy and eliminate entire ecosystems? It's 2022, there are no excuses not to understand that preserving the greenbelt is more important than the housing crisis. If we don't slow down climate change and revise our ideologies and habits, there won't be a planet and/or people to luve on it and worry about housing. Forget the housing crisis, we need solutions that can forsure a healthy and viable future, not destroy what precious natural green space we have now.
There are other ways to deal with the housing crisis: politicians can easily look to the OAA for solutions, NOT money hungry developers, but professionals that have studied various social ideologies and have dedicated their careers to understanding the relationship between people, built forms and nature.
Building on the greenbelt is NOT the solution. We must protect the greenbelt as much as we can. As humans we are better than this, we have a responsibility to all other living species on the planet to fix OUR mistake. Climate change is a human issue, it's up to us to fix it.

- Once a habitat is destroyed it’s gone forever.
- Protecting other land as part of green belt does not undo the damage being caused to the existing lands, water, rivers and it’s flora & fauna
- Blaming this on the housing needs of new immigrants is wrong and an oversimplification of the issue. There is low likelihood that newly arriving immigrants would have the means and even want to live there.
- This will put immense pressure on the existing infrastructure of roads, sewage, emergency services etc
- This will worsen the problem of urban sprawl
-Existing traffic congestion issues on our freeways will be adversely affected by people living there commuting to work

Each parcel of land that is removed from the Greenbelt will contribute to death by a thousand cuts to the Greenbelt. The maps show that each parcel is gradually encircling other Greenbelt land which will then in itself become subject to future sell offs.
There is already a vast amount of existing development land that is as yet undeveloped because speculators are sitting on the land. Multiple studies show that there is already sufficient land already open for development to meet our future housing needs. Just continuing the old and tired approach of increasing urban sprawl making and cities less and less liveable due traffic congestion helps no-one. We need to be looking at increasing intensity in transit friendly existing neighborhoods rather than increasing sprawl.

For example, if the Provincial Ministries were to consider moving more Provincial employees to fully or partially remote work, hostelling could be used in consolidated offices, allowing the Province to save money by paying for less physical office space (buildings) and these building could be converted to affordable residential units.  Further, some types of businesses in the private sector could be encouraged to do the same with one time or ongoing tax rebates.  This would create more housing inside urban centers where it is most needed, and also reduce pollution and congestion by requiring fewer people to commute to work daily.
In addition, more people working remotely means that they would be able to move outside of areas like the GTHA, to seek housing in areas with less intense housing availability pressure.
Municipalities should also be strongly incentivised to reduce the impact of consultation from neighbours when it comes to the development of multi-family units.  Apartment buildings belong everywhere and communities should not be allowed to gate-keep certain areas from having apartment builds and other forms of affordable housing.

There is such a vast supply of unused “greenfield” land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries (350 square kilometers as of 2019), that opening up Greenbelt lands will not deliver a single net new home. The latest round of boundary expansions would – if approved – add 17,000 hectares more of non-Greenbelt land to that vast stockpile.

The forest in front of my house was destroyed for more housing more than 5 years ago, and I still see the repercussions to this day. There are still rabbits zooming around my neighbours' backyards because they lost their home. More coyotes have appeared in my childhood park because they don't have a home either. The most heartbreaking thing I've seen is the destruction of the forest on the land of the David Dunlap observatory. Over one acre of forest was torn down to build housing, which STILL hasn't been completed yet after almost 10 years of construction. So many animals were displaced through these actions, and whenever I drive by it, what once used to be a thriving habitat is just an ugly construction site. Rapidly urbanizing areas, especially without having a safety plan for the animals and ecosystems you are disrupting, is not sustainable or ethical.

Along with this, I've noticed the increased amount of precipitation in the form of water during these warmer months. This has lead to higher water levels coursing through our storm water management systems, stressing our natural waterways and the animals living within them.
Along with the stress on these ecosystems, there is the human cost and the insurance cost of flooding that goes with increased precipitation (from a warming climate). By deliberately opening up land that is vulnerable to flooding to further urban sprawl with suburban development, you are stressing the economic system, even more so for those who are already struggling with rising costs of inflation. To deliberately disavow the experts working in the provincially created conservation authorities from providing strategic and scientifically-backed guidance and advice for development, will create communities prone to flooding, ensuring further increased insurance costs, and warmer and less sustainable living conditions.
We need smarter communities, with denser development, mid-rise is preferable, along with a tighter building envelope. Additionally, we need to repurpose buildings in Toronto and throughout the GTA, which are unused, underused, or can be completely rebuilt as options for low-income or smaller family units.

66739,/comment/66739,"I am against the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation.
The provincial government hasn't released any evidence demonstrating its plan for the Greenbelt would actually be good for the environment.
The provincial government is going back on years of promises to leave it intact.
This decision threatens the stability and certainty of the Greenbelt and it undermines its permanency.
One area of the Greenbelt includes land that’s part of the Duffins Rouge Agricultural Preserve, which the province has recently watered down protections for.
Existing evidence shows Greenbelt changes likely won’t be a net benefit to the environment — and the government hasn’t released proof that it will.
Another thing to consider is the importance of habitat connectivity. Water flows and animals migrate. Experts say you can’t just draw a line around a piece of land, say it’s protected and assume it will all work out — how that land is connected to what’s around it will also define how successful conservation efforts there might be.
Connectivity was top of mind when the Greenbelt was designed. Though the legislation that created it may technically permit land swaps, it was never intended to allow them because the land it protects was intentionally chosen.
Lack of land isn’t the reason for Ontario’s housing crisis, and more than enough has already been set aside for development.
Ontario isn't using the land it has efficiently.
If the Ontario government has evidence as to why removing 7,400 acres of the Greenbelt is a good idea, it hasn’t shown its work.

66885,/comment/66885,"I am writing to express my opposition to Bill 23. Below is a list of specific concerns, but I would also like to share my personal feelings on the matter; Ontario wetlands and the Greenbelt itself are hugely important to me, my friends, and my family. We all deeply value the natural beauty of Ontario, and believe it to be part of our provincial heritage. Altering the Greenbelt would rob Ontarians of a precious space that should be available for everyone to enjoy far into the future. While housing is obviously very important, I refuse to believe that there cannot be ways to support the housing of Ontarians without destroying the wetlands and the Greenbelt. I hope you will take this matter as seriously as I do.
I am particularly concerned about the:
1. Removal of my right to appeal on planning matters that affect my community;
2. Limitations on the power of conservation authorities (CAs) to regulate or prohibit development that negatively impacts wetlands, rivers or streams, to provide expert review of planning applications, and to appeal planning decisions;
3. Removal of the role of seven regional municipalities (Simcoe, Durham, Halton, Peel, Niagara, Waterloo and York) in planning matters, thereby eliminating coordinated efforts to protect farmland and natural areas, determine optimal locations for development and infrastructure, and efficiently deliver municipal services;
4. Drastic amendments to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, ensuring that very few wetlands in Ontario will be deemed provincially significant and protected from development;
5. Replacement of the Provincial Policy Statement with a new policy instrument geared to facilitating unchecked development; and
6. Creation of a natural heritage offsetting policy and “pay to slay” fund that could lead to widespread and extremely risky tradeoffs, where existing natural areas are sacrificed on the faulty premise that they can be recreated or restored elsewhere.
In the face of unprecedented and accelerating biodiversity loss and the ever-worsening climate crisis, it is vital that the government do its utmost to protect the farmland, wetlands, forests, rivers and other natural areas that sustain us. As Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report, we do not need to sacrifice environmental protection to address the housing crisis. That’s because “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem.” (p.10) There is a vast supply of land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries.
I wish the government of Ontario to 1) withdraw all amendments likely to weaken the protection of farmland and natural heritage; and 2) retain and uphold the role of the public, CAs and regional municipalities in environmental planning and decision-making.

Further, more suburban sprawl is not the fix to the housing crisis. Even if there were more houses available, they are unaffordable for most Canadians. They will most likely be bought as investments by people who already have several properties. More needs to be done to address the out of control rental and housing market.

From the Ontario governments own webpage about the Greenbelt: ""Ontario’s Greenbelt protects farmland, communities, forests, wetlands and watersheds. It also preserves cultural heritage and supports recreation and tourism in Ontario’s Greater Golden Horseshoe."".
The importance of the Greenbelt only increases with time as climate change causes more risk to the benefits we get from these lands.
1. Food Security and the Economy:
- Growing our own food is great for many reasons. Providing local jobs, improved food availability with less supply chain risk for less cost than importing.
- The ecosystems that are part of the Greenbelt provide lots of benefits, for example the production of honey requires some of the ecosystems Greenbelt that bees need to survive.
- Removal of lands will affect recreation, tourism and cultural heritage, such things that bring money into the ecomony.
2. Climate Change:
- Water is one of the essentials for living things to survive, we need to preserve the water systems that keep our water healthy for Ontarians and wildlife.
- The trees provide a way to deal with Carbon Dioxide (which traps heat which warms the auto-sphere) and return Oxygen into the air, the air which we all need to breathe.
To address the concern about the need for housing:
- There is so much existing development land that already has the infrastructure or is close enough to be upgraded that we do not need to touch the Greenbelt. Providing more denser housing such as condos and apartments with larger square footage might help meet demand for more space that residents usually look at detached or similar housing types for.
- Just ""trading"" existing Greenbelt land for new land is not something that can done without any impact. There are reasons why the current lands are Greenbelt are designated as they are. For example the water system is not something that can just be replaced. Climate change already is putting our way of life at risk, there is no reason to make it worse instead of better.

If you can’t care about the climate, the Greenbelt is also a huge part of the economy by protecting farmlands to ensure food production (and income for local farmers) and outdoor recreation/tourism opportunities.
Building housing on this type of land would also be widely unsuccessful as much of the land is prone to flooding, which would not only not help the housing crisis but would, in the end, feed into the crisis.
Taking away these protections so that Doug Ford’s millionaire friends can build the millions dollars mansions is not only a laughably bad idea but down right irresponsible and dangerous.
The government should be focusing on rebuilding or repurposing the building that we already have in order to create more substantial and less damaging low income housing which could actually help towards the housing crisis, rather than focusing on padding the pockets of the Premier’s buddies and destroying our environment in the process.

These lands will be used for residential sprawl - entirely unsustainable, car-centric practices that will barely put a dent in the housing crisis.
There's plenty of existing land that can be turned into medium and high density housing - why give up such important land that won't even solve the problem?
This is not an isolated incident, the larger picture needs to be considered. For example, the Bradford bypass is already an entirely unnecessary destruction of environmentally significant lands that appears to be moving forward. Not only will the highway itself cause great destruction to very sensitive environmental areas, but it will make additional adjacent green/farm lands attractive for developers to profit off more unsustainable residential sprawl.
The proposal on redesignating greenbelt areas would be slightly more palatable if medium+ density & transit oritend communities were a requirement in order for developers to be permitted to build on these lands.
Considering the existing adjacent communities appear to be examples of residential sprawl, and the the fact that it would take collaboration and strategic planning between developers, the province and municipalities to makes these sustainable communities happen - I have no hope in this outcome as the province seems to prioritize rushing this process without proper care and consideration of the long term impacts.

All it is going to do is line the pockets of land developers by building even more inaccessible """"luxury"""" housing that no average person can realistically afford. I strongly oppose these amendments and I would like to respectfully remind Mr. Ford that ""building more homes faster"" will only address the housing crisis if those homes are accessible and affordable for all Ontarians, not just the wealthy few.

It is not a reliable way to improve Canadians' quality of life, as we will continue to face economic struggles as long as property owners continue to create artificial demand for further urbanisation and housing therein.  Demand can only go up for so long, there is only so much inhabitable land and we deplete it at astonishing rates- trying to prolong that rise in demand is not in the interest of the people, it is in the interest of the land owners.

I have always loved the beauty of this province, and the Greenbelt is an important part of that for me. This plan recklessly risks Ontario's environmental health (including some valuable ecosystems) as well as prime agricultural land, and does not seem likely to solve the problem it presorts to solve. There are ways that are less expensive (both financially and environmentally) for the Province to address the housing crisis; solutions which will be more effective, including improved support for people (especially lower-income people and first-time buyers) wishing to rent and purchase property, as well as policy that more effectively cracks down on predatory renting practices.

67678,/comment/67678,"Hello,
I support leaving the Greenbelt intact to preserve farmland, forests, wetlands, rivers, and lakes.
These lands provide us with clean water and fresh air. The recommendation to ""free up land to build more housing"" works only on a planet with infinite resources.  Where there is a scarce resource, the decision to take advantage / exploit it needs to be evaluated more seriously.
1. Protect the water supply - this year had some of the worst droughts in history.  In Western US the drought is the worst in “1,200 years”; in Europe in “500 years”.  The Danube river receded so much this year that for the first time ever it exposed the hulks of dozens of explosives-laden sunken German warships…from during WWII.   Ontario’s lakes contain 20% of the world’s freshwater while housing only 0.2% of the world’s population (recently having reached 8 billion).  If we can’t come up with a way to preserve our water supply, there isn’t much hope for our planet.
2. Protect farmland and animals - this helps ensure biodiversity.  We’re coming off the heels of a pandemic that disrupted our daily lives at best, and caused millions of deaths at worst.  The ability of our planet to generate renewable inputs and absorbing unavoidable wastes needs to be considered before we reach such severity and frequency of pandemics that we can’t keep up our defences.  Note our farming and animals are already stretched: only <2% of world’s farming is organic (the rest is forced to rely on pesticides), and most animals live in cages and are given antibiotics due to unfathomable living conditions.  We cannot continue eroding more farmland this way.
3. The people need somewhere to live - and, yes, if one asks a first grader what to do about that they’ll probably say build a house (although it depends on the first grader, mine would probably consider the environment).  As adults with so much technology and scientific knowledge at our disposal we can do better than exploit a protected Greenbelt that is perceived as a “low-hanging fruit”.  We can start by acknowledging that there is housing shortages in most parts of the world.  However, many locations are land-constrained but manage to fit in housing.  Over time the Greenbelt will become only more precious and more valuable.  It has the potential to put Ontario/Canada as the most desirable place to live in the world (and possibly one of the only places to live if climate crisis drags on due to climate refugees).   The Greenbelt’s value will grow beyond the value created by single family residences where no-one uses half the space (think of your dining room).  Here's an example -  Central Park in NYC.  Taking a large chunk of prime land away from development and turning into a green space sounds like a poor economic decision - but in reality the space has transformed New York, resulted billions if not trillions of additional tourism revenue, helped create ""billionaires row"" (homes alongside the edge of the park with views of the park).    Green space has value...so much value.  And it is both financial and existential.
4. Other solutions - address people’s mentality about “financialization” of real estate.  People don’t look at housing as a consumption good, they look at it as an “investment”. Part of this is the 100% capital gains tax exemption on primary residences - this needs to be capped similarly to the US.   A cap on the capital gain preserves the ability of households to build reasonable wealth while stabilizing pricing and encouraging downsizing in an elderly population from large houses they no longer need so that younger generations can get into the market.  Secondly, use technology to compile vital complex data and find insights.  Examples include number of people residing in Ontario, number of new housing units built (by type), the number of primary residences sold each year by count and amount of profit claimed, the amount of new infrastructure (schools, hospitals, medical clinics, public transportation) built each year, traffic studies, electricity grid usage etc. All this data is available piecemeal but a comprehensive project would tied it all together and help make better decisions. Then overlap this with existing land usage and see where else we can build these “millions of homes”.  Because we can.  Looking at nibbling away on land in the Greenbelt because it is the simplest solution is not right.  It is also not clear what the financial impact of building these houses specifically in the Greenbelt will be - if it is to address the population growth from immigration ....take look at the statistics on immigration.  Most people arrive on low incomes (<$50K) and can't afford $1.5million homes.  So how is this helping?  We need transparent data to make practically-relevant decisions and leave monopoly playing to the board game.
In conclusion, “freeing up land to build houses quick” is really a fig leaf for “quick profit on development”. To really build the financial wealth and overall health of our people we need to give them the whole package - fresh water, clean air, good education, access to cutting-edge technologies, green infrastructure, and democratic platform for decision-making.  The opinions of indigenous communities should also be taken into account.  Housing is important, but it’s also about having access to clean water and fresh air.  Consider international projects with countries short on land as a way for collaborative decision-making as well.  Japan, South Korea, UK etc.
Please keep the Greenbelt intact and we’ll reap the benefits a million times over.

Constraints include but not limited to the following:
- are the lands close to existing waters and sewers to tie in or upgrades/oversizing;
- securing the lands and developing a plan of subdivision;
- hire various professionals - engineer, surveyor, landscape architect (given that the tree huggers have so much power now that this is a requirement now) etc.
- conducting various studies eg. Archaelogical which cannot be done in the winter and could give into various stages depending on what is found on site and obtaining clearance from Ministry of Culture, traffic, heritage studies,  hydrogeological and environment site assessment
- develop a plan of subdivision, rezoning and by-law amendment
- get and deal with  comments from various agencies after municipality circulates to them including local conservation authority
- make applications to the ministry of the environment for storm sewers, water and storm water management ponds which takes months ( given how quickly government employees work when they are not sick or on vacation and now working 50% of time working from home and this applies to employees at the municipality
- set up neighbourhood meetings and deal with their concerns
- wait for municipal council to hear at their next council meeting
- plan of subdivision to be approved by local conservation, respective native council, local conservation authority
- work with utility providers - water, electricity, enbridge gas, cable, telephone, Canada post, etc.
- site preparation ie earthworks and grading of the site
- install underground services which cannot be done in the winter and must be done before the temperature is below zero  and asphalt plants close.
- all the money required for every item including municipal charges for engineering and various other soft costs, development charges for water, hydro one fees, posting various Letters of credit which requires various financing facilities with a bank, the various bank fees for this in addition to the high interest
- sell the lots to a builder who then has to have a buyer and also get financing,
- the builder and developer does not know what work will cost and availability of materials.
The liberal government caused this problem setting the Greenbelt  and causing high prices.
We didn’t need the green belt because land not near to infrastructure is basically undevelopable, there are local conservation authorities governing the lands and protect wetlands.
The density the liberals proposed didn’t make condos cheaper as land near subway stations or on main roads were bidded up which raised the prices of nearby homes (and then the foreigners bidder it up) or help with climate change because it just caused gridlock across every major street in the GTA and every condo build on a block of 5 houses ended up with hundreds of parking spacesfrom 1 condo building.  Imagine how many more cars are added to the areas where condos are built.

67825,/comment/67825,"Although adding onto the greenbelt, especially by including rivers and valleys, is important, these amendments should not be made. According to the Toronto Star, the Ford Government promised not to touch the greenbelt and also said no land swap would be made. Going back on these promises does not show the government is trustworthy.
As well, this sets a precedent that the greenbelt can be swapped out, which makes it easier for those in the future to do the same.
There is little to no information on this website about the ecological effects of these proposed amendments, but the other websites linked below show that the protections on at risk species have already been weakened, and much of the land which has been proposed to add to the greenbelt is already under some form of environmental protection. It's likely that these amendments will have a negative effect on the local environments overall, especially since there is no explicitly laid out oversight of the policies and protocols for these plans and amendments.
Culturally, the greenbelt is a large part of what makes the GTA the GTA, and should be protected for that reason as well.
Lastly, there are many many many other ways of building new houses/apartments without cutting into the greenbelt, such as rezoning to allow for mixed office/residential areas, housing subsidies, etc. Another possibility is banning large corporate landlords from buying up housing in the GTA.  Mom and pop landlords make up only 3% of Canadian households, with large corporations making up the rest. With large monopolies, the companies can afford to raise rents for higher profits, and buy more households to increase their market share. Getting rid of this problem and lowering rents (or putting in a rent cap) might be of more use then cutting out parts of the greenbelt, even if new areas will be added.

I have lived near in the country for 10 years. I have watched countless families be expropriated from their homes to put up subdivisions, and the Green Belt is the only nature we have left around us. All the upheaval of farmland and forests has ruined the watershed and water table for people's wells and septic systems. Small, peaceful country communities are now riddled with crime and violence. The people who live in the country near these Green Belt sites, live there for a reason. They spent their hard earned money on a home that promised them Green Belt land near it that was never to be disturbed.
Not to mention the horrific impact it has on the wildlife in these areas. From small to big, animals are being pushed out of their homes where they thrive and being forced to cross highways to find new land or try to coexist in these subdivisions. This leads to many issues, including species like coyotes and wolves being prevalent and attacking people in these newly built areas. Where else are they to go if we take away their home?

Homeless people, more times than not, do not have proper identification because they have been homeless for so long. How will they be able to apply for the housing that is going to be built?

68117,/comment/68117,"I am writing to provide feedback in response to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing’s Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan, as posted on the Environmental Registry of Ontario for consultation (ERO number: 019-6216).
I do not support removing lands from the Greenbelt Area and I do not support the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan (ERO 019-6216), or to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation O. Reg. 59/05 (ERO 019-6217), or to the Proposed redesignation of land under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan O. Reg. 140/02 (ERO 019-6218).
While I support efforts to address affordable housing in Ontario, your proposal to remove about 7,400 acres in 15 different areas from the Greenbelt – which was created to protect environmentally sensitive regions from development – is not the way to do it.
The government’s proposal contradicts its previously stated public commitments to protect the Greenbelt and undermines the importance of green space and the impact of climate change.
The Greenbelt protected area must remain protected, it must not be cut, and lands must not be moved.
CURRENT PROPOSAL CONTRADICTS PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS
The current proposals directly contradicts previous government statements on protecting the Greenbelt.
In March 2022, your Ministry held a consultation on growing the size of the Greenbelt (ERO 019-4485), which stated the following key principles:
1. No removal or land exchanges proposed.
2. No policy changes proposed that would reduce existing protections in the Greenbelt.
And in February 2021, when confirming plans to expand the protected area by adding a moraine south of Toronto and a series of urban river lands, you are quoted as saying:
""I want to be clear: we will not in any way entertain any proposals that will move lands in the Greenbelt, or open the Greenbelt lands to any kind of development.”
The Ministry’s news release, Ontario Takes Steps to Grow the Greenbelt, on February 21, 2021, further supports the government’s statements not to develop the Greenbelt:
""The Premier has been steadfast in his commitment to protect the Greenbelt and our government will not consider any proposals to remove or develop any part of it.""
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT
The Greenbelt was created to protect agricultural and environmentally sensitive lands in the Greater Golden Horseshoe area from development and it should remain that way. It is vital to the well-being of our province, our environment, and our citizens.
The Greenbelt has a role to play in helping to mitigate climate change as it safeguards the resources that clean our air and water, reduces flood risks, provides a home for wildlife, and it also ensures Ontario communities have greenspace.
The Greenbelt is also an important contributor to the economy.
In 2020, the Greenbelt's agri-food sector generated an estimated $4.1 billion in GDP and close to 59,000 jobs (source: Understanding How Greenbelt Agriculture Feeds the Regional Economy and Greenbelt Farmers).
Wetlands in Ontario’s Greenbelt were estimated to provide $380 million in flood mitigation per year (source: Green Infrastructure in Ontario: Economic Impact Assessment).
And a previous report quantified that the annual value of the ecosystem services provided by the Greenbelt are an estimated $2.6 billion, which would be over $40 billion since the establishment of the Greenbelt (source: Ontario’s wealth Canada’s future: Appreciating the Value of the Greenbelt’s Eco-Services).
Proposing to cut the Greenbelt, add lands elsewhere, or exchanging unprotected land for protected land, threatens the stability of the Greenbelt and the important benefits the Greenbelt provides to Ontarians, the environment, and our economy.
The Greenbelt protected area must remain protected, it must not be cut, and lands must not be moved.
ONTARIO’S HOUSING CRISIS
The housing crisis in Ontario is complex with many causes. While supply is an important factor, it is not the only factor.
Ontario’s affordable housing crisis is not new, but has become more severe, especially over the past few years with home prices up by 44% in 2021 since 2018, according to Generation Squeeze Lab’s Report.
Speculation has been a significant issue with homes increasingly being treated as an investment, like stocks and bonds – instead of as a basic human right to shelter – which have inflated home prices.
It is important to focus on creating affordable housing, which would help stabilize rental markets and ease competition, as well as considering other options, which may include:
- Eliminating the land transfer tax for first-time buyers or increasing the existing rebate;
- Managing unregulated rent increases;
- Implementing progressive property taxation, which would disincentivize property flipping and renting out properties to the highest bidder;
- Stronger restrictions on foreign investment;
- Requiring beneficial owners of real estate to identify themselves to land title authorities, and to make that information transparent and publicly available, to address opaque ownership concerns and other conditions that make real estate markets vulnerable; and
- Identifying appropriate and non-protected land to create new supply while holding developers accountable.
It was also recently reported that Ontario has dedicated 14,000 hectares of land for urban development in municipalities in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, showing that land is already available (CBC News, November 12, 2022).
And it is important to note that the Greenbelt was created to restrict urban sprawl, and the government’s current proposal would create more sprawl. Any new housing should be built where there are existing roads, parks, transit, schools, and not on protected land.
There is no single solution to addressing Ontario’s housing crisis and restoring affordability, but trading off environmental protection and conservation is not the answer.
IN CONCLUSION
The Greenbelt protected area must remain protected – it is vital to the well-being of our province, our environment, and our citizens — and it must not be cut and lands should not be moved. I do not support the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan (ERO 019-6216), or to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation O. Reg. 59/05 (ERO 019-6217), or to the Proposed redesignation of land under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan O. Reg. 140/02 (ERO 019-6218).

It seems like an oversimplification and misunderstanding of the current housing crisis, as the current major issue is not supply, but pricing due to first time homes being held by landlords. It also seems that the Green Belt would not be the place to solve this issue, even if the supply was the problem.
Further, the green belt as-is is something for Ontarians to take pride in, a statement of our commitment to the environment, and a symbol of our province's natural beauty.  It also is home to endangered species. It stands as a world-class example of conservation efforts - one that should not so callously be used for residential growth. The belt also has important agricultural land. It's a very expensive mistake to endanger this precious natural resource to try to address a problem which has other solutions (ones which won't take over natural or agricultural land).
I deeply hope the Province will reconsider enacting this plan, and instead explore other avenues to provide housing relief - such as better support for renters and rent-control, or subsidizing existing housing.

Our city has expanded too far and has consumed green spaces and increased car dependency and commute times. More highways encourage more sprawl. We don't need more sprawl! We need to reduce it. The purpose of the greenbelt is to protect the environmentally sensitive areas that surround our city, and to prevent urban sprawl. Why would this government undo those efforts? Do not develop the greenbelt that we have fought hard to protect! The resulting urban sprawl will increase ecological footprint and commute times. We are now in the 21st century and we have smart growth solutions. Instead of investing in sprawl and highways, we must prioritize investing in transit and affordable housing. We should only build in existing areas by increasing density, especially around transit hubs  That will provide the most benefit to everyone, and it will reduce ecological footprint. Please listen to the urban planners , transit planners, and environmentalists. Please follow the examples of progressive cities in the world who are designing their cities to be walkable, transit friendly, and affordable. Ontario must take the progressive and smart approach to urban growth. This is not it.

The provincial Ontario government has the opportunity to listen to the constituents they are supposed to be representing, and densify urban areas, not continue to sprawl into protected farm land, wetlands, and watersheds.
More Homes Built Faster does NOT equate to building affordable homes, suburban sprawl comes with increased costs, weak public transit, fewer amenities, more roads and therefore more road maintenance and a higher dependence on cars.
Single detached homes in the suburbs are not every first time homebuyer's dream. We need density in our urban areas, and our existing suburban areas. Allow secondary dwellings, coach houses, tiny homes, granny flats, etc. Make densifying easy, protect the Greenbelt, protect our urban boundaries, and respect your constituents.
I support a Paris Galt Moraine Conservation Act and I support the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001 as it was introduced, not with the current proposed redesignation of land use.

This destruction of green space compromises the promise of maintaining green corridors for the future for the sake of a few headlines that make it appear that the government is doing something about housing.
1. Green spaces and corridors need to be protected for future generations.
2. More suburban homes will fundamentally not make accommodations more affordable. Higher interest rates have already increased the housing supply and brought down housing prices. The government is late to this party.
3. Affordable housing should not mean houses. Headlines should refer to affordable accommodation. We need more apartment buildings.
4. Air B&Bs and the equivalent have cut into available rentals. Crack down on this and you improve available accommodation and increase tax revenue from undeclared income.
5. Improve Landlord/tenant regulations to support both. Unsupported landlords stop being landlords. This spirals the housing issue and pushes potential landlords to short-term rentals.

This is a selfish, transparently greedy decision with no concern for long-term ramifications.
(Or, a blatant disregard and lack of empathy for any negative effects regarding destroying what is supposed to be PERMANENTLY PROTECTED LAND).
The Greenbelt is a sprawling, sensitive ecosystem housing many at-risk and endangered flora and fauna.
Demolishing sections of the Greenbelt in favour of unnecessary suburban sprawl will not only affect the destroyed acreage of land, but will impose a ripple effect of negative, lasting consequences to the land surrounding these areas.
You can't simply cherry-pick land to 'add' to the Greenbelt and call it a day; that's not how delicate ecosystems work.
Anyone with eyes can see that this entire proposal is merely a cash grab for the current government and their developer allies to profit from.
The public can see the true motivation behind this proposal: it's more expensive to purchase large bundles of acreage from private owners, but conveniently cost-effective to 'purchase' land that is 'owned' by the government. It's disgusting, and abhorrent. You expect civilians to live with the consequences of your short-sighted, greedy actions in the years to come? Decades from now when most of your party members will be gone? Either out-of-office or dead?
If your goal is to produce more housing, then do so in a way that actually benefits individuals and their communities. Re-zone neglected commercial or industrial areas and build there. Support multi-living dwellings and mixed-use buildings to promote liveable, workable, and walkable communities.
We do NOT need more suburban sprawl, especially not in the Greenbelt; it benefits no one and has long-lasting, negative effects on the environment and the world at large.

68547,/comment/68547,"Two main comments with the impacts and benefits of the proposal:
1)	The proposal indicates that 15 sites have been identified for removal or redesignation from the greenbelt, totaling 7,400 acres. The proposal suggests a previous proposal to add 9,400 acres to the greenbelt (consulted on in March 2022) would essentially offset this reduction to the greenbelt. There are two major issues with this. First, it is not clear whether the earlier proposal will in fact go forward, and so there is no certainty that the removal and redesignation of 7,400 acres will in fact be offset. The proponents should revise the proposal and make a clear commitment that the 9,400 acres will for certain be added to the greenbelt. Failure to do so gives a false impression to the public about the impact of the proposal. Second, the particular features of the land to be removed/redesignated and added to the greenbelt are not known. So, the full impact of the proposal cannot be fully assessed. Further information on the specific habitat, species populations/ranges is needed to know whether the removal/redesignation of sites could contribute to critical fragmentation of habitat and/or ecological corridors and whether the added land is substitutable for this other land. A superficial glance at the location of the land to be added suggests that it is not.
2)	Identified environmental impacts can be justified if the proposal will contribute to a significant and/or justifiable benefit. The proposed removal/designation of land from the greenbelt is intended to be used to construct homes. However, it is unclear who will benefit from this proposal and how those benefits will be distributed. How will the proponents ensure that the proposal will not reinforce inequality or make housing more affordable? The identified benefits of the proposal are simply not apparent.

It is clear that this attack would end the critical role the Greenbelt plays to stop sprawl and protect farmland, forests, and the source of our drinking water, as well address climate change. The government should be ashamed and the people of Ontario should be outraged.
Promises by the government to “swap” in 9,400 acres of land in other locations will do nothing to mitigate the damage to the Greenbelt system. That is in part because at least some areas being floated as replacements for bulldozed segments of the Greenbelt were already off limits for development – meaning those additions would not mitigate the net loss of protected lands. Even more importantly, the government’s plans would utterly destroy the certainty of permanent protection that is vital to the functioning of the Greenbelt as a whole.
Stripping these 7,400 acres of protection at the request of land speculators would unleash a firestorm of land speculation across the entire Greenbelt – denying farmers the certainty they need to continue stewarding the forests, wetlands and soils on their land, and pushing ownership forever out of reach.
The government’s attempt to rationalize this attack on the Greenbelt as a measure to deliver “more homes” is disingenuous. There is such a vast supply of unused “greenfield” land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries

However, as a graduate from an Environmental Science program, I do not understand the need to remove green space from the Greenbelt to make this happen. There are many other places that homes could be built that do not take away what little green space we have left.
Houses can always be built somewhere else. You cannot bring back nature to its original form once it is destroyed. Do you not want future generations to be able to connect with nature in its finest original form? Or would you rather them be confined to a city because we destroyed the green space to build more houses?
We need to be building our cities with less single homes and more town houses and condo buildings to fix the housing issues. We need to be adding to the Greenbelt so that more land and species are protected for future generations to enjoy. Finally, we need to think about the future and not just the here and now.

69016,/comment/69016,"Land lost in the GreenBelt should be reallocated- the whole point of the Greenbelt is to preserve land, protect natural wildlife (as their homes are being displaced with commercial, institutional, residential builds and infrastructure) and their habitats, and practices of water and land conservation. A logical reassessment must be evaluated to determine if the land lost to this bill and away from Greenbelt protection are lands worth building on- meaning to conduct environmental site assessments and establish whether these lands demonstrate support for biodiversity and are rich in wildlife habitat, amongst other factors. If so, builds should be prohibited. If it does not demonstrate these factors, the land lost to builds should be displaced and another region must be protected. There are Federal goals for minimizing biodiversity loss and increasing land protection, Ontario government should keep this in mind and ensure compliance to upholding this Federal target. For positive view to residents, perhaps displacement of these areas and protecting even more land than what was taken should be integrated into this plan and/or consideration of integrating sustainable community practices in the areas of these new builds.

69029,/comment/69029,"Hello,
With all due respect, this proposal is ridiculous.  The properties outlined in this proposal are in many cases adjacent to property that is not in the Greenbelt protection zone.  It is clear that these very specific properties are owned by developers who are putting pressure on the Government of Ontario to allow their development.
I am terribly troubled that the Ford Government would even consider such a short sighted and almost criminal proposal.  The long term damage to the Environment and the Climate cannot be understated.
It doesn't take much intelligence to see that these properties will have high-end homes on them and will do nothing to help the ""housing crisis"".
This looks like the developers are in control.  I do not want the Greenbelt to be dismantled piece by piece.
Come on people of the Government of Ontario.. And The Premier... Let's do this properly.

69212,/comment/69212,"Do you really think the solution to an AFFORDABILITY crisis is to spend more money on housing construction in a protected land area? What is the point of the Greenbelt's conservation boundaries if they are subject to change as soon as it is inconvenient for developers? In Canada, the unoccupied rate is above 8%; we do not need more houses, especially in place of a protected area that is a major source of drinking water and biodiversity. If boundaries are adjusted, it is likely that residential areas will end up on the edge of the Greenbelt, leeching chemical pollutants like road salts from paved surfaces directly into the watershed.
Southern Ontario is being increasingly industrialized with every passing year. Woodlands becoming neighborhoods, fields becoming grocery stores, and hundreds of agricultural plots being rolled over with asphalt for roads and highways. The Greenbelt was established with this crisis in mind; a boundary to preserve at least some of the natural biodiversity this region has to offer. But now that we are running out of space, our environment is being deemed less important than the housing crisis caused by price inflation.
Breaking the barriers of the Greenbelt opens the floodgates between a natural ecosystem, and the hazardous imbalance of nutrients and trophic dynamics caused by human development.
I, along with countless others, believe that this may spark the beginning of the loss of our Greenbelt. The barriers have been set for the purpose of protection, and the only group with the authority to disobey these boundaries is the Ontarian government. Do not tarnish what remains of a struggling natural environment.

In the face of our current climate uncertainty it seems short-sighted to cut into such an important natural feature of our province. It takes such a short time to eradicate an environment and such a long time to rebuild and regrow, and that is not taking into consideration the issue of paving over floodplains and waterways, which can and likely will cause future flooding to planned developments.

69262,/comment/69262,"My comment is in regard to Bill 23 and the Greenbelt Review.
I am a member of the public who lives in the Greenbelt and works in an Agri-Business. I am appalled at the idea of opening up Greenbelt lands to development. There are so many options for building housing without disturbing the Greenbelt. This includes infill and vertical development rather than big single-family homes and suburban sprawl.
With Climate Change being the main crisis that humans are facing it seems folly for environmental and carbon reduction reasons, but also for water and food security.
Once we build on sensitive environmental areas or prime agricultural lands, they are gone forever.
Wetlands mitigate flooding and are important for biodiversity. Wetlands store carbon s developing them releases greenhouse gases. They filter our ground water - an important source of drinking water.
Farmland is disappearing in the Greater Golden Horseshoe at an alarming rate, According to the Greenbelt Foundation, more than 450,000 acres of farmland has been lost since 1991. Aside from the carbon footprint of importing food, we learned during the height of the pandemic that it was rife with supply change issues, leaving us with empty shelves.
In addition to good environmental stewardship and food security, maintaining the Greenbelt is good for the economy. Farming in Ontario, rather than elsewhere, employs people and keeps money in the Province. It is the same with flood mitigation and other natural disasters. They come at a great cost to individuals and Governments who have to invest a lot of money in clean up and support. Mitigation is key, the Greenbelt was designed to help with that.
Please consider leaving Greenbelt development out of any Bill 23, More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022., planning. It will be better for all of us and future generations, if you do.

As the Housing Task Force noted, there is plenty of land within urban areas ready for development.

69333,/comment/69333,"The Ontario Farmland Trust does not support the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary.
The Greenbelt is a unique piece of legislation that provides Ontarians with greenspace to enjoy and a guarantee of fresh, local food. The Greenbelt has helped connect people to the land and to the producers of their food. Residents from all over Ontario are fond of the Greenbelt and the legacy it provides. For farmers, it provides a certainty that their lands are protected which allows them to invest in their lands, planting cover crops to reduce erosion and help replenish the soil, and investing in infrastructure that will help them further their farm business. This certainty keeps farmers on the land, and contributes to the strength of our agri-food sector.
Even though the proposed changes to the Greenbelt boundary will result in a net increase to the overall area covered by the Greenbelt, OFT is concerned that most of the lands that are going to be added consist of urban river valleys, which already receive protection from land use planning and environmental policy. Meanwhile, much of the land that has been designated to be removed consists of farmland that does not receive these protections and that is vulnerable to development. The GGH is one of the fastest growing areas in the country, and the farmland that surrounds it faces some of the highest development pressures in the country as well. This land is also some of the most fertile land in the province, with a significant amount of the province’s prime agricultural land A. On it, food products are grown that cannot be grown elsewhere. Without the protections provided by the Greenbelt, it is almost certain that these lands would be lost to agriculture.
The Province’s ambitious target to begin building on the former Greenbelt lands by 2025 means that all of the investments put into the land by the farmers will be lost forever. Many of these investments have been the result of farmers taking action to mitigate the effects of climate change on their personal properties. Loss of these lands for agriculture would directly impact the fight against climate change.
Allowing development to occur on lands protected by the Greenbelt would undoubtedly result in an increase in land speculators buying farmland within the Greenbelt for potential future development. If this move to remove land from the Greenbelt proceeds, it will signal that the protections provided by the Greenbelt may not be upheld. The speculation that results will reduce farmers’ abilities to access farmland, discourage them from investing in the land, and ultimately jeopardizes the local agricultural system.
Municipalities in the GGH surrounding the Greenbelt have just put forward their updated official plans, which already designate over 14,000 hectares of land for development. This land provides ample space serviced by planned infrastructure, to build affordable homes that will meet the housing needs of Ontarians. It is worth noting that a significant amount of taxpayer dollars have already gone into the development of these plans. As such, the addition of more lands for development is not only unnecessary, but it will also require municipalities to spend more resources reviewing and updating their official plans and expanding infrastructure to areas for which it has not been planned.
This government has made repeated promises to “not touch the Greenbelt”, which makes proposed changes to the Greenbelt boundaries even more startling and concerning.
As OFT stated in our previous submission on ERO #019-3136 (Consultation on Growing the Size of the Greenbelt), we support growing the size of the Greenbelt, particularly if this means more of Ontario’s finite supply of farmland is protected for future generations. However, it is important that the current Greenbelt areas remain protected, and that land is not removed from this plan.

69578,/comment/69578,"The title of Bill 23 - ""More Homes Built Faster"" is an interesting attempt to distract the public from the real intent of the legislation, that being to make it easier for developers to encroach on protected lands for development. Yes, we are in need of more homes for people to live in. However, it is AFFORDABLE housing that is required, NOT mansions and monster houses. In addition, we need more homes more desperately than we need new highways that destroy very important and life supporting environments such as wetlands, watercourses and especially prime agriculture lands.
It would be appropriate to open the way for residential development that would enable our younger generations to own a home. There should be requirements included within this bill for the developers to construct houses that people can really buy today.
It is reassuring to see 9400 hectares (although the number of hectares should be much higher) being added to the Greenbelt designated a Protected areas as well as the time frame for development of the 7400 hectares being removed from the Greenbelt, that would return the areas to the Greenbelt. Acknowledgement needs to be made that many of these small parcels are adjacent to existing areas already developed as residential zones. Although, I do wonder how this will monitored and enforced with staffing being stretched beyond limits presently.
It appears that some of the 9400 hectares are already protected in that they are watercourses which naturally fall under a Protected category, so hardly a true addition to the Greenbelt.
Further, 9400 hectares is a very modest addition to the Greenbelt being located entirely in one spot. To demonstrate a serious commitment to preserving more areas as Greenbelt, it would be advisable to add substantially more hectares than 9400 to the Greenbelt. The proposed addition should be at least double (suggesting that 15,000 hectares be added) the area being removed and be a currently unprotected areas, i.e. not just watercourses or wetlands or even agriculture land.
Having spent some time reviewing the current draft of Bill 23, there is another issue within this bill that raises serious doubt about the sincerity of the Ministry to protect the Greenbelt. Giving the Minister latitude to overrule a municipalities decision, and a Ministry decision to decline an approval is unethical and morally corrupt. The province has seen the wisdom of authorizing municipalities to make decision in the best interest of their residents and community AND then with this Ministerial Zone Override rescinding that authority. If there is sufficient evidence for the municipality and the Ministry to come to a decision to decline and approval, then that should be the decision upheld by any higher authority.
Of recent years, Conservation Authorities have expanded their oversight well beyond conservation, indeed into area handled by the Environment ministry so it is reassuring that some of these duplications are being removed. This will reduce the onerous paperwork and studies that are already covered by the Ministry of Environment and eliminate studies not required and simply increase costs and lengthy time delays.
This bill requires serious attention to the real need for housing and other development as well as ensuring that the Greenbelt and all sensitive areas are appropriately assessed and protected.
Please listen to the people who care about this - the citizens who vote for smart, intelligent and honourable people to represent their interests. Development companies DO NOT vote for these representatives, therefore they have to satisfy everyday citizens that they are doing good business.

69653,/comment/69653,"The greenbelt was created to preserve the farmlands and nature that was at risk of being destroyed by unending sprawling development. By removing pieces of the greenbelt, the provincial government dooms these farmland and nature that we had hoped would be protected forever.
The greenbelt covers unique land in Ontario, being located mostly within the Carolinian woodlands region: the most biodiverse ecozone occupied by Canada.
We have already lost far too much of this region's woodlands since confederation, with the forest cover having dropped from 77% in 1861 to 19% in 1921. Less than 10% of the land of the Carolinian region is natural, and 95% of those natural places are under private ownership. We cannot afford further reduction of Carolinian woodlands.
Likewise, wetlands have suffered greatly, with 90% of the Niagara Region's wetlands already gone. As there is intense pressure from developers to destroy these lands, we must make sure there is strong protection for every wetland in the Niagara Region and all of southern Ontario.
ALL wetlands should be considered provincially significant. The less wetlands there are, the less habitat species that need wetlands to survive and thrive will have. The reduction of wetlands will inevitably lead to increased flooding, costing taxpayers and burdening our local governments.
Natural areas need buffers to be healthy. By building closer to wetlands and woodlands such as those that will be encroached upon in Grimsby, the nature of southern Ontario will continue to be degraded.
Only 5% of Ontario is farmable. These farmable lands are at serious risk, as from 1996 to 2016, the province lost 175 acres a day. These amendments will only increase the loss of farmland in Ontario with no end in sight. What makes matters worse is that much of the development taking place on former farmlands is increasing CO2 emissions, since the suburbs being developed on farmlands lack proper connection to employment and retail areas. The car dependence of these suburbs will contribute to the ongoing use and creation of more parking lots that take up space that could otherwise be used for housing.
First Nations have a long history of opposing European settlement in their lands precisely because settlers drove away animals through their rapid destruction of habitat and negatively impacted the waterways that have been used by First Nations for fishing, transport, harvesting, and many other uses since time immemorial. Canada's courts have found in many cases that by destroying nature, First Nations are deprived of their rights, since their ability to exercise those rights are made extremely difficult if not impossible. In addition, Canadian courts have found that provincial governments have an obligation to protect First Nations' rights, which includes taking steps to protect nature.
The Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council at Ohswken has made it clear that the area covered by the 1701 Beaver Hunting Grounds Treaty is under Haudenosaunee jurisdiction, and that these grounds include the greenbelt and the golden horseshoe. Likewise, Mississaugas of the Credit considers all the waterways within their territory to belong to them, as well as tracts of land surrounding Bronte Creek, 16 Mile Creek, the Credit River, and the Rouge River.
Developing Haudenosaunee and Mississaugas of the Credit lands without their consent would be seriously unethical.
Ontario municipalities have already more than enough room to build new housing within their urban boundaries. Undermining the conservation of wetlands, woodlands, and farmlands in southern Ontario is a massive mistake that will hurt us for years to come.
And to Premier Ford, I say this: keep your promise to not touch the greenbelt.
I therefore call on the provincial government to reject these proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan.

These efforts will turn back efforts made over many decades to ensure we preserve the lands needed to support healthy and sustainable communities.  Everyone DOES deserve a place to live but not at the cost of the environment and food sustainability.
Food security and protection of spaces that support and protect local farming are more important than ever and many areas in Canada actively work toward ensuring local access to food. Local access reduces environmental impacts of relying on long distance transport of food, while reducing prices and increasing food security.
Our government should be a leader in the protection of our agricultural resources, especially in the large urban areas of southern Ontario where they are in limited supply and at the mercy of being consumed for housing as land values soar. We expect our elected representatives to be forward thinking to ensure we are building sustainable communities that can withstand the test of time, including a changing climate and changing economy.
Bill 23 lumps together a significant number of changes that impact green space, natural areas and agricultural lands which limits the ability for public consultation and ultimately harms our democracy.  We have a vested interest to protect these spaces as much as reasonably possible not only for our immediate concern, but also for future generations.  I hope this government will reflect upon these comments, and those being put forth by others, and make changes to this legislation so that protections of agricultural lands are not weakened under the guise of affordable housing.

The Greenbelt is a vital part of the Greater Toronto Area and must be protected and preserved. Once it is paved over there is no turning back. Destroying land in the Greenbelt will endanger the animals that live there, will make flooding worse, will contribute to increased air pollution and climate change, and will negatively impact the health and wellbeing of all who live around it.
My personal experience is with the eastern front of the Greenbelt in Pickering that you plan to sell off to developers to destroy. My family lives right on the edge and we often go walking through it and see deer, herons, foxes, turkeys, and all types of wildlife. To loose this biodiversity and natural habitat would be devastating. I fear so much that the Ontario my children will grow up in will be a smoggy concrete hell hole owned by greedy developers. It is unconscionable that in a time when climate change and health should be our top priorities that this government is looking for ways to profit from bad policy that goes against these priorities.
You are changing Ontario’s landscape forever for the worst and we will all suffer long term because of it. You were not given the mandate to enact legislation like Bill 23.  There was no talk of selling off the Greenbelt in the election, in fact there were (hollow) promises to preserve it. You have a majority government but have no where close the support of the majority of Ontarians. This is a decision that should be made by Ontarians and we did not vote for the Greenbelt to be paved.
I understand that there is a need to build more houses and quickly, but every expert panel has suggested selling off the Greenbelt is not needed to do so, and using existing properly zoned land with multipurpose development would meet our needs for housing. We need to use the resources we already have more wisely and this Government needs to prove it has explored all options until irreversibly taking any land away from the Greenbelt. And please do not promote the plan to add existing greenspace that wasn’t planned to be developed anyways into the Greenbelt as a benefit of this legislation – we need to keep the little green space we have near our urban centres intact.

As a provincially licensed engineer and an environmental professional, I have a strong understanding of the role of natural areas, particularly wetlands, as well as the damage their erosion and removal can cause. Once these areas are gone, they cannot be restored. The Greenbelt in particular is crucial to reducing temperatures in cities such as Toronto, temperatures which have already been increasing year after year.
In the face of unprecedented and accelerating biodiversity loss and the ever-worsening climate crisis, it is vital that the Ontario government do its utmost to protect the farmland, wetlands, forests, rivers and other natural areas that sustain us. As Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report, we do not need to sacrifice environmental protection to address the housing crisis. That’s because “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem.” (p.10) There is a vast supply of land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries.
Sacrificing the Greenbelt to build large ""luxury"" single-family homes is not an appropriate solution to the housing crisis. This is not the kind of housing that is needed, and it will cost cities, the province, and ultimately the taxpayer a lot of money. As a province we need to be focusing on affordable housing, near transit and workplaces, rather than single family homes in a car-dependent suburban desert.
There are many other potential solutions to this housing crisis which can and should be explored, such as:
1.	Repurposing empty office buildings as low-income housing,
2.	Building more reasonably priced housing than ""luxury"" homes and condos, and
3.	Changing zoning requirements to allow for medium-density housing in areas currently zoned only for single-family homes.
I encourage you to look into Strong Towns, an urban planning movement which has also done financial analysis of several American cities, as well as a few Canadian cities, to see the impact of types of housing development on a city's budget. Car-dependent suburbs consisting of single-family homes cost cities money in every case, and must be subsidized by high-density downtowns to prevent cities from going bankrupt. The urban planning YouTube channel Not Just Bikes has an excellent series of videos discussing these suburbs and their cost.
The removal of land from the Greenbelt will have consequences beyond climate impacts and the loss of biodiversity. The loss of farmland will only deepen Ontario's dependence on imported food, which will hit consumers harder and harder as the price of fuel increases and import costs go up, not to mention threaten the livelihood of our province's farmers. The loss of wetland will result in increased flooding risks, especially for homes built on these areas.
I urge you to withdraw all amendments likely to weaken the protection of farmland and natural heritage in Ontario, and strengthen protections for the Greenbelt rather than weaken them.

70097,/comment/70097,"According to this proposal to amend the Greenbelt Area boundary, parcels of land will be removed from the Greenbelt Area to support the “[provincial government’s] municipal partners to plan for responsible growth and help build housing faster … while leading to an overall expansion of the Greenbelt.”
First of all, the Greenbelt Plan is supposed to provide permanent protection to the agricultural land base and the ecological and hydrological features, areas, and functions within the Greater Golden Horseshoe and beyond. Removing lands from protection sends a clear message that such protection is NOT permanent, therefore setting a precedent that endangers the rest of the Greenbelt. “Vaughan Councillor Marilyn Iafrate … has received calls from developers who own land elsewhere in the Greenbelt looking for municipal support to open up their properties as well: ‘Every single landowner with Greenbelt land will start lobbying the government. And we will see more of this.’” (Toronto Star, Nov. 17, 2022)
According to Environmental Defence, the provincial government reviewed current Greenbelt boundaries in 2017 as part of a required 10 year review. They received over 650 requests from developer landowners to remove land from the Greenbelt. With the exception of minor adjustments made to correct mapping errors, these requests were denied because approval would have resulted in islands of development within the Greenbelt. These islands (new subdivisions) would require roads, sewers, water etc. which would create a spider web of development through remaining protected land. They would also negatively impact wildlife and forest habitats, and bring urban development closer to agricultural land with potentially disastrous results (remember Walkerton?).
The provincial government defends the removal of these lands by saying that it will do a land swap by adding land from another area and increasing the overall size of the Greenbelt. In addition to the point above, many of the proposed additions are already protected, thus are being double counted. And what is the mechanism for comparing the lands being removed and the lands being added? Are they of equal value? And how does one relocate, for example, a wetland?
According to the Greenbelt Act, when seeking amendments, consultation is required with municipalities, conservation authorities, the general public, and Indigenous groups. The timeframe is very short, especially considering municipal elections have only recently taken place with some councils not yet sworn in, so supporting their “municipal partners to plan for responsible growth” seems a bit disingenuous to me, as does consulting with conservation authorities (refer to Bill 23, which seeks to strip CAs of their power).
Finally, The Housing Affordability Task Force report, commissioned by the provincial government, states that, “a shortage of land isn’t … the problem. Land is available, both inside existing built-up areas and on developed land outside the greenbelts.” Housing can still be built within existing urban boundaries, and on the thousands of acres of land already designated for development,  without sacrificing the Greenbelt, which was established in 2005 to preserve farmland, protect environmentally sensitive areas, and rein in GTHA sprawl. I fear that this is the beginning of the end for the Greenbelt, and an early Christmas present (complete with ‘parcels’) for several developers, some of whom have as recently as two months ago made significant purchases of Greenbelt land.
I strongly object to any changes to the boundaries of this precious, irreplaceable resource.

70107,/comment/70107,"Please - I implore you to have better strategic foresight than to worsen our climate change crisis with a proposal that only pretends to sustainably resolve our housing crisis. These 'proposed' actions from our government hold strong anti-democratic and anti-environmental implications of deep concern.
The proposal carves 7,400 acres out of the Greenbelt for development - with an unfounded excuse that these lands are need for housing.
The amount of land already zoned and ready for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets. That includes 88,000 acres within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area alone. This is a direction promise broken by this government to protect the Greenbelt, and strips conservation authorities and municipalities of their voices being heard. These 'houses for the future' are paying developers today while critically endangering our collective futures. There is nothing strategy, thought-out or sustainable about these proposed amendments - all under the veneer of supporting housing that no will be able to afford. If we were truly motivated by providing housing we should focus on sustainable, affordable housing instead of stripping our lands, our globe in the face of a massive climate change crisis all for the benefit of short-sighted, greedy developers.
According to Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force, “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem … land is available.” The Task Force further advised that “Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture.”
The proposed removal of Greenbelt lands sets an alarming precedent, opening the Greenbelt to development at the request of those who stand to reap immense profits – and at the expense of the rest of us. Stripping these 7,400 acres of protection would unleash a firestorm of land speculation and development pressures across the entire Greenbelt.
Most of the lands to be removed from the Greenbelt (10 of the 14 areas shown on the maps) overlap with the Natural Heritage System, which supports “the highest concentration of the most sensitive and/or significant natural features and functions” and is meant to be managed “as a connected and integrated natural heritage system, given the functional inter-relationships between them.” What an outrage! And all of these 'proposed' changes are swept under the rug and not available for public discourse - in fact the opposite, where critical conservation authorities and community voices are being muzzled to make way for developers and this government's short-sighted greed. Are you not there for the best interests of Ontarians today and for the future? Nothing about removing lands which also overlap with our Natural Heritage System says 'consideration for our communities'.
And finally, regarding the detrimental and incredibly damaging proposal to remove lands from the Greenbelt and arbitrarily add 9,400 acres. Some of the proposed replacement lands are already off limits for development (e.g., publicly owned lands designated as municipal parks and open space). Further, these lands were already part of the government’s previous Greenbelt expansion proposals – the Paris-Galt Moraine in 2021 and the Urban River Valleys in 2022. Those proposals went nowhere, despite great fanfare at the time. NOWHERE. And now, the government is dusting them off to soften the blow of removing lands from the Greenbelt. This is ludicrous and unethical!
I absolutely oppose these proposals to devastate our local ecosystems and pay out to developers with no intention of sustainably solving our housing crisis - only contribute to our climate change crisis.

70138,/comment/70138,"I'm extremely dissapointed in the province's move to walk back on the previous decision to protect the Greenbelt and propose to overrule the city of Hamilton's decision to stay within it's current boundaries. I disagree with the provinces decision to allow the destruction of marshlands to fill them by building sprawling subdivisions but protecting a golf course instead. Mr. Ford and his Ontario government has done everything to line the pockets and grant favours to his builder supporters but thought nothing about the problems city face in maintaining their aging infrastructure as well as allowing them to make decisions that are right for them regarding housing. It feels like no research has been conducted regarding what the needs of our population is for housing and his ideas are narrow and short sighted. Below are some points to support my reflections and comments that should be counted as opposition to his current plans for the Greenbelt and Hamilton.
1. Your government's move to gut the Conservation Authorities' role in environmental protection in the name of the “urgent” need for housing is bogus, specious, and nothing more than a smoke screen to disguise your government's intent to reward political allies in property development – and at any expense to the citizens of this province.
2. In Hamilton, as in virtually any other Ontario urban centre, there is plenty of underused and unused space within the urban boundaries without constructing one more building on protected and/or agricultural land.
3. Building lavish homes on monster lots on protected and/or agricultural land risks our country's food security for generations to come. Developed land cannot be made agricultural again.
4. Minister's Zoning Orders that seek to end-run critical wetlands protection is not only stupid, it is dangerous, risking as it does ongoing flood protections managed by the Conservation Authorities.
5. Building sparsely spaced home tracts on protected and/or agricultural land will require massive infrastructure systems that must ultimately be paid for through municipal taxation. The sparsity of homes on these ruined lands will NOT COVER THE COST of this infrastructure over time. The mathematics reveal the plan to be unsustainable both financially and environmentally.
6. Building sparsely spaced home tracts on protected and/or agricultural land will do NOTHING for the most urgent needs for housing, which exist almost exclusively in the urban centres. Those who are currently poorly housed, homeless, and those who are financially challenged to break into home-ownership will remain exactly in the same disadvantaged position.
Corollary to cancelling this regulatory change, I formally register my objection to opening the Greenbelt up for any manner of development. I also object in the strongest possible terms to pushing out Hamilton's urban boundaries into precious and irreplaceable agricultural land. ""

70194,/comment/70194,"taking away the review and commenting authority of conservation authorities is a dangerous step backwards to our 1960s/1970s era of planning. The whole point of conservation authorities is to protect the natural environment and urban infrastructure from natural hazards through planning and management of a watershed. If you take away their ability to do this than what is the point of them. Municipalities do not have the technical skill to pick up this slack. Building homes faster should not come at the expense of proper planning and due diligence. Many areas of the province already have flooding issues that will get even worse with climate change. We need stricter rules regarding construction around floodplains, wetlands, and other natural features to avoid the mistakes of the past and the millions of dollars of damage they cause every year. Wetlands deserve protection as they have huge benefits to cities and the environment through flood mitigation, carbon sequestration, erosion control, climate regulation, not to mention the positive benefit to wildlife. Developers should be required to plan construction with our shared future in mind. We need development, but it must be done in a way that protects the natural environment and its function, as well as protecting said developments from future climate catastrophes and damages. The provincial government promised to protect greenbelt lands and to not remove any part of it. Removing sections at will because youd like to build there is ridiculous. You cant just take a piece away and add it somewhere else, that defeats the point of having it protected in the first place. agriculture and natural lands are critically important to ontario and must be left intact. This bill is ripe with issues, too numerous to count. it requires heavy revision and increased public and private sector consultation.

I feel this government is completely backwards in its ability to look towards the future and the countless numbers of people this expansion will affect, not even taking into account the species that have to move farther away from their sources of food and territory.
It saddens me that our only way to create more houses lines the pockets of large construction companies and the government yet exploits the beautiful land that makes up southern Ontario.

70348,/comment/70348,"Hello,
- Withdraw Bill 23 in its entirety, and replace it with a plan for housing that respects municipalities, renters, and the environment.
This is a land grab that benefits the companies that bought greenbelt land. It is terrible!! The general public was not consulted about this. Doug Ford vowed to protect greenbelt areas and now he has allowed the sale of these lands to builders. Shame on Doug Ford for lying and shame on all of those who profit from this heinous Bill!!
It has incredibly wide-ranging impacts, and the general public will be affected in one way or another. You are basically planning to blow up planning and conservation as they currently exist in order to promote more sprawl and further enrich developers. And with almost zero consultation before doing so.
Despite what the public might have heard about the ""housing supply crisis"", there is NOT a shortage of approved, ""shovel ready"" developable land for new housing throughout the province. It's just that developers are choosing not to build on it, due to various market conditions. To give an example from Waterloo Region, developers have been building just 9% of approved suburban housing units in a given year over the past 15 years; that is a lot of already approved housing that remains unbuilt!
This proposed legislation has MASSIVE implications for the way Ontario is planned and built; the province wants to override local input and democracy, destroy regional (read: holistic, big picture) planning, practically abolish conservation authorities, and open up the Greenbelt for development - not to mention build two new 400-series highways through prime agricultural land and the headwaters of several rivers. If the government succeeds it will result in major degradation of environmental protection and conservation, destruction of farmland, and set us back even further in the climate crisis. And it will almost certainly not make new homes any more affordable than they are today.

70369,/comment/70369,"Good afternoon,
I am a student who has lived in Ontario for a better part of their life and am absolutely appalled by the government's proposal to ""amend"" the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation. I feel it's very short-sighted given the current state of our global environment and it will be a detriment to not just our current and future residents and citizens of this country, it will also be a detriment to our country's global image.
When people think of Canada, especially Ontario, they don't just think about major cities like Toronto or Ottawa, they think about our massive forests, our fresh-water lakes and rivers, our capability to easily visit natural spaces like the Greenbelt Area and be in touch with the earth in a deeper manner. To develop the Greenbelt is to eradicate what makes Ontario unique compared to other provinces, especially given how most of the province is on the Canadian Shield, which doesn't allow for much natural growth anyway so to remove what is presently available is to deprive anyone the ability to truly appreciate our province.
As mentioned earlier, our current natural environment is also at stake with this amendment, and despite the provincial government's promise of promoting and protecting our natural spaces, this directly contradicts these promises and initiatives. For example, in regards to the sudden sharp decline of the American Eel population that was once naturally so plentiful they could found as far inland as Algonquin Park as well as several other species of flora and fauna that are local to this province, the Ontario government established the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2013 to indicate efforts to protecting their natural habitats, only for the CWF (Canadian Wildlife Federation) to report that they have done nothing to truly uphold their end of the Act.
What this amendment will do in tandem with such reports like the CWF's research is erode more trust from the province's people from the government, and given other frustrations like the CUPE strikes due to lack of proper payment, the Metrolinx strikes due to lack of job security, the lack of proper housing due to inflated rent prices across all major metropolitan cities like Toronto, lack of access to food due to inflation, the collapse of our healthcare (which has historically been praised around the world for the fact it is not privatized) and many other issues that are currently ravaging this province, it will reflect terribly upon your party. Your party may have won the election, but the province is acutely away how much your party's approval has been dropping since the pandemic.
I urge you not as a benefactor or a detractor, but as a fellow Ontario resident who wants this province to thrive and continue to thrive, to please reconsider this amendment and instead focus on more pressing infrastructure, for example the housing crisis. We have so many empty office buildings and warehouses due to so many people working from home, you can easily re-purpose them into homes and shelters especially given how cold our winters can be. Toronto especially is having a shortage of shelters for their residents due to high rent prices and low temperatures, and given how it is by far one of the most populated cities in Ontario, and how many people pass away every year due to lack of housing.
I will conclude this with some few final words: You're not the only one living here, just because our currency is colourful doesn't mean you should let our province be drained of any natural colour.

70390,/comment/70390,"I oppose this proposal. It violates the purpose of the Greenbelt which is to permanently protect the lands and waters set aside in the Greenbelt. This was intended to END land speculation on these lands and waters. As soon as pieces are chopped out, that purpose is destroyed and ALL Greenbelt lands become again subject to speculation. That speculation will inevitably lead to 'mining the soils' and other features of the Greenbelt on the expectation that more lands can be removed from the Greenbelt in the future.
The proposal claims that 50,000 houses can be built on the 7400 acres (just under 3000 hectares) being removed from the Greenbelt. That works out to less than 17 per hectare - a density that is far below what is required to support public transit - and instead  one that will facilitate very low density sprawl development. The costs to service this sprawl - both initially and over the long term - are unsustainable.
The proposal element that promises added other lands and waters to the Greenbelt is highly misleading. The lands identified in most cases are already protected, and in all cases should have been added to the Greenbelt long ago.
The overall description of the proposal is noxious. It is a PR push and quite dishonest. It has nothing to say about the downsides of the proposal. It is typical of what we have come to expect from the Progressive Conservative government in Ontario who should be ashamed of their behaviour.
The proposal doesn't mention climate change - no doubt because it would have to admit that this proposal is disastrous to climate. It will eliminate large carbon sinks and is intended to create very very large carbon sources through car-dependent, low-density sprawl. It also directly harms the resilience of Ontario to the climate crisis - and will certainly result in worse flooding and higher temperatures. In short it will almost certainly result in additional deaths - and we should record the names of those who vote in favour so they can be held fully responsible for these consequences.
I object also to the option provided for submissions ""on behalf of [a] client (e.g. as a lawyer or consultant)"". This is odious. It allows some people more influence than others. Comments in a democracy should not be permitted by ""representatives"" of individuals. The individuals themselves should write their own submissions, and take full responsibility for them.

- Taking over existing investment properties that sit empty for more than a certain amount of time. (Say 2 years) This can be managed by the municipalities and would be a lot cheaper than building new affordable housing.

70660,/comment/70660,"I am a lifelong resident of the Greater Toronto Area and am extremely opposed to this corrupt land grab proposal. I am thoroughly unconvinced that these measures will do anything to address the housing crisis.
If Ontario is serious about the housing crisis, the focus needs to be on urban development and density, not actions that only line the pockets of construction donors at the expense of our natural environment. Fund the ongoing operations of transit, rather than just capital expenditures. Build rental buildings at scale on those transit lines so they don’t add to overall congestion. Become a landlord for those rental buildings. Build public housing for ALL income levels, and maintain them when you do.
The Greenbelt exists because we recognized we could live in a dense urban environment without further sacrificing the natural lands that surround it. Encroaching on it is an admission of failure.

These words come straight from the Report of the Ontario Affordable Housing Taskforce.  Opening up the Greenbelt for development is so short-sighted.  If we are to have a meaningful impact on climate change emissions, we should be aiming for denser communities that decrease out reliance on cars.

The Ontario PCs have made it clear for over four years that they have zero interest in listening to the public. To them, the public who pay attention are the problem. And, here again, they are outright mugging corruption in the faces of Ontarions under the guise of this housing act. They know they can get away with it too because only a small fraction of voters bothered to vote. If people can’t even vote then what’s the chance of them standing up when greasy politicians hand protected land over to the developers who greased their pockets as political donors and chums?
This isn’t building for the future. Because these properties need to be left as productive farmland. They need to be kept as wetlands. The Ontario PCs can have no climate plan to continue their willful ignorance that climate change isn’t coming for us sooner than we all think, but even they and their developers will lose with higher food prices and higher insurance prices as our current sources of food become deserts and as “100 year” storms become yearly occurrences.
So go ahead and lie, cheat, and make corruption like this “housing” bill the normal mode of governance if you will, but you can’t fool all of us into thinking that the limitless greed of a few will have some beneficial trickle-down effect for Ontario. This bill is shameful and sickening.

70696,/comment/70696,"Hi there,
I am a 21 year old student studying at the University of Guelph. My home is back in Ajax but while studying here I have learnt a lot about climate change, mitigation strategies and carbon sequestration.
I believe that this idea and proposal although it sounds amazing for the build homes faster plan it will cause climate repercussions that we will not be able to pay back and thus suffer the consequences from.
The Greenbelt was put in place for a reason, it provides us with climate regulation, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. This land is crucial to many species already at risk, and paving over part of it will only put these ecosystems at significant risk of collapse. This will lead to something called an extinction debt - when one species becomes extinct it affects the others that it interacts with, and when those go extinct, the species that rely on it will also disappear. This will continue to happen on large timescales but will be felt in the lack of clean air and water we will or won't have.
Additionally, the bill states that they will ""swap in"" land for the taken ones, but we cannot just expect that fragmenting these habitats will still make them sustainable. Actually one of the main drivers of endangerment and extinction is habitat fragmentation - therefore these small islands of habitat separated by highways, roadways, and housing will cause the habitats to become dead zones - an ecological term that means an unthrivable habitat without any species, so not a habitat.
Also, this is not a housing crisis, this is an affordability crisis and a lot of homes are vacant right now, just no one can afford them. Materials are so in short supply which will make these houses more expensive. Also if we are concerned about housing, these areas should not be zoned for single-family houses but for condos that can allow for less of a carbon footprint as well.
Additionally, you say you are only going to take away 7400 acres, but who says there won't be any more pressure from developers to keep going?
If you truly care about our future and this province you will inquire about the environmental and ecological impact this plan will have on us in the future.
This is no point in building houses in an area if in the future it is unlivable because of the conditions we have imposed on ourselves. It is time to start thinking about us and the environment as one, as each player affects one another.
Thank you for reading and I hope you take some of my points into consideration.

70720,/comment/70720,"There is already a 30-year supply of land for housing in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, so there is NO need to change the Greenbelt's boundaries, NOR remove any lands from the Greenbelt, which was envisioned to remain PERMANENTLY PROTECTED.
If you really want the public’s feedback on the Greenbelt, put the entire matter to a politically-binding public referendum.
Leave the existing Greenbelt Plan in place and do NOT remove any lands from the Greenbelt; however, the addition of 13 river valleys to the existing Greenbelt has long been discussed as the Bluebelt.
The existing Greenbelt should be expanded through the addition of the river valleys and the Paris-Galt Moraine. The Duffins Rouge Agricultural Preserve must also remain intact. Ontario has already lost far too much farmland, while agricultural lands continue to dwindle
The Ontario Farmland Trust reports:
“The total acreage of farmland in Ontario decreased from 12,348,463 in 2016 to 11,766,071 in 2021, averaging out to a decrease of approximately 319 acres of farmland lost per day during this time period. This rate of loss is almost double the 175 acres of farmland lost per day that was reported in the 2016 Census of Agriculture
The number of farms reporting to the Census in Ontario also decreased by over one thousand in this same time period, declining from 49,600 to 48,346.”
According to the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, “In 2019, Ontario’s agriculture and agri-food sector, from field to fork, contributed $47.28 billion to Ontario’s economy and supported 860,494 jobs. Decision makers must never lose sight of this reality when making decisions about future agricultural land loss to development for population and employment growth.”
Thanks to Ontario’s farmers, Ontarians were better fed and supplied with enough food during the pandemic, compared to other nations.
Only a fool would remove agricultural lands and supplant them with an ever-growing human population.
The Greenbelt also provides many ecological services to native species and humans alike.
If Ontario is building 1.5-million homes (averaging 3 to 4 people per household) for between 4.5 and 6.0 million new people, then it will need all the existing farmland to feed those millions of new mouths. Ontario will also have to beef up every service from education to healthcare, from libraries to parks, to serve so many newcomers. All will occupy a land base that is not growing. Ontario’s landscape is finite, so it is becoming increasingly congested, while being transformed rapidly and unsustainably.
One wonders how the provincial government came up with so many DETAILED MAPS for lands to be withdrawn from the Greenbelt within such a short time after the MMAH Minister's announcement. The public needs to know who prepared all those maps and when.
There are recent news' reports about how certain developers bought lands within the Greenbelt before the Minister's announcement to break up the Greenbelt, so it appears those developers have reaped their rewards. They purchased at a low price, and they would rewarded with a bonanza through automatic re-zoning since the Conservatives only serve developers.  Developers' deductible political donations to the Conservative Party are pocket change by comparison to the multi-millions of dollars they stand to gain.  It does make one wonder if those developers might have benefitted from ‘insider knowledge’, since they seem to have such a close relationship to the Premier and his Ministers. One might even begin to wonder about other unsavoury possibilities associated with influence peddling. Consequently, a review of Quebec’s Charbonneau Commission’s investigation into the dealings between that province’s construction industry and its cozy political connections could provide a very good template for a similar investigation here in Ontario.
Just leave the Greenbelt alone.

In short, this Bill must not be passed!
Bill23 will have a multitude of negative downstream impacts as it opens up the potential for unchecked development, while closing off important elements necessary to guarantee a liveable future for all Ontarians.
Without question, Bill23 and the decreased oversight it promotes, will amplify the already-increasing risks we can anticipate from climate change.
Bill23 and the accompanying policy changes spell disaster for the farmland and natural areas that sustain us.
If passed, these changes will set land use planning back decades and will stymie societal efforts to address the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss through enlightened environmental planning and decision-making.
Putting this Bill forward under the promise of a “build homes faster” plan to address a gap in affordable homes, is sneaky labelling at best. At worst, it’s a gross overstatement, quite simply a lie about what the policies within the Bill actually address—none of it a path to more affordable housing.
Bill23, and the resulting activities that would occur once it passes, will do irreparable harm from which Ontario will never be able to recover.
It is incumbent upon the government serving its public to do what’s best for its citizens in the short- and long-term.

I do not agree with this proposed amendment. While housing is important, the Greenbelt should be protected as it is. The government needs to move beyond simply bulldozing valuable natural resources to address the housing crisis. The Housing Affordability Task force did not specify that the Greenbelt must be used to achieve the housing targets. There are other solutions available.
""The province has pledged to replace the land it’s removing from the Greenbelt by adding 9,400 acres elsewhere."" This is also a very concerning statement. Valuable land cannot just be added elsewhere. There is a reason why this land has been protected.
I am a Canadian in my 20s who would love to be able to afford my own house one day. My parents immigrated here in the 90s and bought a home that I could only dream of affording today. However, I do not believe that this proposed amendment has people like myself in mind. After reading The Narwal's article, I am concerned that this decision is being made not for the benefit of ALL Canadians in the present and in the future, but for the benefit of a small group of already wealthy individuals.

This projection is as much aspirational as positive; given the aging of our population, we require this growth if we hope to maintain our present degree of prosperity. In the context of these numbers, it is obvious that 50,000 homes is a hopelessly inadequate measure. On the other hand, examination of the geometry of southern Ontario demonstrates that it is not possible to replicate this pattern of low-density sprawl in sufficient quantities to meet projected demand. The main effect of this development is not to increase housing for new arrivals, but to reduce the appeal of the GTA to employers, who seek concentrations of skilled workers, and those self-same workers whom we hope to attract.
And that is the critical problem. Ontario needs to shed the mindset of ""admitting"" immigrants and think in terms of attracting them, particularly since Canada targets the most productive, highest value immigrants who are most in demand in other destinations. Why should an immigrant come to Ontario if they can go to existing employment agglomerations in California, or Austin, or Seattle instead? For that matter, why should they come to Ontario if they can go to Calgary or Vancouver? A dismal grey tangle of suburbs and traffic jams, lacking well-paying employment and covered in snow five months of the year, is not a plausible answer to this question.

Global Warming is a serious problem and we need to take action to fix it now, not add to it.
There were 1.31 million vacant homes in 2021 according to the census. That's not far off what your proposal says we will require in the near future. This doesn't include vacant properties or businesses.
There are Empty office buildings, and retail spaces that have sat empty for years. Could we not repurpose those for low income housing. There's now a empty old age home in whitby although run down, if not fixable it could be torn down and something built in its place. In Oshawa Sears sits empty in our mall, currently being used for a covid vaccine clinic on the ground floor, although a good temporary use its not forever. Are there other empty Sears locations? There's a Reno Depot in Aurora just off the 404 that's been empty for a few years now. How many targets sat empty for years before they were divided up, torn down or filled. Is there still empty ones? How many large retail locations sit empty because no-one can fill them. Will Toys r Us or Hudson's Bay be the next to join them?
There are empty houses too. In Whitchurch-Stouffville/Newmarket, I know of two houses that sit empty right across the street from one another. They have sat empty for years, the really run down one was finally torn down but now the lot sits empty. There are also Houses that sit empty because foreign investors are buying up homes, with no intentions of using them. Even if that's a small fraction it still adds to our housing troubles.
These are just some locations I know of without doing any research. How many more could I find if I dug a little deeper? I know that these are all owned in one way or another or zoned for other things but the government could allow for rezoning and provide incentives to the owners to repurpose these spaces for housing.

70944,/comment/70944,"I am writing in to have my opposition for land swapping in the Greenbelt known. The Greenbelt, as it is, is an important ecological feature for Ontario. It provides not only protection to valuable agricultural land, but also wild life and wetlands. Lets look at the value of having wetlands for a moment. Wetlands act as giant water filtering sponges. They absorb excess water run off and filter the water, taking out pollutants and helping to protect our drinking water. Wet lands in the Greenbelt currently provide $224 million dollars per year in flooding protection in Ontario-1. Paving over and developing sections of wetland not only will lead to increased flooding in new developments but also existing housing. Losing wet land also put the supply of clean water at risk. Without wetlands to filter water, we will see a build up of toxins and sediment in our waterways.
Building houses in the Greenbelt also means that valuable agricultural is lost forever to housing. In an environment where global food security and trade can't be counted on, just take the Ukraine war for example and the affects it's had on global wheat supply, building houses and paving over the best soils in the country is beyond stupid. Once housing is built on agricultural land, it is lost forever to food production. The agriculture GDP in Ontario is the largest of the provinces at $15.3 billion dollars-2. By continuing to allow development on sensitive agricultural lands the provincial government is putting this at risk. Development means that as land is lost forever to development, farmers lose their ability to make a living through more land competition, increased land rents, increased cost of purchasing available lands and having to pay more in fertilizer to farm poorer quality land. Just as importantly, as farm land disappears, it puts this province, and country, in jeopardy of not being able to feed ourselves. After all you can't grow the same crops in Northern Ontario that you can in southern Ontario. Urban sprawl is the second largest cause of lost farm land on the planet.
 So where are we going to get new houses for the population who needs housing? The answer is within the cities we already have. Cities such as Halton and Hamilton had already vote to not extend their urban boundaries and to instead densify what land they have to work with. This I believe is the much better answer than moving land in the Greenbelt. By having cities work with individuals, investors and developers to add infil development, housing needs can be met. By making garden suites and laneway houses a right, in cities we can add supply. By having cities open to changing zoning to allow for multi use buildings (looking at you Toronto) we can add housing. Allowing investors and individuals to turn a single family home into a duplex or triplex we can add far more units across the GTA, using infrastructure that is already present.

71352,/comment/71352,"Ontario is in a housing crisis! Hundreds of thousands of Ontarians are priced out of the housing and rental markets, and hundreds of thousands more immigrants will require housing in the next few years.
What Ontario Needs:
Multitudes of mixed income and mixed format housing units.
A significant proportion of these must be rental and truly affordable to working people.
These units must be close to public transit, schools, parks, and other services to reduce dependence on automobiles and thus reduce greenhouse gas production while improving quality of life.
These units should not encroach upon irreplaceable farm land that Ontarians depend upon for long term food security.
These units should not be built upon wetlands and forested lands that Ontarians require to ensure our contiued supply of clean water.
These units should not be built upon floodplains vulnerable to our increasingly unstable and changing climate.
What this proposal will actually do:
Supply a small number (50,000) of what will inevitably be large, high profitability, single family dwellings affordable only to higher income earners.
These ""McMansions"", because of their size and isolation from each other, will produce a disproportionate per capita share of green house gases from heating and cooling.
The residents of these developments will inevitably require private automobiles, usually at least two per home, to access employment, groceries, supplies, education and recreation, which are not present within the vast majority of new suburban developments.
Because of proposed reduction in development fees, servicing these housing units will require large inputs of municipal taxpayer dollars.
These green field developments will use a significant proportion of currently protected and vital food and water security lands.
Some of the housing developed will inevitably be vulnerable to damage by climate change due to proposed reduced environmental oversight and protection.
On balance, I strongly oppose this proposal. The only persons advantaged will be a very few land speculators and a relatively small proportion of those needing housing, virtually all of whom, if they can consider purchase of a new, high footprint, green field home, are able to afford decent homes in any case. The people disadvantaged will be those who are excluded from housing due to low incomes and the lack of rental and mixed housing, and the people of Ontario in general, whose long term food, water and climate security will be compromised by the use of irreplaceable land which provides indispensible ecosystem services.
In addition, the land speculators who benefit from these changes will inevitably be emboldened to purchase further lands within the Green Belt in preparation for the next round of exclusions of presently protected lands.

At a critical time in history such as this, with the world facing an environmental tipping point, I believe it is criminal for the Ford government to even propose this, to the obvious benefit of the contractors Ford has personal connections with. I strongly feel environmental protections must be strengthened, not weakened, and that we must turn to scientists and city planners, not development corporations to guide this province forward.
Affordable housing can be found within the city and surrounding areas by repurposing and upgrading existing unused, or poorly used, developed areas as seen with the recent successful redevelopment of Regent Park. I ask that what can be done within our cities is looked at before threatening invaluable and irreplaceable ecosystems in a series of projects that may well be reclaimed by nature anyway within the next decades if climate change is not mitigated.

The same task force said that the Greenbelt, other environmentally sensitive areas, and farms must be protected.

Very simple-that's it -the people have spoken and I'm going to listen to them."" We believed the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing when he said "" We will not consider proposals to remove or develop any part of it""
Now I find it imperative to write to object to the proposed amendments to the greenbelt boundary
because both the Premier and the Minister have not been straight with the people.
There are several reasons why the greenbelt should remain as protected lands and in fact should be increased. Why?
1)  Farmland -we are losing 175 acres a day of farmland to urban sprawl and development for houses, roads, highways, strip malls etc. Farmers have been some of the biggest supporters of the Ontario PC Party but not only have they become victims to MZO's they are now also victims of the cutting up of the environmentally protected greenbelt. We are quickly losing land to grow the good quality food we all are used to and need . We may end up with some 50,000 homes but where will we get the food to feed the people who live there?
2) Removal of Forests -trees provide oxygen for us to breathe. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They absorb water, help prevent flooding and cool the atmosphere during warm summer months.
3) Wetlands- Not only do they provide habitat for animals and birds. They also provide nutrient  retention, erosion control and most importantly they provide groundwater recharge. Many of us in rural Ontario still rely on groundwater for our drinking water.
These lands were put aside for very good reasons and should continue to be protected. Once taken away and developed they can not be returned. This must be stopped.

72333,/comment/72333,"I am writing to express my vehement opposition to the new Bill 23 and the long-term, negative impact this regressive bill will have on Ontario's Greenbelt, wetlands, farmland, sustainable building standards, and the increased financial burden it will ultimately place on taxpayers.
The vast majority of residents of Ontario have already expressed their opposition to opening up our natural gem, the Ontario Greenbelt, to suburban development.  The Ford Government already went on public record several times - within the past year - stating that they would NOT open any portion of the Greenbelt to developers.   In fact, this Government stated they would seek to expand the Greenbelt- so why the sudden change?    The current government DOES NOT have a mandate from Ontarians to open up the Greenbelt - not one acre - to developers.   Protecting our diminishing natural environment, farmland, wetlands and biodiversity to the benefit of all Ontarians is a fundamental mandate for any elected government - PC, Liberal or NDP - that is your job!   It's truly pathetic, with all the resources and ""intellect"" this Government has its disposal,  that the best idea for affordable housing they can come up with  is, once again, paving over the Greenbelt.
With respect to ""building homes faster"", why doesn't the government seek to work with commercial property owners to retrofit existing office buildings and vacant parking lots into residential communities? Take a stroll around the commercial office area of Renforth and Eglinton on any given workday  - it's practically a ghost town of half-empty buildings, shuttered restaurants and hectares of vacant parking lots, no longer used by office workers.   And all of these old, empty buildings are already surrounded by highways, public transit and other infrastructure.    Why can't the Regressive Conservatives work with the owners of these ghost towers and turn this massive area of West Toronto and Mississauga into  a viable mix-use community?  How about financial incentives to these commercial property owners to take down the multiple For Lease signs, and retrofit their office buildings into AFFORDABLE residential condos for first time-buyers and seniors  (not 4,000 square foot homes with 3 car garages that will inevitably be built on the Greenbelt).  How about a government with a long-term plan and a vision for the GTA and Ontario that goes beyond increased sprawl, cookie cutter houses and big box stores?
I also don't understand why it is necessary to suddenly implement a provincial government Bill that essentially trumps any and all environmental standards for municipalities have in place. Builders in the city of Toronto have already been working with the city's standards for years and they seem to be doing quite well getting buildings erected.  You can't turn a corner in downtown Toronto without coming across a new construction project and the sky is filled with cranes.  So why would the Regressive Conservatives need to give Developers the power to disregard sustainable, energy efficient, bird-friendly building standards designed for the long-term benefit of future homeowners, the environment and all residents of Toronto?   Nobody, except disreputable Developers seeking to improve their profit margins, will benefit from this regressive change (was this idea ever announced during the last provincial election as a solution to the housing affordability problem  - of course not).
Although it's obvious with the tabling of yet another Omnibus Bill of destruction, the environment and sustainable development is the last priority for this Government,  it is also clear they have a great disdain for local Municipalities and existing homeowners.   First, this Bill takes away any authority local Conservation Authorities to protect our watersheds or Urban Planners have to implement the Official Plans that govern the long-term vision for our communities.    Second, by cutting development fees for the Developers this government solely serves, their costs to build infrastructure will now shift to the Municipalities, which in turn will be transferred to, guess who, THE TAXPAYER!    Given local governments cannot run an annual deficit, their only choice will be to make up the revenue loss with an immediate and substantial HIKE IN PROPERTY TAXES.   So, this Bill only ensures the Regressive Conservatives appear like heroes as they simply download the costs of new developments to existing homeowners and mom and pop business owners at a local level.   Did this Government ever think that perhaps existing property owners are struggling financially too and don't have the capacity to subsidize new development projects in order to improve the profit margins for Developers?  If a Developer can't afford to put in a park with trees next to a new condo building, then they shouldn't be in business.
There definitely should have been much more transparency as to what this Government was planning to do and more time for public input.   The fact that the Regressive Conservatives made a point of announcing Bill 23 on a Friday afternoon, during a CUPE strike threat and IMMEDIATELY after Municipal elections with new city councils not even in place yet, proves that they (a) already know Bill 23 does NOT serve the best interests of Ontarians and (b) don't really give a damn anyways.

He has given the go-ahead to destroy our already fragile and precious Greenbelt. It was created for a reason, in a time when our awareness was much lower as a population in regards to the damage we were creating towards our natural ecosystems. We have already declared a Climate Change Emergency, so why would this ever have been considered as a good long-term solution?
What kind of precedent does this set for the near-future if we continuously allow compromises to be made and redactions to our promises?
It would be unbecoming to complain without furthering a possible solution to accompany it. There are other ways we can be generating revenue and help alleviate the alleged 'housing crisis'. We could implement substantial increases to the Foreign Buyers Taxes, perhaps extending it province-wide instead of just our big cities. We could pay more attention to the proceeds of money-laundering and black market funds which has also become rampant in recent years. Canada has even established a reputation for being one of the most lenient in that regard which is not something we should be celebrating.

Mr. Ford please reassess your stance on this matter. It is impossible to know exactly what repercussions this will have but you can be certain they will be there. Irreversible damage is not something to be taken lightly and our situation has become so precarious. We have seen the changes happen in our own lifetime, with our own eyes. The natural biodiversity that will be lost in these areas will not ever come back.

72881,/comment/72881,"Thank you for considering my comment. I had a chance to read through the Report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force and it iterates that: ""a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem. Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts.""
With this in mind, I believe that it is unwise to change the boundaries of the Greenbelt as this would remove protections that have been put in place with a lot of hard work and advocacy. Changing boundaries can set a precedence for further development, which is unnecessary as there is land still available outside the Greenbelt boundaries. The Greenbelt provides many environmental protections, including safety of our drinking water and safety from flooding. Without these protections, even if housing were to be built on the Greenbelt, the housing there and in surrounding areas would be at higher risk of damage in the event of storm and flood events (which have been increasing in recent years).
As the report states: ""Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security.""
There are some great recommendations on how housing can be addressed with other solutions, such as changing zoning laws within urban boundaries.

73194,/comment/73194,"Impact of the Proposed Cut to the Greenbelt on Human Health
Our well-being is dramatically impacted by our neighbourhood design. Hundreds of Canadian studies, including dozens of Ontario-based publications, demonstrate a strong link between our health and various objectively measured community features.1 Our food environment, population density, and green space features impact our physical and mental health.
More than a third of Canadian adults have at least one chronic disease.2 Community design impacts our risk of injury, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, anxiety, and depression.
We owe it to all Ontarians, as well as our future immigrants, to invest in urban design. We must avoid the low-density sprawl that is consuming our best farmland and polluting our air and water. We need walkable communities that promote physical and mental health and social engagement.
Food Security:
Minimizing the distance our food travels from farm-to-table reduces our costs and improves the quality of our diet. Closer proximity to healthy food sources reduces or helps prevent:
-	Obesity3-10
-	Diabetes11 and metabolic conditions12
-	Cardiovascular disease13,14
-	Anxiety and depression15,16
-	Death14,17
This proposal threatens large tracks of the province’s prime farmland. It removes a significant portion of local food production from the province’s most populated region.
Sensitive Ecosystems:
Destruction of river basins elevates our risk for serious flooding which places human life at direct risk by drowning but also contributes to chronic respiratory disease by creating chronic mold problems within these homes.18,19
These ecosystems filter our drinking water. The loss of this function, and the added chemical run-off from roads and motor vehicles, pesticides and other landscaping uses contribute to a host of illnesses including cancer.20,21
Air Pollution:
The peripheral location of the proposed parcels of land, and the lack of public transportation infrastructure, ensures that the future residents of these proposed communities will be dependent on personal motorized vehicles for transportation. These car centric communities will create massive air pollution. Poor air quality contributes to chronic lung disease, cancer, and atherogenesis.22-26 Atherogenesis is the build up a plaque within blood vessels, which can lead directly to heart attacks and stroke.
Community Design:
Allowing this massive expansion of suburban sprawl in Ontario is bad for our health in other ways as well. The proposed focus on creating low-density single-family dwellings creates large distances between homes and their occupants’ daily destinations, disconnecting neighborhoods, making walking and cycling as a means of transportation unmanageable for the average citizen.
A neighborhood’s walkability is determined by how safe and convenient it is to walk from your house to essential services within the community. For example:
-	Shopping and commercial services: grocery stores, pharmacies, and banking
-	Community resources: schools, libraries, recreational centres, health and cultural services, and places of worship
-	Public transportation (allowing residents to commute to work)
-	Green space: natural habitats, recreational facilities, and public parks.
Walkable neighborhoods dramatically improve our health from birth through old age.
Studies have demonstrated a direct impact of green neighborhoods on pregnancy outcomes. A study performed in Vancouver demonstrated that mothers who lived in greener neighborhoods had healthier babies with higher birth weights and a smaller proportion of preterm infants.27
Children and adults in this province who can walk to school, shops, and essential services have better fitness and are less likely to be overweight or obese.3-5,28-36
Studies show that the people of Ontario who can walk their neighbourhoods have fewer chronic diseases like diabetes,11,13,29,32,33,37,38 better blood pressure and cholesterol control,12,39 and are less likely to develop the devastating complications of cardiovascular disease including heart attacks, congestive heart failure, strokes, and death.38,40-42,30-32
Access to parks and recreational facilities reduce the population’s risk of cancer.43
Our mental health is also significantly impacted by our physical environment. Proximity to community resources provides social support through health and cultural services and improves connections between people which helps to reduce anxiety and depression.15,16,39,44
Safety:
Infrastructure allows children and adults to remain mobile and active across their lifespan. Safe neighborhood design reduces the chances that our children are injured or killed while walking or cycling near home. Elderly individuals thrive from social connection, good sidewalk design and maintenance and reduced distances from home to destination decrease the risk of falls another serious injuries.45-56
Summary:
Protecting the environment is good for our health.
We must protect our most productive farmland, invest in public transportation, and ensure adequate healthcare, education, and recreational infrastructure to support neighbourhood growth and well-being. As we welcome new immigrants to our beautiful province, they deserve to be full participants in our communities and not live in marginalized peripheral regions that lack the infrastructure and the social supports necessary to allow these Ontarians to excel in their new environment.
It is irresponsible to hastily construct 50,000 homes while ignoring the marked detrimental effect the proposed community design will have on the health and well-being of the citizens who will live there. It is unconscionable to ignore the damage this construction will inflict on the health of the rest of Ontarians impacted through the destruction of our best farmland and pollution. Such poor design will reduce our quality of life and ultimately cost our healthcare system.
Avoid the suburban sprawl and save the Greenbelt.

Secondly, all proposals should be put on hold until a thorough investigation is done one the ownership of these lands.

We need to build smarter, not continue the sprawl. We need family sized condos that get young families into the market. We need densification, but not massive buildings that tower over the neighbour'shomes to avoid the nimby problem. Design and build 3 or 4 units that fit into neighborhoods. Large rental or condo buildings should have a percentage geared to income. Waiting more than 5 years for an affordable place to rent is ridiculous.

73410,/comment/73410,"To the Government of Ontario,
I am opposed to the proposed amendment of the Greenbelt (as well as Bill 23) as this would entail destroying precious farm land, watersheds, and green spaces that keep our environment, as well as the living creatures who live on and around it, safe. (Which, mind you, includes ourselves) This is not the direction we should be taking given our current climate crisis, nor is this going to address the affordable living issue in the province. Rather, I believe and have heard from expert opinion, that this will simply provide profit booms for the housing development companies, rather than the average Ontario citizen, nevermind even the working class. There are a million empty parking lots and essentially abandoned office buildings all of around Ontario that could be torn down and rebuilt with a more equitable, walkable, and green future in mind. This isn't even a NIMBY question for me. I live in an urban area, and I wish *more* people could access this lifestyle.

73411,/comment/73411,"Withdraw Bill 23. Preserve the Greenbelt as is. Or, add to it without removing from it. Bill 23 is not progress. It is regress. It is focused on today, and not tomorrow. It is not a plan. It is a pander.
We need homes built closer to existing infrastructure, not where new infrastructure needs to be built and maintained at the cost of local ratepayers. Those higher taxes are an unfair burden on us 905rs made to subsidize wealthy developers to build sprawl.
We need homes that are not built far away from good employment. No one enjoys driving 2 or 3 + hours a day just to commute to their job. Grandparents might think this plan will result in their kids and grandkids living close but all will quickly discover the toll these far-flung housing projects will take on the family. Grandparents had better give up their plans to be snowbirds and instead become babysitters and chauffeurs and financial subsidizers. No wonder they want to save a few pennies on a litre of gas. They know they will be driving distances on a regular basis. Now, on the other hand, if their kids and grandkids lived in an in-build  nearby (maybe even on their own property!), what a pleasure  and convenience that would be. Give those grandparents decent options so they can move out of their single family dwelling and pass it on.
For the people yet to come to Ontario there is already enough potential for 'building more'. We need to in-build but not with 'monster mansions'. We need raised 2 story 4 plexes, semis, low rise apartments/condos that are larger than 600 sq feet, small townhouse plexes instead of a monster mansion. How about 3  bedroom apartments with a living room, kitchen and 1+ bathrooms and a balcony? I am a senior and cannot/will not live in a 600 sq foot space. I would appreciate the 3 bedroom etc condo/apartment in town so I can walk/scooter/public transit to nearby community services and retailers. That would free up my single dwelling house and presto! A 'new' house for a family just like that. But with the total lack of appropriate housing for me I am not moving from that house, even as it becomes too large for me. And so that stock remains locked up. I am not the only senior who would like to downsize but go where? I would like to give up my car but how will I get around? Sprawl housing as planned by this government requires people to keep driving even at an advanced age. It requires households to have numerous cars.
This lack of planning does not admit the tsunami of single family dwellings that will hit the market when my generation dies/is institutionalized (in what this PC government thinks is elder-care). But then, I know that is not what this plan is about. This plan is about enriching PC donors and speculators who knew when they bought the lands, they were designated Greenbelt.  They knowingly got themselves into this. It should not be Ontarians who have to bail them out by enduring the loss of our valuable farmland and increased traffic and pollution. A better solution than Bill 23 is to expropriate these speculated-on lands and maintain them as Greenbelt. The message needs to be sent that gaming the system will not work.
We need senior housing plans, not single family homes in the rural areas. Those poor kids and parents who will have to drive everywhere. That does not create a community and we have many social woes as 'community' is diminished to a sea of houses with roads that are designed to head to the highway to somewhere else.
Has anyone in cabinet actually driven to the proposed lands to be released in Ajax at the conjunction of the 401, highway 2 and expanded Lakeridge? Who on earth would want to live there? It is farmland and should remain farmland. We need locally grown food that is fresh when delivered to our stores and that land is perfect for that purpose.
We need to retain and maintain our word-class farmland. Is no one in the housing ministry paying attention to $15 romaine lettuce? Ontario has a growing population that needs to be fed and climate change means that will be more difficult. Transporting that food from other places is expensive, results in hard sour poor taste and poor nutrition product. With climate change those places themselves (e.g. California) are unable to provide supply. The Pickering Duffins-Rouge Agricultural Preserve is a gem of farmland but will be a polluting disgrace as a subdivision. After the topsoil is scoured off these residents will be lucky to get dandelions to grow. That precious topsoil will be sold off in plastic bags at the local big box store. It took eons to be created. Rainfall will run off the land, not soak in. Lots more stormdrains will be sending more salt and chemicals into Lake Ontario (our drinking water supply) and through the watersheds polluting as they go.
We need less light and noise and air pollution. Those attack our quality of life and health. How can we manage our increasing health costs if our government pushes policies that harm our health? More highways, more roads, more vehicles, more street lights, more traffic and more big box plazas all hurt us and hurt our small businesses. Wal-Mart loves a big box plaza. My neighbour trying to operate a small business does not. I have no shared cause with Wal-mart. I do with my neighbour. Funny this government-for-the-people is hostile to small businesses. In-builds already have lights and sewers and roads and sidewalks. No need to build more. We do not need to have more snowplows, more fire stations, more police stations, more municipal vehicles , more garbage trucks and so on. In-building helps limit those extra expenses the developers will not have to pay the price for, but I and my neighbours will.
We are not the only creatures who live here. I grew up in small town in Ontario. We never saw a raccoon. Coyotes did not come through our wooded neighbourhood. Nor did deer. They did not have to, they had 'north of 7' to live in. Pets and people were safe. Now people fear walking their dogs in south Ajax.
One problem begets another problem.
Adding to as compensation for taking away is insulting as it implies I cannot figure out the bait and switch. The Greenbelt needs its integrity preserved, not destroyed by being scattered about. I know a contiguous spread of land has superior integrity to isles of Greenbelt. A lot of study was put into what should be in the Greenbelt long ago. By experts. People need to be able to rely on past decisions and move on. That is predictability and that is what people want, not whimsical pandering pop-up policy per the government of the day.
We must preserve watersheds that protect the homes we have as well as infrastructure. Flooding is expensive and heartbreaking and insurance companies are increasingly shying away from /reducing the coverage they offer. Bill 23 is going to make existing housing insurance more expensive, and increase the risks of flooding. Will there be free handouts of sump pumps? Will this PC government subsidize my insurance? Pay for damage to my home caused by flooding? I do what I can on my property to minimize those risks only to see that just up the road acres of pavement and concrete and roofs and other hard surfaces are promoted by this PC government.
The Greenbelt and agricultural lands and woodland nature of Ontario are what make it beautiful and a premier place to live. There are lots of other places in the GTA already planned for building residences. Conservative includes 'don't buy what you don't need'. We cannot afford the price. We need stability, predictability and sustainability.
1. This is not a 'build homes better' plan but a 'reward for donor developers' plan.
2. We need a 'better way to build homes' plan for everyone and to free up existing single dwellings.
3. This is a complete waste of the expense and effort of prior reports that reached conclusions about the Greenbelt and is something we should be able to plan/rely on. It is a waste/disruptive to throw out plans every few years. It teaches us to not trust the government of the day and foment resentment.
4. This emphasizes that the words of governments and premiers, and this one in particular, cannot be trusted.
5. This is not a government 'for the people'. No wonder the slogan changed. This is government for the rich, connected and privileged.
6. This PC government has a problem with 'experts' and that is scary.
7. This PC government panders to speculators and that is scary.
8. While this PC government rewards developers who will make millions of dollars, it gives me a $120 a year gimmick (if I cannot afford $120 a year to get a car permit, I cannot afford a car) or a few cents a litre on gasoline (same, if I cannot afford, time to sell the car).
9. I want my government to focus on quality of life, which should be how to continue to make Ontario a beautiful and healthy place to live for most of us, not a money-pot for the privileged connected few.

This is simply to enrich your already wealthy developer backers.

This would increase the vibrancy of our urban centres and allow us to more than accommodate the arrival of new residents.

I fully support the removal of the Book Road West lands in Ancaster from the Greenbelt for several reasons already premised in the MMAH guidelines, but there is another underlying and compelling reason that is most important to me. It is as follows:
I purchased a parcel of land on Book Road West Ancaster a couple years after the original Greenbelt was established primarily BECAUSE the Book Road Area was NOT part of the newly established Greenbelt. It was safe! But it was not until some 7 years later, 10 years after the Greenbelt was established, that the City changed its mind and did a unjust and undemocratic move, and voted the area into the Greenbelt without any scientific justification, and without any input from the area owners.
At the time,  this area was going through the planning process whereby our land group submitted studies and consultations to bring these lands forward as a future growth area, and began working with the City to move the project forward.
But City in conjunction with the Liberal government moved to quash our effort to develop these lands and misused the Greenbelt title as a tool to stop developmentbof an area. There was no scientific justification that these lands be placed into the Greenbelt. Book Road West area is not Prime Agriculture nor is there any farming happening that would support the food supply or otherwise. This is evidenced by ALL of the generational owners and farmers of these lands vehemently opposing a Greenbelt status back in 2016-17 when this decision was made. Councilor Ferguson in conjunction with Minister McMeekin and the Chief Planner ensured the area would never be developed by using the Greenbelt title to block development for their purposes. This is not how a  Greenbelt should be decided. All the owners were furious about how undemocratic and intentional it was. The process is a matter of record, and even during this recent MCR process, Ferguson and the Chief Planner made reference to how they stopped Book Road West and its all on video and they laughed about how it happened. This was not only insulting to all those generational owners, but its on record, and speaks to how conspiratorial their game was.
I am fully in favour as an Ancaster resident that Book Road West be removed from the Greenbelt and permitted to develop as there are several ways to service the area immediately but the City will try to tell you otherwise.

73662,/comment/73662,"To the Government of Ontario,
The Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation (ERO number019-6217)
in reference to alteration of the Greenbelt Act, 2005 to facilitate the mandates of the “More Homes Built Faster plan” lacks alignment with the broader Canadian vision of developing sustainable and eco-friendly solutions to the housing crisis in a manner that limits environmental impacts and global warming. The plan to establish 1.5 million houses over the next 10 years by reducing the greenbelt and allocating one-off new greenbelt lands in Wellington County lacks foresight and adds additional risks of environmental degradation as well as impediments to vital wildlife corridors (e.g., Proposed Modifications Map 7). While we can all appreciate the housing crisis, amendments to remove greenbelt lands are not the solution. The proposed plan is shortsighted in terms of finding viable solutions to a clearly increasingly difficult problem. How does the province’s vision for the future of the Greater Golden Horseshoe Region (GGHR) plan to addresses housing in years to come when population levels in this region begin to more closely align with some of the largest cities in the world? There are only so many extra pieces of land in the area to remove, which is to say a finite solution. The present plan as proposed has no clear vision as to how the increased density of population around the GGHR will be addressed but rather seeks a quick solution to a perennial problem. While the addition of equal or greater greenbelt lands outside of the proposed areas of redesignation is a step in the right direction, one does wonder how soon these new greenbelt lands will also be re-designated for development once additional housing becomes necessary in Wellington County and surrounding areas. Simply allocating additional lands in areas of limited present development to remove vital lands where they currently exists, and which were designated as greenbelt lands for a reason, is not a viable or convincing solution. By this measure greenbelt lands might as well be allocated in Moosonee so that housing can be realised in the GGHR! It is for this reason that I am submitting this comment on the proposed amendments to express my disagreement with the Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation (ERO number019-6217) as presented

Why doesn't the Government of Ontario come up with a plan for that? Building homes in areas set aside as floodplains and greenspace is irresponsible as global warming intensifies and natural disasters become more regular. The only part of this plan which I could agree with is adding land to the Greenbelt Areas - taking any away is robbing the future of the people of Ontario and cannot be undone. I would like to see the Government of Ontario abandon any plans to take away from our Greenbelt.

73677,/comment/73677,"Hello. I am a Toronto resident who opposes the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area. While I understand that the government intends to add lands to the Greenbelt Area if the amendments pass, I reject this kind of simple replacement solution as irresponsible and narrow-minded.
First, urban and suburban sprawl means ecological destruction. Our local animal and insect populations lose habitats and green corridors for migration. Deep soil that would absorb rain or nurture farmland is removed, thereby increasing the risk of flooding and polluted runoff.
Second, removing land from the Greenbelt means that communities lose local connections to nature. They also won't necessarily benefit from the addition of lands to the Greenbelt kilometres away from home. This particular harm may seem slight, but I believe that having protected natural space nearby (a walk, bike, or short car ride away) is vital for health, mental health, and the broader goal of land stewardship, which is everyone's responsibility under both the treaties and the wampum belt covenants that have governed Indigenous and settler relations for hundreds of years. I myself am not Indigenous, however I consider it part of this responsibility to speak out against such changes as the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area.
Third, I do not believe that removing important ecological areas from provincial protection is the correct way to go about housing development in the Greater Golden Horseshoe Region. The Report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force (link #1) states that ""a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem. Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts."" Changes to zoning (e.g. allowing for development of low-rise apartments in single-home residential areas in Toronto), further restricting short-term rentals, and penalties/restrictions on vacant investment units--solutions such as these could all contribute to development of new housing stock and opening up existing stock that is currently being held, empty of residents, by investors. I question why the provincial government would attempt to remove land from Greenbelt Area protection, given the statements and recommendations from the Task Force, as well as the existence of other solutions that are less ecologically damaging.
Fourth, in light of the recent investigation by the Toronto Star and The Narwhal (link #2), I am deeply suspicious of the timing of these proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area. The financial connections of several developers to the Progressive Conservative party throw an ugly light on the amendments, one that suggests the government is more concerned about profits than building homes in an ecologically-responsible and community-minded way. Furthermore, any kind of development may also increase pressure on municipalities to give up more of their green space.
In summary, I strongly urge the government to withdraw these proposed amendments, and work with municipalities to take advantage of alternative routes to housing development. Thank you for your time.

A true solution to solving this crisis first requires acknowledgement that there is no one simple solution. This  is  a multi-faceted problems and requires a multi-prong approach.
At the root of it all is income disparity. Minimum wage won't even solve the problem. Governments today regulate businesses on tax, employment/labor laws, insurance, etc. Where is the regulatory control over profit sharing? I would like to agree with the libertarians who want to minimize government over-reach if people upheld some sort of values, but leave it to individuals and they selfishly prioritize their own gain over the collective good for all. We need a taxing system or forms of  regulation to ensure profits are distributed in an equitable manner and that people are receiving equitable increases in salary year over year.
Education. It costs too much to go to college or university and many university programs (especially), offer too many degrees that yield no practical results.  We need post secondary to be quicker, qualitative , and less costly. Education shouldn't be all about profit too. With the ability to find jobs needed in the market sooner due to more accessible and efficient education, comes the ability to save sooner and find an income to support oneself. More affordable education also allows one to re-educate without taking a considerable financial burden, limiting their potential.
Social housing. Not everyone needs a house or wants one. But they need to live somewhere and these days with the profit over everything mentality, rent is not affordable either. Government needs to invest in social housing for various income levels to avoid only the poor living there, creating integrated communities that live together, see businesses and community grow  there , in turn providing more opportunity for all.
Build with community in mind. Too often we see a huge mass of single unit homes or town homes built in effectively the middle of nothing. No schools, no stores, no shops, no cafes, no schools. At best you are within 20 minutes of costco. This drives up the cost of homes in the areas that are actually walkable and more attractive which eventually drives up the cost in these sub-urb areas once nobody can live in the cities/towns. Developers need to be held to re-investing in the community. Try developing industrial areas or commercial spaces no longer in use but that are within walking distance of attractions people desire and need day to day. Try re-zoning areas meant for single unit homes to include options for multi-unit homes. Then slowly expand.
Seniors. Yes the boomers are part of the problem. They don't want to leave their house with the white picket fence. They live alone and can barely maintain the upkeep while a family elsewhere crams into an apartment. Senior care has been and is still abysmal. We need to focus on government funded senior care that is attractive to them and provides quality care. Again not everything can be about profits. Without that they refuse to leave their homes. Their should be tax incentive to those that do, or at least choose to open up their spaces for rent. The same should go for multi-generational homes, a choice many are left with making as result of no other options.
Credit. Mortgages right now must remain flexible but once the income issued is resolved credit should be limited to a rate times ones income. Extending this only furthers the housing problems.
Foreign investors should be heavily taxed or out-righted banned in certain scenarios. Further those with more than one home  must be taxed further to de-incentivize excess fixation on growing's ones own wealth over the common well being of all.
Our problem isn't just a housing problem. Its a problem with prioritizing profit over everything else. This issues affects everything eventually. Re-instating plots of land within the green-belt as land available for development will not solve for this. It may instead create ecological issues, affect our farming, and water supply. This in turn down the road could just exacerbate the housing problem by driving up the costs outside of these now no longer desirable areas to live in.
Admitting that we have a bigger problem and not simply a housing supply issue is the next step. Shovels in the ground can be part of the solution when done right. However, when profit is the only motivation across all facets of society, we all fail to prosper.

Ontario created the Greenbelt in 2005 to protect agricultural and environmentally sensitive lands in the Greater Golden Horseshoe area from development.

Despite my fear of having adequate housing, I am disturbed by the recklessness of Ontario's Plan to Build More Homes Faster for 2 reasons:
1) It ignores the environmental, climate, and health impacts that ploughing through Ontario's Greenbelt would bring. Doug Ford's ""tough decision"" makes risky and unnecessary cuts to environmental protections.  While we may not be able to assign a numeric value to the ecological value of the greenbelt, this land is important to the ecosystems which still drive our way of life in Ontario.
2) New developments are being incentivized with policies that favour investors.  A lack of rent protection in buildings rented after 2018, new developments which prioritize luxury homes, ""affordable units"" that are used as investment rental properties, and housing built on agricultural land far from social services and public transport do not ensure that housing meets the needs of all Ontarians.
Cutting red-tape and delays by cutting environmental and social responsibility is not progress and does not reflect the creative solutions from government that we need moving into the decade.  To truly address housing concerns with a responsible long-term solution, the Ontario government must allow the people who know the land best (locals at the municipal level, with consult from indigenous groups) the authority to dictate how development occurs.

This is a  blatant affront to our democratic right. It takes away the individuals recourse through their most direct government -the municipalities- whose planning is in a more direct and meaningful way to individuals. Their ability to pay for infrastructures that are dovetailed into development should not be taken for granted nor should the expense be handed down. The costs should be incurred by the developer who is making the bigger profits from these builds. Bill 23 is an undemocratic Bill that is blatant favouritism and reeks of nepotism. Shame on this government for thinking Ontarian's don’t care for the policies and infrastructures they have fought to have in place to protect the green spaces.

74419,/comment/74419,"Bill 23 is the most atrocious and disgusting attempt I have seen by this or any other provincial government to erase huge swathes of legislation put in place to protect Ontarians. The Bill would completely rewrite the script in terms of how development goes ahead in this province, handing the majority of the power to developers and taking it away from citizens and municipalities, while at the same time axing development charges and shifting costs from developers onto ordinary people. Outside of the development community there is little to no support from any organizations for Bill 23, no matter what interests they represent. Environmental groups strongly oppose it, as the Bill will pave over 7,400 acres of greenbelt and all but erase the power of conservation authorities anywhere in the province to ensure that development is done in a manner that protects vital natural resources, habitat and farmlands and safeguards against increasing flood risks. Greenbelts were established around urban centres across the globe for very good reasons - they are vital to providing clean water, flood control and ecosystem services on which cities depend. The last time Ford tried to chip away at the greenbelt the public pushed back hard, and we need to do it again; if anything the need to protect these lands is even more apparent now, as the climate and ecological emergency accelerates and threatens our health, safety and stability. Municipalities are also very concerned about Bill 23. The Association of Municipalities Ontario (AMO) described in a statement the profound negative impacts the Bill is likely to have at a local level, as it reduces municipalities’ ability to consult with the public and develop in a way that is appropriate for their constituency, and it shifts costs from developers to municipalities, which will inevitably need to recover the costs through a rise in municipal taxes. Despite the transition period councils are in, many of them, including our neighbours in Collingwood, have organized a response in opposition to the Bill, and we must urge Clearview Council to do the same. Perhaps most ironically, housing associations and affordable housing charities are also speaking out against the Bill because it appears that it will actually exacerbate the affordable housing crisis by limiting affordable housing requirements.in new developments to a maximum five per cent. This will make it much harder for municipalities to address the housing needs of their citizens through the provision of affordable housing options. For example, Ottawa was looking to pass a bylaw requiring that a minimum 10 per cent of new rental units available near transit stations be offered as affordable housing, but this would not be permitted under Bill 23. So yes, there will be more homes, but who will be able to afford them? To solve the housing crisis requires creative urban densification projects and well-planned, well-connected communities with an adequate provision for affordable housing and greenspace, not more poorly planned, hastily-built, disconnected sprawl. Bill 23 is nothing but a sweeping attempt by the Ford government to take the power to influence local development away from local people and put it into the hands of the provincial government and the developers whose interests they have long favoured over those of citizens.It is a slap in the face of our children when they most need us to stand up and protect them against accelerating damage to their planet and their futures, and I for one am so devastatingly tired of my children’s futures being hung out to dry by the ill-conceived decisions of adults who are at best short-sighted and at worst downright corrupt.

74439,/comment/74439,"Good morning. I am not in support of Bill C-23 and the impacts it has to the Greenbelt. Though I support the urgency being displayed to work on addressing our province's housing crisis, I don't agree with the way in which we're going about it. Altering the Greenbelt is not part of the solution.
I have lived in and alongside the Greenbelt my entire life. I grew up on federally appropriated lands in the Markham-Stouffville area, spent my young adult years in the Region of Waterloo, and now am settled in Perth East county.
With a long-standing family history of farming, and having studied environmental resources for my undergraduate degree, I have always been a proponent of the Greenbelt and the benefits it provides to our human society.
The ""golden horseshoe"" area receives significant benefits from the Greenbelt. In fact, the Greenbelt provides Ontario with over 2.5 billion dollars of ecosystem services every year; things like water protection, flooding prevention, better air quality, habitats that protect biodiversity, and more. These services are preventative in nature. While it may be tempting in the short term to tinker with the Greenbelt to address one problem of housing, it ultimately only contributes to a larger problem that is not going away, and that is the climate crisis and health of our natural environment.
While the amendments being proposed to the Greenbelt include a net increase to dedicated land, they put our current cities and townships at risk by removing the aforementioned services in our most densely populated communities.
What's additionally concerning, is that the development projects that would occur if this bill is passed are estimated to provide a mere 50,000 homes. These homes have been designated by external parties as ""luxury housing"". This is a very, very small solution to the housing crisis which is about accessibility as much as it is about supply. What we need are not expensive, detached, single family homes. We need creative solutions to this problem that should involve building up (not out), making affordable homes, and prioritizing their development on land that is less rich in biodiversity.
Doug Ford and his government promised to never touch the Greenbelt, and now they're proposing we dig into it. While the amendments today impact only 7,400 acres, the likelihood of more development becomes inevitable. I am deeply disappointed and not impressed.

74442,/comment/74442,"Hello,
In order for this comment to be published I will not include the specifics of my employment or education, but suffice it to say I have an advanced science degree as well as years of work experience in the field of aquatic science research and regulations.  Beyond the obvious dangers to wildlife that would accompany any reductions to the Greenbelt (habitat destruction, contamination of soil and water, loss of ecosystem services) there is a serious threat to freshwater that I have yet to see addressed by the Ford government. It is well known and documented in the scientific community that road salt use in Ontario is leading to the salinization of our freshwater systems. Even marginal increases to salt concentrations are devastating to freshwater organisms we love and rely on. Road salt easily runs off roads and enters streams and lakes, and 40-90% of it can enter our groundwater to continue to leech into our surface waters over years and years. By adding any amount of roads and other impermeable surfaces to the Greenbelt you are immediately putting aquatic life and OUR DRINKING WATER SUPPLY at risk of becoming completely unusable in the not so distant future (not to mention fisheries, recreation, water clarity). The Greenbelt is home to important groundwater recharge areas such as the Oak Ridges Moraine (I have included a link to the Ontario.ca page about why it is important if you care to catch up). If people want to continue living in the GTA they will need their aquifers uncontaminated by road salt, and other chemicals introduced by development, not to mention that we will swiftly lose much of our diversity in freshwater species as most are extremely intolerant of increased salinity.
If you couldn't be bothered to read here is the summary: development on greenbelt = more roads = more road salt = salinization of freshwater in Ontario. The situation is already dire. Many of us are working tirelessly to try and fix this issue, please do not make it worse. I have attached a sampling of pertinent peer reviewed articles corroborating my claims.

74468,/comment/74468,"PC Conservatives are really out of touch with Canadians if you truly believe that paving over already scarce green land that protects our neighbourhoods and communities from floods and other natural disasters to build million dollar homes is the solution to our housing crisis. On average, regular Canadians are making less than $70,000 a year and with rising gas prices, cost of food, rising mortgage rates, and a government who continues to choose to back their rich donors instead of fighting for a decent living for ALL Canadians. We do not need another section of costly subdivisions which are most likely to start in the $850k - $1m range so who is this really helping??
Back in 2003, Caledon was recognized as the ""Greenest Town in Ontario"" - well how can I be proud to live in a town which prioritizes the agenda of wealthy developers instead of being an innovative sustainability leader for all towns in Ontario.
What the government needs to do is by starting with:
- More affordable housing near public transportation (to reduce gas, parking and transportation costs). Most Canadians want to live near public transportation to reduce their costs and environmental impact but simply cannot afford to because of greedy landlords who continue to raise rent prices.
- Invest more in public transportation. We need to strengthen our public transportation in the Caledon region as many folks are choosing to move to the Peel region from Toronto (like myself). PCs need to recognize that climate change is real and continues to damage our ecology and by doing so, investing in sustainable modes of transportation.
- Rent control to help Canadians who want to live near subway lines and city-owned public transportation afford rent and to keep greedy landlords at bay
- Create incentives and support for young Canadians who want to enter the real estate market but cannot due to inflammatory prices/interest rates. We all have grown up with the Canadian dream of being established in your career, owning your own home and starting a family which is no longer a reality for the majority of Canadians. I have heard stories of people selling their houses to live with their parents due to rising costs, many putting off family planning and having kids because of the rising costs. I myself cannot afford to get married and am choosing not to have a child in this current economic state because I fear that it would put me into debt. These are the real concerns of average Canadians.
You and your party need to become more in touch with what will actually impact Canadians and reduce their stress of living. Everyday it seems like something is going wrong in this province with this government, it's time for a change. Canadians want change and we want to do so with innovation and sustainability at the forefront.

74542,/comment/74542,"I am writing to express my opposition to Bill 23 and associated policy proposals that would weaken environmental protections and undermine public involvement in land use planning and decision-making.
I am particularly concerned about the:
1. Removal of my right to appeal on planning matters that affect my community;
2. Limitations on the power of conservation authorities (CAs) to regulate or prohibit development that negatively impacts wetlands, rivers or streams, to provide expert review of planning applications, and to appeal planning decisions;
3. Removal of the role of seven regional municipalities (Simcoe, Durham, Halton, Peel, Niagara, Waterloo and York) in planning matters, thereby eliminating coordinated efforts to protect farmland and natural areas, determine optimal locations for development and infrastructure, and efficiently deliver municipal services;
4. Drastic amendments to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, ensuring that very few wetlands in Ontario will be deemed provincially significant and protected from development;
5. Replacement of the Provincial Policy Statement with a new policy instrument geared to facilitating unchecked development; and
6. Creation of a natural heritage offsetting policy and “pay to slay” fund that could lead to widespread and extremely risky tradeoffs, where existing natural areas are sacrificed on the faulty premise that they can be recreated or restored elsewhere.
In the face of unprecedented and accelerating biodiversity loss and the ever-worsening climate crisis, it is vital that your government do its utmost to protect the farmland, wetlands, forests, rivers and other natural areas that sustain us. As Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report, we do not need to sacrifice environmental protection to address the housing crisis. That’s because “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem.” (p.10) There is a vast supply of land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries.
I urge you to 1) withdraw all amendments likely to weaken the protection of farmland and natural heritage; and 2) retain and uphold the role of the public, CAs and regional municipalities in environmental planning and decision-making.

74590,/comment/74590,"Much of this applies to the “More Homes Built Faster” initiative in general.
Ontario did not invent the concept of a Greenbelt and this government would be wise to learn from those who have gone before.  Chief among those lessons is that this kind of reserve is not to provide a reservoir of development land.  Like Mike Harris giving away the 407, Doug Ford will give away development rights to Greenbelt lands.  The consequences will escalate with time and both men will be reviled for decades to come by the people of Ontario for committing us to bad deals.
Perhaps our greatest opportunity in Ontario is to shift away from the unrelenting focus on growth in the Golden Horseshoe.  With or without Greenbelts, the province would be much better served if economic opportunity was fostered in other municipalities.  While this government loves to trumpet a vibrant economy, they can only say that by ignoring the vast majority of the province.  Coming from Kingston, it should be obvious to Minister Clark that most cities beyond the Golden Horseshoe have suffered badly in recent decades.  And yet economic policy, transportation policy, infrastructure of any kind, is driven exclusively by a desire to bring more business and more people to the Greater Toronto region.  Why on Earth are companies like Amazon encouraged to build facilities in the region to employ tens of thousands of workers for wages that don’t meet the cost of living.   They set up in Bolton or Georgetown, clogging traffic, yet not even providing transit for those low wage workers.  In London or  Peterborough or Kingston facilities like that would be better for the towns, better for their employees (and better for Amazon if they weren’t so myopic).
In case it isn’t obvious, my point is when we debate how to squeeze more people into the Greater Toronto region, we are having the wrong debate.  Your objective as a government, and your most effective strategy to relieve pressure on this region, is to do the job the rest of Ontario is entitled to.  Drive policy, investment and lifestyle opportunities toward municipalities that have the most to gain.
The way in which the Ontario Government chooses to engage with the public in its efforts to urbanize the Greenbelt is laced with such cynicism that there hardly seems any point in voicing an opinion.  However, in the hope the sheer numbers might make an impact I will try to add my voice in opposition.
Let’s start with the label of cynicism:
It starts with outright lies during elections that this government would respect the Greenbelt.
Which, to be fair, was an obvious lie from the outset, given that the service area for a planned highway 413 would reach deep into Greenbelt lands.
The iteration of Greenbelt realignment before us now is clearly skewed to benefit very specific friends of the Ford Government.  It is so bold-faced and blatant one wonders why the rest of the building industry is not raising cries of favouritism.  Of course, that industry knows very well that this is only the first of an ongoing series of similar moves to degrade the Greenbelt.  Everyone will get their share in time.
Against this backdrop of indifference to what the people of Ontario might wish, we are told to submit feedback to the Ministry of Environment.  Clearly that is a branch of the government that has abdicated its obligation, or at a minimum has been excluded from decision making on this issue.
Even the so-called information provided on the website is designed to deceive.   The maps presented there have almost all the area inside the Greenbelt shaded in grey without a legend to explain.  The insinuation is that all that grey space is already developed.  You know that is false.  I know that is false.  But clearly the intention is to deceive most of your audience.
The entire campaign by the Ford Government to attack the Greenbelt is laced with denial of facts, refusal to consider alternatives, papering over mistakes of previous Conservative governments, and ultimately outright lies.  It makes this effort to participate in democratic process feel like a waste of time.

74636,/comment/74636,"have a few concerns regarding the Bill 23 “Build more homes faster Act”. This Bill has some good elements but it is simply not ready for implementation. I suggest you pause the bill and significantly revise the document prior to implementation. If implemented in this stage there will be significant economic, social, and environmental costs. The following letter will focus on the economic concerns regarding affordable housing, development charges, and possible tax increases required with the bill.
The first concern is how “affordable housing” is proposed to be tied to market rates of existing houses rather than income. In Caledon this will increase the price of an affordable house from $600,000 to $1,100,000. That represents an increase of $500,000 just by the passing of a bill, residents are simply not ready for this drastic increase in housing price.
The term “affordable housing”, with the revisions to the definition most new development will be able to fall into the proposed exception from development charges. Development charges are intended to pay for public services required by new developments such as road widening, intersection signalization, water main improvements, community centers, fire services, and police services. If development is no longer paying for development these costs will need to be passed onto the existing taxpayer. Preliminary estimations by staff in the City of Brampton estimate that taxes will need to be increased by 80%. In bedroom communities this cost would have to be paid by the existing homeowners, many of which are already struggling to make ends meet with inflation.
Finally, this bill doesn’t guarantee that costs saved in skipping development charges will be passed onto the end user. It is likely that affordable housing costs will be raised at the expense of existing homeowners, while developers pocket the profits. For greenfield developments and bedroom communities there will be significantly more costs passed onto the existing taxpayer than developed urban areas, disproportionally discriminating against low-income rural communities. As such in its current form I cannot support Bill 23.
Beyond the ecconomic costs i am extreamley concerned with the lack of public space that will be created by the changes, the lack of protection for endangered species, and the removal of conservation authorities ability to prevent flooding.

The focus of the government should be to build government-aided houses for low-income citizens. These people can start by renting the condo/townhome etc., to buy back the property if they meet specific criteria. Or, a qualified household to buy the home at a lower cost with conditions to meet on buying/selling the house after the purchase, or the government/province can control the selling price. In this case, not only can the benefits go directly to the home buyers, but the existing homeowners in the free home market will not be impacted.

74765,/comment/74765,"The government should not backtrack on its promise to leave the greenbelt intact. These changes will set a precedent for every landowner and speculator to lobby the government to remove lands from the greenbelt for their benefit. Furthermore, the greenbelt is not a reserve of land for development. It is an essential feature for protecting natural heritage and agricultural land in Ontario. Most of the remaining prime agricultural land in Ontario is within the bounds of the GTA and the greenbelt, as are a disproportionate number of rare and at-risk species. We need these regions more than ever to have good planning, with dense land efficient development within lands already designated for development. There are lands available for development to support growth for at least several decades, we do not need to open up valuable greenbelt land. None of the parcels would support affordable housing - only expensive exurbs, luxury homes and car dependent sprawl that is wrecking out environment and bankrupting our communities.
In short, I am opposed to ALL of the proposed removals of land
I am in support of adding the Paris Galt moraine and urban river valleys to the greenbelt, but these are not an adequate replacement for the lands removed, since most of the area is already protected by other mechanisms.
If the government wants to get housing going quickly, perhaps they should look at land owned within the urban boundaries of the GTA

These lands were designated and protected for a reason, actions which were supported by strong government commitments to protect the lands in perpetuity. Removing protection for the purposes of homebuilding, when the government's task force on housing and other experts have already proven that lack of land is not the factor limiting housing development, is not sound policy. It undermines public trust in the government and the status of protected areas everywhere. Affordable housing should be achieved, but within the context of other goals, including the goal to protect 30 percent of our province's land mass by 2030, which this proposal undermines. I am concerned about the integrity of areas near my home, such as the Niagara Escarpment, which is protected by similar legislation. This is a proposal that the government has introduced alongside other environmentally devastating legislation, namely Bill 23. The cumulative impacts of these legislative changes on our land, water and climate change resiliency must be considered.

74838,/comment/74838,"We are strongly opposed to the Ontario Government’s proposal to remove 7,400 acres of land from the Greenbelt.  The rationale for this removal of land and the changing of the boundaries is unsound and detrimental to farmland & ecosystems.  We urge you not to proceed with these changes for the reasons outlined below.
1.	The amount of land already zoned and ready for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries far exceeds what is needed to meet long rage housing targets.  The government should not be misleading the public with false claims that Greenbelt lands are needed to solve the housing crisis.
2.	The proposed removal of Greenbelt lands sets a dangerous precedent, opening Greenbelt protected lands to development at the request of those who stand to reap large profits.  The proposed removal is contrary to the vision of the Greenbelt Plan which emphasizes permanent protection against loss and fragmentation of agricultural land as well as giving permanent protection to the natural heritage and water resource systems that sustain ecological & human health.  Furthermore the Greenbelt provides for a range of economic and social activities associated with rural communities, agriculture, tourism, recreation and resource uses.  The protected land in the Greenbelt also serves to build resilience to and mitigates climate change, much needed services as natural disasters increase.  The protected Greenbelt is vital to our local food systems, to the protection of at-risk habitats and species and to the maintenance of the physical, social and economic health of 9 million people who live in the Greater Golden Horseshoe.
3.	The proposed land removals will negatively impact the Natural Heritage System. Most of the lands proposed to be removed from the Greenbelt overlap with the Natural Heritage System.  The Natural Heritage System is vital to the ecological integrity of the Greenbelt and includes the highest concentration of the most sensitive and/or significant natural features and functions.  These areas must be maintained and managed as a connected and integrated natural heritage system, given the functional inter-relationships between them.
4.	The government’s offer to add 9,400 acres to the Greenbelt is not acceptable.  This land swap would establish an unacceptable precedent that would completely undermine the long-term protection of Greenbelt lands, offering an open invitation to developers and land speculators.  Furthermore, the land swap would not compensate for the damage done.  It would violate the fundamental and widely accepted premise that ecological offsetting should only occur as a last resort.  Clearly, there are other options in this case:  other lands are available!  Also, some lands being proposed such as municipal plans for parks, recreation, etc., are already off limits to developers.  Furthermore, some of the lands being proposed were already announced in 2021 and 2022 as part of previous Greenbelt expansion proposals.  The government needs to honour commitments that are already made to earn the trust of people and to do what is right for Ontario’s natural environment.
5.	The broken promises of Premier Ford and Minister Clark are very disappointing.  On more than one occasion both of these leaders stated that the Green belt would not be touched.  Why are promises being broken?  There is no need for this action to be taken and there is much to lose by disrupting the Greenbelt.  We expect the government to honour its commitments.
Summary:  The Greenbelt was created almost 20 years ago to help ensure natural and prime agricultural lands are permanently protected from sprawl development.  Today, more than ever, we need an intact and resilient Greenbelt.  Not only are we facing the interconnected and accelerating crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, we also are losing 319 acres of farmland daily.  With so much growth happening, steps need to be taken to protect the lands and waters that sustain us.  The protection of natural and hydrological systems and farmland must be prioritized.  They are finite, irreplaceable and invaluable in terms of community and ecosystem health and resilience.  For the welfare of current and future generations, we urge you not to proceed with plans to open up and remove 7,400 acres of protected lands from the Greenbelt.

Development charges are determined by strict guidelines on what a municipality requires for infrastructure and services.   By shifting the burden to the taxpayer you will be forcing people who do have homes out of them as they can no longer afford the taxes.  This additional tax burden is in addition to the increasing costs of living, home ownership and interest rates.
We had to sell our home as we could no longer afford the high realty taxes.
Existing infrastructure such as roads etc. should be examined - can they support the development?  This needs to be addressed first.

What are the concrete actions that will be put in place to realize attainable ownership? How will you guarantee that the housing being built will support first-time buyers rather than inflate the market of secondary / temporary residences? Without addressing rental market inflation and property as investment, housing costs continue to make quality of life unattainable. Particularly as minimum wage and yearly salary raises are not keeping up with inflation and costs of living for the majority of people. If you're guaranteeing mixed dwelling, what are you doing to ensure that rental and buying rates remain accessible to ensure quality of life for people who have been left out of home ownership?
Housing needs to house people who don't have a home. Stop building homes as investment properties -- this does a disservice to the land and ecosystems that are unsettled in the process of housing people. If you do nothing to safeguard new homes being bought for resale or rental, the people who you could have made a difference in the lives of will continue to be marginalized.  This is an opportunity for more people to flourish and thrive.

75032,/comment/75032,"The More Hones, Built Faster Act intends to expand land resources for housing development into the long protected “Greenbelt” surrounding the GTA.  This need for more land is not borne out by reality.  All municipalities within the GTA have vacant land zoned for housing, often with secondary plans in place and infrastructure available.  Yet the developers have held off building on these lands  in hopes that inflation, greater demand and lower interest rates will increase their profitability.  In Port Hope, for instance, we have had over 100 acres of land zoned for residential development since 1998, yet it has not been built upon in over 20 years.  Land freed up by expanding into the Greenbelt is not needed.
New development requires infrastructure such as roads, sewers, water, transit and other community services.  Meanwhile, there are huge areas of our municipalities already serviced.  Large parking lots, one-storey malls and under utilized industrial lands, all areas where community infrastructure is already in place, could be used for housing.  Abandoned industrial sites and buildings can be redeveloped into residences rather than be demolished.  This is also a sound green strategy since “the greenest building is the one that is already built.”  Financial incentives, such as grants for.clean-up costs or re-development incentives could make these properties into valuable community assets rather than eyesores.
In short, there seems to be no justification for opening up protected Greenbelt areas when there is already an abundance of readily buildable land within our communities.

more affordable homes and rental units in the province;
however
It is vital for our future that it does so in an environmentally sustainable way
not only in terms of construction methods but very importantly in terms of where
these units are built.. More urban sprawl is not necessary.
By allowing the sprawl of the GTA and GGH in the 15 areas currently under
consideration, it would appear there is a fundamental lack of understanding
by the government about the role of the Greenbelt.
The Greenbelt serves as a carbon sink for the urban areas around Lake Ontario.
It helps to mitigate the poor air quality generated by these already large urban areas.
It helps to provide clean water as well as control run-off and flooding.
It offers a cooling effect to the increasingly high temperatures brought on my climate
change.
It provides habitat for a wide variety of plant, animal and insect species all of which
are essential to preserving a healthy productive environment upon which we people
rely.
The plan suggests adding one large chunk of approx. 9400 acres to  the northwest in Wellington
County to make up for the loss of the 15 areas. There are at least two problems with this.
1. The Greenbelt cannot effectively deal with the environmental problems of an urban area
that keeps increasing in size.  Moving the greenbelt further out while allowing more urban
development does solve these problems, It only worsens them.
2. Replacing 15 areas of a diverse nature with one unit of largely uniform terrain is not
an effective trade-off. This area will not replace the loss of wetlands, and varied habitats

The plan might be better framed if it used the on-the-ground knowledge and expertise of
 municipalities around and within the greenbelt.

75306,/comment/75306,"Developing the Greenbelt is not an acceptable course of action to meet housing demands. The Greenbelt is needed to support feeding the influx of people as well as to mitigate the potential risks to the GTA and surrounding communities associated with climate change. The Greenbelt features prime agricultural land that does not exist elsewhere in the province. We are already losing prime agricultural land daily. With the cost of living soaring, I do not wish to pay to import food that we have been growing ourselves for centuries. The more the land is developed, the more the control over our food production is lost. A line needs to be drawn and to remain. The protection of the Greenbelt cannot be eroded.
The Greenbelt is the headwaters of the GTA. Any further development puts the health of our natural ecosystems that supports our access to safe, clean water at risk. It also provides a carbon sink providing economic, environmental, and health benefits to surrounding communities.I believe the economic value of the greenbelt as a carbon sink has been found to equate approximately $10.7 billion per year. On the brink of global climate disaster, I do not understand how development of this protective resource can be justified.
The Greenbelt has been preserved thus far for many reasons well supported by evidence. If we divide it up and give it away to developers it can no longer serve us the way we need it to. To develop any of this land has been proven to be detrimental on many levels. It simply cannot be defended.
Once the land is developed, it will be up to the taxpayer to maintain it. This will not achieve the intended goal of adding affordable housing. What it will do is raise the cost of living for all of us. Finally, if not most importantly, the reason for developing the Greenbelt is a lie. To quote Ontario Nature, ""As you know, in its 2022 report, Ontario's Housing Affordability Task Force stated that a shortage of land isn't the cause of Ontario's housing problem and that Greenbelts, environmentally sensitive areas and farmland must be protected.""
I completely object to the development plans and actions regarding the Greenbelt. I believe the environmental concerns warrant more accountability from the current government to its citizens. There is a need for sustainable, long term planning that addresses how we might safeguard our communities from advancing climate change and food and water crises rather than rushed, mismanaged, and destructive growth.

The proposal claims that the lands removed will be ""replaced"" by adding land to the Greenbelt.  However, much of the land that will supposedly be added is already protected.  And, even if it weren’t already protected, the very possibility of ""swapping out"" the plots of land targeted for development destroys the permanence and certainty required for any part of the Greenbelt to function properly.
By permanently setting aside land for farming and natural heritage, the Greenbelt protects land from the intense speculation and development pressure in Southern Ontario. Without this permanent protection, agricultural land would quickly become completely unaffordable to farmers. Even raising the possibility of removing any land from the Greenbelt will create a speculative rush and intense development pressure on all the lands currently within the Greenbelt.
Currently, there is a vast supply of unused greenfield land already open for development within existing municipal boundaries (350 square kilometers as of 2019) and the current round of Official Plans awaiting approval will add 42,000 additional hectares of non-Greenbelt land to that vast stockpile.
Given that we have an extreme shortage of homes in existing neighborhoods, and a long term shortage of materials, equipment and skilled labour, squandering our resources on resource -intensive Greenbelt sprawl will mean fewer homes in the places where they're desperately needed.
Not only is this proposal bad for the health of our province and unlikely to produce any additional housing, it goes against the Premier’s word and it goes against Minister Steve Clarke’s assertion that “we’re not going to entertain any conversations about a land swap” on the Greenbelt.
In addition to my concerns about the Greenbelt, I am deeply concerned about many of the components of Bill 23 and its associated policy proposals.
Bill 23 prohibits Conservation Authorities from doing anything to prevent sprawl from causing flooding and erosion – or destroying ecology. It would leave vast swathes of Ontario’s most important habitats largely unprotected – and put Ontarians at real risk.
Proposed policy to allow “pay to slay” destruction of currently protected wetlands and woodlands, and changes to the rules that are used to identify wetlands, will cause the majority of these rare and ecologically crucial areas to be opened to development.
This Bill’s attack on regional planning is counterproductive for creating affordable homes – as well as being environmentally disastrous.  Devolving planning decisions to lower-tier municipalities would produce development that is more scattered and thus much more environmentally harmful, but also more uncoordinated and expensive.
The recently passed bill also attacks Green Buildings. This bill will take the authority to require green buildings from municipalities – undoing many municipal Green Building standards that have already been developed – and undermine the affordability benefits that energy-efficient, climate-resilient buildings provide to owners and tenants.
Bill 23 will further the destruction of critical natural areas in a time of climate crisis while also failing to deliver the urban transformation – or the affordable housing – that Ontario needs.
In conclusion, please desist from removing any lands from the Greenbelt – even if they are replaced by other lands in other areas– and repeal Bill 23.

75483,/comment/75483,"Carving up the Greenbelt is not a Solution to Provide Affordable Housing to Ontarians
I am writing to express my strong opposition to the plans within Bill 23 to destroy large sections of the Greenbelt in exchange for other land.
The purpose of a Greenbelt is to provide access to greenspace to citizens and to constrain inefficient growth while also providing ecological services to the population. The extraction of almost 7500 acres from the Greenbelt in ""exchange"" for other land area is a theft from the citizens of the province and a unjustifiable gift to homebuilders that will in no way solve the affordability and access problems associated with the unsustainable, federally mandated immigration targets.
The exchange of these Greenbelt lands damages the integrity of the Greenbelt as a connected ecological area and undermines its ability to provide ecological services to the population, meaning that those services such as water filtration and flood mitigation will have to be paid for through manmade infrastructure thus costing taxpayers twice. At the same time, building on the Greenbelt areas creates high cost and low tax revenue areas that will have to receive subsidized services by those in the urban areas, especially given the loss of development charges imposed by other aspects of Bill 23. The construction done there will also not provide affordable housing near the urban centers where it is needed, it is merely providing access to high value property for low density house builders. The whole idea that that building on the Greenbelt can in any way increase the number of housing units is a falsehood being pushed to the population of Ontario.
Further to the immediate damage done to the Greenbelt, allowing its borders to be changed at all will invite land speculation and further lobbying by the low density house builders that will then create further destruction of the Greenbelt, hastening its breakdown all the while continuing to cost urban taxpayers more and more, while failing to deliver affordable housing units where they are required.
I encourage this government to serve the population of the province by providing lower cost, high density housing units near urban centers instead of opening the Greenbelt to builders promoting low density units that actually increase the costs to taxpayers. This bill and the provisions around damaging the Greenbelt only serves the low density house building industry.

Promises by the government to “swap” in 9,400 acres of land in other locations will do nothing to mitigate the damage to the Greenbelt system. That is in part because at least some areas being floated as replacements for bulldozed segments of the Greenbelt were already off limits for development – meaning those additions would not mitigate the net loss of protected lands. Even more importantly, the government’s plans would utterly destroy the certainty of permanent protection that is vital to the functioning of the Greenbelt as a whole.
Stripping these 7,400 acres of protection at the request of land speculators would unleash a firestorm of land speculation across the entire Greenbelt – denying farmers the certainty they need to continue stewarding the forests, wetlands and soils on their land, and pushing ownership forever out of reach. It will also start a never-ending queue of Greenbelt land speculators at the Minister’s door, each with their own convenient rationalization for paving their own patch of Greenbelt.
The government’s attempt to rationalize this attack on the Greenbelt as a measure to deliver “more homes” is disingenuous. There is such a vast supply of unused “greenfield” land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries (350 square kilometers as of 2019), that opening up Greenbelt lands will not deliver a single net new home. The latest round of boundary expansions would – if approved – add 17,000 hectares more of non-Greenbelt land to that vast stockpile. Far from boosting the number of new homes, because of a constrained supply of skilled labour, materials and equipment, it is likely this plan would result in fewer homes being delivered within the next decade.
According to Bilal Akhtar, a prominent volunteer organizer with More Neighbours Toronto:
“This proposal would be a disaster for housing supply. Slashing open the Greenbelt, combined with Bill 23’s extreme watering down of promised measures to facilitate more homes in existing low-rise “single detached” neighborhoods, will mean LESS housing supply in the places where it is desperately needed – not more. The last thing we need is to squander labour, materials, and equipment that we need to add compact family homes in existing built up areas and settlement areas – and especially in Toronto– on greenfield sprawl in northern York Region and Pickering.”
Removing land from the Greenbelt, taken together with the Ontario government’s Bill 23 attack on Conservation Authorities, the Growth Plan, the Planning Act, the Endangered Species Act and other important legislation, dismantles decades of slow progress toward protecting Ontario’s environment and creating more sustainable communities. These actions together repudiate the important and historic work of many previous governments, including those of Bill Davis and Mike Harris.

1.1 Context (from The Greenbelt Plan)
The Greenbelt Plan, together with the ORMCP and the NEP, identifies where urbanization should not occur in order to provide permanent protection to the agricultural land base and the ecological and hydrological features, areas and functions occurring on this landscape.
While providing permanent agricultural and environmental protection, the Greenbelt also contains important natural resources and supports a wide range of recreational and tourism uses, areas and opportunities together with a vibrant and evolving agricultural and rural economy.
1.2.1 Vision
The Greenbelt is a broad band of permanently protected land which:
•	protects against the loss and fragmentation of the agricultural land base and supports agriculture as the predominant land use
•	gives permanent protection to the natural heritage and water resource systems that sustain ecological and human health and that form the environmental framework around which major urbanization in south-central Ontario will be organized
•	provides for a diverse range of economic and social activities associated with rural communities, agriculture, tourism, recreation and resource uses
•	builds resilience to and mitigates climate change

CLEARLY these lands were designated to be PERMANENTLY part of the Greenbelt!
We say NO to using ANY of the Greenbelt for new housing.  Please listen to the people of Ontario and your constituents!
Respectfully,

Bill 23 is a direct abuse of political power. It eradicates Ontarian's right to Democracy.
It is abundantly clear that the majority of Ontarian’s DO NOT agree with Bill 23.
It is clear that it will ‘pave the way’ to destroying the environment and the species within, many that are identified as Species at Risk’.
It is pathetic to think the only way a Bill that has this degree of a negative impact on Nature could only be presented and passed by using ‘bully’ tactics.
This is a clear abuse of political power. The transparency of the motivation of the presenting and passing Bill 23 is a sad state of affairs. It is obviously a money grab to line the pockets of those that the Ford administration is indebted to.
The Environment, the Greenbelt does not belong to the Ford administration. It’s clear exploitation is NOT acceptable in any way, shape or form.
As far as re establishing a wetland at a new location research has proven that it does not work as it does not maintain the integrity of the original that will be permanently lost.
Wetlands ARE NOT WASTELANDS to be developed.
They play an essential role in the control of waters both in the times of flood and drought.
Is the passing of Bill  23 going to prove to be a giant ‘I told you so’?
Wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems in the planet.
They sequester carbon, filter freshwater sources. Only 2% of the worlds water is a freshwater source. 20% of that is found in Canada with most of it in Ontario. Half of the worlds population has migrated to find freshwater sources over the past number of years.  3 provinces in Canada had freshwater shortage issues last year and previous years as well.
Wetlands are our freshwater reservoirs.
The turtle populations in those wetlands are already identified as Species at Risk. They are the ‘janitors’ of the wetlands keeping our freshwater sources free from bacteria because of the vast amounts of carrion and decaying vegetation the turtles consume.
The essential truth about the turtle populations is that they CANNOT be relocated with any measure is success. That is a sure ticket to their demise.
So what will happen to the turtle populations located in those areas to be developed? How can the eradication of a species already identified as ‘at risk’ be annihilated without recourse ?
Why is it that Bill 23 is based on deceit and misrepresentations?
Where are the principals of integrity and ethics in this process ?
Words cannot impart the insanity of this legislation.
There is no integrity or accountability in the passing of this Bill. Why is there such a lack of creativity, ethics and imagination in this legislation. The transparency of this ‘money grab’ is embarrassing in its immaturity.

2. Prevent heat sinks in cities.
3. Ameliorate strong winds.
4. Excellent nature escapes beyond Mr. Ford's imagination.
5. If it's gone there's no turning back.
6. Wild life diversity.
7. Less animals coming to your house and staying in their home (the forest)
Global effects.
1. Sinks CO2
2. Slow down global warming.
3. Produce oxygen for breathing living beings (we learned that in grade 3)
4. Take out pollutants.
Please stop 🛑 this irreversible damage. Leave something to cherish for our kids.
Thanks,
Sam of Mississauga

75672,/comment/75672,"As a citizen of the beautiful province of Ontario, I strongly oppose the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation under the omnibus Bill C-23 (the housing bill), on the grounds of the effects of these changes as well as the underlying rationale. Regarding the rationale, the argument that the housing crisis and potential population increases in the province necessitates ""building more houses faster"" is a spurious one. If the provincial government was serious about housing, it would be taking steps to protect existing housing, including rental units and non-profits within cities and towns, as well as medium level density housing such as low rise apartment buildings, flats and multi-unit houses, and would be assisting local governments in planning for the same. Instead, the province has used MZOs to push through big development projects (large condo buildings) which displace people from their homes and communities as these become less affordable. Even without the use of MZO's, what has the province done to reign in the speculators and big corporate buyers who are taking housing out of the hands of ordinary people? Bill C 23, in the name of ""more housing,"" actually undermines the ability of municipalities and regional authorities to protect housing, and does not address the root of the problem. The province's own housing task force has made it clear that the lack of access to housing has nothing to do with lack of land - in other words, the solution is not to take up more land for urban sprawl, but to encourage ""gentle density"" within towns and cities, including by helping municipalities update their infrastructure capacities. Instead, the province is removing important funds from cities (developer fees), reducing their ability to properly plan and regulate development (for example, by mandating green spaces, heritage protections, affordable housing and protections for existing tenants), thus further enabling the process of displacement.
The land sprawl agenda this government is so determined to pursue not only does not address the roots of the housing crisis (speculation, corporate ownership, displacement of existing affordable and medium density housing), but it will add to the ecological nightmare already at play. It is well known that wetlands play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as filtering and cleaning our waterways (that we humans depend on, too!) and reducing the intensity and effects of flooding. Forests are crucial in mitigating the effects of climate change (heat waves, droughts, carbon emissions) as well as helping to protect farmland (from soil erosion and wind damage as well as those droughts, heat waves and flooding). Small farms in Ontario are an essential source of food for us all and livelihood for farmers. It is unbelievable, after going through the supply chain blockages and other crises experienced during the COVID pandemic, that our government would allow this source of local food to be destroyed. Apparently the short-term profits of a small number of big developers outweighs the value of our local farmlands, our wetlands, our forests and our ravines in the minds of the provincial government.
The government is supposed to act in the public interest, and out of concern for the public good. Part of that public good is the protection of the environment we all depend on and love. This bill, which further undermines the mandate of local Conservation Authorities, and interferes with the Growth Plan, the Planning Act, the Endangered Species Act and other important legislation, dismantles decades of slow progress toward protecting Ontario’s environment and creating more sustainable communities. In fact, by dismantling this legislative and regulatory framework, Bill C 23 will reverse the modest progress that has been made, as it will open the door for more speculators to request that greenbelt lands be sold off piecemeal for their private benefit in the years to come. This is a truly shameful piece of legislation that must be repealed.

What this bill will do is destroy the sacredness of our Greenbelt and open it up for land speculators and developers to make more profit.  Once it’s gone, it’s gone.

75682,/comment/75682,"Premier Doug Ford; Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing
I’m writing to you today in support of the Greenbelt, Conservation Authorities and Ontario’s wetlands, woodlands and other natural areas.
Firstly, I am writing to state my opposition to the proposal to remove 7,400 acres of land from the Greenbelt, which was revealed on November 04.
The proposal claims that the lands removed will be ""replaced"" by adding land to the Greenbelt.  However, much of the land that will supposedly be added is already protected.  And, even if it weren’t already protected, the very possibility of ""swapping out"" the plots of land targeted for development destroys the permanence and certainty required for any part of the Greenbelt to function properly.
By permanently setting aside land for farming and natural heritage, the Greenbelt protects land from the intense speculation and development pressure in Southern Ontario. Without this permanent protection, agricultural land would quickly become completely unaffordable to farmers. Even raising the possibility of removing any land from the Greenbelt will create a speculative rush and intense development pressure on all the lands currently within the Greenbelt.
Currently, there is a vast supply of unused greenfield land already open for development within existing municipal boundaries (350 square kilometers as of 2019) and the current round of Official Plans awaiting approval will add 42,000 additional hectares of non-Greenbelt land to that vast stockpile.
Given that we have an extreme shortage of homes in existing neighborhoods, and a long term shortage of materials, equipment and skilled labour, squandering our resources on resource -intensive Greenbelt sprawl will mean fewer homes in the places where they're desperately needed.
Not only is this proposal bad for the health of our province and unlikely to produce any additional housing, it goes against the Premier’s word and it goes against Minister Steve Clarke’s assertion that “we’re not going to entertain any conversations about a land swap” on the Greenbelt.
In addition to my concerns about the Greenbelt, I am deeply concerned about many of the components of Bill 23 and its associated policy proposals.
Bill 23 prohibits Conservation Authorities from doing anything to prevent sprawl from causing flooding and erosion – or destroying ecology. It would leave vast swathes of Ontario’s most important habitats largely unprotected – and put Ontarians at real risk.
Proposed policy to allow “pay to slay” destruction of currently protected wetlands and woodlands, and changes to the rules that are used to identify wetlands, will cause the majority of these rare and ecologically crucial areas to be opened to development.
This Bill’s attack on regional planning is counterproductive for creating affordable homes – as well as being environmentally disastrous.  Devolving planning decisions to lower-tier municipalities would produce development that is more scattered and thus much more environmentally harmful, but also more uncoordinated and expensive.
The draft bill also attacks Green Buildings. This bill will take the authority to require green buildings from municipalities – undoing many municipal Green Building standards that have already been developed – and undermine the affordability benefits that energy-efficient, climate-resilient buildings provide to owners and tenants.
Unless the major flaws in Bill 23 are addressed it will further the destruction of critical natural areas in a time of climate crisis while also failing to deliver the urban transformation – or the affordable housing – that Ontario needs.
In conclusion, please desist from removing any lands from the Greenbelt – even if they are replaced by other lands in other areas– and revise or cancel Bill 23.
Sincerely,
Concerned Ontarian

There are lots of other ways to build affordable housing  inside our cities without compromising conservation lands that protect our Humber River area from flooding, protects woodlands, wetlands and wildlife habitat and cancels green building standards.
Promises by the government to “swap” in 9,400 acres of land in other locations will do nothing to mitigate the damage to the Greenbelt system. That is in part because at least some areas being floated as replacements for bulldozed segments of the Greenbelt were already off limits for development – meaning those additions would not mitigate the net loss of protected lands. Even more importantly, the government’s plans would utterly destroy the certainty of permanent protection that is vital to the functioning of the Greenbelt as a whole.

It's also creating massive sprawl and more dependency on car use -- additional negative effects on environmental efforts.
This change, allegedly for housing. It seems so odd when there's a very simple thing that the provincial government could to do rapidly and seamlessly boost the opportunity for housing: end exclusionary zoning province wide. A simply change to the law. That's it. Easy.

75744,/comment/75744,"NEED: MORE RESPONSIBILITIES ON DEVELOPER, BETTER IDEAS TO POSITIVELY IMPACT MORE
I am a former Realtor with a distinguished brand, and some knowledge  of the  development process. I am compelled to write, with grave concerns over many of the decisions being made at this time. When I read the ero document,  I am most concerned to see that the Developers/Builders have ALL the rights, and NO responsibilities and little regard for so many current topical issues.  This is a recipe for disaster.
1) There appear to be no checks and balances in place for ensuring a positive impact on anyone, except for the developers. No Public Meetings?  Re-zoning unnecessary? How offensive this must be to our formally-educated Planners and Associated professional fields.
b) Removing  all Development costs?  Why? Will  there be Environmental Studies done? Is so, for free?
     Money need not delay the building process. Find a workable solution. For example, the developers can pay fees retroactively at completion,  when the homes/lots are sold. But in no manner, should taxpayers be financially responsible for this.
Builders currently can sell a product (lot) to the customer that they don't even own yet, unbeknownst to the buyer, so money is already in their pockets before they build.
c) It is also time that Realtors are required to represent the Buyer, instead of only the HomeBuilder representing the buyer, while protecting their interests. We now discourage ""double-ending in resale homes thankfully, and understandably so; so it is time that Buyer agents, separate from the Builder/Seller, be legally required to legally represent the consumer in new home sales. Especially since  the quality  of the overall process is certain to be less than adequate  amidst the volume of construction.
2) a) Everyone is acutely aware that this Greenbelt proposal was not necessary in order  to build homes quickly. The brazen disregard for the well-being of the  environment AND current homeowners/taxpayers is absolutely gutting.  It is not, in any manner, going to raise the sinking morale of our citizens , nor increase a sense of well-being and financial security during this economically recessive period of time.
b) When we look closer at who is adversely impacted currently, it is our younger  first time home-buyers, priced out of the market. What policies have been put in place to protect them when the building is  complete?  Building expensive homes with wide margins is not going to serve them well, or at all. Nor is it going to serve anyone else. Have maximum prices/margins been put in place to rein in home-builders intentions and motivations?
3) We need to curb sprawl now; and in fact, research shows that densification is a lot cheaper than just going full-bore in sprawl - that the central core of Toronto, for example, is paying the load for the rich suburbs. Planners are necessary, as developers will take every shortcut imaginable. This is not a secret. Just talk to planners, architects and anyone involved in Development projects. It is always the same story. They want more for less. Cut corners. Unimaginative builds  that pad their bottom line.
4) What is needed to be put in place, is a lot more than just returning un-used land.  We need to address multiple issues at the same time.  Of course the land trade LOOKED good. River valleys can't be utilized, anyway.  Developers need to be accountable to the province and taxpayers.  If we are building homes, what size? Are they green? Will they even be affordable?  We need small homes, sum zero homes, multi-units with appropriate community parks and Green-space.
What type of quality control will be in place while they slap up homes?. Will there still be Building   Inspectors and warranties? Will we keep the same standards or bend those too? How far is the removal of quality control going?  Who is paying for the additional  costs like school builds? Will there be requisite bike lanes since the development will be new and so room for it will be available and not need to be annexed later?
Any developer that builds a home larger than say, 2000SF (whatever is determined to be sensible by PLANNERS) should require a tariff to be paid by them. The bigger the house, the steeper the tariff. Simple. Or for every x number of homes built, a SOCIAL HOUSING PROJECT to address homelessness must be built simultaneously. Assist the province's  greater needs, not just the greed of a few. Try to be efficient in addressing two or more  of our large issues with one solution.
Let's protect the most vulnerable among us and stop eating our young. We all know that unaffordable housing and homelessness is growing, and along with that, addiction and suicide - let's address it here and now with this proposal. The perfect time to do it is now, where it can be folded into the plans. Don't we all think that we should have been forward thinking when we put in the current infrastructure of roads, etc?
5) Why are we building on green-space instead of incentivizing redevelopment of the central core of places like Hamilton for example? Our city cores in many places need to be rejuvenated with better/newer projects and retrofitting the many diminishing  unnecessary retail/church buildings etc.
For example,  there are many single level properties along Yonge Street in Toronto that might be incentivized to build/replace with more levels/mid-rises etc.  Bring the money downtown to improve and revitalize our urban areas.  Kitchener is a great example of a city core that is turning around due to development. Places like Hamilton's core are crumbling because people's money and morale is crumbling.  Let the zoning/bylaws/policies be lightened up there to advance progress/growth and utilize what we already have there. Put money in the hands of the cities and municipalities to create housing where they need it most. This, in turn, will redistribute money to the significant amount of small-sized,  construction companies/owners who could also benefit.
7)  In this shifting era of remote working, why are we not using less valuable land and spreading the wealth of development to areas that need the economic boost, such as North Bay? There we have under-utilized, recently built highways that are ready for major development.  The highway congestion and  increasing lack of safety  due to vehicle volume, and lack of  commuter trains is only going to adversely impact the mental health of those needing to use these over-worked highways, with slow infrastructure improvements.  How will this be addressed without further asking for more taxpayer money to pay for the further expansion of the 401, 403 etc?
8) a) Employee shortages: WHO is going to be  building these 1.5M homes quickly? Have Colleges been given funding for more educating of trades? Have we created processes to hire all of the displaced Ukrainians who are increasingly showing up and needing work that is at least a living wage?  Have we made the process easy for young people or  other immigrants to gain training instead of  naturally yet unnecessarily, over-burdening our under-funded social services sector ? Perhaps  builders/developers should be required to  employ a defined  number of apprentices, as one of their civic responsibilities in this  overall proposal.
b) And with the limited trades we currently have, the typical homeowner who needs a tradesperson is going to compete with the  now voracious developers----driving the price up for everyone?  It appears that the larger context has not been considered. The ripple effect of this  hasty proposal is going to be  a horrendous legacy, economically, socially, morally, psychologically.
9)  This  dire need for more homes could have been such an incredible OPPORTUNITY to  gain the trust of the citizens by ensuring that  the majority  of already strained homeowners are assisted, not  just the wealthy few.
a)The government could have incentivized current homeowners to build extra units in their homes, or at the rear of their properties, by reducing the  bureaucracy and costs and offering  municipal guidance to ensure compliance.
b) Homeowner-friendly policies could have been created by investigating and enabling condominiums/ strata policies in large homes, like seen in Victoria, BC. A large home divided into 2+ legal entities etc. could allow younger people to get into the market while cooling it down with supply; instead low supply and aggressive interest rates to make it more difficult?
c) Time could be spent discussing with architects and planners some ingenious/effective ways to move forward quickly. Imaginative, resourceful  and informed ways to improve what we already have and put the money in the typical homeowners' shrinking pockets.
d) Such a potentially missed opportunity to benefit many and allow Ontario residents to be partners in the process and grow along and contribute to the need and benefit economically; well beyond the borders of the GTA and well beyond the wallets of Developers......Corruption - something I never thought I would  use to describe our Ontario Leadership.  But it's here. This is not the Ontario I grew up in. We need to DO better, BE better.
10) TRANSPARENCY & DUE PROCESS: It is saddening  how little our current Provincial Government  shares information with its citizens. Thankfully, I found out about this consultation because I am retired and had time to write to an MPP. Most people are too busy trying to put food on the table to even read a paper or ask questions. How few people really know the implications of the Bill. The lack of straight forward discussion/presentation of the facts of the Bill by our Premier, and the swiftness in order to pass it, demonstrates such a  clear lack of regard for its citizens.  It's even sad that early December  is the cutoff for comments  here. In such a short time, people can barely have time to form their thoughts on san issue that is so hugely impactful on them.
However, in summary, it is my hope that the above concerns will  be addressed here in these consultations. Massive changes are needed now, before the damage is done and can't be reversed. A wide-angle lense on the impact of the broader society and the future implications for years to come is necessary for informing  future decisions.
May you all use your wisdom and discernment in  your decision-making in the upcoming weeks to try and reshape this proposal  into an intelligent, thoughtful plan where everyone can win.
Thank you for this opportunity to share my opinions and I hope they are thoughtfully considered.

Dear Minister Clark,
Re: ERO 019-6216 Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan; ERO 019-6217 Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation
We, the 78 undersigned organizations, are strongly opposed to the Ontario Government’s proposal to remove 7,400 acres of land from the Greenbelt. Opening these lands to development would destroy vital wildlife corridors, negatively impact woodlands, wetlands and watercourses, and result in the loss of over 5,000 acres of farmland. The government’s rationale – that these lands are needed for housing – is unfounded and untrue. We urge you not to proceed with this proposal for the reasons outlined below.
1. Abundance of land already available for housing
The amount of greenfield land already designated for development and added to municipal settlement boundaries, but still sitting unbuilt far exceeds what is needed to meet long range housing targets. That includes 86,500 acres within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area alone. According to Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force, “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem.”
Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts … Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture. (Housing Affordability Task Force, 2022, p.10)
The government should not be misleading the public with false claims that Greenbelt lands are needed to solve the housing crisis.
2. Harmful precedent and loss of permanent protection
The proposed removal of Greenbelt lands sets an alarming precedent, opening Greenbelt protected lands to development at the request of those who stand to reap immense profits. Stripping these 7,400 acres of protection would unleash a firestorm of land speculation and development pressures across the entire Greenbelt.
The proposed removal is contrary to the vision of the Greenbelt Plan which emphasizes permanent protection:
The Greenbelt is a broad band of permanently protected land which:
• Protects against the loss and fragmentation of the agricultural land base and supports agriculture as the predominant land use;
• Gives permanent protection to the natural heritage and water resource systems that sustain ecological and human health and that form the environmental framework around which major urbanization in southcentral Ontario will be organized;
• Provides for a diverse range of economic and social activities associated with rural communities, agriculture, tourism, recreation and resource uses; and
• Builds resilience to and mitigates climate change. (Greenbelt Plan, 2017, (1.2.1))
The importance of permanently protecting lands and waters within the Greenbelt cannot be overstated. It is key to building the resilience of local food systems, protecting at-risk habitats and species, and sustaining the physical, social and economic health of the nine million Ontarians living in the Greater Golden Horseshoe. Healthy ecosystems are the foundation of human prosperity and will become increasingly important for building climate resilience and providing refuge for rare and endangered plants and animals.
3. Negative impacts on the Natural Heritage System
The proposed land removals will negatively impact the Natural Heritage System. Most of the lands proposed to be removed from the Greenbelt (10 of the 14 areas shown on the maps) overlap with the Natural Heritage System. As explained in the Greenbelt Plan, 2017 (3.2.1), the Natural Heritage System “provides a continuous and permanent land base necessary to support human and ecological health in the Greenbelt and beyond.” It is vital to the ecological integrity of the Greenbelt and includes “the highest concentration of the most sensitive and/or significant natural features and functions.” These areas are to be “managed as a connected and integrated natural heritage system, given the functional inter-relationships between them.” Clearly, the proposal to remove lands from the Greenbelt’s Natural Heritage System contravenes the intent of the Greenbelt Plan to protect natural heritage.
Most of the land to be removed is in one area located on highly sensitive and ecologically important lands in the City of Pickering. This triangle of land at its widest point extends east-west for five kilometres between the Rouge River and Duffins Creek watersheds, and stretches south to north for 7.8 kilometres from just north of Finch Avenue to Highway 407. It supports thousands of acres of largely prime farmland, numerous valleys, woodlands, wetlands and the entire critical headwater reaches of Petticoat Creek. These lands have major provincially designated wildlife corridors designed to provide east-west connections between the Rouge, Petticoat and Duffin Creek watersheds and north-south connections along the river valleys that connect Lake Ontario to the major east-west corridor of the Oak Ridges Moraine. The southern portion of this area also supports a highly sensitive band of wetlands and woodlands that is a recharge and discharge area on the former sandy beach of Glacial Lake Iroquois, a large version of today's Lake Ontario.
Other important areas that would be adversely affected include:
•	A provincially designated wildlife corridor in King Township that provides a vital connection between the Holland Marsh and the Oak Ridges Moraine;

4. Land removals put the entire Greenbelt at risk
We do not support the government’s efforts to sugar-coat the bitter pill of removing land from the Greenbelt by offering to add 9,400 acres to the Greenbelt. First and most importantly, this land swap would set an unacceptable precedent that would completely undermine the long-term protection of Greenbelt lands. In essence, it would be an open invitation to developers and land speculators to seek special permission from decision-makers to pave over parts of the Greenbelt.
Second, the proposed land swap will not compensate for the damage done. It would violate the fundamental and widely accepted premise that ecological offsetting should only occur as a last resort, when there are no other options to avoid or mitigate the damage. Clearly that is not the case with the proposed land removals. The damage is entirely avoidable, given the many, many thousands of acres of land already zoned and ready for development within settlement boundaries in the Greater Golden Horseshoe. Further, some areas being proposed as replacement lands are already off limits for development (such as publicly owned lands designated in municipal official plans as parks, open space, recreation, conservation and/or environmental protection). Their addition would not in any way mitigate the net loss of protected lands.
Third, we take exception to the fact that the government is putting forward lands that were already part of previous Greenbelt expansion proposals – the Paris-Galt Moraine in 2021 and the Urban River Valleys in 2022. The government proposed these additions to the Greenbelt with great fanfare at the time, and yet has done nothing since to honour or respond to the thousands of Ontarians who supported and anticipated these expansions. To now tie this proposed expansion to soften the blow of removing lands from the Greenbelt is unacceptable.
5. Broken promises
The government has repeatedly stated that there would be no removal of lands from the Greenbelt. Premier Ford is quoted as saying in 2018, for example, “The people have spoken. I’m going to listen to them, they don’t want me to touch the Greenbelt, we won’t touch the Greenbelt.” He reiterated that promise in 2020, saying that his government would not “touch” or “build on” the Greenbelt, when facing criticism about the resignation of the chair and six members of Ontario’s Greenbelt Council. You, Minister Clark, made a similar commitment in February 2021 when you said, “I want to be clear: We will not in any way entertain any proposals that will move lands in the Greenbelt, or open the Greenbelt lands to any kind of development.”
Ontarians expect the government to honour its commitments.
Meaningful consultation with affected Indigenous Peoples
The government must meaningfully consult with affected Indigenous communities about the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan. The duty to consult is a constitutional obligation that arises from s.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which recognizes and affirms Indigenous and Treaty rights. Indigenous traditional practices, responsibilities and knowledge systems must be honoured by ensuring Indigenous voices are key to any discussions about removing lands from the Greenbelt.
Closing remarks
The Greenbelt was created almost 20 years ago to help ensure natural and prime agricultural lands are permanently protected from sprawl development. Today, an intact and resilient Greenbelt is needed more than ever. Not only are we are facing the interconnected and accelerating crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, we are also losing 319 acres of farmland daily. Given growth forecasts and the pace of development approvals in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, steps must be taken to protect the lands and waters that sustain us. The protection of natural and hydrological systems and farmland must be prioritized. They are finite, irreplaceable and invaluable in terms of community and ecosystem health and resilience. For the sake of current and future generations, we urge you not to proceed with plans to open up and remove 7,400 acres of protected lands from the Greenbelt.
Yours sincerely,

1 - ""Replacing"" the lands with other lands is a shell game. Some of the lands are already protected so designating them doesn't add anything and the rest is around a small town that wasn't consulted. It also makes a joke of the purpose of the greenbelt, which is to provide a belt of green around our most densely populated area
2 - Ford did NOT raise this possibility during the election campaign and when asked about the lands said he would not touch them. This is clearly a lie.  Or maybe his answer was couched to fit in with this action but regardless it was not truthful in intent.
3 - It is suspicious that developers have bought much of the land in this area - if it was truly supposed to stay a greenbelt why would they have bought ""undevelopable"" land? This raises many concerns of conflict of interest.
4 - the premise that this action will allow more affordable homes is laughable. So many reasons why this is unlikely to occur.
5 - Being such a huge omnibus bill, there are layers that should be supported that hide many that should not occur.  Break them into separate bills please.
6 - What is the hurry? There are  more years of this government. Take your time to truly identify the consequences. Again - this all suggests a very dangerous lack of transparency and creates great concern for the process this government will follow for the next 3 years.

75808,/comment/75808,"According to the Report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force, land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts. The report goes on to state that greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas MUST BE PROTECTED.
By permanently setting aside land for farming and natural heritage, the Greenbelt protects land from the intense speculation and development pressure in Southern Ontario. Without this permanent protection, agricultural land would quickly become completely unaffordable to farmers. Even raising the possibility of removing any land from the Greenbelt WILL CREATE A SPECULATIVE RUSH AND INTENSE DEVELOPMENT PRESSURE ON ALL THE LANDS CURRENTLY WITHIN THE GREENBELT.
Currently, there is a vast supply of unused greenfield land already open for development within existing municipal boundaries (350 square kilometers as of 2019) and the current round of Official Plans awaiting approval will add 42,000 additional hectares of non-Greenbelt land to that vast stockpile.
The proposal to amend the Greenbelt plan is bad for the health of our province and Ontarians. Amending the Greenbelt plan will further the destruction of critical natural areas in a time of climate crisis while also failing to deliver the urban transformation – or the affordable housing – that Ontario needs.

75840,/comment/75840,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the ""Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan"".
First, I would like to state that I am strongly opposed to the proposed amendments. The Greenbelt was created in 2005 in part to prevent the loss of farmland and natural heritage and restrict urban sprawl. The proposed amendments to the Greenbelt are contrary to this mandate and are an insult to years of conservation efforts.
I believe that selectively removing areas from the Greenbelt and using the housing affordability crisis as an excuse is pathetic. There are plenty of solutions to housing affordability in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) which include using existing undeveloped lands outside of the Greenbelt, building denser housing, and banning single family zoning in Ontario. Expanding urban/residential land in the GTA only furthers the ability for urban sprawl to continue in Ontario.
The lands protected by the Greenbelt should be protected forever. The proposed amendments to the Greenbelt should be declined in favour of protecting Ontario's farmland, forests, wetlands, rivers, and lakes.

RE: ERO 019-6217: Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation
10240 Pine Valley Drive, Vaughan
Dear Mr. Clark,
This submission is a response to ERO #019-6217, “Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulations (O. Reg 59/05)”, to propose additional modifications to “amend the Greenbelt Area boundary” in a similar manner to removals proposed elsewhere by the Province through this posting.
On behalf of the family of Jean Gay Evans, I am requesting the removal of lands municipally known as 10240 Pine Valley Drive, Vaughan from the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation. These lands are located near the geographic centre of Vaughan, on the west side of Pine Valley Drive, just north of Major Mackenzie Drive. The lands are located at the edge of the Greenbelt Plan area and are surrounded by urban development or publicly owned lands. We believe the land contains the last remaining farm in the area.
Removal of these lands from the Greenbelt Plan boundary regulation is supportable given that the lands:
• Are adjacent to the urban area of Vaughan, with development all around the property.
• Are adjacent to the edge of the Greenbelt Plan area boundary.
• Can be serviced in the near-term with local infrastructure upgrades entirely funded by private investment; and,
• Would enable housing, including opportunities for long-term care and/or hospice to be built in the near-term as part of a complete community.
In addition to the fact the lands meet all of the suggested criteria for removal from the Greenbelt Plan, we would also like to note that our family generously gifted 500 acres of Upper Cold Creek farm to the Ontario Heritage Trust for the betterment of the Vaughan community in 1968. Since that time our family has continued to manage our lands with a community first focus and we plan to continue this commitment with the thoughtful and responsible development of our lands to help produce the housing and long term care facilities that are so desperately needed by our community. We respectfully request this history also be considered by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing in its decision.
Enclosed is a Planning Analysis by Malone Given Parsons Ltd. (MGP) analyzing the appropriateness of the requested removal of 10240 Pine Valley Drive, Vaughan from the Greenbelt Plan regulation boundary.
Please contact the undersigned with any questions or comments on the submission.
Regards,
Gillian Evans

75862,/comment/75862,"I am opposed to any removal of lands from within the Greenbelt protected boundary.  However, I support any addition to Greenbelt lands by expanding the boundaries.  Farmland and natural areas provide vital ecosystem services to keep urban areas healthy and prosperous.  Any loss or fragmentation of this land reduces the amount of the services they provide and the resilience of the urban areas to future extremes.
In particular, I oppose any shrinking or fragmentation of Greenbelt lands in Ontario.  Healthy and prosperous communities depend on these lands and waters for food, clean air and water, healthy soils and recreation.  As well these areas provide huge amounts of carbon storage, and carbon sequestration potential.  The current and future resilience of urban communities depend on their continued existence.  Any losses or fragmentation of natural areas and farmland reduces their ability to provide the billions of dollars of ecosystem services that they currently deliver.
I recommend that current Greenbelt lands remain protected and that the boundaries be expanded so that more services are available for the expected growing population
I oppose the practice of 'offsetting'.  Every time a mature wetland, woodland, waterway or meadow is disturbed or destroyed, thousands to millions of tonnes of carbon are released into the atmosphere.  All the future capability of that natural feature to absorb carbon is lost.  Not to mention the loss of other ecosystem services that area provides.  A newly manufactured and/or immature wetland, timber plantation or meadow is very poor, sometimes even negative carbon sequester compared to a mature natural area.  We need to retain the services we have, both for life support and for climate mitigation and adaptation.
I recommend that all current existing wetland, forests, waterways and meadows be protected and enhanced with buffers.
I oppose any reduction in public input.  There are thousands of knowledgeable people in Ontario who understand the value of the ecosystem services that natural features and farmland provide.  There are millions more who love the natural areas near and far from their homes for the beauty and recreation they provide.  They appreciate without understanding the mental and physical relaxation these areas provide and they benefit from the ecosystem services without perhaps fully appreciating where these services come from. People also prefer to live in walkable communities without having to commute hundreds of kilometres a week for work and shopping. These people should have a say in how we develop our housing stock in Ontario.
I recommend that the public be heard and taken seriously when they defend the Greenbelt.
In conclusion, I oppose any shrinkage or fragmentation of the Greenbelt.  I support boundary expansion for the Greenbelt in order to grow our protection for the services provided by natural features of all types and by farmland.  And I support the enhancement of our Environmental Bill of Rights so that the public has a greater say in how our land is developed.

Dear Minister Clark,
Re:   ERO 019-6216 Proposed Amendment to the Greenbelt Plan; ERO 019-6217 Proposed Amendment to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation; ERO 019-6218 Proposed Redesignation of land under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan
Beef Farmers of Ontario (BFO) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing’s (MMAH) consultations regarding the Greenbelt Plan. BFO represents 19,000 beef farmers in Ontario by advocating in the areas of sustainability, animal health & care, environment, food safety and domestic & export market development.
The provincial government’s plan to address Ontario’s housing crisis and prepare for the province’s expected population growth over the next ten years by building approximately 1.5 million homes is ambitious and necessary, but the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan raise concern for the protection of agricultural land within and outside the Greenbelt. We believe the push to build housing across the province is being conducted with little regard for our province’s ability to farm and produce food for our growing population. The province’s housing objectives cannot be achieved at the expense of Ontario’s finite agricultural land base.
Ontario’s beef producers have serious concerns with the loss of agricultural land, especially agricultural grasslands, in our province. Agriculture Census data from 2016 to 2021 shows Ontario lost 582,392 acres of farmland, totalling over 1.5 million acres of farmland lost between 2006 to 2021. Further, between 2016-2021, over 290,000 acres of tame and native grasslands were lost in Ontario. Grasslands, in the form of pasture and forage land, are primarily managed by beef producers in Ontario, and, in addition to being vital to beef production, grasslands provide a number of ecological services such as habitat for wildlife & pollinators, biodiversity, carbon sequestration & oxygen production and water & nutrient cycling.
The ministry’s Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force recognizes in its report released earlier this year that more growth is pushing past urban boundaries and turning farmland into housing. The Task Force also states that most of the solution to Ontario’s housing crisis must come from densification and not by removing land from the Greenbelt. Actions must be taken to balance our province’s need to increase our housing supply while protecting our farmland and food security.
Agriculture is the backbone of our rural communities and is important to the quality of life of all Ontarians. Beef farms and the broader beef cattle sector have a presence and economic impact in every county and district in Ontario, sustaining more than 61,000 jobs in primary production, processing and retail across the province. Ontario’s beef industry is vitally important to the well-being and growth of families, businesses and communities.
Our comments and recommendations on the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan can be found below:
Lands Proposed to be Removed
BFO has serious concerns with the proposed removal of approximately 7,400 acres from the Greenbelt to be developed for housing. The consultation does not specify the type of lands being considered for removal and for development, but based on the maps provided, it is likely that much of the land will be agricultural land and natural heritage land. A key objective of the Greenbelt Plan is to identify where major urbanization should not occur, provide permanent protection to the agricultural land base from being lost and fragmented, and to support agriculture as the predominant land use. The changes being proposed, evidently, go against this key objective.
Based on the continued loss of agricultural land in Ontario, we maintain our position that the province should be expanding protections to preserve agricultural land across the province and not removing protections already afforded to agricultural land within the Greenbelt. We firmly believe that when the province is considering how best to prepare for Ontario’s growing population, that it must recognize that access to housing and farmland protection are not mutually exclusive issues.
Lands Proposed to be Added
We maintain our position, as stated in our past submissions to ERO 019-3136 Consultation on Growing the Size of the Greenbelt and ERO 019-4485 Proposed Amendment to the Greenbelt Plan - Growing the size of the Greenbelt, that we do not support the proposal to add lands within the Paris Galt Moraine and the 13 Urban River Valleys (URVs) to the Greenbelt. We also believe the addition of URVs to the Greenbelt should not be considered as an increase in the total Greenbelt land area as a majority of URVs are already publicly owned and protected land areas. Although we see the merit in adding both land within the Paris Galt Moraine and URVs to the Greenbelt, doing so will not achieve one of the key objectives of the Greenbelt, which is to provide permanent protection to Ontario’s agricultural land base. As noted, we believe the province needs to do more to preserve agricultural land from development across the province.
The proposal to add lands from the Paris Galt Moraine and Urban River Valleys, amounting to approximately 9,400 acres of land, as a means to compensate for the land being removed from the Greenbelt, none of which is designated as agricultural land, should not be considered as a replacement equal to the agricultural land being removed from the Greenbelt. It is not a fair assessment to suggest that land not suitable or capable of producing food can replace the prime agricultural lands proposed to be removed from the Greenbelt.
Strategic Removals
The consultation outlines the criteria for how the provincial government considered properties within the Greenbelt as suitable for removal and for future and near-term housing development. A component of the criteria is that “greater than 1:1 offset must be achieved to ensure overall Greenbelt expansion”. As noted, we believe the proposal to replace the agricultural land removed from the Greenbelt with non-agricultural land, should not be considered a 1:1 offset.
Although we believe all agricultural land in Ontario should be protected, if the provincial government truly wants to offset the agricultural land from the Greenbelt proposed for housing development, then the government should be replacing that land with other agricultural land. BFO recommends the government consider replacing the agricultural land removed from the Greenbelt with Crown land in northern Ontario. Despite there being more than 200 million acres of land in northern Ontario that could be used for agricultural production, most is controlled by the province and is not easily accessible for food production purposes. Not only could this replace the proposed agricultural land to be removed from the Greenbelt, but opening Crown land to farmers in northern Ontario would further support the government’s agricultural development goals in northern Ontario. Further, allowing access to Crown land in northern Ontario for grazing and hay production would also maintain and provide valuable ecological services and environmental benefits.
Other Recommendations
•	BFO believes the path to meeting Ontario’s housing development goals while ensuring Ontario’s finite agricultural lands are not lost in the process, is to ensure urban boundaries are fixed and that development focuses on density in urbanized areas. Especially in urban areas where density does not exist due to exclusionary zoning rules.
•	BFO continues to express that land used for agriculture but not classified as prime agricultural land, or CLI Class 1-3 soils, must also be preserved to ensure future capacity for the production of food exists throughout the province and across commodity sectors. This is particularly important for agricultural uses that do not depend on CLI Class 1-3 soils, such as beef production, as such land is suitable for pasture use.
•	BFO supports the use of agricultural impact assessments as a key tool for land use planning and for providing an opportunity for avoiding, minimizing and/or mitigating negative impacts on agriculture. We believe they should be required as part of the permit process for residential builds on Ontario’s diminishing agriculturally productive land.
It is evident the preservation and protection of the existing agricultural land base is critical for the future sustainability of Ontario’s food systems, the provincial economy and in the fight against climate change. Land use policy has a significant influence on competing interests for Ontario’s farmland, which is one of Ontario’s most valuable and at-risk resources. The current unsustainable loss of agricultural lands needs to be seriously addressed. Long-term actions to protect agricultural lands that do not pit areas of the province against one another need to be examined. The province must find a way to balance the need for increasing our housing supply with the need to better protect our farmland.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the current Greenbelt Plan proposals. We look forward to being included in future discussions related to the Greenbelt Plan and the preservation of Ontario agricultural lands.

76013,/comment/76013,"This move by the provincial government is wrong in so many ways I can't list them all. Including: the obvious corruption involved in promising developers the Greenbelt will be opened, then assuring the public the Greenbelt will NOT be opened, while big developers continue to buy this ""protected"" land – then cash in big when their parcels are removed from the Greenbelt and the market values skyrocket. And then: municipalities are told they must slash development fees paid by the developers, AND they can't get knowledgeable advice about environmental impacts from MNRF or Conservation Authorities, so they will make decisions in ecological ignorance, while also having to hike our property taxes – all so that big developers get a windfall. Plus: the associated changes to wetland evaluations will seriously weaken protection of the small percentage of original wetlands that still remain; the predictable result will be a continued, accelerating decline in biodiversity. Plus: some of the best farmland in Canada, the land that is more important every year for our food security, continues to be paved over. All of this might be excusable on some level, IF it were actually needed to address the affordable housing crisis. But the provincial government knows full well that there is already ample land available for 1.5 million new homes, because your own Housing Task Force told you so earlier this year. All in all, this round of changes, under the guise of building more homes, is utterly disgusting and will make many voters think twice before even considering voting Conservative, ever again.

76059,/comment/76059,"Bill 23 is not the solution to our housing crisis as the party is leading people to believe, and is an obvious risk to our environmental protection of the Greenbelt. This bill will not address the issues regarding our outrageous housing and rental prices, and the lands and developers being designated for construction do not have legislation or agreements in place to ensure that homes built there will be made affordable to the public. Our number of empty housing units is at an all-time high due to high rental and housing prices, and has made owning a home nearly impossible for most Ontarians. In Toronto alone, the number of housing units not being occupied by residents has risen 40% in the past 5 years. This bill is also working off of the assumption that we do not have enough land within cities to expand with the projected increase in population. However, studies have shown that there is already enough land designated within existing town and city boundaries to accommodate the expected large population growth well past the year 2040 (including 350 square kilometers as of 2019). Furthermore, this bill will result in labour, material, and equipment being reallocated from densely populated areas already proposed for development and where housing is desperately needed, to outside city borders in favour of sprawling and sparse underdeveloped areas.
Our Greenbelt is a vital part of our ecosystem, and once the boundaries of this protected land are sacrificed for development, the integrity of its protection is lost and it becomes a land of possible future business endeavors rather than being integral and important protected lands. There will always be developers looking to take away more and more of it for land swaps once the boundaries of its protection are crossed. The majority of the land proposed to be added back to the Greenbelt is already protected lands that would not allow development; therefore, the land added back into the Greenbelt is nowhere close to that being taken away. In a time of climate crisis and food scarcity, it is not the time to be cutting into lands that are vital to the protection of agriculture, animals, water systems, soil erosion, flood control, disease control, wetland preservation, etc. The proposed pockets for development will result in urban sprawl, requiring infrastructure, roads, sewers, and water supplies to be expanded from surrounding cities to accommodate the expansion. This will cut through additional protected lands, cutting off migratory routes for animals, seed dispersion, as well as endanger land integrity and air and water system qualities.
This bill also dangerously impacts the amount of power our conservation authorities hold when it comes to protecting our lands. Changes to our Conservations Authorities Act will make it so that conservation land may be sold for the purpose of development without permission from the government. It also removes the Conservations Authorities power to reduce sprawl into environmentally sensitive areas in need of protection in order to maintain wetlands, rivers, and stream valleys. ""It does this through Section 7 of the Bill, which would amend s. 28 of the Conservation Authorities Act to exempt any project that has received land use planning approval under the Planning Act from Conservation Authority regulations regulating water-taking, interference with rivers, creeks, streams, watercourses, and wetlands, or controlling flooding, erosion, conservation of land.
Sections 8. (3)(a), 8(6)(a), 9 (1) (a), 9 (2) (a) & (b), 10 (4) (a), 10 (7)(a), 11(2)(1), 12 (2)(i) of the Act would remove the power of Conservation Authorities to protect the ecological function and potentially the long-term stability and viability of wetlands. It would do this by removing the power to regulate – and refuse permits based on “pollution or the conservation of land”, and removing the obligation of the minister to consider those matters in appeals.""
Furthermore, this bill not only removes the powers of the Conservation Authorities, but also gags their ability to communicate with municipalities due to amendments to s. 21.1.1 and s. 21.1.2 of the Conservation Authorities Act. These changes prohibit them from providing municipalities with the information they need in order to protect their own lands when they consider them for planning approvals. Not only does this bill threaten the protection of the Greenbelt, but all environmentally sensitive lands previously protected and off-limits to construction.
Additionally, the province must consult with Indigenous communities regarding taking areas of the Greenbelt away. It's an obligation that comes from the s.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and must be abided by to ensure that their Indigenous and Treaty rights are being adhered to, and their voices heard.
This bill is not aligned with the needs and desires of the Ontario people, and will only serve to benefit the landowners who plan to develop the Greenbelt and protected areas.
Wishing you health and happiness, and a brighter and greener future,

76111,/comment/76111,"I am horrified that this government is so short sighted as to think that destroying critical habitats and farmland in order to further urban sprawl is a good idea. The Greenbelt is crucial to protect our province from climate change impacts such as flooding, as the wetlands and green spaces it provides can mediate extremes in temperature and precipitation. We have seen over the past few years how the climate crisis is worsening, increasing severe weather and causing grave damage (for example, in Lytton BC). In Southern Ontario, one of the largest risks in a changing climates comes from flooding in population centres, and loss of viable farmland.
The changes suggested in this regulation appear set to make both outcomes worse. The wetlands in protected Greenbelt areas are essential for capturing rainwater runoff before it can flood more populous areas. In addition, by seeking to build new homes in protected areas, Ontario commits itself to expanding urban sprawl - worsening the climate crisis through increased emissions.
I urge the government to keep its promise not to touch the Greenbelt and instead look to build much more densely in urban areas, particular areas with strong transit infrastructure.
Ripping up the Greenbelt is short-sighted and dangerous, and will only make homes more expensive in the long run by imposing greater environmental risks and expanding unsustainable and inefficient sprawl. This government must take real, meaningful action to build sustainably for the future instead.
I would also request that the government investigate the possible collusion between the Conservatives and developers who have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars on Greenbelt lands over the last few years. It seems obvious that there have been backroom dealings happening here, with both parties obviously benefitting from this egregious destruction of protected lands.

In addition, more homes can be built in urban areas  by infill and intensification and in more rural areas by establishing 2 additional residences as requested in the Provincial Policy Statement. Taking this protected land is a 'want' not a 'need'. The owner/developers want to profit from developing  protected land.
Urban sprawl had to stop somewhere in the early 2000's or there would be continuous development  from Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe and from the Niagara Escarpment to the eastern end of the Oak Ridges Moraine. This sprawl had to stop so it did, to protect  some of the best agricultural soil and farmland in Canada, some of the last remaining forests, cold water streams, and fish spawning grounds,  aquifers, wetlands and the habitat of diverse species, that have been here and whom inhabitants have  depended on for thousands of years. There is no need to take any of this land from those uses and protection. The proposed lands will expand urban sprawl for no reason. Once the government starts to eat away at this protected land the developers' voracious appetites will seek more and more. Our trust in our government to serve and protect us will be destroyed .
Municipalities know their lands, watercourses, wildlife and their habitats,  the needs of their residents and businesses, their recreational facilities and their Official Plans based on those needs. Their experts have spent many years and millions of tax dollars developing and revising their Official Plans as their needs change. They are starting to see how they are affected by climate change, the challenges of affordable housing, while trying to budget for necessary services, and maintain and replace  their infrastructure. Municipalities can better effectively direct their growth and support their tax base with additional housing.

Even then, I cannot support this re-zoning plan. If this zoning plan goes through, I will no longer be supporting the Conservatives at the next election.
I recently met with a financial advisor to talk about retirement savings. He asked me about what kind of retirement I wanted. I wasn't really able to answer him. I always thought travelling would be my ultimate goal. But looking at the news, I dont really know what kind of world will be left by 2060. The Great Barrier reef bleaching, the Amazon all but gone, the west coast wilderness disappearing in blazes.   When I drive through the Ontario farmlands and see patches of what use to be greenspace and farmland being turned into generic McMansion suburbs, it makes me want to give up. What of my childhood will I be able to share with my children? ""See that highway over there kids? That use to be a wetland where we use to go hiking and see the butterflies spawn ever spring"".
We dont need more sprawling suburbs of 2 million dollar mansions planted out in the middle of nowhere, without any connection to the rest of the GTA. We need more vibrant, medium to high density communities in walking distance to transit hubs and amenities, with smaller homes we can actually aspire to afford. We need our wetlands and waterways protected so that our future generations can see what this land use to look like. We need to protect our food networks because Covid has shown us how delicate our supply chains really are.
We need to stop taking the easy way out for every problem we face. I know the obvious solution to our current housing crisis is to build more homes in open lands. I know the pockets of many powerful figures in ontario will be lined with cash from developers for this rezoning. But that isnt why I supported conservatives. I supported them because I hoped they would be willing to take on the challenge of facing problems of today while protecting our heritage.

The carving of land from the Greenbelt on such weak grounds is to endanger the very survival of the Greenbelt.  It will give a signal to developers that the Greenbelt isn't off limits and will result in further speculation and push for further development.
There is a large supply of unused ""greenfield"" land open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries (350 sq. km. as of 2019).  We can build affordable housing on this land, as well as build more densely in urban areas, particularly where there is a strong transit infrastructure.  Needless to say, affordable housing should include public transportation which would not require owning a car.  This cannot be said in housing built in the Greenbelt.
The Greenbelt protects farmland that once developed cannot be reclaimed.  Already hundreds of acres of farmland a day are lost to development according to The Ontario Federation of Agriculture.  It provides protection from flooding, habitat for species at risk, and green spaces for tourism and locals.  With climate change advancing, and more quickly than recently expected, all of these services are greatly needed.

76357,/comment/76357,"Though it is clear that this consultation is a token gesture and comments will not be considered I still feel it is important to voice our opinion before our greenbelt is irreparably damaged.
This bill marks a flip-flop by the Ford government, who promised in recent years to keep the Greenbelt free from development, and sets precedent for removal and sale of any protected land in this province to those with the closest connection to the currently elected party.
This proposal is unlikely to add any real additional housing to Ontario. There is currently over 85,000 acres of unused greenfield land already open for development within existing municipal boundaries and a long term shortage of materials, equipment and skilled labour. Earlier this year, Ontario’s government-appointed Housing Affordability Task Force said a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the province’s housing crisis. “Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts.” (see attached link) This proposal seeks to redirect those resources to developing sprawl in the form multi-million dollar houses where developers can profit instead of creating affordable housing where people need it.
The proposal claims that ""approximately 2000 acres"" will be added to the greenbelt but much of this land is already protected.
The damage done by removing protected lands can never be undone. ""Swapping"" these out for other protected lands only obfuscates and normalizes the damage. The result of this proposal is that now other Greenbelt landowners are asking for protections to be dropped on their properties.
I can only hope that future generations learn from our mistakes.

76359,/comment/76359,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on proposed changes to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation as outlined in ERO 019-6217 and as related to the Government of Ontario’s More Homes Built Faster plan. This submission reflects similar statements to our comments in ERO-6216 - Proposed Amendment to the Greenbelt Plan, and ERO-6218 - Changes to the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, recognizing the complementary nature of these three proposals as outlined on the Environmental Registry of Ontario.
As noted in our November 16th submission to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy on Bill 23, the Ontario Public Health Association (OPHA) fully supports the need for Ontario to find more affordable housing opportunities for its residents and create healthy, equitable and climate-resilient communities. At the same time, it is vital that these processes, including legislative changes, are undertaken in a manner that reduces the risk of inadvertent harms and inequities to the health and climate resiliency of communities. Actions such as intensification and transit-oriented development can be health and equity promoting, without compromising other vital attributes required for healthy and equitable communities including access to, and protection provided by greenspace.
Public health agencies have long recognized the connections between healthy environments and population health, and thus the importance of healthy public policy across all sectors to strengthen health protection and equity. This includes policies for the protection of natural heritage systems, the preservation of ecosystem connectivity, and the implementation of nature-based solutions for climate-resiliency including mitigation and adaptation.
OPHA urges the Government of Ontario to:
- Maintain the integrity of conservation protections across Ontario, including the conservation of wetlands, woodlands, farmlands and other protected ecosystems
- Implement smart growth policies that truly value the benefits of natural ecosystems, including strengthening of provincial land-use planning direction to protect green spaces
- Implement the Auditor General of Ontario’s recommendations in the 2022 Value-for-Money Audit: Climate Change Adaptation: Reducing Urban Flood Risk, including recommendations to protect green space and wetlands
- Keep to its commitment to leave the Greenbelt intact
OPHA does not support amendments Greenbelt Area boundary regulation (O. Reg. 59/05) that would remove or redesignate 15 areas of land from the existing Greenbelt Area (Maps 1-11 in ERO 019-6217 supporting material). We have provided a detailed account below, as to why this amendment to the Greenbelt Plan is contrary to protecting public health and safety, including climate-resiliency.
OPHA does support the amendment to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation (O. Reg. 59/05) would add lands in the Paris Galt Moraine area to the Greenbelt Area. This amendment would provide protection for this important area and allow expansion of the Greenbelt westward.
Greater consideration of health impacts must be incorporated into the decision-making process affecting the Greenbelt Plan and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan (ORMCP). The protected lands in the Greenbelt and ORMCP work together to promote the development of healthy, equitable and complete communities, protect natural heritage, water, and agricultural systems, improve air quality, help buffer against flooding and other climate-related health risks, and promote a culture of conservation. These plans help the province meet its climate change targets and communities achieve their net-zero carbon goals by providing a natural carbon sink, reducing energy usage and mitigating the urban heat island effect. As pointed out in the report The Nature of Health: Accelerating the integration of health considerations in urban nature-based solutions  these nature-based solutions increase climate-resiliency and can have added benefits for vulnerable populations disproportionately impacted by climate change.
Removing 7,400 acres of natural areas and farmland from Greenbelt protection will not solve the housing crisis, and will create additional problems. Healthy natural ecosystems are essential to human health. Removing protections from the Greenbelt undermine the conservation of wetlands, woodlots and farmland, jeopardize source water protection, decrease climate resiliency and contribute to more urban sprawl.  Natural ecosystem services include regulating air and water pollution, flood protection, erosion control, carbon sequestration, provision of nutritious food and clean water, surface temperature regulation, and several cultural, recreational, physical and mental health benefits.
Protection of green space including wetlands, and realizing their human health, environmental and economic benefits, is inextricably tied to land-use planning decisions. The Auditor General of Ontario has acknowledged the risk of further loss of green spaces posed by Bill 23, the More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022, in relation to the increased risk of urban flooding in surrounding communities. As noted in the Auditor General’s report released on November 30, 2022, Value-for-Money Audit: Climate Change Adaptation: Reducing Urban Flood Risk  the three main factors that contribute to an increased risk of urban flooding are: (1) development that results in the loss of green spaces and other pervious surfaces, (2) inadequate or aging stormwater infrastructure, and (3) climate change, which is resulting in more frequent and more intense rainfall events.
OPHA urges the Government of Ontario to implement the Auditor General’s recommendations, including those related to protection of green space and wetlands – tracking and reporting on percentage of area covered by pervious surfaces, natural cover, wetlands and woodlands; reviewing land-use plans and policies, and including limits on impervious surface area that results from development; and developing and implementing a strategic plan to protect, conserve and restore wetlands. As noted by the Auditor General of Ontario: “Despite the critical role that green spaces play to reduce the risk of urban flooding (and provide other benefits), we found that weak provincial land-use planning direction to protect green spaces is resulting in the continued loss of such spaces in urban areas across southern Ontario.” The report references a Statistics Canada analysis of 2021 satellite data that found that: “the percentage of urban land area classified as green has declined in 31 of 33 (94%) of Ontario’s medium and large population centres over the past 20 years.” Another significant finding of the Auditor General’s report is that nearly half of southern Ontario’s remaining wetlands are unevaluated and risk being lost – with an average loss of 1,825 hectares of wetlands every year in this area alone. The report also noted that the Province may be undermining local efforts to protect important green spaces through the increased use of Minister’s Zoning Orders (MZOs) in recent years which override municipal land-use decisions.
A 2016 report commissioned by the Greenbelt Foundation – Ontario’s Good Fortune: Appreciating the Greenbelt’s Natural Capital , estimated the total value of carbon stored in the Greenbelt’s forests, wetlands, and agriculture to be $11.17 B, with annual carbon sequestration from forests, wetlands, and agriculture adding $51.94 M per year.  The value derived from the natural capital of the Greenbelt for recreational activities was estimated to be $2.1 B per year with the value related to property protection by reducing flood risk estimate at $224 M per year. The health benefit provided by air quality improvements resulting from forest cover within the Greenbelt was estimated to be $18 M per year.
Lands within the Greenbelt Area are crucial to the protection of our drinking water resources including recharge of our groundwater to provide safe drinking water to Ontario residents. Many of the Greenbelt Areas are located in the Oak Ridges Moraine and are identified as critical areas for protection of groundwater resources. After the drinking water tragedy in 2000 in Walkerton, Justice Dennis O’Conner made 121 recommendations related to source water protection under the Clean Water Act.  Allowing development on the protected Greenbelt removes many of these vital protections as outlined in the inquiry reports. In addition, these land use changes could impact both drinking water quality and quantity for residents relying on private well water in this area.
OPHA does not agree with the Government of Ontario ERO 019-6217 statement that “The anticipated regulatory impacts of the proposal are positive.” Any loss of protected Greenbelt Area lands will disrupt these essential natural ecosystem services – reducing their ability to provide local sources of healthy, nutritious food, to control climate-related health impacts including flooding, extreme heat and other extreme weather events, to mitigate climate change, and to support equitable access to nature. Carving out portions of the Greenbelt for development removes vital protections for wetlands, woodlots and wildlife habitat. These cannot be replaced by providing protection in other areas, and sets a dangerous precedent for continued loss from the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine and other environmentally sensitive lands – posing additional risk for ecological stability and human health.
More protected natural ecosystems and connected near-urban nature is needed in the Greenbelt, not less. The Southern Ontario Nature Coalition’s Technical Background Report: A Solution to Climate Change and Biodiversity Loss , points out that “some of the most ecologically important areas in Canada are the natural areas and farmland in and around our cities”. The report stresses that land-use policies and decisions must recognize the vital importance of greenspace and the particular elements of near-urban nature that “provide resilience to extreme weather, important outdoor spaces for communities and habitat for plants and animals.” The report acknowledges that nature is “central to Indigenous Ways of Knowing and culture and provides local food and essential gifts from nature or “ecosystem services” to communities. These benefits will only become more important as climate change progresses.”
With clear evidence that climate-related heavy rainfall events will continue to increase, it is counter intuitive to remove protections that allow development to occur in these sensitive areas. As noted in the Independent Review of the 2019 Flood Events in Ontario   report commissioned by the Government of Ontario the first core component of emergency management is prevention, which includes “… actions taken to prevent flood-related emergencies or disasters from occurring, and includes land use planning and regulatory restrictions to keep development out of the floodplains and other hazardous areas. While we cannot prevent flooding from occurring, keeping people and property out of flood-prone areas helps ensure naturally occurring flood events do not result in local emergencies.”
Failing to value the benefits of the Greenbelt is neither a balanced nor a fiscally sound way to plan for responsible growth. To be economically-sound in the long-term, all land-use planning decisions at the provincial and local level must take into account the services that nature provides. This allows for the proactive management of natural assets for climate-resiliency and the identification of nature-related risks and opportunities that specifically recognizes the positive benefits of natural-climate solutions.  As noted in the Intact Centre of Climate Adaptation’s 2022 Report, Getting Nature on the Balance Sheet: Recognizing the Financial Value of Natural Assets in a Changing Climate : “These actions will help Canada enlist and work with nature to slow climate change, increase climate resilience and reverse biodiversity loss, ultimately benefiting the wellbeing of people in Canada and beyond.”
Evidence from expert authorities and provincially-appointed advisory groups shows that more than enough land has already been set aside to meet the demand over the coming decade for all types of housing within existing town and city boundaries, and outside Greenbelt Areas. The 2021 Expanding Ontario’s Greenbelt report  sets out key requirements for expanding the greenbelt including: “no land removal; … work towards simultaneously improving public health, local food security, water security, biodiversity conservation and economic prosperity; … acknowledge that there is more than enough land to grow the Greenbelt and built complete communities to handle projected population growth.”
The Report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force  lists a number of options that the government has at its disposal to help address affordability for Ontarians and achieve the target of 1.5 million new homes built in the next ten years, without developing on protected Greenbelt Area lands. These include densification, more gentle density and more efficient use of land across Ontario including better use of existing public services and infrastructure. As pointed out in the Report: “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem. Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts.”
OPHA is concerned with the agricultural land base no longer being afforded permanent protections in the Greenbelt and ORMCP Plans. Both greenspace and farmland provide ecological, economic, social and health benefits for our residents, including land for growing food, access to local food, opportunities to connect with farmers and food production.  The loss of agriculture land does not support other provincial policy directives namely the Local Food Act, 2013, which was created to help foster successful and resilient local food economies and systems.
Ontarians have experienced and will continue to experience the devastating impacts of extreme-weather events including flooding when greenspace is paved over, and unsustainable development is permitted in areas that require environmental protection. Moreover, the value of productive farmlands in these areas for local, healthy food production, for environmental protection including that of speciality crops (e.g., tender fruits and grapes) many residents rely on for their livelihood, and for our economy supports continued protection of the existing Greenbelt.
OPHA urges the Government of Ontario to keep to its commitment to leave the Greenbelt intact and not to remove or redesignate the 15 areas of land from the existing Greenbelt Area as proposed in ERO 019-6217. We also urge the province to maintain the integrity of all conservation protections within existing protected green spaces across Ontario and to expand the Greenbelt beyond its current area in consultation with stakeholders and by engaging with Indigenous communities.
It is vital that all smart growth policies truly value the benefits of natural ecosystems and not undermine the conservation of wetlands, woodlands, farmlands and other protected ecosystems. We encourage the province to heed the recommendations of its advisory groups and expert authorities, protect the existing Greenbelt, build in existing designated development areas and increase density to expand housing stock more effectively with co-benefits for health, the environment and the economy.
Thank you for considering our concerns and recommendations with respect to proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan as outlined in ERO 019-6217. We would welcome the opportunity to meet with the government to discuss the proposed changes and solutions that address concerns related to this proposed legislative change.

Politicians need to admit they don't have the knowledge base and should not be allowed to dismantle/alter plans just because they perceive some short -sighted benefit. What is established through extensive consultation should not be allowed to be altered without the same due process.  Any excuses as to why that is not possible is not democratic.

76440,/comment/76440,"On behalf of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) please find attached our submission with respect to ERO # 019-6217 (Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation).
OFA is opposed to the proposals to remove lands from the Greenbelt’s Protected Countryside for development and urges the provincial government to withdraw these proposals altogether. OFA maintains its current stance and recommends the province should take a holistic, systematic, province-wide approach that prioritizes protecting agricultural lands and identifies the most appropriate areas for growth with justifiable criteria and comprehensive analysis. OFA encourages the provincial government to listen to their experts and explore other avenues to address housing supply which do not sacrifice farmland or the Agricultural System.
OFA does not support this proposal to grow the Greenbelt by incrementally adding the proposed areas of Urban River Valleys (URVs). The proposal to 'Greenbelt' URVs should not be considered an acceptable means of maintaining the Greenbelt's total land area to balance the loss of protected agricultural lands to development. OFA believes that the Ontario government should designate all farmlands in Ontario that are outside of current settlement area boundaries as ‘Greenbelt’ and afford them permanent protections from the threat of urban development.
OFA urges the provincial government to implement changes to build more homes faster that reflect that growth management to meet housing demand and farmland protection are two sides of the same coin. More robust protection against development on agricultural land combined with fixed, permanent urban boundaries and mandatory compliance with urban density and intensification requirements will achieve community development and farmland protection objectives.
Thank you.

76454,/comment/76454,"As a father, and lifelong Ontario resident I am compelled to write, with grave concerns over many of the decisions being made at this time. It is obvious this proposal is being made under the guise of creating additional homes in Ontario, however there are no clauses or protections to ensure the housing created from this proposal will help those who need it most. Without ensuring everyone will have fair access to additional housing, this proposal makes it cheaper and easier for developers to build homes with big profit margins for themselves, while sticking the municipalities and thus the taxpayers with the difference.
Everyone is acutely aware that this Greenbelt proposal was not necessary in order to build homes quickly. The brazen disregard for the well-being of the environment AND current homeowners/taxpayers is absolutely gutting. It is not, in any manner, going to raise the low morale of our citizens , nor increase a sense of well-being and financial security during this economically recessive period of time.
It is obvious that the land-swap being proposed, and the associated talking-points about this proposal netting increased Greenbelt acreage, are nothing more than fancy hand-waving attempting to mislead the general public. We know for a fact many of the lands being added are protected through other means, and much of the additional land can NEVER be developed regardless, so it is inherently protected. Many experts have also chimed in to raise the alarm that the land added to the Greenbelt was thoughtfully considered, and has specific ecological impacts and reasons for being included. To simply propose to add new land, without additional studies and recommendations made, is inadequate. Why does the government refuse to answer questions with regard to how these specific parcels of land were chosen to be added to the Greenbelt?
It is saddening how our current Provincial Government shares information with its citizens. Few people really know the implications of the Bill, and were given little time to get informed and get involved. The lack of straight forward discussion/presentation of the facts of the Bill by our Premier, and the swiftness in order to pass it, demonstrates such a lack of regard for its citizens. This certainly looks like we have a Premier making decisions in the interest of the corporations, not for the people.
However, in summary, the above concerns must be addressed here in these consultations. Massive changes are needed now, before the damage is done. A wide-angle lense on the impact of the broader society and the future implications for years to come is necessary for informing future decisions, and for the protection of our children and our legacies.
Please DO NOT DO THIS. Do not swap short-term, perceived gain for long-term impacts to our sensitive environment and ecosystem that are already under attack from so many angles. The Greenbelt is something Ontarian's can point to with pride, as a demonstration of our commitment to protect something that is so hard to replace once it has been destroyed.
Thank you for this opportunity to share my opinions and I trust they will be thoughtfully considered.

76479,/comment/76479,"I am completely against opening up any part of the Greenbelt for development, whether it is for housing or for a highway.  The Greenbelt is a vital area which stops sprawl, protects farmland, forests, wetlands, biodiversity, endangered species and the sources for our drinking water.  It also is a carbon sink which helps to mitigate the effects of climate change; it also prevents disastrous flooding and landslides.  In addition, allowing some development would incentivize further requests for Greenbelt land development to the point where no parts of the Greenbelt would be preserved.  There is a vast supply of unused ""greenfield"" land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries. Building affordable housing within these existing settlement boundaries and existing low-rise single detached neighbourhoods is the way to solve the housing crisis that we are in.
Add to the Greenbelt by all means; protect it in its entirety from development.  Once it's gone it's gone and the damage will be irreversible.  The future of other species and our ability to feed future generations is dependent upon our wise actions today.

Continuing to enable sprawl only kicks the can further down the road; it doesn't resolve the fundamental housing issue.  At some point we need to intensify.  Let's do intensify existing areas now before we commit to irreversible sprawl that lasts forever.  The apparent collusion between Ontario and developers stinks and it's further reason to reconsider immediately.

76566,/comment/76566,"I wish to comment on ERO posting No. 019-6217 - Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation.
This is a notice of a proposed regulation under the Greenbelt Act, 2005, posted by the
Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing
The premise that Greenbelt lands are required for housing has been refuted by the province's signature consultation body -- the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force --- in its February 2022 report; in fact, the Task Force warned of the danger of developing environmentally sensitive areas:
“But a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem. Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts ...”
                                                                                  …
“Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture.” (p. 10)
Opening up the Greenbelt will lead to the loss of habitat and ground water protection, irreplaceable loss of farm land, reward land speculators and establish the principle that Greenbelt lands are no longer off limits for development.
The proposed countervailing measure of adding equal (or even greater) amounts of lands to the Greenbelt to replace carve outs is, like the idea of carbon offsets, not tenable.
- What guarantee is there that the replacement lands will not themselves be opened for development?
- The replacement lands are in some cases already protected, thereby resulting an a decrease in protected lands.
- Protecting part of a feature, such as the Galt Moraine, is only a partial measure and does not result in comprehensive protection of the feature.
Finally, given the multiple investigations of property purchases in the areas of the Greenbelt that are proposed to be released for development, it would be entirely inappropriate to proceed with this regulation prior to the completion of all investigations.
I strongly urge the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing you not to proceed with this regulation.

76581,/comment/76581,"I am commenting on ERO 019-6217, which relates to Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation.
I strongly oppose the proposed regulation.
Land in the Greenbelt is not needed for housing.  This was the explicit conclusion of the provincial government's own blue ribbon Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force.
The land proposed to be removed is very sensitive in terms of its ecological importance, including wetlands, natural heritage system, prime farm land and a headwater for a creek system, among others.  Removal of these lands will affect many aspects of the natural system of which these lands are a part and will therefore have broader implications in terms of the protection of the Greenbelt area. Once wetlands, farmlands, and areas of biodiversity are developed, they are lost forever.
The precedential value of removing land from the Greenbelt cannot be overstated.  It will establish the principle that the Greenbelt lands no longer have protected status, and will surely encourage other developers to ask for their own piece of the Greenbelt for development.
It must be remembered that the Premier unconditionally promised that he would not release lands from the Greenbelt for development.  The people of Ontario expect the Premier to keep this promise.
I strongly urge that the Greenbelt not be opened up for development: not now, not in the future.

By taking away the oversight power of conservation authorities the province has effectively given the green light to developers and speculators to slash and burn whatever they wish within the Greenbelt. Does anyone seriously think the province will say no if developers clamour for more greenbelt land, beyond the 7400 acres already granted to them?
The wetlands, natural resources, and wildlife of the Greenbelt are unique and irreplaceable; you cannot destroy it and expect it to be recreated in a land swap or ""offset"". Is it any surprise that no conservation group supports this offsetting policy?
Climate change is real and affects us all. Why are you opening up the Greenbelt for destruction when we should be preserving as much green space as possible for future generations, a valuable carbon sink to offset fossil fuel future emissions?
If this bill is so important, then why didn't the province put it to the voters before the last provincial election? The answer is that the province knows from previous experience that Ontarians understand the importance of protecting our environment and would never have stood for it. Do not let the bulldozers move in; once it's gone, it's gone forever. Do not sacrifice a natural birthright just to make a handful of people even wealthier than they already are.

76909,/comment/76909,"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal to remove 7,400 acres from the Greenbelt (ERO #019-6216 and #019-6217).
These Greenbelt lands are not needed for housing. The amount of greenfield land already designated for development, and added to municipal settlement boundaries, but still sitting unbuilt far exceeds what is needed to meet long range housing targets. As you know, in its 2022 report, Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force stated that a shortage of land isn’t the cause of Ontario’s housing problem and that Greenbelts, environmentally sensitive areas and farmland must be protected.
The proposed removal of Greenbelt lands sets an alarming precedent, opening the Greenbelt to development at the request of those who stand to reap immense profits while the rest of us pay the tab. Land swaps put the entire Greenbelt at risk. Most of the lands to be removed from the Greenbelt overlap with the Natural Heritage System, which supports sensitive and significant natural features, and is supposed to be managed by your ministry as a connected and integrated natural heritage system.
The importance of permanently protecting lands and waters within the Greenbelt cannot be overstated. It is key to building the resilience of local food systems, protecting at-risk habitats and species, and sustaining the physical, social and economic health of the nine million Ontarians living in the Greater Golden Horseshoe. Not only are we facing the interconnected and accelerating crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, we are also losing 319 acres of farmland daily. The protection of natural and hydrological systems and farmland must be prioritized. They are finite, irreplaceable and invaluable for community and ecosystem health and resilience.
For the sake of current and future generations, I urge you to abandon your plans to remove 7,400 acres of protected lands from the Greenbelt.

76970,/comment/76970,"I would like to register my objection to the proposed changes for the following reasons, among others:
* The government has repeatedly promised not to allow development on the Greenbelt. This proposal is in direct opposition to those promises.
* The Greenbelt lands are not required to meet housing target as outlined in the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force Report on page 10 of the report.
* Land swaps put the entire Greenbelt at risk. Some of the proposed additions to the Greenbelt area had already been proposed as additions. Also, some of the areas in the proposed additions are already protected areas.
* These changes set a harmful precedent and remove permanent protections. They allow a few developers to generate large profits that will have a negative impact on generations to come. They also set up a potential stream of new requests for changes that have the potential to erode the protection the Greenbelt is supposed to provide for the environment.
* Using the proposed land for development will only encourage urban sprawl and put further strain on transportation resources, both public transit and roads and highways.
* The proposed lands will likely not be used for medium to high density housing developments which are the kinds of housing that will be required to have an impact on housing affordability.
* Harm to the Greenbelt’s Natural Heritage System:
Most of the lands to be removed from the Greenbelt (10 of the 14 areas shown on the maps) overlap with the Natural Heritage System, which supports “the highest concentration of the most sensitive and/or significant natural features and functions” and is meant to be managed “as a connected and integrated natural heritage system, given the functional inter-relationships between them.” (Greenbelt Plan, sec. 3.2.1).
* The government appears to not have done anything related to past proposals (in 2020 and 2022) to add to the greenbelt (https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-4485) and are only now using the lands outlined in those proposals for the land swap in this proposal.

77012,/comment/77012,"I, Max Lysyk, P.Eng., the Development Manager for 1628755 Ontario Limited, represent my family, the Lysyk’s, the owners of the property municipally know as 360 Columbus Road West in Brooklin, Ontario. I am the grandson of the original owners, George H. Lysyk and Olena Lysyk as my family has owned this property since the early 1960’s. We submit the following comments regarding the Province’s proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation:
We are in support of amending the current limits of the Greenbelt Plan within the Province of Ontario in locations where mapping mistakes were made back in 2005 during the Greenbelt’s implementation. In our opinion, these errors occurred due to high level/desktop reviews used to establish the Greenbelt Plan limits, instead of confirming the limits through detailed site walks. This resulted in many parcels of land throughout the Province, including our property (360 Columbus Road W, Brooklin, ON) to be deemed undevelopable even through there is no difference between the land that abuts the Greenbelt and the land within the Greenbelt. Our property (360 Columbus Road W, Brooklin, ON) is approximately 38.75 hectares (95.75 acres) in size, of which, approximately 12.07 hectares (29.82 acres) currently fall within the Provincial Greenbelt Plan. Of the 12.07 hectares (29.82 acres) Greenbelt lands, 4.14 hectares (10.23 acres) has been actively farmed and is identical to the land outside of the Greenbelt Plan limits.
There is currently a development approval application (Draft Plan of Subdivision) with the Town of Whitby for the 26.68 hectares (65.93 acres) not within the Greenbelt. We ask that the Province consider removing the 4.14 hectares (10.23 acres) of actively farmed lands from the Greenbelt Plan on our property, as it does not contain any significant natural heritage features. In fact, there is no difference in the land being farmed and proposed within the draft plan of subdivision, and the same field being part of the Greenbelt. This is yet another example of land that was split by the Greenbelt Plan when the use of the property is, and has been, the same from north to south. We feel that this was an error when the mapping was prepared in 2005, and ask that this be rectified through the Province’s current amendment exercise. The lands proposed for removal are readily serviceable and can easily be incorporated in the current development approval application for the lands outside the Greenbelt. Additional information and details can be found within the attached documents which includes a planning summary of the subject property, providing a review of the site context, the current planning status and two preliminary development options for the lands that currently fall within the Provincial Greenbelt area. Lastly, construction of new homes on the Greenbelt lands can be achieved by 2025, subject to municipality approvals.
The Province has set a bold target of building 1.5 million homes over the next 10 years to address the housing crisis and is considering removing land from the Greenbelt that can be replaced with protected land in other areas of the Province. The area suggested for removal from the Greenbelt Plan at 360 Columbus Road West in Brooklin, Ontario can accommodate 52 or 55 single detached dwellings as shown on the attached concept lotting plans or can certainly accommodate higher density housing if preferred by the Province.

As a Ontario resident who lives in the GTA, I very much oppose this proposal. In your last term you promised not to touch the Greenbelt, and now you have reneged on that promise. The Greenbelt was set aside for many good reasons- preserving our best farmland, protection from flooding and water quality issues, and to provide some greenspace close to the GTA. I understand the need to build more homes, however there are many other suitable areas. I oppose it for the following reasons:
-We have seen how fragile our supply chain is, and changes like this will further make us more dependent on foreign countries for food in the future
-We need the protection of natural areas to help reduce urban flooding and water quality issues. We have seen the issues that high intensity storms can cause.
-Greenspace is shrinking so quickly in Southern Ontario, and we have so many people and so few natural areas
-Having a large protected area is important to conserve our natural heritage system
-The additional lands you are proposing are protected anyway
Please reconsider this proposal, and stick to your promise of not touching the Greenbelt. This will surely cost my vote if you do not. Do what's best for Ontarians, not just rich developers.

In terms of implementing the proposed changes, the political process is nothing more than:
1. provincial avoidance of housing responsibility by transferring the need and address to lower tier governments without consultation;
2. provincial government betrayal of public trust that favours moneyed friends, associates, and political supporters of the governing party;
3. action that promotes reckless and irresponsible urban sprawl without regard to ascertaining environmental costs, implications, and long-term fiscal responsibilities;
4. an impulsive move that cannot possibly address the issue of housing generally and certainly not for homeless people of most limited resources and most dire need;
5. denial of actual practical timelines and procedures for potential construction;
6. denial of functioning municipal planning capabilities by generating false expectations in utterly undemocratic manner that will result in fiscal crises for each involved municipality;
7. a failure to address collaboratively actual housing issues, options, and overall implications beyond the benefit of so-called ""developers""; and
8. failure to engage all stakeholders toward the development of a long-term housing plan that moves beyond ""developer"" controlled structures and profits.

1. ignorance and/or refusal to acknowledge the life-serving-preserving historic functions of morraines in particular and designated greenbelt space in general connective-integrity manner as well as implications for total involved watershed areas beyond the immediately identified greenbelt;
2. failure to accept and protect in perpetuity for the public of this province the functionality and benefits of these spaces, e.g., water purification, wildlife diversity, wildlife connectivity needs, general earth integrity;
3. failure or refusal to recognize expansive adverse environmental impacts of hastily crafted legislation in areas where infrastructural development and increased urban sprawl will have humongous adverse implications, e.g., diminished air quality, stressed water tables and quality, further threatened vulnerable species; and

Developers are not interested in building enough homes to meet the needs of the people. Their mandate is to maximize profits. It's in their best interest to ensure there the demand for homes is always greater than the supply, so they can maximize their profits on the homes they sell.

First, I’d like to say that I agree with your government’s goal of ‘more homes built faster’. It is the strategy that you’re proposing that concerns me.
There is significant evidence that ample land for urban development already exists in municipalities in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, and more broadly Golden Horseshoe-area municipalities. The goal of building more homes faster is laudable, however, it must be framed within the broader context of climate change. Protecting Ontario’s Greenbelt, our Greenbelt, was an astute decision in 2005, and continues to be a wise decision in 2022 and beyond. Our Greenbelt cleans our air, filters our water, protects our native plants and animals, and of course helps to feed Ontarians. It is a crucial component, or should be a crucial component of Ontario’s climate action strategies. Building, principally large single-family homes in the Greenbelt is the antithesis to effective climate action.
I encourage you to look at the type of development proposed for Toronto’s Downsview Airport (https://www.treehugger.com/plan-build-15-minute-city-wins-design-award-…) as an example of sustainable development that will benefit all Ontarians.

The so called additions to the Greenbelt are in areas that would never have been developed anyway and don't resolve the issues that will be created when building on the previously designated Greenbelt.  Stop this madness.  Recognize that climate is changing, ecosystems need to work as a system to be effective, not ""a stream here and a forest there"" sort of approach.

77175,/comment/77175,"The Greenbelt needs to remain untouched to preserve our environment now and into the future.
Editing the boundary for short term gain undermines purpose and legitimacy of the green belt act.
I am particularly concerned about the:
1. Removal of my right to appeal on planning matters that affect my community;
2. Limitations on the power of conservation authorities (CAs) to regulate or prohibit development that negatively impacts wetlands, rivers or streams, to provide expert review of planning applications, and to appeal planning decisions;
3. Removal of the role of seven regional municipalities (Simcoe, Durham, Halton, Peel, Niagara, Waterloo and York) in planning matters, thereby eliminating coordinated efforts to protect farmland and natural areas, determine optimal locations for development and infrastructure, and efficiently deliver municipal services;
4. Drastic amendments to the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System, ensuring that very few wetlands in Ontario will be deemed provincially significant and protected from development;
5. Replacement of the Provincial Policy Statement with a new policy instrument geared to facilitating unchecked development; and
6. Creation of a natural heritage offsetting policy and “pay to slay” fund that could lead to widespread and extremely risky tradeoffs, where existing natural areas are sacrificed on the faulty premise that they can be recreated or restored elsewhere.
In the face of unprecedented and accelerating biodiversity loss and the ever-worsening climate crisis, it is vital that your government do its utmost to protect the farmland, wetlands, forests, rivers and other natural areas that sustain us. As Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report, we do not need to sacrifice environmental protection to address the housing crisis. That’s because “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem.” (p.10) There is a vast supply of land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries.
I urge you to 1) withdraw all amendments likely to weaken the protection of farmland and natural heritage; and 2) retain and uphold the role of the public, CAs and regional municipalities in environmental planning and decision-making.

77257,/comment/77257,"I stand opposed to the government's amendments to the Greenbelt plan for a number of reasons:
1) If this was a plan the government truly thought was in the public interest, then they should have made that clear to voters, rather than using random platitudes like ""Get it done.""
2) If the idea behind cutting into the greenbelt is to make land available for housing, there are plenty of experts making it clear that this is a bad idea. What if we were to begin rezoning everywhere where a big box store has closed up and has just remained vacant? There are so many creative ideas that don't involve sacrificing farmland (like the Duffins Creek wetlands).
3) Building 50 000 homes (as per Minister Steve Clark's claims) where we had natural space is going to cover porous land up with concrete. There are plenty of examples, even within North America, of how this has increased flood risks, particularly in floodplains, which will not be more vulnerable due to the circumventing of Regional Conservation Authorities in Bill 23, which is now law.
4) The provision that developers have to show significant progress by 2023 is even more egregious, because even if we could trust that developers would put the public good before personal profit, they will be rushed, through the conditions of the amendment, and will be unable to put the time into assessing the damage and risk that could come from their plans.
5) The rivers valleys you have promised to protect are already protected, so this is an inappropriate, and frankly insulting proposition.
6) Ontario had a working process for development: conduct an environmental assessment and then proceed under the recommendations of the assessment. If this is worth doing, it is worth doing right.
7) You cannot carve pieces out of the belt and replace them with random pieces elsewhere. This is not how migration corridors work and with the proposed Highway 413, this will put species at risk even further at risk of extirpation in Ontario.
8) No one is asking for this. Despite the assertions of the Minister of Housing that only ""Nimbies"" are against it, farmers, environmentalists, municipalities that will be touched by the changes,and  First Nations groups  are all protesting these changes. It would seem there is a large enough coalition of varied interests in opposition to these changes that one could reasonably call it antidemocratic, and perhaps even autocratic.
Once we pave over greenspace, we will never get it back. The economic value provided by cleaning air and water, as well as preventing flooding, and contributing to local ecological biodiversity far exceeds any to be gained by cutting in to the greenbelt, particularly in a time of erratic, unpredictable weather and increased flooding.
Please make a responsibly choice and spend more time talking with stakeholders before removing any land from the greenbelt.

Ontario is not for sale and this nonsensical idea it supports homelessness and over priced housing is beyond ridiculous. Ford created a 1950 world of big cars and pavement when this is 2022 and those days are gone. Please research the issues and translate it for him.

Bill 23 will significantly negatively  impact precious ecosystems, countless wildlife, and the quality of life of the residents of these areas. Green space is shown to reduce mortality rates and improve mental health. The very reason many of these regions are attractive to buyers is because of their green space. Further urban sprawl does not positively contribute to the tourism industries and only puts more pressure on infrastructure.

The Greenbelt was protected for the good of all Ontarians, and removing those protections to build homes only the wealthiest can afford stands in direct opposition to that public good. Rather than prioritizing protected spaces and natural lands for development, we should be working within the plans municipalities generated that show how they can meet growth targets without resorting to urban sprawl.
The proposed additions to the Greenbelt may be helpful to bring protected spaces under one plan, so long as it is the plan offering the strongest protection, however nobody is fooled by the fantasy that the Greenbelt is expanding. Lands that are already being protected by other conservation programs are being substituted, and the lands proposed for development represent a net loss of protections, natural infrastructure, and functioning ecosystems.

77439,/comment/77439,"Good evening,
I am writing to express concern about the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation (ERO 019-6217). Though I agree that there is a pressing need to address the housing crisis in Ontario, I do not believe the proposed changes to the Greenbelt adequately address this issue.
Removing land from the Greenbelt will weaken our province's food security and ecological integrity. The lands set aside for conservation in the Greenbelt provide essential ecosystem services such as flooding prevention, carbon capture, and drinking water protection, as well as arable land. Protecting these assets is critically important to building our province's resilience to the climate crisis.
Building homes in the Greenbelt will contribute to worsening the climate crisis and increasing pollution by creating sprawled-out communities that will require long commutes by car to reach jobs and services that only exist in the major urban centers. I urge the government to explore solutions involving increasing density in urban areas and regulating the purchase of properties solely for investment purposes.
These proposed changes to the Greenbelt would set a dangerous precedent for stripping away environmental protections in our province. Furthermore, expanding the urban boundary of Hamilton in particular sets a disturbing precedent for undermining decisions made by municipal governments with the support of their constituents, who clearly expressed a will to limit urban sprawl in their city.
Given these issues, it is imperative the province keep the promise it made to the people of Ontario and pursue a different approach to increasing the housing supply.

It is extremely concerning that a few developers have purchased Greenbelt land in the past few years, which is now being removed from the greenbelt for development. There is no need to remove land from the Greenbelt - the Housing Commission has found that there is enough land within urban boundaries for the 1.5 million homes needed.  Opening up Greenbelt land will only hinder the affordability of housing units. Locally, the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation will take away Grimsby's municipal government's authority, and over rule the Niagara Region's official plan regarding building targets. These decisions need to be based on community input and recommendations regarding development, in particular lands protected  and designated as the Greenbelt. Two areas in Grimsby have been identified by the Province to be removed which is unnecessary. Grimsby is fulfilling building targets and through the Niagara Region's official plan lands do not need to be added. Our infrastructure needs to be updated. We have flooding issues that need to be addressed. The wait list for rent-geared to income housing is  7 years. Limiting municipal governance and over ruling Regional government, while imposing the Provincial government's 'will' is undemocratic.

I do not accept your government’s misleading premise that these Greenbelt lands are needed for housing.
The amount of greenfield land already designated for development, and added to municipal settlement boundaries, but still sitting unbuilt far exceeds what is needed to meet long range housing targets. As you know, in its 2022 report, Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force stated that a shortage of land isn’t the cause of Ontario’s housing problem and that Greenbelts, environmentally sensitive areas and farmland must be protected.
The proposed removal of Greenbelt lands sets an alarming precedent, opening the Greenbelt to development at the request of those who stand to reap immense profits while the rest of us pay the tab. Land swaps put the entire Greenbelt at risk. Most of the lands to be removed from the Greenbelt overlap with the Natural Heritage System, which supports sensitive and significant natural features, and is supposed to be managed by your ministry as a connected and integrated natural heritage system.
The importance of permanently protecting lands and waters within the Greenbelt cannot be overstated. It is key to building the resilience of local food systems, protecting at-risk habitats and species, and sustaining the physical, social and economic health of the nine million Ontarians living in the Greater Golden Horseshoe. Not only are we facing the interconnected and accelerating crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, we are also losing 319 acres of farmland daily. The protection of natural and hydrological systems and farmland must be prioritized. They are finite, irreplaceable and invaluable for community and ecosystem health and resilience.

It is a vestige of hope for clean air, clean water, clean soil, clean food, as well as food security, in a tiny fragment of remaining healthy ecosystem.  People value the Greenbelt for its many connections to Nature.  It seems that the Government of Ontario no longer believes in our rights to the above and rejects the ecosystem functions and services that the Greenbelt provides.  The government seems willing to sacrifice them to the greed of land developers.
The Greenbelt was originally delineated for its intrinsic importances which Ontarians want  permanently protected.   It was a continuous, provincial, natural heritage system of healthy, functioning ecosystems, an important legacy for the people of this province.  Yet the Ontario government wants to remove 7,400 acres of farmland and natural areas.  I am vehemently opposed to this!
Food security should be a top priority for the government.  Much of the land to be removed from the Greenbelt is farmland.  This is unthinkable!  Agricultural land is finite and disappearing at an alarming rate!  And the best is disappearing the fastest.  This is unconscionable.  The government should be protecting our agricultural land.  People want food grown locally, not shipped from distant shores, employing fossil fuels and producing greenhouse gasses which fuel climate change.   Farmers invest in their lands, many taking measures to mitigate climate change, such as creating and enhancing wetlands.  Loosing these lands wound diminish the fight against our changing climate.  Breaking up the Greenbelt will have land speculators buying up farmland  for future development, thus removing access to that land by farmers and future farmers.  This will jeopardize Ontario’s agricultural system.
The government should follow the advice of its own Ontario Affordable Housing Task Force which said that there was plenty of land within urban areas ready for development.   Municipalities in the GGH surrounding the Greenbelt have already designated over 88,000 acres of land for development. This land provides ample space serviced by planned infrastructure, on which to build affordable homes.  A significant amount of taxpayer dollars have already gone into the development of these plans.  The addition of more lands for development is not only unnecessary, it will require municipalities to spend more resources reviewing and updating their official plans and expanding infrastructure to areas for which it has not been planned.
Diminishing the rights of municipal and regional councils, as well as others to refute boundary decisions is anti-democratic.  The democratic process is fundamental to Ontario and to Canada.
Preventing Conservation Authorities from performing one of their main, mandatory functions, to prevent and mitigate flooding, in part by consulting with local and regional governments, is inconceivable.

Green Belt is home to protected species of both plants/wildlife that will be forced out of their habitat to homes/pavement.   Green Belt is internationally known for his fertile agricultural grounds such as Holland Marsh, Niagara Region tender fruit/grape areas, GTA loam soils for nursery and farm crops - it should not be lost and become known for high rises.

There are so may fringe areas within cities/towns such as brownfield unused lands that should be developed first !

77643,/comment/77643,"If you don’t care about farmland or the environment I can give you several other reasons why you should be angry about Bill 23
1. It strips the Conservation authority of regulating negative impacts on wetlands/streams and rivers.
 2. Bill 23 removes requirements for public meetings and people’s right to appeal - meaning us, the taxpayers, have no say in the development that affects our neighbourhoods. Hamilton has already voted no on urban sprawl - democracy is no longer a thing under this conservative government
 3. The rich get richer, while the poor get poorer. The only people who stand to benefit from this Bill are Doug Ford and the developers. Bill 23 may allow for an additional 1.5 million houses to be built but can you afford your property taxes to be even higher? This Bill is allowing for the freeze/waive of development charges that developers would normally have to pay - ie sewer instalment, roads, community centres etc. Now, us, the taxpayers will be on the hook for this instead. Municipalities are already raising the alarm:
Waterloo expects it will cost them $530 million
Mississauga - $885 million. Collectively,
The Association of Municipalities of Ontario said the legislation could leave their members short $5 billion - which the taxpayer will have to foot the bill for
 4. It’s not a new theme “Farmers feed Cities” - once this farmland is paved it’s gone forever
 5. We no longer have a symbiotic relationship with our wildlife. A few months ago Burlington decided to kill coyotes as they were biting humans - what do we think is going to happen here? The wildlife has no where to go
 6. It seems a bit fishy that this protected land was bought by developers (some Even just a few weeks before this bill was passed). Did they know that Doug was going to push this bill? Most of these developers have also donated to the PC party, coincidence? I think not! There has been increased pressure by the opposing parties to have this looked into.
 7. Southern Ontario just keeps getting more and more busy. I’m sure you’ve all noticed how brutal it is to drive around any of the cities anymore - there will be no escape once the sprawl happens.
 8. We are about to enter a recession - the housing market has and is cooling already. Your property tax is going to go up and your house is going to be worth less.
9. Canada is growing (and has to) but we need to do it in a sustainable way - it’s no secret we are in a climate emergency!
10. Ford’s proposed highway 413 is set to cost $10 billion - maybe he should be spending this money on healthcare and education instead of ruining the greenbelt

The government should not be engaging in egregiously corrupt political acts like this to benefit the developer friends of the premier. These lands as a public trust meant to protect the environment and our future. Removing lands from them violates that trust.
There is adequate land available in Ontario for more housing on existing developable land, especially if incentives are given to promote in-fill and increased urban density, as well as allowing municipalities to create mixed-used zoning.
What would be far more effective than destroying the environment would be legislation requiring and incentivizing more rental units. Both rental developments like apartment buildings and in-fill units (aka granny flats or garden suites) are needed. Plus the government could encourage the use of ""tiny homes"" to alleviate housing issues in many communities.
No matter how many more single-family homes get built, there will still be millions of people who either cannot afford to or do not wish to own a home, especially a home so far from existing urban centres. Living out there requires a car and thus more traffic, more smog, more environmental erosion.
This Act will hurt Ontario's future generations irrevocably. PLEASE do not pass it. There are smarter, better solutions to housing problems than just letting developers build more single-family homes in the suburbs.
As a postscript, reducing development charges puts an enormous burden on municipalities which only gets passed to the local property taxes, making housing more and more expensive. Believing developers will pass savings on to buyers is naive: they will simply get richer while housing remains unaffordable for many.
Municipalities will have to make cuts to services and infrastructure maintenance to keep tax hikes low. Millions of Ontarians on fixed incomes, including seniors, will be hurt. Don't reduce development fees: they go to paying for expanded infrastructure and servicing for those new developments. Without those fees, many municipalities will resort to interim control bylaws to slow or stop local development until they have the resources to pay for the servicing. That will not help create more housing: rather, it will throttle it.

I do not believe that this proposed bill will help to solve the housing crisis in Ontario. It will instead reduce the amount of affordable housing, increase urban sprawl and make life less affordable. Thereby defeating the purpose, it is supposedly set out to serve.
Instead of continuing to take away valuable green land, it would make more sense to densify in cities. Higher densification allows smaller, more affordable housing in areas that already include services (schools, hospitals, transit). Building in newly developed areas will create large, unaffordable houses that require car ownership and increased commute times. This is not something that makes life affordable for people that are struggling to find housing.
The proposed approach will not work, and while it will create unaffordable houses, it will not deal with the root problem.

I would like to express my concerns about the removal of any lands from the Greenbelt Plan. As you know, the Greenbelt is a system made up of natural heritage features and areas, linkages intended to provide connectivity and improve ecological features in the future, protected countryside and urban river valleys. It contains some of Canada’s most ecologically and hydrologically significant natural environments and scenic landscapes, including the Oak Ridges Moraine and the Niagara Escarpment. These natural areas clean the air, provide drinking water, provide diverse flora and fauna habitats, including pollinators, and they provide opportunities for recreational activities that benefit public health and overall quality of life. While citing the need for housing, this proposal misses the critical piece of providing a good quality of life for Ontarians, not just a house. There are already enough lands for housing development allocated to meet the projected needs. What is needed is a sustainable future with natural lands to mitigate climate change (so houses don’t get destroyed by extreme weather) and provide recreational opportunities (for people living in those houses), and enough farmland to feed all the people who need a house. Taking lands out of the Greenbelt will not provide the future Ontarians need and deserve.
I fully support the submission by CELA regarding these changes. Specifically I request that the Greenbelt be expanded, not shrunk, to ensure the Greenbelt be protected and realize its original purpose. I ask that the province not remove the proposed 7,400 acres of land to protect the integrity of the Greenbelt.

According to the notices, the removal or redesignation of 15 areas of land and adding lands in the
ParisGalt Moraine area is intended to remove regulatory burdens for municipalities in order to effectively direct growth, optimize investments in infrastructure and support needed housing.  Lands to be removed would no longer need to comply with prohibitions and requirements of the GreenBelt Plan.
As to my comments on the above, I'll quote two men and the government's own Housing Affordability Task Force.
        In an interview with The Narwhal, Victor Doyle, the former provincial planner who's credited with
being an architect of the GreenBelt, stated, ""It threatens the stability and certainty of the GreenBelt.  It
undermines its permanency.  This is the edge of the wedge that creates an incredibly powerful precedent that will weaken the GreenBelt significantly and allow it to be eroded through a death by a thousand cuts.""
        The connectivity of the GreenBelt lands was paramount in the creation of the Belt.  Animals move, water flows.  Lands on the edges are as important as those in the centers.  Doyle said connectivity was top of mind when it was designed.  The legislation that created it in 2005 may technically permit land swaps; it was never intended to allow them because the land was intentionally chosen.
         When asked about the proposed swaps, Phil Pothen of Environmental Defence stated that it will
""start a never ending queue of GreenBelt land speculators at the minister's door, each with their own convenient rationalization for paving their own patch of GreenBelt.""
           Earlier this year the government's own Housing Affordability Task Force said, ""A shortage of land isn't the cause of the problem.  Land is available, both inside existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside the GreenBelt.""  A bigger problem, the report said, is that Ontario hasn't used the land efficiently.
            Protected lands aren't protected just for people. GreenBelt lands are protected for food security in a world of climate upheaval.  GreenBelt lands are trees, marshes, rivers and streams, farmlands and they're also homes for countless species--animal, reptiles, insects, birds. What happens to the residents of GreenBelt lands that are ""swapped""?   It's pay and slay, buried alive as soon as the developers move their earth movers in.  It happens all the time.  It shouldn't be allowed to happen this time.
           There's no good reason to do any of this.

It also concerns me greatly that the property owners/speculators who purchased this property ahead of  time, are the ones that stand to benefit while the rest of us will lose so much.
We urge the Ontario Government to follow the recommendations in the Report from its own Housing Affordability Task Force that clearly states the above concerns and supplies adequate and just alternatives.

77941,/comment/77941,"The land on Garner Rd W (Map 9) is already in a busy, developed area with multiple condos and townhomes directly across the road. There are multiple retail stores just down the road. This land previously was not part of the greenbelt but was put in a few years back. Given the recent development, it's unclear why this decision was made. How can a combine harvester be expected to drive down Garner Rd in order to plough a farm? It's essentially a city zone at this point. Expecting this to be protected farmland in this area is somewhat ridiculous.
Beyond that, housing has become unaffordable for my generation. Housing prices have grown significantly beyond the rate of change in inflation and wages. One of the drivers of this is a lack of supply. This area is already developed. Why not open it up to have the remainder also be developed in line with the rest of the area? It seems an ideal area close to several amenities to build medium density housing to increase the supply of homes. The current set up of this area makes no sense. Are we truly thinking that having farmland across the road from condo and townhouse development is the ideal plan?

78037,/comment/78037,"Bill 23 needs to be rescinded!  This Bill unfortunately, is unethical and an unacceptable selling of Ontario's protected 'Greenbelt' under a disguise that it will help solve the housing crisis.  Living in a rural area of the province, very close to environmental green spaces, we have seen much new housing development due to this current governments changes to increased growth density requirements for municipalities.  Only municipalities know their required housing needs, and do so in a democratic manner, for the most part.  The majority of people requiring housing are from various demographics that will not be able to afford homes built on the 'Greenbelt' acres, that have been sold by the Ontario Government to wealthy developers.  That is a fact.  Therefore Bill 23 does not solve the issue as written.  Taking responsibility away from Conservation Authorities, Municipalities, etc. under this act, will continue to weaken Ontario's eco system to the point of no return for future generations.  Does no one in our Ontario Government care?  Didn't the Ontario Government bureaucracy pledge to be non-political; to be leaders for making the best decisions for all the people of Ontario, which includes all natural resources and the environment?    In fact, two Ontario ministries were established to ensure this!  The Ministers, Deputy Ministers and staff are responsible for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, and for the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation & Parks.  Both Ministers and those working in these ministries are responsible on behalf of all Ontarians, for Fish& Wildlife Management, Land & Waters Management, Forest Management, Ontario Parks, Forest Fire, Flood and Drought Protection and Development and applying geographic information to help manage the province's natural resources.  Bill 23 does not touch upon these critical areas in any manner that would salvage our natural resources or environment, even though over 7,000 acres of our Greenbelt will be eliminated from protection under this Bill!  So how did this legislation only focused on housing and get passed if these two important Ministries reporting to the Premier, were not consulted with critical input to Bill 23?  The title 'honourable' needs to be eliminated from many Ontario politicians who voted to legislate Bill 23.  This Bill was not put forward to a consultative, democratic manner.

78041,/comment/78041,"ERO 019-6216 Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan
As someone who lives in the Greenbelt and knows firsthand the value of these lands, and the richness of its soil, I oppose the proposal to remove 15 parcels of land from the Greenbelt. The Greenbelt was intended to offer permanent protection to natural areas and agricultural lands adjacent to Ontario’s fastest growing population centres.
The areas selected for Greenbelt protection were chosen after extensive scientific studies and public consultation. Your government should not be able to throw that in the dustbin without so much as a single explanation of what criteria was used to justify these deletions.
The excuse that these lands are needed for housing cannot be supported when your own consultant’s report said Greenbelt lands would not be needed to accommodate new housing. As well, Ontario’s municipalities have just gone through municipal plan reviews that set aside enough developable land to meet population growth until 2051.
We don’t have a housing crisis in Ontario as much as we have an affordable housing crisis in Ontario. That crisis cannot be solved by building new homes on currently unserviced Greenbelt lands. Truly affordable housing can only be built in already urbanized areas where infrastructure, transportation options, services and amenities already exist. Housing development must concentrate on the “missing middle” and purpose-built rentals, geared-to-income (whatever happened to that?) etc. Every municipality has acres of land within its urban boundaries suitable for redevelopment. This includes the single-storey commercial sprawl lining many arterial roads. Do something about that!
By putting a deadline in starting development on Greenbelt lands, you will be redirecting development away from projects scheduled for urban areas. Developers already have almost 88,000 acres of land already approved for development. What is holding them back is not the availability of land, it is a lack of construction workers, skilled trades, supplies/materials and simply the landbanking that has some developers sitting on approved parcels waiting for land values to climb so they can sell it off to others at an even greater profit.
Greenbelt land is not needed for development, but it is needed for food production.
Only 5% of Canada’s land is arable and only .5% of that is prime farmland — most of which is here is Southern Ontario and we are currently paving it over at a rate of 319 acres a day. This cannot be sustained, especially in light of the disruptions the climate crisis will have on global food supplies. For our own food security, we will need to grow more food here in Southern Ontario, not less. I recently read a press release from your government about a strategy to build the agricultural sector in Southern Ontario. It mentioned all kinds of things but not one word about protecting the farmland where food is grown. Everything depends on the soil.
The Greenbelt land that is being proposed to be removed in Grimsby is in a specialty crop area, land that is given the highest priority for protection because it is scarce and unique and if lost, cannot be recreated. With the best soils and unique microclimate, the lands between the escarpment and Lake Ontario in Niagara are uniquely capable of growing crops few other places in the Province can grow. So much of this precious growing area has already been sacrificed to expensive homes near the waterfront. We must protect what is left.
Paris Galt Moraine
Current Greenbelt land cannot simply be traded for land elsewhere. Offering to add river valleys, that are already, by their nature, protected from development to make up for taking farmland and natural areas out of the Greenbelt is a sleight of hand that everyone recognizes. In any case, it should not be about picking apart the existing Greenbelt and adding bits and pieces (again with no justification as to why particular pieces of land were chosen) for land elsewhere. It should be about protecting the existing Greenbelt with all its features and functions (agriculture, recreation, ecosystem heath, habitat protection, green infrastructure benefits) and adding more land to it so that future generations of Ontarioans can also benefit from this Province’s natural gifts.
Breaking Faith With The People
The Premier promised clearly, that this government would not touch the Greenbelt. This proposal breaks faith with the citizens of Ontario.
As you are well aware, there are serious questions about how these 15 parcels of land were selected for removal from the Greenbelt, including who will benefit at the expense of the people of Ontario, especially since several key parcels were purchased recently. This does not pass the smell test for ordinary citizens. There is a growing chorus of people who have called for investigations of various kinds into the situation. The number of people who are becoming aware, alarmed and activated is only growing. For reasons of self-preservation alone, this government should rethink these proposals.

78207,/comment/78207,"I do not support the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt area regulation as the government has made easily accessible to the public the process of selection and the selection criteria used to identify the proposed areas of the greenbelt and other protected areas that will be removed from their protected status for future development. What can be inferred from the areas selected and the information provided on the government website, these areas were selected based on their proximity to already developed areas and infrastructures. There seems to be no consideration of the environmental and social-cultural values of these sections of land to local communities. From the maps provided, it is unclear as to what types of lands have been selected and whether these lands are suitable for agricultural purposes or provide significant ecological services to those (human and non-human) that use them. It is also unclear whether these lands contain significant habitats for species protected in under the Species at Risk Act or contain significant stopping places for migratory birds - many of which are protected under the federal Migratory Birds Convention Act. Furthermore, there appears to have been no publicly available analysis is of why the area that will be added to the Greenbelt is sufficient enough to offset any future impacts from the development of the areas that will be removed from the Greenbelt. Is the area that will be added of equal or significantly greater ecological, social, economic, cultural, and environmental value that all of the areas that will be taken away from the Greenbelt? Or is it merely the same surface area? Answers to these questions should be readily accessible to the public.
To the knowledge of the public, the government has not conducted sufficient or any analysis of the environmental impacts of removing the proposed areas from the Greenbelt and other protected areas on both a local and regional scale. Moreover, there has been no indication of a potential regional or local environmental impact assessment of the development of the proposed areas into residential/urban environments. Most, if not all of the proposed areas occupy the head waters of the many watershed that feed into Lake Ontario. Future development of these areas can result in a decrease in water quality and have impacts of drinking water resources as well as impacts on aquatic ecosystems.
Lastly the proposed amendments set a dangerous legal precedent for the further reduction of the Greenbelt and other protected areas. These areas should remain protected as they have significant environmental, ecological, and social-cultural benefits. While the need for more affordable housing is entirely valid and timely, this need cannot be used as a means of pushing through changes to legislations and regulations to avoid accountability for proper decision making processes. The hyper-focus on economic and social benefits and the willful ignorance of environmental and long-term costs is a constant flaw in decision-making processes at all level of governments and it is disappointing to see it continued by the current provincial government.

78217,/comment/78217,"The proposed removal of thousands of acres from the Greenbelt under the guise of building more homes is a completely questionable act. It favors the special interests of a few large developers, seemingly who have political ties to the Premier. The argument that this move will provide significant housing is not supported by the government's own numbers, and will have significant financial impacts to municipalities and significant environmental impacts to nature and residents long term.
The proposed change would have a minimal impact on the housing need, not only numerically but because the built form - most likely large single-family detached and semi detached houses, provide a minimum of additional units at a maximum cost. This cost is not only reflected in the construction cost of each dwelling, due to the high square footage, but also due to the higher construction cost of services at the periphery of service areas. This cost is borne by fewer people, as more service infrastructure is needed per capita in suburban neighbourhoods. Additionally, this infrastructure will be more expensive to replace at the end of its lifecycle. This will further burden municipalities that already have some of the highest property taxes. The additional changes to development charges proposed in Bill 23 are an additional blow.
For this proposed change to take place, it's already been reported that this could have specific impacts on wetlands and watersheds. Further, removal of any forested areas would have additional hydrogeological impacts. Aside from the environmental impacts, there's a real material impact to residents within the watershed areas. How does the province propose to handle liability for increases flooding risk? Will houses built even be insurable long term? If the lands in question themselves aren't prone to flooding, how assured can residents downstream be that there won't be risks of flooding or other issues? These questions reinforce the reality that this proposed change is not necessary.
The recommendations this year from the Province's own housing taskforce provided suggestions, including to greatly increase as of right dwelling numbers in areas that already have development. Rather than opening up unbuilt land which is environmentally sensitive and provides substantial valuable agricultural and environmental services, the province should instead seek to encourage intensification on already built lands, and diversification of building typologies to provide a greater range of housing options than just expensive suburban sprawl.
This will both more efficiently use already built services and infrastructure, but will help to create more vibrant, diverse and liveable communities that mitigate the risk and impacts to the environment.  Further, it will help to create more financially viable communities for the long term, rather than a short term fix (that's not actually even a fix) that will leave municipalities holding the bag for decades to come.
The need to address the housing crisis and the need to mitigate the environmental impacts of sprawl, climate change, etc. are not zero sum. Rather, many well informed professionals from across the development industry have proposed a range of options for years that would balance these needs. It's absurd to believe this favouring of one solution which benefits specific developers is a better solution than a comprehensive menu of options that balances the need for housing with the need for a healthy environment for people to live in.
My comments within are largely influenced by the work of Charles Marohn and the Strong Towns approach. Rather than continuing with a ""Growth Ponzi Scheme"" which creates sprawl, damages the environment, and saddles municipalities with financial burdens and depressing environments, we should instead be building incrementally, intensively and efficiently. This will create beautiful, vibrant, environmentally sustainable and beautiful places which reflect the people who live there.
The Greenbelt lands should be protected for generations to come, and the people of the province should be granted the respect not to be sadfled by the Provincial representatives bad planning and short-sighted drive towards profit and corporate cronyism.

* withdraw the plan to remove lands from the Greenbelt;
( get on with a meaningful Greenbelt expansion that reflects public input - repeatedly promised but never delivered by the Ford government;
* follow the advice of the government’s own Ontario Affordable Housing Task Force and focus efforts on developing affordable housing on lands that have already been designated for development and have the necessary infrastructure in place. As the Housing Task Force noted, there is plenty of land within urban areas ready for development.

78292,/comment/78292,"This proposal is outrageous and constitutes yet another way of decreasing land and natural heritage protection in this province by this government to add to the multitude of other inexcusable changes that have already been made and, no doubt, will continue to be made in the future.
This government constantly sends out news releases about the help being provided to the agriculture sector on the one hand and then removes some of the best agricultural land in Canada from food production on the other hand. However, even more disgusting is the inclusion of Core Natural Areas in some of these proposed removals from the Greenbelt. We already have lost so much natural area in southern Ontario and to do so with the blessing of the government is frankly unconscionable.
As has been noted many times in the media, the government’s own Housing Affordability Task Force clearly stated that lands in the Greenbelt were not needed to address the problems with housing in Ontario. In fact, the amount of land already designated for development is far in excess of what is needed to meet long-range housing targets. That includes 86,500 acres within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area alone. There is nothing in this proposal that appears designed to build affordable housing.
So, who exactly is this government listening to when coming up with this proposal if not experts? Well, it certainly appears to be wealthy, Conservative party donating land owners and developers. There has not been a single good reason provided to justify breaking a promise that was plainly stated on many occasions, including in the following:
From the Proposed Amendment to the Greenbelt Plan - Growing the size of the Greenbelt (ERO #019-4485) posted on March 24, 2022 -
The Key Principles for Expanding the Greenbelt identified in phase 1 were also applied. In particular,
1.	No removal or land exchanges proposed
o	This proposal is about growing the size and quality of the Greenbelt, and the government will not consider the removal of any lands from the Greenbelt.
In less than eight months, has there really become more of a ‘housing crisis’ than there was at the beginning of the year? I don’t think so. Why is the size of the area of Urban River Valleys not mentioned anywhere? Why are you adding lands that are never going to be developed anyway to the Greenbelt? It isn’t a bad idea to do so, but if you are using the addition of river valleys as justification for removing upland areas then it is entirely misleading to the public to say that the size of the Greenbelt is being increased. The addition of the so-called Paris Galt Moraine lands in Erin is apparently another inclusion of lands that are already protected by the local municipality and do not constitute the majority of this valuable landform that does need protection.
This government should just honour its original promise to not touch the Greenbelt, but we all know that the decision has already been made no matter how many people provide comments on this proposal. And yet, the fact that people are still willing to spend time commenting should let you know the extent to which Ontarians are appalled by what is being proposed.

Particularly, this decision sets the precedent that policies existing for environmental purposes are smoke and mirrors, and can easily be superseded when it is convenient.

Greenbelt land is essential to: preserve healthy forests to clean the air; maintain functioning wetlands that filter water, protect our lakes and provide natural flood control; and safeguard habitats for wildlife species and populations.
Climate concerns are a top priority worldwide. Therefore, it is ludicrous that our provincial government is proposing changes that will destroy important Greenbelt land. Now, it is more important than ever to protect the Greenbelt.
People expect government to make decisions in the best interests of the public and our communities. We expect our government to improve strategies to conserve and protect lands for now and the future.
Unfortunately, the current provincial government has a different focus. That focus is on wealthy Developers, who have contributed significantly to the governing Conservative party. Developers that also purchased Greenbelt land since the Premier’s 2018 election, with the expectation that our Premier would green light rapid approval to ""build more homes faster"".
In fact, that’s exactly what our Premier did, with lighting speed!  On October 25, 2022, BILL 23, the “More Homes Built Faster Act” was introduced and it was passed by the Ontario legislature on November 28, 2022.
Regrettably, there has been no real opportunity for interested parties to weigh in on this matter, other than, of course, those with vested interests, possibly behind closed doors??
The fact that Bill 23 was passed BEFORE this ERO public comment period makes a mockery of the process.
Bill 23 will certainly have a negative impact on the Greenbelt.
Regrettably, municipal leaders, organizations and members of the public have resorted to expressing valid concerns about Bill 23 using any means possible, after it was rushed into law by the current provincial government.
Important voices and insight from experts in Ontario have been left out of the process. Why?
In fact, the province’s own experts have been ignored. Experts from the province’s Housing Task Force affirmed that enough land is available to address Ontario’s housing needs without using Greenbelt land.
The current provincial government has also fast-tracked the Bradford Bypass and Highway 413, which will also damage the Greenbelt.
Again, the province’s own experts recommended six other higher-priority highways, previously approved by the Treasury Board.
It seems obvious that the Bradford Bypass and Highway 413 were favoured by our Premier to meet the needs of the Developer's construction plans for the Greenbelt, instead of on the best financial, environmental and transportation solutions for all of Ontario.
It is a crime to see the current provincial government making plans to destroy the Greenbelt and to fast-track Bill 23, the Bradford Bypass and Highway 413 in order to benefit wealthy landowners.
It is deceitful for our Premier to suggest that it is necessary to build on the Greenbelt in order to resolve housing needs in Ontario. That is simply not true!
There is no need to trade, swap, reduce or eliminate Greenbelt lands.
Evidence is readily available to prove that Ontario can provide safe, affordable housing without creating urban sprawl, and that it is possible to do this while preserving and protecting the important Greenbelt for now and for future generations.
With determination Ontario residents, municipal and provincial leaders and organizations will continue to join together to bring the current provincial government back to reality and demand protection of the Greenbelt and it’s important natural resources, and ensure good governance for the people of Ontario.

Here I outline the most important five issues:
- Violation of an election promise and the legitimacy of the provincial election
- Violation of municipal governments and community self-determination
- Lack of need for Greenbelt Land to solve the housing crisis
- The financial burden of urban sprawl on the taxpayers in the targeted municipalities
- The environmental impact of sprawl and loss of local farmland
Premier Ford promised the public that he would not touch the Greenbelt. His election is therefore predicated on that promise. This proposed plan is a violation of that promise, in direct opposition to the will of the voters. By showing that election promises can be so casually violated, this proposal undermines the very legitimacy of democratic elections in this province.
Municipal governments across Ontario have created land use plans, based on democratic processes such as ballot initiatives and referenda. Most of these municipalities were told by their electorate: “Stop the sprawl, don’t touch the greenbelt.” The proposed plan would overrule municipal authority across Ontario. It is an overreach of provincial government power, and symbolic to the voters that we cannot trust municipal democracies. It undermines our capacity to determine and guide our own priorities as communities.
The housing crisis is real and should be one of our highest priorities, but studies have clearly shown that we have the land we need inside urban boundaries. Violating the Greenbelt solves nothing.
Urban sprawl requires far more infrastructure per capita to support. They are financially inefficient to support, requiring outside subsidy or unappealingly high property taxes. This will make these developments a financial burden on the taxpayers in the urban areas of the targeted municipalities for decades to come.
The environmental impact of increasing sprawl, as well as the loss of local farmland, is significant. Given the environmental crisis in southern Ontario and the climate change crisis in the wider world, the proposed plan is incredibly short-sighted and self-destructive.

78615,/comment/78615,"I wish to register my complete rejection of  the Bill that allows the Government to open the Greenbelt for housing construction. Ford promised not to do this and he is now breaking that promise and using the need for housing as the reason.  Meanwhile it has been proven that there is land available within cities to increase the housing stock.  Density needs to increase near transit, grocery stores and other established amenities.  Get rid of nimbyism  without destroying wetlands, farm lands and conservation areas that cannot be replaced and protect not only wildlife but areas, such as Toronto, from flooding.
We can expect more floods with increasing climate change and the Federal Govt. has said it will not help the province with funds when floods occur because Ford opened the Greenbelt. Ford is setting residents and all taxpayers up with increased costs and taxes.
I do not believe developers are going to build affordable houses on the Greenbelt.  They make more money doing 3-5K sq. ft. mansions on acre lots.  They are not going to build basic rental townhouses or apartments.  People who need affordable housing usually don't own a car nor can afford gas to get  long distances to work.  Defining affordable as 80% of the cost of other houses in the area is ridiculous.  80% of $1.5million or more is NOT affordable for most people.
The fact that developers bought much of this land in the last 4 years and one developer in the last month proves that they were given inside information that it would become valuable or they would not have bought it!! The Government is corrupt and an investigation needs to take place to determine who told what to whom and when.  There is a video of Ford speaking to a business/developer group in 2018 saying he was going to open the Greenbelt to development yet during the last election he and Clark promised not to do so.  They clearly lied.  The situation has not changed.
The feds expanding immigration and the need for affordable housing are not the reasons Ford is opening the Greenbelt.  He has other options as stated above. Immigrants are not going to be able to afford these new monster homes.  Saying others who buy them will free up more affordable homes within existing GTA is nonsense.  The homes buyers will be selling are already priced way above anything that could remotely be called affordable.  The people are not stupid.  They are furious! Quit treating us like fools and repeal your horrendous Bill NOW.
The lands you are adding to the Greenbelt do not adequately replace the type of land you plan to remove and are concentrated in the town of ERIN.  Why? Stop. REPEAL
Finally, removing development fees when builders build what your definition of affordable housing is, dramatically increases Municipal taxes.   Existing homeowners have paid their share of infrastructure costs and should not be saddled with exorbitant taxes to pay for the sewage, road, water, park, sidewalks etc of new developments. Local Councils are shell shocked by the costs that are being downloaded to them, by Ford, without any prior consultation.  Several mayors have spoken out against this Bill.  Your gift of billions to developers is at the expense of hard working citizens and is appalling.
Please listen and repeal this Bill and begin a consultative, democratic process, involving all stakeholders before autocratically legislating change that is destructive in so many ways.

78668,/comment/78668,"1. Many municipal planners have stated that there is enough land designated for housing that removing land from the Greenbelt is not necessary.
2. Scientists were involved in the original boundaries as their knowledge of the land and creatures on the land and the area underneath the land are valuable. The land underneath purifies the water, which we need to drink. The lands were carefully chosen to reflect the links that wildlife need to travel along. Scientists should be consulted before any land is withdrawn from the Greenbelt. The lands chosen to be removed should not be chosen based on their proximity to already developed lands.
3. We need our food to be secure. Removing these lands from the Greenbelt means that we will not have easy access to food. Having farms close to the communities in Southern Ontario means that the communities have a secure food source. We do not need to depend so heavily on foreign food and pay for huge transportation costs of delivery.
4. Access to nature trails is important for the mental health of our people. Having these trails within easy access to the communities in Southern Ontario is good for the well-being of all of us.
5. Housing for new immigrants should be close to transportation and jobs. They do not need big fancy houses, well spread out, with thousands of sq. ft. of living space. They need affordable houses, ones that are very unlikely to be built in the Greenbelt.
6. Adding more land is a good idea. Removing parts of the Greenbelt without understanding the basics that could be provided by scientists is unconscionable. This appears to only benefit a few already rich developers.
In conclusion, the Greenbelt should not have any land removed because scientists were not consulted, the people were not consulted, we need food security, we need nature trails within easy access, and there is enough land designated for housing without using this land.

Many of the areas targeted for removal are extremely important and sensitive lands. Some are critical for species at risk, some are designated as provincially significant wetlands, some are critical as wildlife corridors, others as ground water recharge areas. We must continue to protect these important areas in perpetuity.
There is more than enough land already set aside for development in these areas and in other municipalities across the province, as confirmed by the governments own housing task force.
That the beneficiaries of this proposal are large landowners and developers is not lost on those speaking critically of this plan.
We must do all we can to prioritize the protection of these areas, the whole of the Green Belt, for the long term. Biodiversity loss, climate change and threats to our food and water supplies should be the filter that we use for all decisions for development going forward.

I understand that some existing greenbelt areas may not be useful currently and could be developed without major or even minor environmental impacts, but....
My concerns/questions with this are:
- what studies and consulting was done with/by conservation/watershed experts and urban planners to determine the proposed areas to be opened up for development?
- what regulations are in place to insure that the developments will produce AFFORDABLE housing?
- why are development fees being off-loaded to municipalities? this seems very unfair
- what laws were broken when 8/15 of the areas in question were bought after the election and BEFORE the announcement?  I'm not a lawyer, but this looks like insider trading or something similarly very illegal
- as an aside to the above - what recourse to voters/constituents have when politicians flagrantly lie and break explicit promises? this all looks so corrupt, so even if some areas would be ok to develop, how can we trust the Ford govt to be honest and transparent in light of the apparent cronyism at our expense?

Premier Ford is on the record stating unequivocally that he promised to not touch the greenbelt. Keep your word.
This government and all government cannot remove and add lands to the greenbelt to suit your purposes.
It is outrageous that a few developers have been able to buy up some of the previously deemed protected areas within the greenbelt that are now so suddenly up for grabs. I agree with the Green Party opposition leader, Mike Schreiner, that an inquiry must be lead to determine if there were any illegal dealings in this regard.
Additionally, the Housing Commission has determined that there is enough land (88,000 acres to be precise) in our current urban boundaries to hold all needed homes, 1.5 million new homes.
There is no need to deplete or change the greenbelt outside of actually growing the greenbelt. Food insecurity is a growing concern globally and decimating this arable and vital land is definitely not a wise or economic decision for the government.
All of the points above highlight that the government needs to listen to the advice they obtained from their own Advisory Committee .. do not proceed with your current plan.

The vast majority of residents of Ontario have already expressed their opposition to opening up our natural gem, the Ontario Greenbelt, to suburban development.  The Ford Government already went on public record several times - within the past year - stating that they would NOT open any portion of the Greenbelt to developers.   In fact, this Government stated they would seek to expand the Greenbelt- so why the sudden change?    The current government DOES NOT have a mandate from Ontarians to open up the Greenbelt - not one acre - to developers.   Protecting our diminishing natural environment, farmland, wetlands and biodiversity to the benefit of all Ontarians is a fundamental mandate for any elected government - PC, Liberal or NDP - that is your job!   It's truly pathetic, with all the resources and ""intellect"" this Government has its disposal,  that the best idea for affordable housing they can come up with  is, once again, paving over the Greenbelt.
With respect to ""building homes faster"", why doesn't the government seek to work with commercial property owners to retrofit existing office buildings and vacant parking lots into residential communities? Take a stroll around the commercial office area of Renforth and Eglinton on any given workday  - it's practically a ghost town of half-empty buildings, ""For Lease"" signs, shuttered restaurants and hectares of vacant parking lots, no longer used by office workers, even before the Pandemic.   And all of these old, empty buildings are already surrounded by highways, public transit and other infrastructure.    Why can't the Regressive Conservatives work with the owners of these ghost towers and turn this massive area of West Toronto and Mississauga into  a viable mix-use community?  How about financial incentives to these commercial property owners to take down the multiple For Lease signs, and retrofit their office buildings into AFFORDABLE residential condos for first time-buyers and seniors  (not 4,000 square foot homes with three car garages that will inevitably be built on the Greenbelt).  How about a government with a long-term plan and a vision for the GTA and Ontario that goes beyond increased sprawl, cookie cutter houses and big box stores built on pristine greenspace and wetlands?   There is already existing brown and white lands earmarked for residential development.   This Government is just opening up the Greenbelt because it's easier and cheaper for Developers (which is exactly why there's been a sudden rush to buy land in the area in the past month, before the Bill was made public).
I also don't understand why it is necessary to suddenly implement a provincial Bill that essentially trumps any and all environmental standards Municipalities have in place. Builders in the City of Toronto have already been working with the city's standards for years and they seem to be doing quite well getting buildings erected.  You can't turn a corner in downtown Toronto without coming across a new construction project and the sky is filled with cranes.  So why would the Regressive Conservatives need to give Developers the power to disregard sustainable, energy efficient, bird-friendly building standards designed for the long-term benefit of future homeowners, the environment and all residents of Toronto?   Nobody, except disreputable Developers seeking to improve their profit margins, will benefit from this regressive change (was this idea ever announced during the last provincial election as a solution to the housing affordability problem  - of course not).
 Although it's obvious with the tabling of yet another Omnibus Bill of destruction, the environment and sustainable development is the last priority for this Government,  it is also clear they have a great disdain for local Municipalities and existing homeowners.   First, this Bill takes away any authority local Conservation Authorities have  to protect our watersheds or Urban Planners have to implement the Official Plans that govern the long-term vision for our communities.    Second, by cutting development fees for the Developers this government solely serves, costs to build infrastructure will now shift to the Municipalities, which in turn will be transferred to, guess who, THE TAXPAYER!

There definitely should have been much more transparency as to what this Government was planning to do and more time for public input.   The fact that the Regressive Conservatives made a point of announcing Bill 23 on a Friday afternoon, during a CUPE strike threat and IMMEDIATELY after Municipal elections with new city councils not even in place yet, proves that they (a) already know Bill 23 does NOT serve the best interests of Ontarians and (b) don't really give a damn anyways.

78816,/comment/78816,"The Ford government is proposing using up 7500 sq acres of Greenbelt space for urban development in light of the housing crisis Ontarian now face.  Yes the cost of labour and raw materials are all up due to runaway inflation but as a percentage, still less than the price of developed land.  Canada is the world's second largest country by land mass, but we as Canadians choose to live on less than 5% of that land.  Ontario alone is over 1 million sq kms of land.  7500 sq acres of land is approximately 30 sq kilometres.  That is 30 out of 1 million or less than 0.00003%.  It's the price of land in Ontario that is driving up the cost of affordable housing.  Keeping land costs at a ridiculous level is absurd.

78830,/comment/78830,"Dear Greenbelt Consultation Team,
Despite repeated promises that there would be no removal of lands from the Greenbelt, the Government of Ontario is proposing to do just that: carve 7,400 acres out of the Greenbelt for development (ERO #019-6216 and #019-6217).
Their excuse – that these lands are needed for housing – is unfounded and untrue. The amount of greenfield land already designated for development, and added to municipal settlement boundaries, but still sitting unbuilt far exceeds what is needed to meet long range housing targets. That includes 88,000 acres within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area alone.
According to Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force, “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem … land is available.” The Task Force further advised that “Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture.” (p. 10)
Harmful precedent and loss of permanent protection
The proposed removal of Greenbelt lands sets an alarming precedent, opening the Greenbelt to development at the request of those who stand to reap immense profits – and at the expense of the rest of us. Stripping these 7,400 acres of protection would unleash a firestorm of land speculation and development pressures across the entire Greenbelt.
Harm to the Greenbelt’s Natural Heritage System
Most of the lands to be removed from the Greenbelt (10 of the 14 areas shown on the maps) overlap with the Natural Heritage System, which supports “the highest concentration of the most sensitive and/or significant natural features and functions” and is meant to be managed “as a connected and integrated natural heritage system, given the functional inter-relationships between them.” (Greenbelt Plan, sec. 3.2.1)
Land swaps put the entire Greenbelt at risk
The government’s proposal of adding 9,400 acres is misleading. Some of the proposed replacement lands are already off limits for development (e.g., publicly owned lands designated as municipal parks and open space). Further, these lands were already part of the government’s previous Greenbelt expansion proposals – the Paris-Galt Moraine in 2021 and the Urban River Valleys in 2022. Those proposals went nowhere, despite great fanfare at the time. And now, the government is dusting them off to soften the blow of removing lands from the Greenbelt.
Sincerely,
A concerned citizen

78834,/comment/78834,"This response to proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan is being submitted by Climate Action Muskoka. We are individuals concerned about climate change in Muskoka. We agree that climate change is the issue of our time, that we can and must take definitive action against it and that we are stronger if we take action together. We are an inclusive non-partisan group focused on positive change. We focus locally on education, community engagement to reduce GHG emissions and collaboration with municipalities to build a more resilient community as Muskoka transitions to a post-carbon future and a clean, green and just economy. For more information about our organization please visit climateactionmuskoka.org
We are submitting our response to proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan ERO numbers 019-6216, 019-6217 and 019-6218 because their implementation will make achievement of the critical climate goals set by municipalities and regions unattainable. Indeed, it will increase GHG emissions and make it impossible to achieve the legislated commitments to GHG reductions of 50% by 2030, reaching zero by 2050.
The passing of Bill 23 and these attendant proposed amendments meant to support it are deeply connected and deeply flawed.
First, we see any intrusion into the Greenbelt as a climate catastrophe for Ontario. It opens the door to further incursions and sets a precedent which will affect municipal land use planning across the province.
Second, we see amending the Greenbelt Act, 2005 as an appalling abuse of provincial power to benefit a few PC-friendly developers, some of whom bought these specific parcels of land as late as September, 2022 bringing up the question of whether they had prior knowledge of the pending legislation to remove them from the protected Greenbelt. Calls have been launched for the Integrity Commissioner to investigate these purchases.
Third, the actual boundaries and expanse of the Greenbelt were set based on deep environmental knowledge of areas at risk, areas of high environmental significance, areas vital to the integrity of the biosphere and areas providing natural services, such as flood protection, water purifying services and carbon sequestration to the Greater Toronto area, and indeed to the climate in Ontario.  You cannot just willy-nilly substitute one natural area for another.
Bill 23 will not create affordable homes in already serviced communities, but rather accelerate climate-wrecking greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) by creating massive sprawl, more areas of asphalt, and increased fossil vehicle travel. Suburban car-dependent subdivisions are not affordable for the majority of those needing housing, nor do they provide rental options. So, to say it is meeting the housing need is a falsehood upon which amendments to the Greenbelt are being predicated. It is appalling to imagine that some of the sprawl envisioned in these amendments will extend into areas clearly protected by law in 2005.
The majority of those seeking housing in the GTA want and need both active and public transportation, including walkable communities. New builds should be required to use green building standards and to build in these already serviced urban greenfield areas, not sprawling into Greenbelt subdivisions. Existing urban boundaries in Ontario communities are more than sufficient to achieve the much-needed new attainable housing and to accommodate the predicted population increase up to 2050. Building in those areas will be the only way to reach the significant GHG reductions required by the climate imperative.
Instead, what these amendments will do is set a precedent which can be applied elsewhere in Ontario and will open the door for developers to pave over wetlands, farmlands, forests and waterways that were previously protected and are provincially significant under current OWES definitions. These wetlands are essential to addressing the climate crisis. Bill 23 exacerbates sprawl, undermines affordability, creates car dependent communities and ends the use of municipal green building standards. Bill 23 and these Greenbelt amendments in conjunction with all the other amendments planned to other Acts to enable Bill 23 goals will set Ontario on a new path with little to no consultation with Indigenous groups or the public in general and indeed will remove the democratic right to public consultation. The only winners here are the builders of new subdivisions. The losers are the citizens of Ontario, our municipalities, and everyone across Canada who is looking for leadership in developing housing that is part of the climate solution, not part of the climate problem.
Bill 23 in itself is an appalling abuse of power. In conjunction with precedents set in these amendments and in the OWES amendments, its seriousness cannot be overstated and is of particular concern to us in Muskoka. It strips municipal powers to enact any policies around land use, climate action, wetland protection, regional/District decision-making, building, and watershed-wide decision-making. It disregards Indigenous and Treaty rights. These local policies are essential to the protection of our deeply-entwined environment and economy in Muskoka.
Bill 23 gives the Province the right to supersede municipal planning decisions, which we have already seen in the province’s rejection of Hamilton Council’s decision to freeze its urban boundaries, including Official Plans; it gives the Province the right to override planning proposals and the advice of staff, including experts like the Muskoka Watershed Council, a critical science table advising local government on watershed planning; it silences Conservation Authorities (CAs) and other environmental groups protecting the Greenbelt and other environmentally sensitive areas; it withdraws the rights of citizens to be informed of new developments and of the right to appeal; it eliminates development fee revenues necessitating a rise in municipal taxes which will eliminate municipalities’ ability to hire staffing to address climate initiatives; it eradicates the ability to have watershed-wide regional planning which is already ongoing in Muskoka funded by the Ontario government; it redefines what a provincially significant wetland is; it overrides green building standards and the municipal power to require developers to build with climate mitigation and adaptation in mind; and it ensures that any significant responses to the declared Climate Emergencies in Muskoka are unattainable.
This Bill was undemocratically introduced on purpose on the day after the municipal election - at a time when municipalities were in transition disarray between the old and new councils, indeed when there was no elected government in the District of Muskoka and some of its lower-tier municipalities; it gave a very short public response timeline preventing new councils and citizens from having adequate time to consider the long-term ramifications and to respond in depth.  Indeed, even these consultations with closing dates before most new Councils have even met for the first time are unacceptable in a democracy.  We call on the ERO to extend consultations to give municipalities and other groups an appropriate amount of time to respond.
Following, please find a deeper analysis of Bill 23, Build More Homes Faster Act, and its attendant amendments to the Greenbelt Act et al. These points have been identified as key concerns by our organization.
•	Ecological, wholistic watershed planning is eradicated. It is being replaced by political boundary decision-making which will eradicate the integrated planning of lower tiers of government. As written, it will seriously compromise our region’s ability to protect wetlands, forests, farmlands and fragile ecosystems. Decision-making will be fragmented and resources inadequate to do the job in every little community. This is a gift to developers and they are celebrating. It is also a nail in the coffin of climate mitigation and adaptation.
•	Green Building Standards are gutted. The provisions of this Bill particularly attack municipalities’ ability to require green building standards some of which are already in place in many communities across the province. While our local municipalities across Muskoka were only just on the verge of developing green building initiatives, this provision will seriously impact our ability to put the necessary standards in place. This means that it will be more difficult to build energy-efficient, climate resilient buildings which are both more affordable for residents and essential if we are to meet the legislated commitments to reduce GHG emissions as adopted by both District and municipalities across Muskoka.
•	Climate Action will be restricted. We know buildings and transportation are the two highest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Implementing upfront building standards (low carbon materials, air-source heat pumps) is far cheaper than the cost of retrofits down the line and saves home-owners considerable energy costs. Bill 23 will severely restrict and even eliminate the ability of a municipality to require this upfront energy efficiency in the design of new housing.
•	Wetlands will be redefined. This legislation changes the criteria for the designation of critical wetlands and will result in the removal of some of our most essential natural heritage. The new criteria will make it difficult to protect wetlands from development. This weakens our ability to respond to climate change, maintain essential biodiversity, prevent flooding in extreme weather events and retain irreplaceable carbon sinks.
•	Conservation Authorities stripped of power. Conservation Authorities (CA) will no longer rule on the environmental impact of a proposed development on protected farmland (our food security), habitat, and waterbodies. The CA will not be able to prevent construction debris from impacting water supplies. This Bill opens the door to more contamination of land and water, more flooding and landslides. While we do not have a Conservation Authority in Muskoka, we are working hard to implement an Integrated Watershed Management Plan to make land use planning decisions to protect both the economy and ecological integrity of Muskoka, an imperative if we are to respond to the urgency of the climate crisis. This Bill will jeopardize not only our region’s opportunities to make climate responsible decisions across all jurisdictions but it will also harm climate resiliency across all of Ontario.
•	Changes to the Planning Act will impact site plan approvals. Some requirements for plans of subdivision, industrial parks, businesses and site plan approvals will not require approval. By amending sec. 23 of the Planning Act, Ministerial Zoning Orders can be used to overturn municipal decisions. This could open Muskoka to massive development exploitation at a time when protecting Muskoka for future generations has become an increasingly shared value across the District.
•	Development fees, community benefit charges and parkland requirements will be removed including but not limited to affordable housing. This will seriously diminish the ability of municipalities to do their own planning, to manage their own budget, to protect any land, or have policies to try and protect the environment or the economy.
•	Tax increases will be the only way for municipalities to pay for development when these development fees and permitting approvals are removed at the municipal level in order to expedite building. Municipalities will need to pay for the infrastructure services into these new developments in spite of being unable to collect development fees. There is no guarantee that the savings to developers to expedite building will be passed on to buyers to reduce costs and make housing more affordable.
•	It violates Treaty and Indigenous Rights. Consultation and reconciliation efforts are not addressed in this Bill. Nowhere is there room for an Indigenous voice at the table.
•	Bill 23 overrides Democratic Rights. Bill 23 removes requirements regarding public notification and public meetings on planning matters and removes the right for citizens to appeal planning decisions. These provisions infringe on our democratic rights and principles and must not be supported.
•	It overrides municipalities’ right to manage their money. Bill 23 requires municipalities to spend or allocate 60% of reserve funds annually making it difficult if not impossible to use development charges to gather funds for large infrastructure projects and for future needs for infrastructure growth.
•	Less not more affordable housing will be the outcome of this Bill. Housing experts, including this government’s own advisory board, state the urgent need for both an efficient use of limited resources, materials and infrastructure, and the need for densification in existing communities to meet the housing crisis. This bill will not deliver more housing, just bigger housing with more massive sprawl into rural areas – a developer’s dream, a climate nightmare.
The only benefactors of Bill 23 and all the subsequent amendments to the Greenbelt Act and the other various Acts will be a few developers and land speculators who will profit enormously. Bill 23 and its attendant amendments are a developers’ charter for unrestrained and unregulated growth. None of these changes will contribute to more affordable and attainable housing. Instead, they will undermine our ability to build climate resilience into livable and affordable neighbourhoods. They will gut environmental protections and prevent decisive climate action.
The Secretary General of the UN, at the opening of COP27 said, “We are on the highway to climate hell with our foot firmly on the accelerator.”  Bill 23 and its attendant amendments is a” Made in Ontario” example.
We submit our request that no amendment that takes any land out of the Greenbelt be allowed and indeed that the Act be amended to definitively state this. A further amendment to the Act needs to be that the Greenbelt is protected in perpetuity as part of Ontario’s commitment to GHG mitigation and to meeting our climate obligations to hold global temperature rise to below 1.5C.

78884,/comment/78884,"I condemn this proposal in the strongest possible terms.  This is a completely outrageous proposal that must be abandoned if there is a shred of democratic responsibility in the present government, as there is zero electoral mandate for this proposal.
As recently as the spring of this year and on this Registry, unequivocal statements were made that ""the government will not consider removals to the greenbelt"" (See Registry Postings 019-4803, 019-4483, O19-4485).  This proposal is a complete betrayal of trust, of previous commitments to the people of Ontario and of the Greenbelt Act, 2005 and Plan.
Given that no previous proposals for removal were to be considered, how was this proposal, which is based on discrete parcels of private land ownership, created?  Which landowners did the ministry or minister's office staff consult with and when?
It's clear that a few landowners have been selected based on a closed  backroom process that does not follow the directions of the Greenbelt Act and Plan itself.  For example, the proposed removals include many portions of the Greenbelt Natural Heritage System.  The Greenbelt Plan itself directs at Policy 3.4.5.1 b), that in the few instances where Settlement Area Boundaries may be expanded, they must ""not extend into the Natural Heritage System.""
The proposed rationale for removals is not credible.   The criteria for amendments contained in Policy 5.6 of the Plan have not been met.  There are no major unforeseen circumstances or major new Provincial Policy, legislation or regulations that create the need for an amendment to facilitate removals.  The Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force in its report, which was prepared and released well in advance of the previous ERO Greenbelt Consultations cited above, that: ""a shortage of land isn't the cause of the problem.  Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on developed land outside of the greenbelts."" (p. 10 of the report).   The rationale for removals presented in this posting is shamefully fallacious.
This proposal is a betrayal on every level.  For the sake of our province, our land and landscapes, our environment, our future and our children and future generations, I ask in the strongest way that the unjustified removals contained in this proposal be withdrawn.

78919,/comment/78919,"Hello, I am writing today to submit a comment to ERO 019-6216, 019-6217, and 019-6218, pertaining to redesignation of Greenbelt lands.
I am supportive of efforts to increase the supply of home as a means of countering the housing crisis. However, I am deeply concerned about the proposed changes to the Greenbelt.
We have seen over the past few years how the climate crisis is worsening, increasing severe weather and causing grave damage (for example, in Lytton BC). In Southern Ontario, one of the largest risks in a changing climates comes from flooding in population centres, and loss of viable farmland.
The changes suggested in this regulation appear set to make both outcomes worse. The wetlands in protected Greenbelt areas are essential for capturing rainwater runoff before it can flood more populous areas. In addition, by seeking to build new homes in protected areas, Ontario commits itself to expanding urban sprawl - worsening the climate crisis through increased emissions.
I urge the government to keep its promise not to touch the Greenbelt and instead look to build much more densely in urban areas, particular areas with strong transit infrastructure.
Ripping up the Greenbelt is short-sighted and dangerous, and will only make homes more expensive in the long run by imposing greater environmental risks and expanding unsustainable and inefficient sprawl. This government must take real, meaningful action to build sustainably for the future instead.

-- The premier explicitly promised not to touch the Greenbelt... it's part of why he got voted in.  Touching the Greenbelt goes against the will of the majority he is supposed to represent

78969,/comment/78969,"The Ford government has removed lands from the Greenbelt to allow for more needed housing to be built. Unfortunately, this opens rural lands to development when these areas should be left for agriculture and resilience from climate change. While housing is an issue for possible new residents to Canada, there are already ample lands designated for development within urban areas of the province. Opening Greenbelt lands to development does not address affordability of housing and the changes in Bill 23 diminish Municipalities' abilities to fund local planning. Municipalities need to be able to recover costs for development which can be extremely expensive; by removing their ability to recover costs, property taxes for rural properties will increase dramatically and will be at the expense of residents already living in their municipality. Allowing more single family units in rural areas is not the answer to housing issues and shows the government is blind to the true challenge of our time, climate change. Forests, wetlands, and meadows need to be left in their natural state to provide resilience for the coming changes to our climate. Without these natural areas, housing will be at risk following catastrophes. Sprawl into these areas that should be protected will result in higher insurance rates as more and more homes are placed in areas they should not have been built. Additionally, removing land from the greenbelt also affects agriculture. Farmland is declining in Ontario at a high rate and this will impact the ability to feed residents and our food sovereignty.
Additionally, these changes to the Greenbelt areas make it seem like the Ford government is playing favourites and removing land from the Greenbelt that will benefit a few land speculators. Without allowing municipalities, conservation authorities, planners, and residents to have a say in the individual properties being removed, conclusions are drawn that these speculators must be friends of the current government.
Without focusing climate change in legislative changes, the government will place more and more detrimental impacts on future Ontarians and fail their ability to respond and survive the future changes to the climate. Unfortunately for future residents, it is apparent that Bill 23 will create more problems just to make things easier for already well-off developers.

The result would be like applying accelerant to any land speculation fire that may currently be underway within the GB. The result would be to put land purchase values out of reach of well established farming operations, let alone any new entrants to the industry.
And the proposal in place will cause major uncertainty for any well established farming operations situated in Greenbelt. I don't understand how they will be able to make decisions to invest in farm infrastructure when there is the constant unknown of when the agrarian neighbourhood they believed they were operating in is suddenly converted to urban designation with a pen stroke. I'm not sure the provincial government would expect industry to make substantial long term investment into an industrial park, if those businesses felt that government might take the immediately adjacent lands surrounded the industrial zone and fill it with housing. Agriculture is an industry .... an industry that makes large capital investment.

This is one more example of their short-sighted plans that fail to understand or consider natural heritage planning, and the critical importance of protecting and managing natural heritage features, species and processes.  Their motives for providing more housing are highly suspect and appear to be taking advantage of the housing crisis to create opportunities for more development.
No rationale for the selection of properties to remove from the Greenbelt have been provided in this proposal.  While the properties are identified in mapping there is no supporting documentation of the rationale.  Were additional properties considered? Was an evaluation process used to identify which properties were selected? What criteria were considered?  Did the criteria include natural environment, social and cultural impacts?  Were provincial natural heritage staff and private natural heritage consultants consulted on these decisions?  How were their comments incorporated into the selection of properties?  If this type of study was not undertaken, why not?
Studies (such as How Much Habitat is Enough?, Government of Canada) have previously been completed on how much habitat we need to protect viable wildlife populations and help maintain selected ecosystem functions and attributes and we are no where near achieving it in the municipalities where changes are proposed, nor do we have plans in place to achieve the minimum targets, yet more development is proposed in these municipalities.
I ask that further rationale be provided that explains why these changes are needed in the specific locations identified as raised above.

79268,/comment/79268,"Comments on Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Area Boundary
ERO number 019-6217:
These proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan need to be put on hold until a full environmental assessment is done and a full assessment is done of the need for this Greenbelt land to be removed for housing. In addition, there needs to be proper public consultation and input from all municipalities and conservation authorities affected by the proposed amendments. The government must follow the Precautionary Principle on such an important decision.
The Greenbelt was set aside by all political parties years ago for the benefit of current and future generations of Ontarians. Any changes to it must undergo a rigorous transparent assessment. This proposal has far-reaching impacts that will be felt for generations to come. Following the Precautionary Principle, which the Ontario courts have upheld for important environmental matters, the current and future residents of Ontario deserve these amendments to the Greenbelt Plan to be put on hold until a full assessment of all the issues is done. Once the land is paved over for housing, we can never get it back.
Many issues have already been raised by local residents, academic researchers, community groups, conservation authorities, politicians and staff at all levels of government, and by urban planners.
For example, the following are just some of the issues that have been raised:
-- Earlier this year, Ontario's government-appointed Housing Affordability Task Force said a shortage of land isn't the cause of the province's housing crisis. ""Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts."" There is over 10 times as much land ready for housing development in communities where people already live. Why the rush to remove land from the Greenbelt?
-- A former provincial planner who was one of the architects of the Greenbelt, said in an interview that he worries the land swap sets a precedent for other developers to push to have their lands removed as well.
-- A Vaughan city councillor said she has received calls from developers who own land in other parts of the Greenbelt looking for municipal support to open up their properties as well. The councillor remarked that this is only the start and that there will be a flood of Greenbelt landowners lobbying to have their land removed. This sets a dangerous precedent.
-- In the recent report ""Value-for-Money Audit: Land-Use Planning in the Greater
Golden Horseshoe"" by the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario:
    ""Effective land-use planning ensures that lands, which are finite resources, are used and developed to meet the current and future needs of communities and the people who live in them, while safeguarding valuable resources such as agricultural lands, wetlands, forests, and distinctive natural features and landscapes."" The overall conclusion in the Auditor General's report: ""Our audit concluded that the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing does not have effective procedures and systems in place to ensure that land-use planning in the Greater Golden Horseshoe is consistent with good land-use planning practices, the purposes and objectives of the Planning Act, and the Growth Plan for the GGH.""
-- The Auditor General also said that Ontario is not doing enough to prevent urban flooding, a problem that is expected to worsen in the coming years with extreme rainfall events due to climate change. The findings are part of the 2022 Auditor General's Report, which points to the province's failure to clarify its commitments to manage urban flooding and a failure to adequately support municipalities to effectively tackle the problem. The Auditor General says it isn't just a problem for the three per cent of Ontarians who live near rivers. All Ontarians who live in cities, towns and smaller communities may be at risk of flooding and that not addressing the problem will be costly. The report recommends improving urban flood risk mapping and better protecting green and natural spaces such as wetlands.
-- The conservation authorities were not consulted about flood risks and biodiversity loss due to removing these lands from the Greenbelt.
-- Municipal and regional governments were also not consulted about removing these lands from the Greenbelt. Their urban planners are saying they'd much rather focus housing growth within existing urban areas, closer to existing infrastructure.
-- The United Nations is forecasting a world-wide food shortage in 2023. Climate change is reducing crop yields around the world and the problem is only going to get worse. We need the Greenbelt farmlands, some of the best in Canada, not only for our own food security, but we owe a duty of care to help feed the world.
-- The Duffins Rouge Agricultural Preserve lands in Pickering which are slated to be removed from the Greenbelt are adjacent to the Rouge Urban National Park. The lands bordering the Park are significant to the wildlife and biodiversity of the Park. There needs to be a proper environmental assessment on the impact on the Park. There should not just be an arbitrary straight line drawn north-south along the Markham/Toronto-Pickering border. In a Tweet on November 16, 2022, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (@TRCA_HQ) said ""The Province's proposed removal of nearly 4,700 acres of protected agricultural lands in Pickering, could result in unplanned urbanization negatively impacting efforts to protect Petticoat & Duffins Creek & nearby Rouge National Urban Park.""
-- Biodiversity loss from removing these lands from the Greenbelt needs to be assessed. We are in the midst of an accelerated biodiversity loss worldwide. Canada is hosting COP 15, the United Nations Biodiversity Summit, over the next couple of weeks. From a spokesperson for the Convention on Biological Diversity, ""The food we eat comes from biodiversity, the water we drink comes from biodiversity. The air we breathe [comes from biodiversity]."" The ultimate goal is to stop biodiversity loss and build a sustainable relationship with nature in response to unprecedented rates of declining nature and species extinction. The new target under the draft agreement is the much-talked about 30 by 30 goal: preserving 30 per cent of land, freshwater and oceans by 2030. Canada has already committed to that pledge. The latest figures show Canada has only conserved 13.5 per cent of its land and freshwater and 13.9  per cent of marine territory.
-- First Nations peoples have not been consulted. Mississaugas of Scugog Island and other First Nations have said that the government did not consult with Indigenous communities while developing Bill 23 and were not consulted about removing lands from the Greenbelt. Indigenous rights for consultation are enshrined in the Constitution Act under Section 35. The Constitution Act requires provincial governments to consult with Indigenous peoples before passing legislation that would directly affect their communities.

79298,/comment/79298,"Removing these particular lands from the Greenbelt and using them for housing development is unacceptable for many reasons.
1. Indigenous peoples of the areas were not consulted.
2. Wetland and riparian habitat experts show that reduction in habitat will cause further danger to already threatened wildlife species and reduce natural removal of atmospheric carbon. We are in a climate crisis and a biodiversity loss emergency where any reduction in Greenbelt lands needs to be prohibited. Wetlands are also water purifiers and are essential to cleaning the water suppluy used by several million people in the GTA.
3. Flood control experts from academia and conservation authorities indicate increased flood risk and removal of the ability to apply needed conservation efforts to reduce flood risk. Municipalities say they are not able to afford to look after flood control nor do they have the expertise to do it well. They rely on conservation authorities to have the right tools to protect people, property and natural landscapes.
4. Housing proposed will not be affordable or geared to income which is where the greatest need is.
5. Housing is too far away from the core of commerce resulting in increased need for fossil fuel use for transportation at a time when we must be drastically reducing CO2 emissions.
6. Farm land is essential to having food security and can, in no circumstances, be taken out of circulation.
7. There is enough land to create appropriate housing in better locations available now according to many sources in the GTA.
8. Urban sprawl does not have to occur if higher density development and smaller homes are adopted as the norm by urban planners in conjunction with efficient public transit.

79365,/comment/79365,"Hello, I am writing today to submit a comment to ERO 019-6216, 019-6217, and 019-6218, pertaining to re-designation of Greenbelt lands.
I am supportive of efforts to increase the supply of housing – rental and owned - as a means of countering the housing crisis. However, I am deeply concerned about the proposed changes to the Greenbelt.
We have seen over the past few years how the climate crisis is worsening, increasing severe weather and causing grave damage (for example, in Lytton BC). In Southern Ontario, one of the largest risks in a changing climates comes from flooding in population centres, and the loss of viable farmland.
If we have homes but no local sustainable food supply, we have just created another, arguably more severe, problem. During Covid, we quickly learned the fragility of supply chains and experienced empty shelves in grocery stores.
The changes suggested in this regulation appear set to make housing, climate change and food supply outcomes worse. The wetlands in protected Greenbelt areas are essential for capturing rainwater runoff before it can flood more populous areas. In addition, by seeking to build new homes in protected areas, Ontario commits itself to expanding urban sprawl - worsening the climate crisis through increased emissions and deepening our food insecurity through the loss of valuable, irreplaceable agricultural lands.
I urge the government to keep its promise not to touch the Greenbelt and instead look to build much more densely in urban areas, particularly areas with strong transit infrastructure. People also want a reasonable commuting distance from home to work. There is no joy in having a home you seldom see because you are commuting hours a day to and from work. This also reduces the negative aspects of commuting, usually in single occupant vehicles, which helps in the climate change fight.
Ripping up the Greenbelt is short-sighted and dangerous, and will only make homes more expensive in the long run by imposing greater environmental risks and expanding unsustainable and inefficient sprawl. This government must take real, meaningful action to build sustainably for the future instead.

79442,/comment/79442,"This proposal should not be adopted for many reasons.
1.) There has been an absence of meaningful consultation with First Nations, as publicly admitted by Minister Clark. Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan will have profound impacts on treaty lands across Ontario.
From your own Ontario Government websites:
“Ontario, as the Crown, has a legal obligation to consult with Aboriginal peoples where it contemplates decisions or actions that may adversely impact asserted or established Aboriginal or treaty rights.”
“The Crown has a duty to consult with Aboriginal peoples when the following conditions occur:
The Crown has knowledge, real or constructive, of the existence, or potential existence, of an Aboriginal right or treaty right; and The Crown contemplates conduct that might adversely affect the right in question.”
Canadian courts have affirmed that governments have a duty to consult Indigenous people on projects affecting their rights or on their territories. It is obvious that the provincial government has not worked to incorporate traditional indigenous knowledge in these proposals. As this is a federal requirement, adopting these proposals without consultation could open up the project to federal impact assessment.
Finally, from the Greenbelt Plan itself:
“The First Nations and Métis communities within the Great Lakes region are essential partners. They have a unique relationship with the land and its resources. Ontario, including the area covered by the Greenbelt Plan, is largely covered by a number of Treaties that provide for treaty rights. In addition, Aboriginal communities may have Aboriginal rights within the Plan area. Ontario recognizes the unique role that Indigenous peoples have had and will continue to have in the growth and development of this region. Through their historic relationship with the lands and resources, Indigenous communities have gained traditional knowledge that is of significant value to the planning decisions being made today.”
2.)According to your own study, Report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force, February 8, 2022, (page 10) it is outdated zoning rules that are causing the housing crisis.
Your study states:
""Too much land inside cities is tied up by outdated rules.""
""Most of the solution must come from densification. Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture.""
""Allowing more gentle density also makes better use of roads, water and wastewater systems, transit and other public services that are already in place and have capacity, instead of having to be built in new areas.""
And finally,
""But a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the [housing] problem. Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts.""
Opening up Greenbelt lands to development to solve the housing crisis is a not supported by the current government’s own research and recommendations.
3.)Removal of Greenbelt land protections in order to open up natural heritage areas to development will increase fragmentation of habitat.
Habitat fragmentation occurs when large blocks of habitat are cut into smaller pieces by development such as roads or housing. The remaining blocks of habitat may be too small to sustain populations of a number of species and the fragmentation often results in barriers to species movement.
Fragmentation also leads to biodiversity loss:
“A synthesis of fragmentation experiments spanning multiple biomes and scales, five continents, and 35 years demonstrates that habitat fragmentation reduces biodiversity by 13 to 75% and impairs key ecosystem functions by decreasing biomass and altering nutrient cycles. Effects are greatest in the smallest and most isolated fragments, and they magnify with the passage of time. These findings indicate an urgent need for conservation and restoration measures to improve landscape connectivity, which will reduce extinction rates and help maintain ecosystem services.”
Swapping acres for acres does not reflect the complexities of local ecosystems, natural corridor systems, nor the species that rely on them for survival. Merely mapping additions and subtractions to the Greenbelt lands do nothing to take into account the distinctiveness of the habitats involved nor the quality of the habitats being exchanged.
4.) Removal of Greenbelt land protections will increase fragmentation of protected countrysides.
Allowing fragmentation is in direct opposition to the listed vision 1.21. of the Greenbelt Plan which : “protects against the loss and fragmentation of the agricultural land base and supports agriculture as the predominant land use”
as well as the 1.2.2 Protected Countryside goals which includes: “c) Protection of prime agricultural areas by preventing further fragmentation and loss of the agricultural land base caused by lot creation and the redesignation of prime agricultural areas
Ontario farmland is a precious commodity which we should be preserving for our current and future food security.
The proposed amendments to the Greenbelt plan are in direct opposition to the recorded vision and goals, as well as the spirit of the Greenbelt Plan. Adoption of these amendments does not respect the legal obligation the Ministry and the Government of Ontario have to meaningful consultation with First Nations as set out by both the provincial and the federal government guidelines. These amendments are not supported by the Ontario Housing Affordabilty Task Force.

79445,/comment/79445,"I am writing to express my anger and opposition to the proposed changes to the Greenbelt Area Boundary. I can’t grasp how a government could propose such drastic changes to so many provincial Acts and Regulations concurrently with minimal public commenting period with no previous proposals being made public for discussion prior to the formal ERO postings.
These are difficult times and made worse by the pace of these profound changes to provincial regulations, how can experts, municipalities, conservation authorities (CA), Indigenous Peoples and the public possibly be able to review, understand, digest and comment on all these changes in such a short amount of time. It’s simple, they can’t, even all the municipalities, CA’s, experts, professional associations can’t appreciate all this change at once. These changes cascade through many acts and regulations, a process like the Sewell’s Planning and Development Reform Commission should be convened to study these changes before they are implemented – “Says better use must be made of existing City space rather than allowing continuous expansion” (1991).
All this regulatory change proposed with an ongoing pandemic creating the worst times for our hospitals with surgeries, diagnostic tests, and treatments being postponed by the thousands, hundreds continue to die every month and experts warn it’s going to get worse through the winter months – collateral damage the government does not care about. Following a municipal election where new councils have yet to be sworn in, with no meaningful involvement of experts, municipalities, conservation authorities, interest groups, the public, and little supporting information and analysis provided to justify the need for the most profound changes to municipal and environmental planning ever seen in the history of the province.
Given the breadth and depth of these changes clearly the government had been planning these significant changes for some time, why were these not outlined in the Conservative Party election platform this past summer? Oh, I know why, the Conservative Party did not have a platform, nor would their candidates participate in public meetings and forums, and a leader that would not take questions – How’s that for democracy!!!
The removal of these significant protected lands within various GTA municipalities will result in the loss of significant habitats, linkages, carbon sequestration, places for people to enjoys in Vaughan, Richmond Hill, King Township, Stouffville, Markham, Clarington, Ajax, Hamilton, Niagara, and other areas proposed for the provinces land grab. Shifting most of the replacement lands to one small community west of Caledon will have no measurable benefit to the residents of these communities. The new lands do not come close to being equivalent lands.
Furthermore, these lands do not create new ecological areas they already exist it’s just a mapping change, however, the newly designated lands proposed for development will result in a significant loss of key natural heritage features that sustain our ecosystem and ourselves. Allowing the loss and attempting ecological offsetting does not work (most of these areas fail or do not result in the replacement of equivalent features and functions). With the provinces refining of ecological offsetting this transfers the costs to environmental organizations and subject communities to try and recreate wetlands, forests, and other significant habitats that history has shown do not work. These biologically, complex features were created over hundreds and thousands of years.
I have been in the environmental and planning field for over 30 years when I started my career Ontario was at the forefront of environmental planning and regulations, unfortunately we are now near the bottom and the proposed changes in Bill 23 and accompanying regulations will accelerate this process.
Through Bill 23 the government has produced a narrative of a false crisis to support changes to various regulations and the Greenbelt boundary area. There is no shortage of developable lands in the current Greenbelt area, as detailed by Environmental Defense in the existing areas identified for development are enough for 25+ years. There is “no crisis” and there is no shortage of developable land within the protected Greenbelt. Yes, there is a shortage of affordable housing, and if the government truly wanted to address that problem, they would have consulted with experts, municipalities and the public not just their developer friends.
If it is affordable housing the province wants then why are the new lands not automatically designated for multi unit dwellings, i.e., Townhouses, low rise apartments, high rise apartments. How will these changes make developers build affordable housing when they won’t build it now? Tens of thousands of building permits currently sit idle in the GTA; houses are not being constructed developers are just sitting on the approvals and crying that they need easier to develop sprawl lands for their profit-making machines.
What do the people you say you care so much about get? - they get to lose their rights to participate in planning matters that may directly impact their daily lives, uncoordinated and piecemeal planning by over 400 municipalities, fewer and more expensive homes, the right to pay higher municipal taxes to pay for the millions of dollars of lost development fees going into the pockets of developers, the right to be put in harms way due to the acceleration of climate change that will come from these ill conceived policies – increased flooding, rising temperatures and drought the right to watch our natural features and farmland destroyed and paved over.

This will further increase city sprawl which negatively impacts other aspects of our lives including pollution caused by city sprawl (more reliance on vehicles) and the destroying of natural habitats for wildlife. This does not help our fight against climate change. There are other ways to build more housing. There is also no guarantee that this will help with housing affordability.

79476,/comment/79476,"First, there is plenty of room for housing outside of the Greenbelt.  There is no need to ""re-jig"" the Greenbelt boundaries for the purpose of building homes.
Second, this proposal indicates that 50,000 units (""or more""?  Not the most helpful statement) will be built on 7400 acres.  That's 50,000 units on just under 3000 hectares.  That's 16.7 units per hectare.  That is LOW DENSITY housing.  Monster homes will not do ANYTHING to help solve Ontario's housing issues.  Monster homes built in what IS CURRENTLY PROTECTED GREENBELT LAND will benefit very few people, and the average taxpayer isn't one of them.
Third, a change to the Greenbelt boundaries sets a DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.
Fourth, much of the land that is proposed to be added to the Greenbelt is ALREADY PROTECTED.  So the amount of protected land would actually decrease if this dangerous precedent were to be set.
Fifth, why on earth would we develop agricultural land?  Are we not trying to buy local?  Are we not trying to increase our food independence?  Many farmers live on the Greenbelt:  they grow our food.
Finally, why on earth would you spend your political capital on attacking the Greenbelt?  It makes ZERO sense, especially when we the people KNOW that 700 acres of currently undevelopable land was purchased in September of this year!  It is INSULTING that you think we Ontarians wouldn't take note of who is buying land in the Greenbelt.  Equally insulting is your disregard for one of the crown jewels of Ontario:  the Greenbelt.  We love the Greenbelt for many reasons, not the least of which being that we KNOW it will STILL BE THERE for generations to come.
I strongly urge you to take notice of the many rallies that have been held in Ontario over the past two weeks.  Hundreds of people have shown up to protest this proposed change to the Greenbelt.  Hundreds will continue to protest against Bills and changes to policy statements that are deleterious to the health and well-being of the land, water, and people of Ontario.

79491,/comment/79491,"Hello, I am writing today to submit a comment to ERO 019-6216, 019-6217, and 019-6218, pertaining to redesignation of Greenbelt lands.
I am supportive of efforts to increase the supply of home as a means of countering the housing crisis. However, I am deeply concerned about the proposed changes to the Greenbelt.
We have seen over the past few years how the climate crisis is worsening, increasing severe weather and causing grave damage (for example, in Lytton BC). In Southern Ontario, one of the largest risks in a changing climates comes from flooding in population centres, and loss of viable farmland.
The changes suggested in this regulation appear set to make both outcomes worse. The wetlands in protected Greenbelt areas are essential for capturing rainwater runoff before it can flood more populous areas. In addition, by seeking to build new homes in protected areas, Ontario commits itself to expanding urban sprawl - worsening the climate crisis through increased emissions.
I urge the government to keep its promise not to touch the Greenbelt and instead look to build much more densely in urban areas, particular areas with strong transit infrastructure.
Ripping up the Greenbelt is short-sighted and dangerous, and will only make homes more expensive in the long run by imposing greater environmental risks and expanding unsustainable and inefficient sprawl. This government must take real, meaningful action to build sustainably for the future instead.
Sincerely,

79517,/comment/79517,"1. In the face of unprecedented and accelerating biodiversity loss and the ever-worsening climate crisis, it is vital for the well-being of all Ontarians that your government do its utmost to protect the farmland, wetlands, forests, rivers and other natural areas that sustain us. As Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force explained in its 2022 report, we DO NOT need to sacrifice environmental protection to address the housing crisis. That’s because “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the problem.” (p.10) There is a vast supply of land already open for development within existing municipal settlement boundaries. Indeed, it is irresponsible and arrogant to ignore these environmental protection imperatives in the interest of financial profit for the few.
2. Replacement of the Provincial Policy Statement, which provides strong protections for Ontario’s farmland and natural heritage with a new planning policy instrument that would remove or streamline existing policies to facilitate development, sets the stage for interference with the autonomy of municipalities to establish planning that benefits and protects the local citizenry.  Local conservation authorities have the expertise to assess and monitor the health of flood plains, water supplies and ecosystems.  This crucial role of the CAs needs to be reinforced and respected, NOT decimated!
3. Creation of a natural heritage offsetting policy that could lead to widespread and extremely risky trade-offs, where existing natural areas are sacrificed on the highly questionable premise that they can be recreated or restored elsewhere. Greasing the wheels of destruction would be a “pay to pave” natural heritage compensation fund, which would allow developers to destroy wetlands, woodlands and other wildlife habitats as long as they pay into the fund.  This is folly and not supported by environmental science.  Once gone, these sensitive habitats and ecosystems, centuries in the making, will NOT be able to be restored or recreated.  Again, this policy is dangerous to Ontarians.

White belt land is already allocated for adequate housing for decades.

and Boundary Regulation 019-6217and the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan 019-621
The  removal of 7,400 acres from 15 different areas of the Greenbelt is a breach of trust by Premier Doug Ford. Mr. Ford, you promised: ""The people have spoken. I'm going to listen to them, they don't want me to touch the Greenbelt, we won't touch the Greenbelt.""
This was a very important promise – a promise to uphold the vision brought into reality by a previous government, a promise that was necessary because if the Greenbelt is not a permanent land-use feature, its protective function ceases. As soon as it is possible to take land out of the Greenbelt, whether it’s a large chunk or small, for good reason or bad, all decision-making becomes distorted by political influence and the prospect of profit.
That’s why adding 9,400 acres from other areas is no solution at all, particularly if, as is widely reported, much of this land is already protected.
The fact that some landowners will make a fortune from these amendments is deeply offensive.
I believe that the Greenbelt should be expanded. We in Simcoe County suffer a leapfrog effect as developers ignore the development land that exists within the boundaries of Greater Golden Horseshoe municipalities and pursue cheaper farm or natural heritage land. The government’s proposed erosion of residents’ long-established rights to be heard on what happens in their neighbourhood and the proposed dismantling of the precautionary effect of sourcing data and comment from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and Conservation Authorities makes this leapfrog effect all the more threatening. Please expand the Greenbelt into Simcoe County.
The notion that the Greenbelt lands will be suitable for the immigrant populations the Premier says he aim to serve is preposterous. Immigrants need to settle in urban centres where they can find communities of similar culture, services adapted to their needs, employment, good public transportation, affordable rental accommodation and accessible green space. This plan does not serve immigrants, neither does it serve low-income people struggling to find affordable housing.
Chipping pieces out of the Greenbelt, along with other policies introduced in the Bill 23 package, put many species at risk at even higher risk. I am a steward of the land where I live, I owe respect and care to the land, the creatures with which I share it, and the photo-synthesizing trees, grasses and other plants that support all life. This complex web is clearly not of concern to the current government. It is of major concern to me.
These amendments also show that Ontario has no intention of implementing land use policies that seriously address climate change. We need to protect our tragically shrinking agricultural land base against loss and fragmentation, and extend protection of natural heritage and water resource systems that sustain ecological and human health.
As a Canadian citizen I am a party to the treaties signed with First Nations and I object strongly to the Ford government’s failure to consult First Nations on these amendments. They are entitled to proper consultation based on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and on the duty to consult arising from Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.
I am embarrassed by the casual and ham-fisted way the Ford government approaches lawmaking. How should it happen? RESEARCH into legal, scientific and administrative implications, PUBLICATION, CONSULTATION, REFLECTION, PROPOSAL, FEEDBACK, DEBATE followed by, if possible, CONSENSUS and LEGISLATION. In contrast, we have poorly formulated ideology rammed through at a time of hiatus at the municipal level of government which is the most affected by these amendments.
To take one example of how the process was working, Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force seemed to be a sensible step in CONSULTATION. It found that a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the housing affordability problem. In fact, 86,000 acres are available for development within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area alone. “Most of the solution must come from densification,” the Task Force recommended. “Greenbelts and other environmentally sensitive areas must be protected, and farms provide food and food security. Relying too heavily on undeveloped land would whittle away too much of the already small share of land devoted to agriculture.”
So what happened? A PROPOSAL that reflected none of these recommendations delivered with just days for FEEDBACK and DEBATE. The result - political CHAOS and the enactment of deeply flawed LEGISLATION. We, our children and future generations are fated to live with the consequences.

79645,/comment/79645,"I strongly oppose the proposal for several reasons:
- the greenbelt constraint on urban land zoning is an important constraint that incentivizes thoughtful and purposeful land use in the GTA, and is necessary to combat the problem of urban sprawl
- the environmental importance of the habitats and watershed areas of the golden horseshoe must be understood as a complex and interconnected natural system that other human systems (i.e. our agricultural and hydrological usage) must be in balance with
Furthermore, the purported reasons and benefits given by the government are cynically wrong and disappointing:
- the only people in Ontario who benefit from building more overpriced subdivision houses in cookie-cutter communities are the *developers* who bought up farmland 20+ years ago and are fast bedfellows with anyone who will stamp permits
- the provincial government is peddling a cynical line that more land is needed to house people immigrating to Ontario due to the massive immigration quotas that the federal and provincial governments are pushing. This is at best half-true: if 0.5M people are to immigrate to Ontario, the housing they need should still be built in appropriate locations, spread throughout the province to repopulate centres that have been depopulating for decades---there is no expedient need to touch the greenbelt. However note that this immigration polity is itself poorly conceived; rather than address the actual budgetary problem Ontario faces---the cost associated with an aging population by reforming and limiting OHIP costs (which form 50% of the budget, in which high-cost users consume 80% of the resources)---the short-sighted solution to bring in more workers to even out a population pyramid is being peddled. The solution is not more revenue: the solution is to control and cap costs, and require people to use private insurance beyond yearly OHIP maximums. The immigration policy creating an influx of 5M people yearly is the driving force of housing pressure and subsequent property-related inflation, and the provincial government's short-sighted proposal to pave over the greenbelt in response to their own poorly conceived policies and inability to address the root cause is disappointing.
I strongly disagree with the destruction of the natural environment systems we rely on in this province; it only profits developers, creates more urban sprawl, and abets ridiculous healthcare and immigration policy that are the root causes of inflation and cost-of-living crises.

From:  Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, 2017, Introduction-context paragraph 5
This isn't permanent protection.  The rationale you are using to remove land from the Greenbelt can be used over and over to justify continuous removal of land.  This completely defeats the purpose of the Greenbelt.
The ecosystems, farmland, biodiversity, the values that these lands are supposed to preserve, cannot ever be replaced with substitute land.  That land is not the same and there is illusion in designating another piece of land as part of the Greenbelt.  Expanding the Greenbelt is fine, but the land removed represents a permanent, irreplaceable loss.
The Greenbelt should not be changed except to add to it.  Over the last 200 years we have irrevocably altered the ecosystems around us.  We cannot get them back so we must protect what we have left.  That’s what the Greenbelt was created for.  As people, we need abundant natural spaces near our urban centres.  There must be space for other species besides humans, not only for their sake but for ours.  We cannot survive without nature.
We also need farmland close to where people live. It is imperative that we preserve the farmland we still have to feed our own population into the future when it may not be possible to import as much food as we do now.
The Greenbelt should never be diminished, only expanded.
This policy represents the beginning of the end of the Greenbelt.
For the Province to not see this suggests severe ignorance or a huge blind spot on their part.
We know that many developers have been lobbying hard for the opening of the Greenbelt.  This isn’t about any noble goal of creating housing, but rather, making heaps of money, beginning with a source of cheap land.
Destruction of the Greenbelt is completely unnecessary to achieve the Province's housing goals.  Many municipalities have good plans to address the need for more housing without overdeveloping our rural/green spaces. My municipality (Quinte West) is one of them.
The provincial housing goals come across as an excuse, not a good reason, to open the Greenbelt for development.   Ultimately, we gain urban sprawl, bad urban planning.  We lose a precious resource in the Greenbelt.

I am writing to provide feedback in response to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing’s Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan, as posted on the Environmental Registry of Ontario for consultation (ERO number: 019-6216).
I do not support removing lands from the Greenbelt Area and I do not support the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan (ERO 019-6216), or to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation O. Reg. 59/05 (ERO 019-6217), or to the Proposed redesignation of land under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan O. Reg. 140/02 (ERO 019-6218).
Established under the Greenbelt Act, 2005, the Greenbelt is a broad band of protected land that currently includes over 800,000 hectares of land in the Greater Golden Horseshoe. It is covered by the policies of the Greenbelt Plan, as well as the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and the Niagara Escarpment Plan. Collectively, these plans identify where major urbanization should not occur. The plans provide permanent protection to the agricultural land base and the ecological and hydrological features, areas and functions within the Greater Golden Horseshoe and beyond.
While I support efforts to address the affordable housing crisis in Ontario, I do not support your proposal to remove about 7,400 acres in 15 different areas from the Greenbelt, which was created to protect environmentally sensitive regions from development. Especially since 14,000 hectares of non-Greenbelt land was released for development.
The government’s proposal contradicts its previously stated public commitments to protect the Greenbelt; it undermines the importance of green space and the impact of climate change; and it does not solve Ontario’s housing crisis or realistically acknowledge the issues that have led to the crisis.
The Greenbelt protected area must remain protected, it must not be cut, and lands must not be moved.
Current Proposal Contradicts Previous Commitments
The current proposals directly contradicts previous government statements on protecting the Greenbelt.
In March 2022, your Ministry held a consultation on Proposed Amendment to the Greenbelt Plan - Growing the size of the Greenbelt (ERO 019-4485), which stated that the Key Principles for Expanding the Greenbelt include:
No removal or land exchanges proposed: “This proposal is about growing the size and quality of the Greenbelt, and the government will not consider the removal of any lands from the Greenbelt.”
No policy changes proposed that would reduce existing protections in the Greenbelt
And in February 2021, when confirming plans to expand the protected area by adding a moraine south of Toronto and a series of urban river lands, you are quoted as saying:
""I want to be clear: we will not in any way entertain any proposals that will move lands in the Greenbelt, or open the Greenbelt lands to any kind of development.”
The Ministry’s news release, Ontario Takes Steps to Grow the Greenbelt, on February 21, 2021, further supports the government’s statements not to develop the Greenbelt:
""The Premier has been steadfast in his commitment to protect the Greenbelt and our government will not consider any proposals to remove or develop any part of it.""
Protecting the Environment
The Greenbelt was created to protect agricultural and environmentally sensitive lands in the Greater Golden Horseshoe area from development and it should remain that way. It is vital to the well-being of our province, our environment, and our citizens.
It safeguards the resources that clean our air and water, reduces flood risks, provides a home for wildlife, and ensures Ontario communities have greenspace.
The Greenbelt is an important source of local food and its agricultural activities are an important contributor to the economy. In 2020, the Greenbelt's agri-food sector generated an estimated $4.1 billion in GDP and close to 59,000 jobs (source: Understanding How Greenbelt Agriculture Feeds the Regional Economy and Greenbelt Farmers)
In addition to the agri-food contributions, the Greenbelt is also home to some of the world’s most fertile soil and represents some of our most productive growing regions, which is critical to preserve, especially in light of food security concerns.We need the Greenbelt for our collective resilience.
The Greenbelt’s forests help clean and have a role in helping to mitigate climate change, as trees capture and store carbon, and they also provide habitat for birds and other species, while wetlands filter our water. The Greenbelt is home to 78 at-risk species, and important habitats - forests, wetlands and grasslands.
Wetlands also protect from flooding, drought and climate change. Wetlands in Ontario’s Greenbelt were estimated to provide $380 million in flood mitigation per year, according to the report Green Infrastructure in Ontario: Economic Impact Assessment (June 2020). As climate change continues to impact our province and increase flood risks, we must protect our wetlands as part of the Greenbelt.
The report goes on to explain that Ontario’s Greenbelt is estimated to provide ecosystem services of about $3.2 billion annually, and that the forest cover provided $18 million worth of health benefits annually.
A previous report, Ontario’s wealth Canada’s future: Appreciating the Value of the Greenbelt’s Eco-Services, quantifies the annual value of the ecosystem services provided by the Greenbelt at an estimated $2.6 billion, which would be over $40 billion since the establishment of the Greenbelt. The report goes on to explain:
The Greenbelt’s wetlands and forests hold the greatest value, worth over $2.3 billion. Wetlands are worth an estimated $1.3 billion per year ($14,153/hectare) because of their high value for water regulation, water filtration, flood control, waste treatment, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Forests provide key services worth $989 million each year because of their importance for water filtration services, carbon storage services, habitat for pollinators, wildlife, and recreation. The Greenbelt’s agricultural lands total value is also substantial at an estimated $329 million per year including cropland, idle land, hedgerows, and orchards. Key values include the pollination value of idle land and hedgerows, the storage of carbon in soils, and the cultural value of agricultural lands.
Proposing to cut the Greenbelt, add lands elsewhere, or exchanging unprotected land for protected land, threatens the stability of the Greenbelt and the important benefits the Greenbelt provides to Ontarians, the environment, and our economy.
The Greenbelt protected area must remain protected, it must not be cut, and lands must not be moved.
Ontario’s Housing Crisis
A housing plan must not come at the expense of the environment.
The housing crisis in Ontario is complex with many causes. While supply is an important factor, it is not the only factor.
Ontario’s affordable housing crisis is not new, but has become more severe, especially over the past few years with home prices up by 44% in 2021 since 2018, according to Generation Squeeze Lab’s Report.
Speculation has been a significant issue with homes increasingly being treated as an investment, like stocks and bonds, instead of a basic human right to shelter.
It is also important to focus on creating affordable housing, which would help stabilize rental markets and ease competition.
Some other options to consider may include:
Eliminating the land transfer tax for first-time buyers or increasing the existing rebate;
Managing unregulated rent increases;
Implementing progressive property taxation, which would disincentivize property flipping and renting out properties to the highest bidder;
Stronger restrictions on foreign investment;
Requiring beneficial owners of real estate to identify themselves to land title authorities, and to make that information transparent and publicly available, to address opaque ownership concerns and other conditions that make real estate markets vulnerable; and
Identifying appropriate and non-protected land to create new supply while holding developers accountable.
It was also recently reported that Ontario has dedicated 14,000 hectares of land for urban development in municipalities in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, showing that land is already available (CBC News, November 12, 2022).
And it is important to note that the Greenbelt was created to restrict urban sprawl, and the government’s current proposal would create more sprawl. Any new housing should be built where there are existing roads, parks, transit, schools, and not on protected land.
There is no single solution to addressing Ontario’s housing crisis and restoring affordability, but trading off environmental protection and conservation is not the answer.
Conclusion
The Greenbelt protected area must remain protected – it is vital to the well-being of our province, our environment, and our citizens — and it must not be cut and lands should not be moved. I do not support the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan (ERO 019-6216), or to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation O. Reg. 59/05 (ERO 019-6217), or to the Proposed redesignation of land under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan O. Reg. 140/02 (ERO 019-6218).
Thank you for your consideration.

79764,/comment/79764,"The proposed deletions to the Greenbelt are unnecessary at this time.
1) There are Brownfield lands, redundant Municipal and School Board lands, etc. available  that have not been fully reviewed to date.
2) Have you not learned anything about building in inappropriate lands such as floodplains and watersheds? The impact in B.C. a year ago for building in an old lake? the flooding in Florida and in our Canadian Maritimes?
3) Farmland can not be replaced. We need it now! Please focus on helping the Agricultural community to make farming as profitable as you appear to be making the developers. Protect our food chain and support local.
4) Support the local municipal ratepayers! Adding the land suggested will add costs to the municipality that are not supported by the Development Charges that the provincial government is planning to remove for developers.
5) Hopefully the current Provincial Government is a government of its word. How many times did the Premier say that he would not develop the Greenbelt and now is proposing to do so? The videos of the closed door meeting with developers prior to the 2018 causes intense suspicion.

79796,/comment/79796,"The greenbelt portion of land on 4818 King Street should be added to the proposed greenbelt amendment.  Approximately 8 of the 31.5 acres I own is designated as greenbelt land.  It is a small, narrow and oddly shaped strip of land which splits my property.  Its position is inconsistent with other greenbelt zoning as it is within the urban area.  This anomaly has negatively impacted urban development ability of this area. See Figure 1 (attached).
It appears that the greenbelt was possibly drawn in error.  There’s nothing else like it.  In Lincoln, the vast majority of the greenbelt land is north of King Street and south of Fly Road.  The green belt anomaly on my property is south of King Street in the corner of an urban area.  It doesn't extend to Aberdeen Road or Hillside Drive, but it blocks the final piece of potential development land in that corner.  This is inconsistent with other green belt zoning and seems arbitrarily placed. The greenbelt land in question is highlighted in red in Figure 2(attached).
According to the policy for removal of lands from the Greenbelt, we meet the criteria.
•	It is negotiable
•	It has a potential for homes to be built in the near future
•	It is near existing green belt boundaries, but completely out of place
•	It is adjacent to an existing urban area
•	It is near readily serviceable land.
4818 King Street is partly zoned as residential but interrupted by the greenbelt land on my property. We have evergreen trees in the greenbelt land and the adjacent residential zoned area.  Of the greenbelt land that runs through the property, less than half is evergreen trees (approx. 3 out of 8 acres), and the rest is ravine  (approx. 5 of the 8 acres).  See Figure 3 (attached).
To boost supply of housing, it would be in the best interest of the province to negotiate/remove the arbitrary positioning of the green belt in this quadrant and open up the Aberdeen/Hillside corner.

79799,/comment/79799,"We need our Oak Ridges Moraine and wetlands to be protected from development so they can handle rain and snow melt before flooding occurs.  We are paving over the lands that protect us and provide for us by managing water, by growing our food and by cleaning our air.
Our wetlands and forests are mostly gone already, and as a result, have more flooding impacting more homes and families, and 1 in 5 animals in the province of Ontario is in danger of extinction!
We need to protect our farmers, not our developers, for they provide for our daily sustenance.  Who knows how long 'just in time' delivery will be possible and we may need to rely on our local food sources.  Look at how our finely-tuned logistics for world trade was broken during covid, and we could not get many needed items, including more recently a popular item like aspirin.  We have lost millions of dollars in PPE and vaccines that were needed, delivered and then couldn't be used.  What waste!  And what new diseases will we being hurriedly have to respond to with climate change/environmental immigration/crop failure?
Bill 23 and its effects will clearly ignore the protected boundaries of animal habitat and travel . You can't swap one piece of land for another. Studies in the USA and other areas show the fallacy of land swapping, and it's only used as a last resort, not the first choice.  It is clear that the areas chosen are linked to other desirable neighbourhoods, favourable to the rich and not affordable for the average citizen, especially newcomers who often cannot get employed in their chosen profession.
I despair with this government, its gutting of agencies which protect people,  land and our democracy.  This decision should go to a plebiscite when it impacts so many people negatively.

79823,/comment/79823,"The proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation are an egregious, short-sighted travesty:
- of our democratic processes (the Premier promised the area would not be touched - and likely garnered some voting support from this promise);
- of Ontario's environmental protection initiatives (why was the Greenbelt created in the first place?);
- of Ontario's climate change initiatives (we need to preserve green spaces to help offset our carbon emissions); and
- of current knowledge and best practices in urban planning (spread up, not out, when looking to accommodate increasing urban populations), not to mention that the Ontario Housing Commission states that there is sufficient land available without touching the Greenbelt).  Sadly it is becoming very apparent that sound urban planning principles are NOT what is guiding the Ford government in their decision regarding the diminishing of the Greenbelt.  The following is an excellent summary of modern urban planning principles and should be read and embraced by the Ontario government:  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-generation-cities-best-practices-su….
I am sickened by the disrespect being shown, via this proposed amendment, to the land, the air, the flora, and the fauna (including the people who have the honour to call Ontario home), and to all the hard work of previous governments to establish the protected Greenbelt space.
There is no need to remove land from the Greenbelt.  Premier Ford and his government must not proceed with this amendment.  If this amendment goes through the history books will recognize that the Ford government CONTRIBUTED to climate change by facilitating urban sprawl, leading the to increased use of fossil fuels for transportation, and by reducing the protective band of land in southern Ontario.  At this point in our province's history, we should be INCREASING the Greenbelt, not reducing it!
It is urgent, for the well-being of the climate and future generations of Ontarians, that the Greenbelt be preserved, and ideally, increased.  This nonsensical, short-sighted, inappropriate and unnecessary amendment must be stopped in its tracks!

79824,/comment/79824,"Earlier this year, I submitted comments to the ERO on a proposed amendment to the Greenbelt Plan regarding growing the size of the Greenbelt (ERO # 019-4485). That proposal claimed that its objective was to “grow the size and quality of the Greenbelt” and that the government would neither “consider the removal of any lands from the Greenbelt” nor make any policy changes to reduce “existing protections in the Greenbelt.” With the release of the Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan on November 4, I feel that not only were Ontarians lied to, but also that my concerns and those of so many others who participated in the earlier consultation were ignored.
The Greenbelt was established in 2005 to protect farmland and natural heritage from urban sprawl and climate change and to encourage the growth of healthy, liveable communities in urban areas in which people could live where they worked and played. The lands included in the Greenbelt area were carefully selected for their ecological significance and sensitivity to form a connected system of protected land that would protect the biodiversity and farmland in it. These protections were meant to be permanent.
The proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan and Greenbelt Area Boundary not only violate those protections and numerous repeated promises by this government that the Greenbelt would not be touched, they also threaten the wellbeing and security of Ontarians.
Faulty Premise
Before I proceed, though, the very premise underlying the proposal to open up parts of the Greenbelt (that the lands are required to provide 50,000 new homes out of an anticipated 1.5 million new homes required for projected growth in the GTHA) is untrue. There are more than 86,000 acres of land currently available for development in urban and peri-urban areas in the GTHA alone. This land, along with changes in zoning policies restricting gentle densification within municipalities, is sufficient to meet the housing needs of our growing population—and it would make available housing of various shapes and sizes to meet the needs of people of varying income levels, ages, and stages in life. Even the government’s own Housing Affordability Task Force stated earlier this year that “a shortage of land isn’t the cause of the [housing crisis]. Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts” (10) and that the solution was simply to “make better use of land” (10) through changing zoning rules and “adding density” (4) within urban boundaries. Further, a 2020 report published by the Canadian Federation of Municipalities entitled Sustainable Land Use Practices in Canadian Municipalities: A Snapshot, intensification of urban areas is one of the top municipal best practices to sustainably address affordable housing needs and growth. So, the suggestion that Greenbelt land is required to meet the housing needs of the anticipated population growth is, in fact, untrue—meaning this proposal to amend the Greenbelt Plan is based on false premises and should therefore be dropped.
Promised Protection
After being caught on tape in 2018 stating that he would open up the Greenbelt for developers, Doug Ford and his government have repeatedly promised that the Greenbelt would not be touched. The current proposal to carve out 7,400 acres of the Greenbelt is a violation of that promise. Further, the suggestion by the government that parts of the Greenbelt can be opened up and new land added in a type of “land swap” reflects a deep misunderstanding of how ecosystems function, how biodiversity thrives, and how water systems flow and work. As mentioned previously, the lands that were put in the Greenbelt were carefully selected to protect the ecosystems and biodiversity within the lands, to prevent further fragmentation of farmland (which reduces productivity and farming viability), and to stop urban sprawl. Adding new parcels of land (if truly new—and initial findings suggest some of the land proposed to be added was already protected, already public parks, or undevelopable land) to the Greenbelt, while welcome, would never replace the value and significance of the land already in the Greenbelt. We should not be giving up Class 1 farmland and natural assets (such as wetlands, fields, and woodlands) to housing. And the promise of protection for any new lands added would be questionable, as Greenbelt lands (including those that the government would like to offer up to developers) were meant to be permanently protected. Overall, the proposals to open up parts of the Greenbelt and change boundaries would violate the integrity of the whole Greenbelt and all that it offers Ontarians.
Threats to Our Wellbeing and Security
If the COVID crisis did nothing else, it made all of us aware of the importance of access to green spaces for our health and of access to local food. The Greenbelt provides these things. People need green spaces for the ecosystem services they provide us but also as places to visit and be active (including hiking, biking, skiing, and touring). They provide us with opportunities to improve our physical and mental wellbeing. Recent COVID-related border closures and food shortages also increased our understanding of the need to have local food sources. Food security will be increasingly important as Ontario grows. The proposals to open up parts of the Greenbelt threaten to reduce and destroy both access to local food and local recreation and tourism opportunities.
The Greenbelt also plays a critical role in cleaning our air and water and in preventing flooding. Allowing housing to be built on Greenbelt land will come at the expense of lost natural infrastructure that protects us from the harmful effects of air and water pollution and the costly effects of flooding. As a whole, according to the Greenbelt Foundation, the Greenbelt provides $3.2 billion in ecosystem services such as the ones mentioned above. Parcelling out parts of the Greenbelt for housing would undermine and reduce the benefits provided by the Greenbelt. Further, according to the Auditor General of Ontario’s 2022 report, “all Ontarians who live in a developed area—regardless of proximity to a waterbody, like a river or creek—may be at risk of an urban flood” (1). Removing sections of the Greenbelt would only increase that risk for Ontarians living on, near, or downstream from the Greenbelt.
The climate crisis has also heightened our awareness of the significance of farmland and natural heritage to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. The Greenbelt is key to helping our province deal with the challenges of climate change, including flooding, droughts, heat-island effects, pollution, extreme weather events, and extreme temperatures. Planning for and enabling uncontrolled sprawl by opening up the Greenbelt is irresponsible and goes against the province’s own greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction commitments. How is the province supposed to reduce GHG emissions by its meager goal of 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 if it induces urban sprawl into the Greenbelt and forces people out into car-dependent neighbourhoods built of houses that furthermore, as a result of Bill 23, do not even have to meet municipal efficiency codes? Climate change is considered the biggest threat of our time. Why is the government even considering opening up the Greenbelt when that land has a key role in protecting our province from increased GHG emissions and vulnerability to the impacts of climate change?
Housing Goals Can and Must Be Met Without Opening Up the Greenbelt
The proposals to amend the Greenbelt Plan and amend the Greenbelt boundary reflect a deep ignorance of the purpose and significance of the Greenbelt as a whole in preserving critical farmland, protecting biodiversity, protecting our drinking water, serving as a carbon sink, protecting us from extreme weather events, cleaning our air and water, and providing us with local jobs and food, among the many benefits and services it provides Ontarians. The Greenbelt is not a “regulatory burden[]” and opening it up for development is not “a balanced approach to smart growth,” as suggested by the proposals. While adding land to the Greenbelt is welcome, it cannot come at the expense of opening up other areas of the Greenbelt for development. Carving into the Greenbelt will only destroy ecosystems and biodiversity within them, reduce farmland productivity and availability to feed Ontarians, drive further urban pressures onto the environmentally sensitive Greenbelt, encourage costly and harmful urban sprawl, set a dangerous precedent for future development to occur in the Greenbelt, and put the health and wellbeing of Ontarians at risk.
Our province can meet its housing goals without opening up the Greenbelt. Land-use experts, municipal best practice, and even the government’s own Housing Task Force have shown that if we use the land within urban boundaries more effectively, we can accommodate growth and create vibrant, affordable, and non-exclusive neighbourhoods that integrate businesses, parks, housing, people, and accessible public transit. The Greenbelt must not be opened. It belongs to all Ontarians and should not be at the disposal of developers. Full stop.

79831,/comment/79831,"Opening up the Greenbelt is not in the best interest of current and future Ontarians.
As an life long Ajax resident and environmental scientist I am vehemently against opening up the Greenbelt. The assertion that opening the Greenbelt will provide much needed opportunities for housing development is absolutely ridiculous. First of all, there is more than enough land in the GTA that is not protected by the Greenbelt which is available for development. There is absolutely no need to open up the Greenbelt to ""make space for new development"". Furthermore, the 50,000 homes created on this space will lead to sprawl and the proliferation of more unaffordable housing. If the Ontario government is actually committed to creating more responsibly priced housing, they should be turning to developers to build mid-rise condos on preexisting footprints - this is something that the City of Pickering already has in the works, however this government is not forcing them to change their Official Plan.
Also, why did the developers buy Greenbelt lands? These lands are protected, yet they purchased them on a bet that the government would open them up, something which Ontario's leader very publicly said he would not do. The fact that this is even up for debate shows the rampant corruption and collusion that is happening between the Ontario government and developers.
Removing protected Greenbelt lands shows Ontarians and developers that long standing, long fought for, long celebrated environmental policies can be upended in an instant. Converting these several parcels, in several municipalities, puts the whole Greenbelt at risk. What is to stop more, and more development proposals in the future from asking for the severance of more Greenbelt space. These lands are ""adjacent to current development"", then if these Greenbelt lands are developed, new protected Greenbelt land will be ""adjacent to development"". Will the government then allow these lands to be expanded into? Where does it end? Many experts fought to protect the Greenbelt. Now our current government is discounting their expert research which was done in the best interest of Ontarians and future generations. Who is this development in the best interest of? Low income families? Young people looking to buy their first homes? No. Developers and the rich.
When protected lands, whether as Natural Heritage, or Agricultural lands, are developed we, the public, all lose.
In addition, in this amendment it states that developers will be responsible for the charges, but in the ""
Proposed Planning Act and Development Charges Act, 1997 Changes: Providing Greater Cost Certainty for Municipal Development-related Charges"" proposed changes, it states that certain types of development will be exempt from such charges. Therefore, if any of this housing, is ""affordable housing"" (a ""main reason"" that the Ontario government is pushing development in this new act), then developers will not be obligated to pay fully for development because they will be exempt from development charges, parkland requirement and community benefit charges. Thus, if what this act amendment says is true and ""It is the government’s expectation that the proponents would fully fund necessary infrastructure upfront"" then that would mean that these developers are not building affordable housing. Therefore, this act amendment is doing nothing to help support the housing of those who truly need it and cannot afford it under the current system. As such, the changes to the Greenbelt will not meaningfully provide affordable housing, and thus defeats the More Homes Built Faster Act purpose - to provide housing for those who need it.
This act amendment also states ""small burden on municipalities to update their official plans"". Forcing a municipality to change their official plan is not a small burden. Official plans are made in consultation with municipal staff and the public. Forcing municipality to change already approved plans is extremely costly and diminishes the public's right to comment directly on the plan.
Moreover, taking greenspace away from municipalities, the public (even if its privately owned these land contribute to ecosystem services which benefit the public) and wildlife, yet preserving a chunk of land someone where else, does not meaningfully negate the negative repercussions of development in the direct geographical area (aka the affected municipalities). Making existing areas of green space smaller results in the diminished ability of ecosystems services to provide benefit to human society. Diminishing these benefits will put the burden on the tax payer to fund the public infrastructure needed to replace them.

One cannot simply take land away from one area and by adding land to another area, and expect that to mitigate the original loss of land to the Greenbelt. This proposal would create fragmented land pieces which creates enormous problems for wildlife. Wildlife needs to have a contiguous ""belt"" of land through which it can move. Thus encouraging the stability of the wildlife. A Greenbelt by its very name is not a ""belt"" if it is being broken up into separate and distinct land areas.
The Greenbelt provides natural infrastructure that helps reduce flooding, forest fires, and heat waves. The Greenbelt protects at-risk species and ecosystems, and provides public health benefits through added greenspace and access to nature. The Greenbelt must stay protected!
The amount of land already designated for development far exceeds what is needed to meet long-range housing targets. That includes 86,500 acres within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area alone.
I am opposed to Bill 23 and the various proposals contained within it. Also, I am opposed to the proposed regulatory changes associated with this legislation as noted above.
In particular, my concerns are:
Timing of the Bill. The government has chosen to release this bill as councils were dissolving and new terms were yet to begin. I would like to see the comment period extended and proper consultation undertaken with the municipalities.
Impacted Lands. This bill and the proposed regulations would have application to all lands in Ontario, regardless of suitability for development or ability to meet the goals of this government for more homes faster.  This bill should focus on urban residential lands that have servicing and existing infrastructure. This is consistent with the definition “parcels of urban residential land” already being used for additional residential units.
Site Plan Control. Changes to the Planning Act Section 41 (1.2) remove site plan control from lands with less than 10 units and the ability for a municipality to control landscaping. I would like to see site plan control be retained for rural and waterfront land and that landscaping remain a tool at the disposal of the municipality on these lands.
Appeal Rights. It is crucially important in a strong, healthy democracy that, in municipal planning matters, there is a right for taxpayers to appeal decisions. This government’s proposal to remove the rights of taxpayers and landowners to appeal planning decisions removes one of the checks and balances in the system – holding staff and councils accountable for upholding their policies and ensuring that the environment on which we depend is protected for future generations. I would like to see third party appeal rights remain for all municipal planning matters.
Housing Supply. There have been a significant number of housing units that have already received draft approval. I would like to see the focus be on what has already been approved to reduce red tape and accomplish the goal of more houses with what is already in the works.
Heritage Properties. Requiring designation of all listed properties within two years will create a significant burden on smaller municipalities to preserve cultural heritage. I would like to see that the proposed requirement that a property meet two or more of the criteria prescribed in regulation to be designated, and the proposed requirement to designate all listed properties within two years, be deleted.
I would like to see Bill 23, (SO 2022, c.21 ) and the associated proposed regulations be repealed or revoked.

79911,/comment/79911,"I would like to state my opposition to the removal of lands from the Greenbelt Area and to the redesignation of land in the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan Area if this will permit new development.
1.	The reasons for protecting the land in the Greenbelt still apply.  If anything, there is a greater need for the Greenbelt now.
The Greenbelt is supposed to provide permanent protection to the agricultural land base and to ecological and hydrological features, areas and functions.
It was established because the region has some of Canada’s most important and productive farmland.  Its fertile soil, moderate climate and abundant water resources support agricultural production that cannot be duplicated elsewhere in the province and the country (wording taken from the Greenbelt Plan).  In other words, farms can’t move to other parts of Ontario and produce the same volume, quality and variety of food.  We need to preserve this valuable farmland.
The region also contains many of Canada’s most ecologically and hydrologically significant natural environments. These natural areas clean the air and provide drinking water for the millions of people who live here. They should continue to be protected for the health of present and future generations.
2. There has been no credible public process to decide whether lands should be removed from the Greenbelt area or which lands should be removed.
Municipalities, experts and the public have not had adequate opportunity to review and provide input on the removal of these lands from the Greenbelt. In fact, the process appears to be designed to prevent comment.
The deadline for commenting was very short. The proposal was posted when municipal councils were newly elected and in the process of being sworn in and getting organized.
The proposal was posted on the Registry at the same time as at least 10 other proposals that impact on the environment and municipalities, all with short deadlines for commenting.
And finally, it was posted while Bill 23 was being hurried through the Legislature.  Bill 23 makes drastic changes to the planning system and to the role of conservation authorities in regulating and reviewing development that affects our watercourses, wetlands and environmentally sensitive lands.  It is almost impossible for anyone outside of the provincial government to fully understand all of the changes that are being made to Ontario’s environmental protections right now.
If the Ontario Government really believes that the removal of these lands from the Greenbelt area is warranted, it should be willing to establish a transparent public process with a reasonable timeframe.
3.	The Greenbelt lands are not needed for housing.
There are already 88,000 acres of land already approved for the development of new housing near communities where there are services and where people already live.  These lands should be developed before looking to remove lands from the Greenbelt.
4.	Removing the lands will harm climate resilience
Removing the lands will harm climate resilience by undermining the ecological integrity of the watersheds and natural systems in and around the Greenbelt according to the Ontario Greenbelt Alliance Steering Committee.
It has become increasingly clear that climate change puts us all at risk.  We are facing more severe weather, flooding, air pollution, unpredictable growing seasons that could cause food shortages and wildlife endangerment.  The answer isn’t to destroy farmland and environmentally sensitive areas and add to urban sprawl.  I would urge the Ontario Government to improve our climate resilience by leaving these lands in the Greenbelt and adding more lands to the Greenbelt instead.
5. There is no guarantee that new developments in the Greenbelt will be affordable.
The Ontario Government appears to be removing lands from the Greenbelt without putting a plan in place to ensure that any new housing to be built on the land is affordable.  The Government does not say that it will require apartment buildings, rental accommodation, townhouses, triplexes or other modest housing to be built.  Instead, it promises only that developers will be required to build quickly.  Without new government requirements, why would a developer choose to build modest housing when it could maximize its profits instead by building large and expensive homes that do nothing to solve the housing crisis?  I am concerned that Ontario is handing a huge windfall to developer landowners and receiving nothing in return.
All of these facts lead me to the conclusion that there is no good reason to remove lands from the Greenbelt. And there is a very real risk of harm to the natural environment and to our agricultural land base and food security.  I would urge the Ontario Government to reconsider this proposal and instead work with stakeholder municipalities, experts and the public to develop a strategy to resolve the housing crisis.

79943,/comment/79943,"I’m writing to you today in support of the Greenbelt, Conservation Authorities and Ontario’s wetlands, woodlands and other natural areas.
Firstly, I am writing to state my opposition to the proposal to remove 7,400 acres of land from the Greenbelt, which was revealed on November 4.
The proposal claims that the lands removed will be ""replaced"" by adding land to the Greenbelt.  However, much of the land that will supposedly be added is already protected.  And, even if it weren’t already protected, the very possibility of ""swapping out"" the plots of land targeted for development destroys the permanence and certainty required for any part of the Greenbelt to function properly.
By permanently setting aside land for farming and natural heritage, the Greenbelt protects land from the intense speculation and development pressure in Southern Ontario. Without this permanent protection, agricultural land would quickly become completely unaffordable to farmers. Even raising the possibility of removing any land from the Greenbelt will create a speculative rush and intense development pressure on all the lands currently within the Greenbelt.
Currently, there is a vast supply of unused greenfield land already open for development within existing municipal boundaries (350 square kilometers as of 2019) and the current round of Official Plans awaiting approval will add 42,000 additional hectares of non-Greenbelt land to that vast stockpile.
Given that we have an extreme shortage of homes in existing neighborhoods, and a long term shortage of materials, equipment and skilled labour, squandering our resources on resource -intensive Greenbelt sprawl will mean fewer homes in the places where they're desperately needed.
Not only is this proposal bad for the health of our province and unlikely to produce any additional housing, it goes against the Premier’s word and it goes against Minister Steve Clarke’s assertion that “we’re not going to entertain any conversations about a land swap” on the Greenbelt.
In addition to my concerns about the Greenbelt, I am deeply concerned about many of the components of Bill 23 and its associated policy proposals.
Bill 23 prohibits Conservation Authorities from doing anything to prevent sprawl from causing flooding and erosion – or destroying ecology. It would leave vast swathes of Ontario’s most important habitats largely unprotected – and put Ontarians at real risk.
Proposed policy to allow “pay to slay” destruction of currently protected wetlands and woodlands, and changes to the rules that are used to identify wetlands, will cause the majority of these rare and ecologically crucial areas to be opened to development.
This Bill’s attack on regional planning is counterproductive for creating affordable homes – as well as being environmentally disastrous.  Devolving planning decisions to lower-tier municipalities would produce development that is more scattered and thus much more environmentally harmful, but also more uncoordinated and expensive.
The recently passed bill also attacks Green Buildings. This bill will take the authority to require green buildings from municipalities – undoing many municipal Green Building standards that have already been developed – and undermine the affordability benefits that energy-efficient, climate-resilient buildings provide to owners and tenants.
Bill 23 will further the destruction of critical natural areas in a time of climate crisis while also failing to deliver the urban transformation – or the affordable housing – that Ontario needs.
In conclusion, please desist from removing any lands from the Greenbelt – even if they are replaced by other lands in other areas– and repeal Bill 23.

79983,/comment/79983,"I am deeply troubled by the passing of Bill 23 and the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan.
Premier Ford promised over and over again to protect the Greenbelt, but his PC government has announced a plan to remove 7,400 acres of land from the Greenbelt claiming it’s necessary to solve the housing crisis.  But it won’t solve the housing crisis.  Bill 23 and the redesignation of Greenbelt lands will only facilitate car-centred developments and high-cost housing, rather than affordable homes in sustainable communities.  With this legislation, municipal residents will be subsidizing developer profits by having to cover the costs of infrastructure for growth.  And critically, this legislation compromises environmental protections and opens the door to land speculators and sprawl developers.
The very possibility of taking any land out of the Greenbelt would undermine its effectiveness as a buffer between sensitive greenspaces and the urban environment.  Opening up the Greenbelt will degrade its ecological value in providing wildlife habitat, forest cover, surface water quality, and flood protection.  Thousands of acres of land are currently available within Ontario’s existing urban boundaries and can easily accommodate growth over the next few decades without the need to destroy farmland or the Greenbelt.
I recognize there is a housing supply and affordability issue in Ontario, but Bill 23 and sacrificing the Greenbelt will not solve the problem.  Sprawl does not create affordable housing — it leads to car dependency and higher property taxes.  I want to see a focus on liveable, sustainable communities that offer a range of housing types for all income levels and needs.  Most regions in Ontario already have enough land dedicated to development to meet their housing needs.
The Greenbelt belongs to all Ontarians.  Hands off our Greenbelt!

79984,/comment/79984,"I’m extremely disappointed that the provincial government is proposing removing portions of the Greenbelt. I’m opposed to this proposal because: 1) wetlands cannot be replaced on a 1:1 basis, 2) the risks to flood regulation and water quality, and 3) housing can be built in existing neighbourhoods. I’m deeply concerned that this proposal risks setting a dangerous precedent that would see the Greenbelt cut-up and disappear over time.
It is misleading to state that an acre of land can be taken in one place and replaced with an acre elsewhere. A wetland that is lost is not easily replaced. A review of 59 studies of biodiversity recovery by Pezzati et al., 2018 found that recovery times varied from less than one year to 10,000 years with active restoration efforts. We are lucky to have biodiversity and wetlands in such proximity to urban areas. Once these are removed from the Greenbelt and developed, they will be lost for good. The loss being considered in Map 6 in Durham Region is particularly worrying given the connection to Duffins Creek. A University of Waterloo study valued the ecosystem system services of wetlands in southern Ontario to be worth $9,995 per hectare per year. Wetlands in the Lake Simcoe watershed have ecosystem benefits worth $11,172 per hectare per year. Since wetlands’ benefits vary from watershed to watershed, it is worth reconsidering this proposal of removing one piece of land in the Greenbelt for another in the Paris Galt Moraine.
Overall, the removal of Greenbelt lands poses risks to flood regulation and water quality. These are priceless ecosystem services (or, benefits) that the Greenbelt currently provides. A 250 square metre piece of land in the town of Oakville, Ontario, stores so much stormwater that it saves the city $1.24 million to $1.44 million annually. Certain Greenbelt lands that are being considered to be removed are close to rivers and/or creeks. Areas like this are important to the fight against climate change. Losing these parts of the Greenbelt may be detrimental to Ontario communities and future homeowners in terms of flood risks, which could rise in the future due to climate change. In 2021, the insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) estimated that weather-related events due to climate change cost Canadians around $2.1 billion in insured damages and this figure could reach up to $139 billion by 2050. Environment and Climate Change Canada scientists reported in 2020 that climate change has made rainfall more extreme and storms with extreme rainfall more frequent. There have been significant rainfall events in 2017 and 2018 in Toronto. Communities along Lake Ontario needed sandbags for several days and weeks in 2018.
There can be more than 50,000 homes built in existing neighbourhoods through Missing Middle housing. Such housing includes duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, townhomes, and low-rise apartments. Missing Middle housing can be built more quickly than what is being proposed with the removal of these Greenbelt properties. Building Missing Middle housing would decrease urban development pressures in agricultural and rural areas. Compact urban housing developments provide cost savings for construction and infrastructure maintenance. (Donnan, 2008) The Report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force from February 2022 states that there is enough land to develop inside built-up areas and outside of greenbelts. Young people want to live in compact, dense and complete communities in urban areas. They may not want to live in a far-flung subdivision, where they will have to depend on a car.
Thank you for receiving my comment. I hope that the government decides against this change of regulation. I ask that you do not sacrifice pieces of the Greenbelt to build housing. We have the space in urban areas already to accommodate the number of residents that you are estimating would live in these proposed areas. We do not need to set this dangerous precedent.

Please focus on building more housing within existing urban boundaries and focus on supporting municipalities to move forward with a variety of options to increase affordability as well increasing density in a way that encourages a variety of housing (e.g. triplexes and multi-plexes as well as larger apartment units) but does not worsen climate change as building outside of cities will do.

80128,/comment/80128,"I am an Ontario citizen, resident and voter and I strongly oppose this proposal that changes the Greenbelt Act Boundary regulation to remove approximately 7000 acres from the Greenbelt Plan area. This is the proposal described in ERO #019-6217.
The removal of these lands from the Greenbelt is unnecessary. There is currently plenty of greenfield land that is not in the Greenbelt, that is already approved for residential development and is ready for immediate development. There is enough of this non-Greenbelt land for at least the next 20 years of building. This land is cheaper to develop because it is close to existing municipal infrastructure and the transit network. Thus, there would be lower infrastructure costs to developers which could be passed along to home buyers (with the resulting possibility of slightly reducing affordability). The bottom line is that the Greenbelt land is not needed to build the homes being proposed under Bill 23. There is no reason to dip into the Greenbelt and no real justification for these proposed Greenbelt Act changes.
The overall rationale that more sprawl homes are needed to solve the housing affordability crisis is grossly misguided. Housing volume does not equate to affordability. If this government truly wants to solve the affordability crisis, they should be focusing on building in greenfields and brownfields, and on increasing density in existing urban areas. Building homes on Greenbelt lands will exacerbate the problem as car-dependent, sprawl homes are more expensive to build and will contribute to even greater environmental degradation. This governments attempt to pair destruction of the Greenbelt with the affordability crisis is deceitful. This proposal has every appearance of being a payback to developer-friends of the Conservative government who bankrolled the previous election campaign with opportunity to make huge profits from land speculation and insider information.
This proposal to “swap lands” goes against the core purpose of the Greenbelt. The stated purpose of the Greenbelt is to protect a continuous, unfragmented belt of natural and agricultural lands around the urbanized Greater Golden Horseshoe. This Greenbelt sustains agricultural production of food for residents of the GGH on high quality agricultural lands and it also protects water quality (including drinking water) and quantity by protecting headwaters and groundwater aquifers that GGH residents rely on. The Greenbelt lands work wholistically as a functional unit. But this proposal intends to start fragmenting the Greenbelt, pulling patches out and adding other patches haphazardly based on convenience (read “convenience” as the holdings of developers who have speculated that this legislation will open up the Greenbelt for development) and not on sound ecology. Fragmented systems suffer irreparable damage to their functions. All pieces of land are not equal. It’s not OK to swap out one piece for another when you are relying on lands to provide significant ecosystem services.
I have reviewed the mapping for all the areas proposed for removal/redesignation and find significant and widespread discrepancies between the proposal description of the ERO posting and reality. Contrary to the claim in the ERO description, most of the land to be removed is designated Greenbelt Natural Heritage System and not Protected Countryside. Almost all the removal areas will fragment the Greenbelt and NHS, which runs against the fundamental purpose for having the Greenbelt. Also, contrary to the claim in the ERO description, none of the removal lands are serviced currently and only
two of the 15 areas are adjacent to a serviced area. Thus, service infrastructure will need to be built for all these removal areas, which makes these lands more expensive and less affordable to build on than existing approved non-Greenbelt lands (which are serviced).
While I applaud the proposal to add the Paris Galt moraine lands to the Greenbelt, it should not be conditional on the removal of other lands.
Since, in this proposal, the addition lands are compensatory for the lands removed, and since the Greenbelt Act states that the Greenbelt should retain the same overall size, I suggest that detail should be added to the Greenbelt Act boundary regulation that explicitly ties the removals and additions together simultaneously in time.
Moreover, the proposed changes to the Greenbelt Act 2005 (described in ERO# 019-6216) provide for the return of removed lands if building is not started on them by a stated timeline. Should this occur, it should not impact or cause removal of any of the Paris Galt moraine or URV lands that were added. I suggest that language be added to this proposed Greenbelt Act boundary regulation to reflect that should some removed lands be returned later, it would not affect the addition lands (i.e., they would not be withdrawn).
In a paragraph describing the conditions/timeframe for development on the removal lands, the ERO description of this proposal states, “If these conditions are not met, the government will begin the process to return the properties back to the Greenbelt.” The government should do much more than begin the process for return to the Greenbelt – it should complete the return and in a timely manner. I suggest that the proposal language be clarified to state that the government will return the land back to the Greenbelt and the timeframe for this return.
To conclude, I strongly oppose the removal of any lands from the Greenbelt as it not justifiable due to the existence of plenty of buildable non-Greenbelt land. I oppose the notion that swapping out one piece of land for another is ecologically sound. And I applaud the addition of the Paris Galt moraine lands although the language of the regulation needs to provide more detail, tighten timelines and to protect added lands even if some removal lands are later returned.

80138,/comment/80138,"I agree that Ontario needs more housing but not at the expense of the Greenbelt.  Additional housing can be easily built within the boundaries of the urban centers surrounding the Greenbelt - density would simply be intensified to make room for additional houses. The Ontario government itself has mandated that all municipalities' Official Plans must contain substantial density targets. The following arguments illustrate
The More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022 goes directly against the clearly stated intention of the Greenbelt Plan .  The Greenbelt Plan was created specifically to prevent any type of development on this land.
The following is an excerpt taken from ERO # 019-6216 Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan:
""The proposed strategic removal of lands from the Greenbelt Area was considered in the context of the objectives and policies of the Greenbelt Plan..."".  This statement is found in the Greenbelt Plan.  It is blatantly wrong as the objectives and policies of the Greenbelt Plan clearly state the land is not to be developed.
""...Clark wrote in a statement.  ""These proposals will support our municipal partners' plans for responsible growth and help build at least 50,000 new homes, while leading to an overall expansion of the Greenbelt.""  The More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022 does not reflect ""responsible"" growth - all it does is expand urban sprawl, which is what the Greenbelt Act guards against.
""Last year, when announcing plans to expand the Greenbelt by adding a moraine south of Toronto and a series of urban river lands, Clark said he would not cut the protected area or do a land swap.
'I want to be clear: We will not in any way entertain any proposals that will move lands in the Greenbelt, or open the Greenbelt lands to any kind of development,' he had said"".  The Ontario government has broken its own promise by allowing development on the Greenbelt.

80156,/comment/80156,"I strongly disagree with these proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation.
The 2022 report of Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force stated that a shortage of land isn’t the cause of Ontario’s housing problem. It is therefore unnecessary to build on Greenbelt land, environmentally sensitive areas or farmland.
The proposed removal of land from the Greenbelt sets an unnerving precedent. Both land from the Greenbelt and the Natural Heritage System should never be developed.  Our local food systems and ecosystems are both needed for our present and future.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this matter.

80162,/comment/80162,"I am writing to state my opposition to the proposal to remove 7,400 acres of land from the Greenbelt, which was revealed on November 04.
Bill 23 prohibits Conservation Authorities’ power to protect anything beyond managing floodwaters and erosion. It would leave vast swathes of Ontario’s most important habitats largely unprotected. This measure is useless as a spur to housing supply, because Ontario has more than enough room in existing neighborhoods and lands already designated for development than it will need for housing for many decades.
Premier Ford has chosen not to protect the greenbelt and not to find affordable housing solutions. He has chosen not to consult with the indigenous communities and local municipalities on their concerns and proposed solutions on affordable housing.

80169,/comment/80169,"My dad spent years petitioning for land to be added to the green belt to ensure that we keep our green spaces and protect our native species of plants and animals. It felt like we were finally making progress toward being responsible and caring for the small bits of nature we have left. Reducing the green belt boundaries is a terrible idea. It should not be done. Our governments need to first be looking at vacant lots that are being sat on by developers within city boundaries and force developers to create housing there before we even consider touching our green belt boundaries.

80171,/comment/80171,"I do not support any lands being removed from the Greenbelt Area, because it is simply not necessary.  The amount of greenfield land already designated for development, and added to municipal settlement boundaries, but still sitting unbuilt far exceeds what is needed to meet long range housing targets.  In its 2022 report, Ontario’s Housing Affordability Task Force stated that a shortage of land isn’t the cause of Ontario’s housing problem and that Greenbelts, environmentally sensitive areas and farmland must be protected.
The proposed removal of Greenbelt lands sets an alarming precedent, opening the Greenbelt to development at the request of those who stand to reap immense profits while the rest of us pay the tab.  Land swaps put the entire Greenbelt at risk.  Most of the lands to be removed from the Greenbelt overlap with the Natural Heritage System, which supports sensitive and significant natural features, and is supposed to be managed by your ministry as a connected and integrated natural heritage system.
The importance of permanently protecting lands and waters within the Greenbelt cannot be overstated. It is key to building the resilience of local food systems, protecting at-risk habitats and species, and sustaining the physical, social and economic health of the nine million Ontarians living in the Greater Golden Horseshoe.  Not only are we facing the interconnected and accelerating crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, we are also losing 319 acres of farmland daily.  The protection of natural and hydrological systems and farmland must be prioritized.  They are finite, irreplaceable and invaluable for community and ecosystem health and resilience.

80184,/comment/80184,"I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed changes to the Greenbelt Plan.
The land proposed to be removed from the Greenbelt for residential development includes some of the richest agricultural land in all of Canada, and once it is developed it can never be restored. This is a terrible idea on so many levels - from the loss of local farmland (in the midst of a global food crisis), to the loss of tourism dollars, destruction of critical wetlands (read: flood defenses) and wildlife habitat, and an increase in carbon emissions (in the midst of an existential climate crisis) due to paving natural areas and building giant homes in places not served by transit or other amenities.
The government is right in its assertion that more homes are needed – I don’t think anyone disputes that. However, the much-touted plan to build 1.5 million homes in ten years can be accomplished by building in and densifying already-developed urban areas. There is no need to open up the Greenbelt for housing; the proposed 50,000 homes will barely move the needle on the government’s goal, and can easily be accommodated in areas that have already been approved for urban expansion or via infill development.
Although the proposal would in fact result in a net addition of 2,000 acres of land to the Greenbelt Plan area, the reality is that the 9,400 acres of land proposed to be added is already protected by other means (e.g., municipal official plans). With the proposed removal of 7,400 acres elsewhere in the Greenbelt, this would result in an overall net loss of protected land. To summarize, 16,800 acres of currently protected land (via Greenbelt or other means) minus 7,400 acres of Greenbelt to be developed results in 9,400 acres of remaining protected land - a loss of 44 per cent.
There is also the fact that the government promised several times not to touch the Greenbelt, and did not run for re-election on such a platform. To all of a sudden open these precious lands for development makes a mockery of local democracy and ignores the will of the people, whom this government so strongly asserts that it stands for above all else. It is clear to me that the government does indeed stand for some people, particularly those in the development industry who were lucky enough to own (or even recently purchase) previously protected lands that are now slated for development (by the way, something smells fishy – I guess it must be the Greenbelt and its wetlands). Opening up the proposed lands for development is a slippery slope, as other farms in the Greenbelt will almost certainly be sold to developers and speculators just waiting for their chance at the housing jackpot, resulting in a massive reduction in stewardship of critical agricultural lands.
In summary, the proposed changes to the Greenbelt Plan are incredibly short-sighted, and sacrifice the public good and long-term health of our environment for the immediate financial gain of a few rich corporations and landowners. These changes will assuredly not contribute to the goal of more affordable or attainable housing.
I implore the government to think twice about this decision, for the good of our children and grandchildren.

80191,/comment/80191,"I oppose the proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan.  Municipalities such as Hamilton have already determined that they can meet housing needs/anticipated growth by increasing density within existing urban boundaries.  Support for these pre-existing local decisions needs to be considered before extending boundaries.  Forcing municipalities to expand into the Greenbelt is short sighted, and, frankly, undemocratic. Additionally, creating new infrastructure, rather than relying on pre-existing ones (as in existing urban boundaries) will cost tax-payers significantly more.  Lastly, this housing does not support an affordable solution to the “housing crisis”, despite the intentions.

80192,/comment/80192,"ERO 019 6217 Comments on Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation
General Observations:
I do not agree with the Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation. It is not necessary and if enacted, it would set a precedent for possible future removals of land from the Ontario Greenbelt.
There’s absolutely no need to change the boundaries of land from the Ontario Greenbelt. In the Municipal Plans of ALL GTA Municipalities, there is provision for growth to the mid 21st Century. Some Municipalities have gone so far as to include growth densification thereby obfuscating any need by the present Ontario Government to change the boundaries of lands from the Ontario Greenbelt.
Proposing amendments that would see lands removed from the edge of the Ontario Greenbelt and the boundaries changed is not going to solve the need for affordable housing and or for those wishing to move to their own housing units. Instead, the government should be encouraging Municipalities to densify housing in their growth areas without having to remove land and change boundaries of the Ontario Greenbelt.
The 15 areas proposed to be removed as shown in Maps 1 to 11 are unnecessary and are more suitably left as they currently exist. Current policy is not to remove lands from the Ontario Greenbelt. Some of the smaller planned removals, near stream valleys, would encroach on the water courses. Most egregious is the suggested removal of Greenbelt lands as shown on Map 6 – Durham Rouge Agricultural Preserve (DRAP) - and Map 7 – 765 and 775 Kingston Road East in Ajax. The DRAP serves as a buffer between Metropolitan Toronto and Durham Region, provides fertile land for agriculture, provides a source of potable water, and provides natural environments for flora and fauna. 765 and 775 Kingston Road East are fertile lands that have been in agricultural use for as long as I can remember. This parcel of land contains a wood lot at its south end which contains some of the largest trees in the south of Durham Region. It is home to a thriving understory plant community which contains numerous species of Spring Ephemerals and other uncommon plants. This same wood lot is a Deer yard.
The DRAP and the 765 and 775 Kingston Road East in Ajax must not be removed from the Ontario Greenbelt by changing boundaries. These lands provide 2 natural corridors linking Lake Ontario to the Lake Iroquois Shoreline and Oak Ridges Moraine to the north. Changing the boundaries, removing them from the Ontario Greenbelt, and developing them breaks the existing natural corridor linkages.
Here’s what will happen if the Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan are enacted:
1) Changing the boundaries of 7 400 Acres and removing these lands from the edge of the Ontario Greenbelt sets a precedent for further boundary changes and removals in the future. Agricultural areas, potable water sources for Ontario citizens, and natural environments would be lost and or degraded.
2) Turning the DRAP and lands known as 765 and 775 on Kingston Road East in Ajax over for housing means that two major natural corridor connections, one from Rouge National Urban Park to the Oak Ridges Moraine and the other from Lake Ontario to the Oak Ridges Moraine, will be lost.
3) If many of the smaller proposed land removals are approved from the Ontario Greenbelt, the changes in boundaries mean that there is possible encroachment on adjacent stream valleys and on the headwaters of some local creeks which in turn endangers fish habitat.
Recommendations:
1) Leave the Ontario Greenbelt as is in ALL areas by not changing boundaries such that there is no removal of any lands from it. Removing lands, as per 019 6217, threatens many stream valleys, headwaters of local creeks, fish habitat, 2 natural corridors, and the DRAP.
2) By conserving the boundaries of Ontario Greenbelt lands, protection is afforded to potable water sources, remaining fertile lands near the GTA, and natural environments for flora, fauna, and Ontario citizens to enjoy.
3) DRAP and the lands at 765 and 775 Kingston Road East in Ajax are 2 natural corridors which must be left alone – their boundaries unchanged. The natural corridors allow passage of fauna
south to north and vice versa.
4) Work within the boundaries of the present conurbations. The word is densify. Housing sprawl is uneconomical, degrades the natural environment, and is wasteful of lands that were previously natural and or used for agricultural purposes. Building upward and densifying growth is sustainable and what we must do to conserve the Ontario Greenbelt.
Conclusion:
Do not change the boundaries of or remove lands from the Ontario Greenbelt. There are already sufficient lands within the boundaries of ALL municipalities in the GTA for housing units. Leave the Durham Rouge Agricultural Preserve alone. DRAP is there to prevent the GTA from becoming a megalopolis, and provides a buffer between the City of Pickering and Metropolitan Toronto. Changing the boundaries of the Ontario Greenbelt to remove lands from its edge for development sets a precedent for future boundary changes and removals. The original intent of the Ontario Greenbelt was to leave the boundaries as is and keep it sacrosanct and unchanged.

80200,/comment/80200,"As a concerned citizen of Ontario and Hamilton resident, I am strongly against the Provincial Government's Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan. On February 28, 2005, the Greenbelt Act protected 2 million acres of prime agricultural and ecologically sensitive lands from urban development. Responding to the climate change crisis and the need to protect Ontario's prime farmlands, wetlands, river valleys, and other ecologically sensitive areas, the Greenbelt Act of 2005 was a forward-thinking piece of legislation passed for the benefit of future generations. Today, Greenbelt protection is more urgent than ever to ensure future food security, climate resilience, protection/enhancement of biodiversity, protection of wetlands/surface & groundwater systems. Furthermore, we are currently experiencing an unprecedented climate emergency. To help combat climate change, the Province needs to be promoting the creation of more compact, complete communities rather than fueling outward expansion through the conversion of existing Greenbelt lands into urban uses. Lastly, urban sprawl comes with considerable financial ramifications, and will be a burden upon municipal taxpayers, such as those living in Hamilton, who will be saddled with the costs of expanding its municipal services and infrastructure. For the sake of all Ontarians, and for the future of our shared environment, I urge the Provincial Government to halt all Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan.

80237,/comment/80237,"I oppose the proposed amendment to the Greenbelt Act which would permit chunks of the Greenbelt to be opened for development.  I also oppose offsetting Greenbelt losses with bits of the Paris Galt Moraine.  the Paris Galt Moraine should be protected in its entirety.  It is the water source for millions of people in southern Ontario.
The Greenbelt is an extraordinary legacy for the province of Ontario.  Forward-looking, it provides essential environmental protections, significant knowledge resources and contributes to both the economy and the quality of life for communities.  The Golden Horseshoe Greenbelt was created in 2005 to prevent further loss of farmland and natural heritage and to restrict urban sprawl - I repeat, to restrict urban sprawl.
The Greenbelt boundaries were designed explicitly because of the risk of sprawl, because of the risk of future encroachment on farm and green and wet and natural habitat lands.  Affordable housing is needed too.  As are well planned communities.  But vision and imagination and expertise must be the keys to the future.  And all the years invested in determining municipal boundaries must be honoured with intelligent design of communities, not cookie cutter repetitions of suburban sprawl which has taken over much of the most productive agricultural land in Southern Ontario, and Canada.
The Greenbelt must be protected.  In these times of climate change and population growth we  have to recognize and protect its unduplicatable natural capital, and its contribution to our survival, productive agricultural land.  The possibilities of the Greenbelt for our economy and health are real, and they are dependent on serious protection to be realized.
I live on a farm in the Greenbelt, and am very sensitive to the potential for more demands to erode its boundaries to respond to speculators who are being given every reason to believe that Greenbelt restrictions will no longer apply.  I fear that this first bite will feed the appetite to whittle away at this irreplaceable ""life belt"".

80241,/comment/80241,"I think there are alternative ways to make housing more accessible and available to broader swaths of the Ontario public than by supporting sprawl, developing farmland, and natural ecosystem areas. Once those lands are developed, they will not be able to be returned to farmland very easily, so this action is not one that should be taken lightly.
I am opposed to all areas where the green belt boundaries are to be removed. I am in favour of the area where the green belt boundary would be added. I recommend adding even more farmland to the protected lands in the green belt. We need to take action to protect natural areas and farmland.
For expanding housing, instead,  I recommend following smart growth strategies, increasing higher-density subsidized housing units, subsidizing brownfield rehabilitation efforts to a greater extent, expanding infilling and replacing lower density housing with higher density apartment buildings or condo buildings (with a focus on those gearing lower to middle income earners), and investing in public transit to make our cities more integrated and connected.

This did not occur without numerous consultations and scientific research. We are facing a climate emergency where preserving these important ecosystems, and their contributions to our lives, is paramount to our survival as a species on a thriving planet.
It is plainly obvious what is happening here. A very corrupt premier is going to ruin our future, and that of our future generations, to line the pockets of his friends and cronies. There is no reason for this other than pure greed and selfishness. We do not have a housing shortage that requires us to destroy our significant environmental spaces. Not at all. There is plenty of housing, and areas earmarked for housing - see the Places to Grow published document - for the entire province for decades. There are other pressures impacting housing affordability, but not supply.
People are wiser now to corruption, especially when it is staring us plainly in the face. Having a developer buy greenbelt land before the announcement makes it clear the true reasons for this. If this goes forward, this government - and EVERYONE associated with it who chose to stand by and do nothing - will go down as selling all of us out to make a quick buck. We will not forget. Do the right thing and honour our provincially significant habitats - and your PROMISES - before it is too late.

It needs to remain an intact corridor to allow farmers to have rural land to farm, unimpeded by suburbs and the disruption it brings.
In order for farmers to continue to plan 20-30+ years ahead they need land that is protected from building to protect their investment in the farm.
Protecting the greenbelt protects hiking trails like the Bruce Trail which is a 900km ribbon of wilderness. The physical and mental health benefits of having access to this green space is priceless.

80289,/comment/80289,"Hi there, I am extremely against the idea of removing or re-designating land's in the protected Greenbelt. It is ridiculous that land specifically designated for protection is so easily given up for development rather than exploring other options, which exist by the way, and not first implementing them. We know that we can do a much better job at infilling current developed areas, as well as asking that future development in already approved areas meet greater density standards. We know how to build housing while maintaining our urban boundaries, so it is confusing and egregious to me as a farmer that the government would sooner pave over our precious resources, rather than protect them as we decided to do years ago. What makes it worse is that these moves by the government appear to solely benefit a few specific developer landowners.
There is already a huge backlog of approved land already approved for use, as most regions and cities have updated their official plans recently to account for growth for the next 30 years. So why take the Greenbelt land on top of that?
The Greenbelt contains a large chunk of our very quickly dwindling farmland in Southern Ontario. We are losing 0.94 percent of our farmland every single year, and that number is increasing every year. We should be doing all we can to preserve the protections given to these green spaces and farm fields, not removing and rezoning these areas, especially when it is not logical or warranted.
If the government would like to add lands into the greenbelt, that is a great initiative and should be supported. Land should not, however, be swapped in suspicious deals such as the government has shown. The addition of the swapped lands, which are likely impossible to build on or farm to begin with, is not a 1 for 1 swap. There is no guarantee that the swapped land provides suitable habitat diversity comparable to the land that is to be removed from the greenbelt.
The Ford Government's attack on our precious green spaces shows yet again what disrespect they have for the public, farmers, and future generations. It is frankly offensive that they treat the public with such disdain.
With the climate crisis at the forefront of the biggest threat to our survival in human history, we should be doing everything possible to build our urban areas smarter, sprawl less and maximize habitat, biodiversity and farmland protection. It should be absolutely within our rights to guarantee our survival through environmental protections.

Prepared by the
Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment

PO BOX 19008 Walmer,
Toronto ON M5S 3C9
December 4, 2022
Summary
Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan, Greenbelt Area boundary regulation and proposed land redesignation under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan are not in the interest of Ontario or Ontarians. They contain the potential to unleash incalculable health harms starting immediately and to be entrenched for generations to come. The proposals if implemented will harm not only human health, but the health of our environment, our economy and our democracy. The proposed changes would worsen fundamental social determinants of health including housing and food security, while escalating deadly air pollution and the climate crisis which represents the single greatest human health crisis today. Implementation without due consultation including Indigenous nations undermines the authority of Conservation Authorities, Municipalities and their Green Standards, public/expert input and Indigenous rights while threatening the world’s largest protected Greenbelt. Massive economic and insurance burdens or loss of public services supported by Municipalities may fall on taxpayers. Lack of meaningful public participation decision-making with significant climate impact may contravene Article 12 of the Paris Agreement [1]
CAPE Ontario urges the Government of Ontario to fulfill its mandate to serve the well-being of Ontarians by ensuring these proposed amendments and land redesignation do not proceed to implementation. We recommend sustainable and equitable development avoiding any infringement on the Greenbelt, avoiding sprawl, respecting Municipal Green Standards, and coordinated by experienced urban planners. Detailed plans have already been completed by such urban planners working with other appropriate experts in many municipalities. These should be implemented as ready sustainable solutions to achieve the healthy thriving future we can still achieve if good governance is exercised. There has never been more at stake as the ways in which we use our land, move, eat and live over just the next few years will determine our chances of a healthy livable future for all.
¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬_______________
The Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, Ontario Regional Committee (CAPE-ON) presents this submission with regards to proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Plan, Greenbelt Area boundary regulation and proposed land redesignation under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan (ERO No. 019-6216; ERO No. 019-6217; ERO No, 019-6218). CAPE is a non-partisan, non-profit physician-based organization advocating on the understanding that environmental health directly impacts human health and must be a priority in all policy decisions.
Judicious land use planning is increasingly essential to public health, the economy, housing supply and affordability, equity, food security and the escalating climate crisis.  With COP27 to address our dire planetary situation recently completed, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated this year “The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet. Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.” [2, p.1]. The Government of Ontario must center this concept in any policies going forward. The proposed amendments which will destroy sections of the Greenbelt do not respect the UN statement above. It has not been made clear why the Government of Ontario is ignoring the findings of its own provincial task force that ample land to meet expanding housing needs is already identified within existing urban boundaries.
Sustainable urban planning accommodates population growth models by optimizing densification while avoiding sprawl and enforcing evidence-based greenhouse gas emissions targets to mitigate adverse environmental impacts. This produces many significant health and economic co-benefits. In Ontario, the Conservation Authorities, protected Greenbelt land, Municipal Green Standards and public/expert consultations and oversights all play a critical role in achieving sustainability. These are now all threatened by the proposed amendments and land redesignation which poses serious risks to the health of Ontarians associated with massive environmental, and economic harms. The proposals if implemented despite the overwhelming public outcry against encroachments on the Greenbelt also pose concerns in eroding the health of Ontario’s democratic process.
A multitude of far-reaching negative impacts will arise from these proposals including the following health impacts:
(1)	The proposals examined by this submission will create a smaller supply (only 50,000 of the 1.5 million units promised during the 2022 provincial election campaign) of larger sized, less affordable and more isolated housing units by promoting suburban sprawl, as compared to sustainably planned densification within existing urban boundaries.
-	This will worsen the current crises of both housing supply and affordability, deepening social inequity.
-	Access to housing is an essential social determinant of health: “The impact of housing on health is now being widely considered by policy makers. Housing is one of the best-researched social determinants of health, and selected housing interventions for low-income people have been found to improve health outcomes and decrease health care costs…many health care systems, payers, and government entities are seeking to better understand ... health and housing literature to determine where they might intervene effectively.” [3, p.1]. Has this government considered the public health and cost impacts in this context?
-	Fossil fuel use will be amplified with proposed sprawl housing compared with planned sustainable densification both by increased transportation needs as noted below and heating/cooling the larger and isolated homes. Transportation and the built infrastructure represent two of the highest sources of fossil fuel emissions in Ontario. Both are escalated with sprawl development. Resultant health impacts are explored below.
-	Many powerful combined health, environmental and economic solutions will be made impossible by sprawl development including low emissions public transit, healthy active transport (walking, cycling) and district energy systems.
(2)	Proposed amendments will promote private vehicle dependent communities and lifestyles.
-	Increased road infrastructure required to access sprawl housing and services/amenities is known to increase vehicular traffic and car use [4].
-	Private car dependent lifestyles decrease physical activity and mental health.
-	Increases in obesity, diabetes, heart and lung disease as well as motor vehicle accidents will result [5].
-	Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution will be escalated with further damage to human health.
(3)	Proposed amendments will destroy critically important wetlands, greenspaces and farmland.
-	These lands function as natural carbon sinks. Their destruction will worsen the climate crisis. Natural undeveloped land is neither an untapped monetary asset waiting to be exploited for profit, nor an unnecessary indulgence in areas of growing population pressure. These lands are increasingly critical to human health and survival and must be recognized as such.
-	While evidence-based targets for preserving undeveloped green and blue spaces are accepted as 30% by 2030, southern Ontario currently only has 15% coverage which will be further compromised by infringing on the Greenbelt.
-	Building over more land will increase heat islands. These amplify the health impacts of global warming and disproportionately affect lower socioeconomic populations worsening inequities [6]
-	Building over more land will increase overland flooding risks. Ontario’s protected Greenbelt lands and Conservation Authorities were largely set up in recognition of the risk of flooding to help protect Ontarians from these risks. Dismantling these protections by dismantling the Conservation Authorities through multiple deliberate pathways built into The More Homes Built Faster Act and selling off parcels of the previously protected Greenbelt without Conservation Authority involvement will harm Ontarians. Health risks, massive costs, problems with insurability and potential legal liabilities may result. The federal government of Canada recently advised federal support cannot be extended to Ontarians harmed by future flooding by these amendments if imposed by the provincial government. The Ontario government was already named in a $1 billion class action lawsuit for rampant poorly planned development upstream directly resulting in flooded properties downstream in Oakville, Ontario [7].
-	Decreased access to greenspaces and nature has multiple proven negative health repercussions including increased rates of stroke, heart disease, asthma, high blood pressure, poor mental health such as stress and anxiety [8].
-	Further proven benefits of increased exposure to nature and/or greenspaces include improved memory, creativity, work satisfaction, longevity in seniors, and healthier birth weight babies. Children demonstrate healthier body weights and physical fitness, improved function in ADHD (attention hyperactivity and deficit disorder), better school test scores and school graduation rates [9].
-	Building over already dwindling farmland will decrease local food production. Climate change worsened by development further reduces the productivity of any remaining land. This compounds food insecurity and affordability. We are currently already seeing record high food bank use in Ontario in October 2022 [10]. Access to affordable nutritious food is another essential social determinant of health threatened by the proposed amendments and the complementary More Homes Built Faster Act [11], in addition to the loss of provincial revenue and well being of Ontario’s farmers.
(4)	Proposed amendments will escalate deadly air pollution.
-	Air pollution will be increased by sprawl development destroying parcels of the Greenbelt, with the increased motor vehicle use associated with sprawl communities and increased natural gas burned to service larger isolated homes.
-	As the 4th largest cause of death and illness globally, air pollution prematurely kills 6600 Ontarians every year with an economic impact of over $49 billion dollars [12, Sec. 2.3].
-	Air pollution particles especially PM2.5’s enter the human body and bloodstream via the lungs and cause disease of multiple body systems including: lungs (asthma, COPD, bronchitis); cardiovascular (high blood pressure, heart attacks, irregular heartbeats); neurologic (dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinsons, ADHD, others); cancers (lung, breast, leukemia); and endocrine (diabetes, obesity).
-	Air pollution exposure is also linked to low birth weight babies, birth defects and still births ,and increases risks of COVID-19 infection, transmission and deaths.
-	The worst health impacts of air pollution are disproportionately and inequitably borne by lower socioeconomic, marginalized and racialized communities [13].
(5)	Proposed amendments and land redesignation will escalate uncontrolled GHG emissions fuelling the climate crisis.
-	The climate crisis represents the single greatest human health crisis of our time [14]. A number of far-reaching health impacts exist.
-	Extreme heat is a significant risk factor for death and illness. Canada’s single deadliest weather-related event was the 2021 BC heat dome which killed 815 Canadians, mostly elderly and/or of lower socioeconomic strata [15].
-	Direct illness and death also result from flooding, extreme wind events, drought and wildfires. Wildfires in turn escalate air pollution, able to travel thousands of kilometres and causing further health harms. Ontario’s worst wildfire season on record occurred in 2021 [16].
-	Many infectious diseases are increasing and/or emerging due to the climate crisis. Many experts have already predicted and warned that pandemics such as COVID-19 and other zoonotic infections (spreading from animals to humans) will be increasingly common due to effects of the climate and environmental crisis globally.
-	Lower crop yields directly resulting from climate change affecting health and nutrition through food insecurity have already been discussed.
-	The climate crisis has many major increasing negative mental health impacts including anxiety, depression, addictions, suicidality and solastalgia.
(6)	Proposed amendments and land redesignation in conjunction with the More Homes Built Faster Act will impose massive costs and insurability concerns for municipalities and taxpayers while removing their democratic participation in the process.
-	The complementary proposed Greenbelt amendments/Oak Ridges Moraine land redesignation with the Act are unsustainable not only from an environmental and health perspective but also economically.
-	Ontario’s Financial Accountability Office (FAO) calculated the extra costs generated simply to maintain public transportation infrastructure due to climate change at $1.5 billion annually, non-inclusive of cost of wildfires and ice storms [17].
-	It is clearly understood that the costs of failing to take climate action are far higher than the cost of taking urgent action. Sprawl development costs the public more than double the cost of planned densification [18]. Ontario’s economy already loses over $49 billion every year to air pollution. This will increase further with the proposed Greenbelt and Oak Ridges Moraine amendments [12, Sec. 2.3].
-	By escalating non-renewable energy use, air pollution, climate change, infrastructure costs for sprawl development, healthcare costs, decimating efficiencies in coordinated higher level urban planning, reducing municipal revenues from development charges, and numerous other damaging mechanisms, the More Homes Built Faster Act, for which the amendments and land redesignations currently under consideration have been proposed, will result in massive costs that will fall on municipalities. The municipalities in turn will either have to slash public services or collect the revenue shortfall from taxpayers who will face unaffordable tax hikes
-	Homeowners will face a crisis of insurability with insurance either being unaffordable or unavailable. Insurance industry reports have already stated: “insurance providers may start to withdraw property coverage in areas deemed too costly, or worse, avoid insuring certain risks altogether, if circumstances do not change. This could put tremendous financial pressure on the government.” [19, p.1]
-	Conservation Authorities, Municipalities, citizen input and expert oversight are silenced by design by the More Homes Built Faster Act which must be included in this discussion as the stimulus for the proposed Greenbelt amendments. The valuable informed work of experienced urban planners and professional city staff who have worked to produce sustainable development solutions that would help Ontario thrive are being ignored and rejected. Painstaking land use and boundary expansion decisions such as in Hamilton and Halton, achieved with countless hours of effort, citizen engagement and due democratic process over the past year are unilaterally being overturned. Appeal processes are being eliminated. This may contravene Article 12 of the Paris Agreement [1].
-	The timing of release of Bill 23 the day after the 2022 Ontario Municipal Election and inexplicably tight timeline imposed for public consultation while newly elected Municipal Councils were still in transition severely restricted adequate scrutiny, oversight and response by citizens, experts and municipalities.
-	The public record documents in 2018 the current premier promised he would not develop the Greenbelt, the world’s largest such protected greenspace [20]. Ontarians expect the government to keep its promises and govern with integrity. Our collective future depends on it.

80295,/comment/80295,"I agree that Ontario needs more housing but not at the expense of the Greenbelt. The government's own housing taskforce stated that additional housing can be easily built within the boundaries of the urban centers surrounding the Greenbelt - density would simply be intensified to make room for additional houses. The Ontario government itself has mandated that all municipalities' Official Plans must contain substantial density targets. The following arguments illustrate
The More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022 goes directly against the clearly stated intention of the Greenbelt Plan . The Greenbelt Plan was created specifically to prevent any type of development on this land.
The following is an excerpt taken from ERO # 019-6216 Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan:
""The proposed strategic removal of lands from the Greenbelt Area was considered in the context of the objectives and policies of the Greenbelt Plan..."". This statement is found in the Greenbelt Plan. It is blatantly wrong as the objectives and policies of the Greenbelt Plan clearly state the land is not to be developed.
""...Clark wrote in a statement. ""These proposals will support our municipal partners' plans for responsible growth and help build at least 50,000 new homes, while leading to an overall expansion of the Greenbelt."" The More Homes Built Faster Act, 2022 does not reflect ""responsible"" growth - all it does is expand urban sprawl, which is what the Greenbelt Act guards against.
""Last year, when announcing plans to expand the Greenbelt by adding a moraine south of Toronto and a series of urban river lands, Clark said he would not cut the protected area or do a land swap.
'I want to be clear: We will not in any way entertain any proposals that will move lands in the Greenbelt, or open the Greenbelt lands to any kind of development,' he had said"". The Ontario government has broken its own promise by allowing development on the Greenbelt.
In conclusion, 50,000 new homes built in subdivisions sprawling into the protected Greenbelt will not help to alleviate the housing crisis in Ontario.
We need affordable homes, close to transit and services, to lessen the need for long commutes.  In this time of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions must be a prime consideration in any proposed new construction.

80327,/comment/80327,"What is disgusting about this legislation is that, despite a pro-business government proposing this, they haven't considered how this will affect the agriculture sector and food suppliers. They're so obsessed with getting people into trades, but completely forget that we all need to eat, regardless of what we do for a living. Food isn't affected by just the local environment, but the whole world's ability to balance our life support systems. By just miraculously finding land somewhere else to do what the Greenbelt is supposed to, you disrupt nature even more. Sure, people need houses, but there's plenty of residences the wealthy are using for investments instead of their intended use. If they need real estate to invest in, why not help with the food supply by investing in vertical farms, instead of building for condos 98% of people here and abroad can't afford?

80340,/comment/80340,"Doug Ford (and the Conservative Party) is acting in a dictatorial manner that is harmful to the population of Ontario and Canada. There is absolutely no need to build on the Green Belt  in order to increase the number of new homes for Ontario residents. The need to provide more housing for people does not necessitate building in the Green Belt. Every city in Ontario has under-utilized areas, empty lots, double lots, lane ways, strip malls that can be intensified without having to build new infrastructure. That should be the first step. The Conservative Party’s actions are un democratic (lying about not touching the Green Belt and then not even looking at more practical and straightforward ways of facilitating intensification of cities) . But more importantly, the Conservative Party is harming future generations. We should all remember how early in the pandemic Canada had to go beg and borrow and plead to get access to the Covid vaccines. Why? Because Canada does not have the ability to make their own. What will happen with climate change if for some reason California cannot produce the surplus food that it does now that gets imported into Canada. Do you think if United States falls short of feeding their own population that they will send food to Canada? What will happen 50 years from now when we can no longer import food, and we have paved over all of our farmland. Who will feed us? What the Conservative Party is doing is betraying the population of Ontario.

80358,/comment/80358,"Dear Committee,
I own a 210-acre farm in Rockwood and run a calf-cow business. I do not support amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation. As a farmer in a non-greenbelt area, I would really like to be included in the greenbelt as developers have slowly bought land around me for development purposes, only a matter of time that I will not be able to farm my land that I have owned for 60 years. No one wants cattle mooing during the day or the manure that comes with growing beef. Trying to replace land in the greenbelt with land outside the greenbelt is not the solution to increased development and the creation of homes. Madrid is a good example of how to increase density in city and that is where increased development should be.
310 acres of farmland are being lost in Ontario on a daily basis.  Protecting the Paris moraine is not a solution to housing or protecting farmland. It is a solution to dealing with climate change.

I believe all the maps which show lands being removed from protection, titled Greenbelt Plan Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan Proposed Modification Maps 1-11 may relate to ERO-019-6218 and that the single map entitled Greenbelt Plan Proposed Addition Map A may related to ERO-019-6217.
But I'm really not sure.
So I am submitting my identical comments to all three  consultations.
I apologize for any confusion I cause the readers of my comments.
The Greenbelt Act was passed only after lengthy discussion, much debate and much study. According to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing website https://www.ontario.ca/page/oak-ridges-moraine the Oak Ridges Moraine is part of the Greenbelt: ""As part of the Greenbelt, the Oak Ridges Moraine is an environmentally sensitive, geological landform  in south central Ontario.""
Premier Ford promised he would never touch the Greenbelt.
To break this promise, there must be compelling reasons that the benefits outweigh the costs. And/or there must be compelling arguments to show the costs can be totally mitigated.
Neither case is supported, in my opinion.
I am particularly appalled at the proposals depicted in Map 6, an area bordering Duffins Creek in or near Pickering, and Map 9, an area of Hamilton bounded by Shaver, Garner, Fiddler Green Roads and transected by Book Road.  A similar analysis could be undertaken for the other maps, but these are especially shocking.
The government contends that the designated lands are ones on which housing can be built very quickly, and suggests they will need little servicing ""are serviced or adjacent to services and will be used to build housing in the near term.""
Are these areas indeed shovel ready?
A quick glance at the terrain (satellite view on Google maps) suggests otherwise. One can see in satellite maps of both areas that there are substantial creek systems in these areas.  One can see green shrub and tree lined waterways in forested sections, as well as the darker brown outlines of underground or seasonal watercourses in the plowed fields.
These underground or seasonal creeks will create hazards for builders.
To provide housing on these lands, developers will need to build underground canals to permanently divert these watercourses.
Not what most people would consider ""little servicing"" or almost shovel ready.
True, developers could take shortcuts -- much easier to do now that conservation authorities are not allowed to be consulted -- and the hapless folks who buy there can look forward to permanently running sump pumps and/or living without water damage insurance.
Map 9  Google map satellite view  - note the many streams and seasonal watercourses (brown lines in plowed fields) crossing the area.
Can the negative impacts on Greenbelt Plan goals be mitigated?
Let's consider two of the four goals of the Greenbelt Plan, as stated in section 1.2 Greenbelt Plan 2017 https://www.ontario.ca/document/greenbelt-plan-2017
•	gives permanent protection to the natural heritage and water resource systems that sustain ecological and human health and that form the environmental framework around which major urbanization in south-central Ontario will be organized
•	provides for a diverse range of economic and social activities associated with rural communities, agriculture, tourism, recreation and resource uses
Each Greenbelt Plan area which the province proposes to modify forms part of a complex ecosystem.  Though one may imagine cutting down a single tree and replanting the same species elsewhere, one can't pick up and move entire forests, nor can one pick up and move creeks and whole water systems.
Many ecologists and scientists have written of the negative impacts of fragmenting ecosystems, e.g. Mitchell Snyder, What Is Forest Fragmentation and Why Is It A Problem?, Northern Woodlands, 13 October 2014, online: https://northernwoodlands.org/articles/article/forest-fragmentation#:~:…
The ""natural heritage and water resource systems that sustain ecological and human health"", the ones the Greenbelt Plan promised to permanently protect, will be permanently destroyed by removing these areas from the Oak Ridges Moraine Plan/ Greenbelt Plan.
Another goal of the Greenbelt Plan was to provide a diverse range of economic and social activities.
The Google map view of the Map 6 area to be modified shows that it is crossed by the Seaton Hiking Trail, ""one of the best-known and most-used trails for recreation in the Pickering region"" according to the popular and widely referenced All Trails online hiking guide.
The proposed modification would wipe out this trail and the economic benefit which hiking day visitors (like me) provide to neighbouring municipalities.
One may counter that the government is not contemplating building many houses on these Greenbelt areas, that it's thinking of just nestling in one or two rural mansions into these parts of the Greenbelt/Oak Ridges Moraine.
Whose personal pleasure is so important that we should risk sacrificing our water quality or bird and animal species' existence -- all the things the Greenbelt Plan was designed to protect?
The government's proposals to modify the Greenbelt Plan and Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan should be totally rejected.

80366,/comment/80366,"Please do not change the current Greenbelt boundaries. And do not allow new types of building on those areas — the Greenbelt is one of our treasures that bring Ontarians closer to the land, and the land closer to us. There is no getting these environmentally important tracts back once they’re gone and I am disgusted with the current provincial government for trying to do this!!

80371,/comment/80371,"As a southern Ontario (Canadian) citizen and taxpayer, I strongly oppose 019-6216 Proposed Amendments to the Greenbelt Plan, 019-6217 Proposed amendments to the Greenbelt Area boundary regulation, 019-6218 Proposed redesignation of land under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan and Bill 23.
Protected land must stay protected; urban sprawl is not the kind of housing Ontarians need or can afford. Ontario has already lost most of its wetlands (92% I believe); wetlands filter our water and prevent flooding - both of which are environmental services that we desperately need and must consider in every development proposal. The Oak Ridges Moraine protects the drinking water of millions of Ontarians. The Greenbelt protects habitat for keystone and species at risk; cools surrounding areas; filters the air we breathe and absorbs carbon dioxide and other pollutants; reduces Ontario's emissions and helps work towards climate goals we are committed to - and must meet if we are to slow the rapidly increasing climate change driven disasters. Municipalities and conservation authorities must keep their roles and authority.
The recent purchase of multiple parts of the Greenbelt that are in proposal 019-6216 by developers is inconceivable unless they knew that the designation of the lands was going to change. There is no other plausible explanation. This must be independently investigated - it is illegal and a staggering breach of trust.

80374,/comment/80374,"I am concerned about the destruction of the Greenbelt.  Over 40 percent of Ontario's endangered species reside in these areas and with the dismantling of 2007 endangered species act you are making it impossible for these species to survive.  There is a worldwide biodiversity crisis, and we should be doing everything in our power to protect and nurture these areas.  Your plan has no wildlife corridors which leads to islands with no ability for the animals to move around.  Currently there is 88,000 acres of land zoned urban that can be developed why aren't we looking there?  The Premier also promised not to touch the Greenbelt, so one has to ask what kind financial gain is he receiving?  I sure hope he gets investigated for his criminal activity.  The Greenbelt also contains valuable agricultural land which needs to be preserved for food security, with climate change there is lots of drought's, floods and diseases we need to ensure access to fresh food. There are also studies stating that the destruction of the Greenbelt will affect our access to clean drinking water.   In closing I want the survival of all the flora and fauna in Ontario for future generations.

We need to focus on building up, not out, for new housing. We also need to focus on repurposing brownlands.

I am deeply disappointed by this behavior and disturbed that such a proposal has even been made in these challenging times.
